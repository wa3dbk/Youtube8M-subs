00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
one of the classes for the guns if that

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.650 
one of the classes for the guns if that
made<00:00:31.529> sense<00:00:31.560> you'll<00:00:32.520> see<00:00:32.730> what<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.910> mean<00:00:33.000> in

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
made sense you'll see what I mean in

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.080 
made sense you'll see what I mean in
between<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.290> video<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:35.460> as<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.820> can<00:00:35.910> see

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
between the video so as you can see

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.360 
between the video so as you can see
these<00:00:36.270> are<00:00:36.450> all<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> assault<00:00:37.050> rifles<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.770> did

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
these are all the assault rifles I did

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.190 
these are all the assault rifles I did
see<00:00:38.610> screenshots<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.450> these<00:00:39.660> but<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:39.930> didn't

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
see screenshots of these but I didn't

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.840 
see screenshots of these but I didn't
really<00:00:40.379> pay<00:00:40.530> attention<00:00:40.559> because<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.370> usually

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
really pay attention because I usually

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.030 
really pay attention because I usually
just<00:00:41.910> watch<00:00:42.270> videos<00:00:42.719> more<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.649> was<00:00:43.800> going

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
just watch videos more and I was going

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.860 
just watch videos more and I was going
through<00:00:44.129> twice<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.030> guys<00:00:45.210> can<00:00:45.390> see<00:00:45.450> all

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
through twice so you guys can see all

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.790 
through twice so you guys can see all
the<00:00:45.899> damage<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.649> everything<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:48.469> yup<00:00:49.469> sets

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the damage and everything and yup sets

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.040 
the damage and everything and yup sets
the<00:00:49.980> assault<00:00:50.309> rifles<00:00:50.760> narrower<00:00:51.480> up<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
the assault rifles narrower up to the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.990 
the assault rifles narrower up to the
submachine<00:00:52.500> guns<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.820> probably

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
submachine guns and this is probably

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.729 
submachine guns and this is probably
what<00:00:54.270> i'll<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.480> using<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.079> most<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
what i'll be using the most in the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.920 
what i'll be using the most in the
advanced<00:00:56.280> warfare<00:00:56.699> submachine<00:00:57.449> gun<00:00:57.660> class

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
advanced warfare submachine gun class

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.110 
advanced warfare submachine gun class
because<00:00:58.680> I'm<00:00:58.859> always<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.609> run<00:00:59.820> around

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
because I'm always just to run around

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.209 
because I'm always just to run around
get<00:01:00.359> one<00:01:00.570> kill<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:00.870> die<00:01:01.230> hopefully<00:01:01.559> get<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> few

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
get one kill and die hopefully get a few

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.280 
get one kill and die hopefully get a few
more<00:01:02.399> that's<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.180> way<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.690> play<00:01:03.899> as

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
more that's the way I like to play as

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.649 
more that's the way I like to play as
you<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.100> see<00:01:05.250> here<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> snipers<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.330> links

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
you can see here the snipers the links

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.170 
you can see here the snipers the links
from<00:01:06.840> ghosts<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.520> will<00:01:08.729> be<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.030> most

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
from ghosts and this will be the most

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.020 
from ghosts and this will be the most
used<00:01:09.960> gun<00:01:10.290> i<00:01:10.320> think<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> moss<00:01:11.189> or<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:11.880> you

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
used gun i think the moss or have you

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.450 
used gun i think the moss or have you
say<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.479> because<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.530> bolt<00:01:13.740> action<00:01:13.979> and

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
say it because it's a bolt action and

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.859 
say it because it's a bolt action and
i'm<00:01:14.549> pretty<00:01:14.670> sure<00:01:14.880> everyone<00:01:15.090> want<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> quick

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
i'm pretty sure everyone want a quick

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.499 
i'm pretty sure everyone want a quick
scope<00:01:16.110> with<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.189> that's<00:01:18.000> probably<00:01:18.299> going

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
scope with it so that's probably going

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.929 
scope with it so that's probably going
to<00:01:18.570> be<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.840> gun<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.710> go<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.189> if<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.430> cook<00:01:20.729> if

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
to be the gun to go for if you cook if

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.719 
to be the gun to go for if you cook if
you're<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> quick<00:01:21.420> sup<00:01:21.630> go<00:01:21.960> pup<00:01:22.520> shotguns<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
you're a quick sup go pup shotguns the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.179 
you're a quick sup go pup shotguns the
TAC<00:01:23.970> 19<00:01:24.420> seems<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.080> really<00:01:25.500> really<00:01:25.860> new

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
TAC 19 seems like a really really new

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.730 
TAC 19 seems like a really really new
begun<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.880> think<00:01:27.210> everyone<00:01:27.840> will<00:01:27.990> use<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.500> and

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
begun I think everyone will use it and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.749 
begun I think everyone will use it and
just<00:01:29.450> yeah<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.479> when<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.049> saw<00:01:31.350> t-<00:01:32.040> gameplay<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.520> it

just yeah I when I saw t- gameplay of it

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.179 
just yeah I when I saw t- gameplay of it

it annoyed me watching that just saying
how<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:36.150> easy<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.110> played<00:01:37.409> with<00:01:37.590> it

how like easy it is and I played with it

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.679 
how like easy it is and I played with it
for<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.979> little<00:01:38.100> bit<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.670> eric<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.600> it's

special heavy shield I think you can
just<00:01:58.170> yet<00:01:58.740> deployable<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.549> your<00:01:59.670> shield<00:01:59.880> so

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
just yet deployable have your shield so

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.670 
just yet deployable have your shield so
like<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.479> black<00:02:00.659> ops<00:02:00.840> 2<00:02:00.960> where<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.290> could<00:02:01.500> put

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
like in black ops 2 where you could put

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.870 
like in black ops 2 where you could put
it<00:02:01.799> on<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.009> ground<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.369> then<00:02:02.520> protect

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
it on the ground and then protect

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.359 
it on the ground and then protect
yourself<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.450> prefer<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:04.979> holding

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
yourself I prefer that to just holding

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.520 
yourself I prefer that to just holding
it<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.780> then<00:02:06.780> when<00:02:06.899> you've<00:02:07.110> got<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.290> grenade

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
it and then when you've got a grenade

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.100 
it and then when you've got a grenade
launcher<00:02:08.250> that's<00:02:08.429> pretty<00:02:08.700> cool<00:02:08.819> less<00:02:09.110> time

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
launcher that's pretty cool less time

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.220

not like a war machine but it's like
time<00:02:13.900> detonated<00:02:14.560> so<00:02:15.159> now<00:02:15.370> I<00:02:15.400> will<00:02:15.819> go<00:02:15.970> through

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
time detonated so now I will go through

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.020 
time detonated so now I will go through
the<00:02:16.569> assault<00:02:17.019> rifle<00:02:17.700> attachments<00:02:18.700> will<00:02:18.879> just

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
and now we'll go submachine guns check

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.559 
and now we'll go submachine guns check
out<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.040> last<00:02:45.310> one<00:02:45.579> I'll<00:02:45.819> always<00:02:46.000> do<00:02:46.299> it<00:02:46.420> for

the last one and it is pretty much the
same<00:02:49.989> stuff<00:02:50.290> except<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:50.890> think<00:02:51.220> that<00:02:51.400> was<00:02:51.579> yeah

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
same stuff except I think that was yeah

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.610 
same stuff except I think that was yeah
rapid<00:02:52.420> fire<00:02:52.629> at<00:02:52.780> anything<00:02:53.019> was<00:02:53.260> there<00:02:53.440> last

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
rapid fire at anything was there last

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.509 
rapid fire at anything was there last
time<00:02:54.030> advanced<00:02:55.200> rifling<00:02:56.200> gives<00:02:57.129> you<00:02:57.310> some

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
time advanced rifling gives you some

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.140 
time advanced rifling gives you some
more<00:02:57.700> range<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:59.609> you<00:03:00.609> have<00:03:00.730> pretty<00:03:00.970> cool

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
more range and you have pretty cool

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.750 
more range and you have pretty cool
stuck<00:03:01.420> there<00:03:01.680> suppressed<00:03:02.680> oh<00:03:02.980> that's<00:03:03.400> just<00:03:03.579> a

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
stuck there suppressed oh that's just a

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.979 
stuck there suppressed oh that's just a
silencer<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:05.310> yeah<00:03:06.310> that's<00:03:06.489> that's<00:03:06.790> good<00:03:07.150> now

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
silencer and yeah that's that's good now

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.050 
silencer and yeah that's that's good now
we'll<00:03:08.170> go<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.379> the<00:03:08.470> snipers<00:03:09.099> other<00:03:09.549> than<00:03:09.849> more

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
we'll go to the snipers other than more

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.610 
we'll go to the snipers other than more
so<00:03:10.299> this<00:03:10.420> one<00:03:10.629> cuz<00:03:10.810> that's<00:03:11.049> probably<00:03:11.379> what<00:03:11.500> you

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
so this one cuz that's probably what you

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.809 
so this one cuz that's probably what you
guys<00:03:11.739> won't<00:03:11.980> say<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:12.370> cog<00:03:13.470> variable<00:03:14.470> zoom

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
guys won't say a cog variable zoom

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.659 
guys won't say a cog variable zoom
thermal<00:03:16.650> stock<00:03:17.650> or<00:03:17.859> anything<00:03:18.160> that's<00:03:18.340> been<00:03:18.519> in

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:18.669 
thermal stock or anything that's been in

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:21.949 
thermal stock or anything that's been in
it<00:03:18.819> or<00:03:19.000> aim<00:03:19.690> down<00:03:19.900> sight<00:03:20.260> I'll<00:03:20.560> move<00:03:21.010> move

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
it or aim down sight I'll move move

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.300 
it or aim down sight I'll move move
faster<00:03:22.959> and<00:03:23.139> aiming<00:03:23.440> down<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.620> sights<00:03:23.769> yeah

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
faster and aiming down the sights yeah

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.520 
faster and aiming down the sights yeah
so<00:03:24.579> that's<00:03:24.790> that<00:03:25.540> means<00:03:25.780> quickscoping<00:03:26.410> will

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
so that's that means quickscoping will

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.949 
so that's that means quickscoping will
be<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.650> lot<00:03:26.889> easier<00:03:26.919> in<00:03:27.400> this<00:03:27.549> and<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:28.030> think

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
be a lot easier in this and I think

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.830 
be a lot easier in this and I think
they're<00:03:29.250> taking<00:03:30.250> this<00:03:30.370> into<00:03:30.579> the<00:03:30.819> mw2<00:03:31.180> way

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
they're taking this into the mw2 way

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.319 
they're taking this into the mw2 way
where<00:03:32.139> sleight<00:03:32.950> of<00:03:32.980> hand<00:03:33.340> pro<00:03:33.370> actually<00:03:34.120> gave

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.250 
that's true because I kind of like quick
scoping<00:03:39.609> and<00:03:39.880> then<00:03:40.419> there's<00:03:40.660> iron<00:03:40.900> sights

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
scoping and then there's iron sights

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.870 
scoping and then there's iron sights
there<00:03:41.590> so<00:03:42.630> now<00:03:43.630> we'll<00:03:43.840> go<00:03:44.049> to<00:03:44.109> the<00:03:44.739> shotguns<00:03:45.430> to

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
there so now we'll go to the shotguns to

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.670 
there so now we'll go to the shotguns to
check<00:03:46.209> out<00:03:46.359> the<00:03:46.480> TAC<00:03:46.690> 19<00:03:47.109> because<00:03:47.319> that<00:03:47.440> seems

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
check out the TAC 19 because that seems

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.729 
check out the TAC 19 because that seems
like<00:03:47.859> the<00:03:47.980> biggest<00:03:48.190> one<00:03:48.400> and<00:03:49.470> as<00:03:50.470> you<00:03:50.590> can<00:03:50.709> see

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
like the biggest one and as you can see

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.009
