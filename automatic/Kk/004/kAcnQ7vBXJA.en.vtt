today<00:00:01.140> in<00:00:01.260> this<00:00:01.319> video<00:00:01.469> we're<00:00:01.680> going<00:00:01.770> to<00:00:01.829> learn

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
today in this video we're going to learn

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.710 
today in this video we're going to learn
the<00:00:02.040> difference<00:00:02.159> between<00:00:02.669> driving<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:03.570> ball

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
the difference between driving the ball

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.630 
the difference between driving the ball
and<00:00:03.929> spinning<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.319> ball<00:00:04.410> and<00:00:04.620> creating<00:00:05.549> the

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
and spinning the ball and creating the

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:14.600 
and spinning the ball and creating the
right<00:00:05.730> mix<00:00:12.620> to<00:00:13.620> have<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.799> powerful<00:00:14.130> forehand

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
right mix to have a powerful forehand

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.919 
right mix to have a powerful forehand
you<00:00:14.639> have<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.910> know<00:00:15.000> how<00:00:15.210> much<00:00:15.389> spin<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.870> how

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
you have to know how much spin and how

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.029 
you have to know how much spin and how
much<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.170> need<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.379> drive<00:00:16.590> through<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.920> ball

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
much you need to drive through the ball

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.160 
much you need to drive through the ball
and<00:00:17.190> there's<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.699> situation<00:00:18.270> for<00:00:18.449> both<00:00:18.570> if<00:00:18.869> you

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
and there's a situation for both if you

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.810 
and there's a situation for both if you
don't<00:00:19.560> understand<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.189> what's<00:00:20.430> what<00:00:20.730> you're

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
don't understand this what's what you're

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.460 
don't understand this what's what you're
going<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.000> do<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.449> probably<00:00:21.660> try<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:21.990> add<00:00:22.170> too

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
going to do is probably try to add too

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.170 
going to do is probably try to add too
much<00:00:22.619> spin<00:00:22.890> thinking<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.850> that's<00:00:23.910> going<00:00:24.119> to

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
much spin thinking that that's going to

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.359 
much spin thinking that that's going to
give<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.420> extra<00:00:24.750> power<00:00:25.130> finding<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.250> right

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
give you extra power finding the right

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.580 
give you extra power finding the right
mix<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.789> crucial<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.750> winning<00:00:28.109> points<00:00:28.439> and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
mix is crucial to winning points and

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.980 
mix is crucial to winning points and
being<00:00:28.980> consistent<00:00:29.340> at<00:00:29.609> both<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.660> first<00:00:30.900> you

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
being consistent at both so first you

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.749 
being consistent at both so first you
need<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.140> understand<00:00:31.500> what<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.189> spinning<00:00:32.460> and

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
need to understand what is spinning and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.549 
need to understand what is spinning and
what<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.120> driving<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.690> ball<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.020> how<00:00:34.350> that

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
what is driving the ball and how that

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:34.940 
what is driving the ball and how that
looks

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
looks

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.130 
looks
spinning<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.760> ball<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.120> coming<00:00:36.540> low<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.870> high

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
spinning the ball is coming low to high

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.590 
spinning the ball is coming low to high
on<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.500> very<00:00:37.920> extreme<00:00:38.340> path<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.879> adding<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.450> lot

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
on a very extreme path and adding a lot

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.600 
on a very extreme path and adding a lot
of<00:00:39.719> rotation<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.260> ball<00:00:40.430> understand<00:00:41.430> that

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
of rotation the ball understand that

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.940 
of rotation the ball understand that
rotation<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.420> great<00:00:42.719> for<00:00:42.930> control<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:43.469> at<00:00:43.860> a

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
rotation is great for control but at a

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.979 
rotation is great for control but at a
certain<00:00:44.100> point<00:00:44.420> rotation<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.539> spin<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.899> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
certain point rotation and spin on the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.690 
certain point rotation and spin on the
ball<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.230> going<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.440> slow<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.100> ball<00:00:47.250> down<00:00:47.309> so

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
ball is going to slow the ball down so

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.580 
ball is going to slow the ball down so
if<00:00:48.000> you're<00:00:48.149> trying<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.420> hit<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.600> very<00:00:49.020> big<00:00:49.410> and

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
if you're trying to hit a very big and

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.500 
if you're trying to hit a very big and
powerful<00:00:49.739> forehand<00:00:50.370> you're<00:00:50.760> adding<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.180> ton<00:00:51.480> of

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
powerful forehand you're adding a ton of

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.270 
powerful forehand you're adding a ton of
rotation<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> ball<00:00:52.559> what<00:00:53.039> you're<00:00:53.160> going

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
rotation to the ball what you're going

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.700 
rotation to the ball what you're going
to<00:00:53.340> actually<00:00:53.520> do<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.000> slow<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.600> ball<00:00:54.719> down<00:00:54.780> now

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
to actually do is slow the ball down now

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.410 
to actually do is slow the ball down now
on<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.309> other<00:00:56.489> side<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.030> there's

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
on the other side of that there's

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.180 
on the other side of that there's
driving<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> ball<00:00:58.260> driving<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:58.980> ball<00:00:59.100> is

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
driving the ball driving the ball is

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.319 
driving the ball driving the ball is
getting<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.460> rack<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.699> go<00:00:59.820> all<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.030> way

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
getting the rack to go all the way

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.689 
getting the rack to go all the way
through<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.989> ball<00:01:01.170> not<00:01:01.590> adding<00:01:02.129> or<00:01:02.219> imparting

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
through the ball not adding or imparting

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.640 
through the ball not adding or imparting
the<00:01:03.180> same<00:01:03.359> amount<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.690> spin<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:04.530> you're

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the same amount of spin so if you're

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.410 
the same amount of spin so if you're
going<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.830> drive<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.460> ball<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:06.030> want<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.270> make

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
going to drive the ball you want to make

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.399 
going to drive the ball you want to make
sure<00:01:06.450> you're<00:01:06.659> going<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.810> go<00:01:06.930> too<00:01:06.990> low<00:01:07.140> too<00:01:07.200> high

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
sure you're going to go too low too high

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.320 
sure you're going to go too low too high
but<00:01:07.619> your<00:01:07.979> point<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.430> contact<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.150> your

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
but your point of contact and your

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.700 
but your point of contact and your
follow-through<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:10.080> going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.439> go<00:01:10.530> out

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
follow-through is going to go out

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.500 
follow-through is going to go out
through<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.310> ball<00:01:11.640> what<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.299> going<00:01:12.450> to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
through the ball what this is going to

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.050 
through the ball what this is going to
do<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:13.010> penetrate<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.189> ball<00:01:14.369> having<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.970> go

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
do is penetrate the ball having it go

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.390 
do is penetrate the ball having it go
forward<00:01:15.479> more<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.320> let's<00:01:16.890> go<00:01:17.070> over<00:01:17.159> this

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
forward more so let's go over this

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.580 
forward more so let's go over this
spinning<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.360> ball<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.720> getting<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.290> racket

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
spinning the ball is getting the racket

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.530 
spinning the ball is getting the racket
to<00:01:19.650> go<00:01:19.770> under<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> ball<00:01:20.580> very<00:01:20.909> drastically

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
to go under the ball very drastically

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.510 
to go under the ball very drastically
and<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:22.170> you're<00:01:22.470> going<00:01:22.619> through<00:01:23.009> we're<00:01:23.400> going

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
and as you're going through we're going

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.190 
and as you're going through we're going
to<00:01:23.580> brush<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> inside<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.659> up<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.049> come

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
to brush on the inside and up and come

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.039 
to brush on the inside and up and come
all<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.680> way<00:01:26.070> up<00:01:26.270> spinning<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.450> ball<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.840> used

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
all the way up spinning the ball is used

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.569 
all the way up spinning the ball is used
for<00:01:28.200> when<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.409> want<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.619> slow<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.130> point<00:01:29.369> down

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
for when you want to slow the point down

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.429

other thing to consider know is what

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.789 
other thing to consider know is what
spinning<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> ball<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.110> driving<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.619> ball

your opponent if you hit a heavy topspin
ball<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.689> ball<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:48.930> going<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.079> bounce<00:01:49.409> up

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
ball the ball is going to bounce up

ball the ball is going to bounce up
possibly<00:01:50.820> out<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.240> their<00:01:51.390> strike<00:01:51.600> zone<00:01:51.869> this

possibly out of their strike zone this

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.230 
possibly out of their strike zone this
is<00:01:52.409> something<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.890> player<00:01:53.159> Nadal<00:01:53.549> does<00:01:54.210> a

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
is something like a player Nadal does a

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.240 
is something like a player Nadal does a
lot<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.630> use<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.500> lot<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.860> spin<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
lot of use this a lot of spin on the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.310 
lot of use this a lot of spin on the
ball<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.520> get<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.790> bounce<00:01:56.969> up<00:01:57.240> if<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:58.020> drive

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
ball to get to bounce up if you drive

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.630 
ball to get to bounce up if you drive
the<00:01:58.530> ball<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.890> ball<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.040> going<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.219> stay<00:01:59.280> low

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
the ball the ball is going to stay low

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.789 
the ball the ball is going to stay low
driving<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.570> ball<00:02:00.719> might<00:02:00.930> be<00:02:01.049> preferred<00:02:01.530> if

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
driving the ball might be preferred if

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.630 
driving the ball might be preferred if
you're<00:02:01.950> coming<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.340> net

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
you're coming in the net

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.219 
you're coming in the net
hitting<00:02:02.939> approach<00:02:03.210> shot<00:02:03.450> spinning<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.079> ball

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
hitting approach shot spinning the ball

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.690 
hitting approach shot spinning the ball
might<00:02:04.439> be<00:02:04.469> great<00:02:04.860> if<00:02:05.040> you're<00:02:05.430> going<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.610> be

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
might be great if you're going to be

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.340 
might be great if you're going to be
behind<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.180> baseline<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.780> trying<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.229> keep

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
behind the baseline and trying to keep

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.540 
behind the baseline and trying to keep
the<00:02:07.469> ball<00:02:07.619> out<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.829> your<00:02:07.950> opponent<00:02:08.340> strike

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
the ball out of your opponent strike

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.930 
the ball out of your opponent strike
zone

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
zone

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.240 
zone
so<00:02:09.539> let's<00:02:09.989> look<00:02:10.110> exactly<00:02:10.770> what<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.069> looks

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
so let's look exactly what this looks

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.190 
so let's look exactly what this looks
like<00:02:11.540> spinning<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.629> ball<00:02:12.780> we're<00:02:13.020> going<00:02:13.140> to

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
like spinning the ball we're going to

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.880 
like spinning the ball we're going to
get<00:02:13.260> weight<00:02:13.500> on

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
get weight on

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.760 
get weight on
and<00:02:14.100> really<00:02:14.640> impart<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.210> lot<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.630> spin<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.530> is

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
and really impart a lot of spin this is

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.890 
and really impart a lot of spin this is
going<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.010> also<00:02:17.400> increase<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.450> height<00:02:18.720> over

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
going to also increase the height over

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.240 
going to also increase the height over
the<00:02:19.110> net<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.440> flight<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.920> ball<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.160> going

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
the net the flight of the ball is going

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.550 
the net the flight of the ball is going
to<00:02:20.310> go<00:02:20.460> have<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.910> big<00:02:21.180> arc<00:02:21.420> up<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.260> then<00:02:22.380> down

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
to go have a big arc up and then down

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.840 
to go have a big arc up and then down
okay<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:23.850> we're<00:02:23.970> going<00:02:24.060> up<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.600> then<00:02:25.260> down

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
okay so we're going up and then down

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.850 
okay so we're going up and then down
driving<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.940> ball<00:02:27.290> decreases<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.470> height<00:02:28.650> of

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
driving the ball decreases the height of

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.760 
driving the ball decreases the height of
the<00:02:29.010> net<00:02:29.190> but<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.390> increases<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.530> force

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
the net but it increases the force

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.650 
the net but it increases the force
coming<00:02:32.100> through<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.520> ball<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.060> what<00:02:33.510> your

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
coming through the ball and what your

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.640 
coming through the ball and what your
opponent's<00:02:33.960> going<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.140> have<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.320> deal<00:02:34.500> with

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
opponent's going to have to deal with

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.570 
opponent's going to have to deal with
driving<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.130> ball<00:02:35.250> is<00:02:35.400> going<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.580> be<00:02:36.230> here

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
driving the ball is going to be here

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.280 
driving the ball is going to be here
notice<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.700> difference<00:02:39.090> in<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.300> sound<00:02:39.660> how

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
notice the difference in the sound how

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.480 
notice the difference in the sound how
spinning<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.950> ball<00:02:41.070> you're<00:02:41.190> going<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.370> hit

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
spinning the ball you're going to hit

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.580 
spinning the ball you're going to hit
here<00:02:41.790> this<00:02:41.970> brush<00:02:42.240> and<00:02:42.540> driving<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.440> ball

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
here this brush and driving the ball

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.440 
here this brush and driving the ball
you're<00:02:43.980> going<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.160> hear<00:02:44.280> more<00:02:44.459> of<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.640> pop<00:02:44.880> the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
want to talk about finding the right mix

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.380 
want to talk about finding the right mix
having<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.220> right<00:02:56.400> mix<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.850> spin<00:02:57.209> and

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
having the right mix of spin and

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.449 
having the right mix of spin and
penetration<00:02:57.810> will<00:02:58.440> control<00:02:58.830> your<00:02:59.040> forehand

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
penetration will control your forehand

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.729 
penetration will control your forehand
but<00:02:59.790> still<00:03:00.060> let<00:03:00.270> it<00:03:00.360> be<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.510> weapon<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.560> is

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
but still let it be a weapon this is

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:02.750 
but still let it be a weapon this is
where<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> lot<00:03:02.040> of<00:03:02.160> people<00:03:02.370> make<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.640> mistake

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
where a lot of people make the mistake

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.400 
where a lot of people make the mistake
of<00:03:03.030> trying<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.330> hit<00:03:03.450> too<00:03:03.630> much<00:03:03.810> topspin<00:03:04.260> or

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
of trying to hit too much topspin or

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.260 
of trying to hit too much topspin or
they're<00:03:05.190> trying<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.430> drive<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:05.940> penetrate

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
they're trying to drive and penetrate

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.850 
they're trying to drive and penetrate
the<00:03:06.360> ball<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.690> they<00:03:06.959> lose<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.290> consistency

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
the ball and they lose the consistency

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.860 
the ball and they lose the consistency
so<00:03:08.220> what<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.640> right<00:03:08.760> mix<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.450> right<00:03:09.630> mix

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
so what is the right mix the right mix

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.570 
so what is the right mix the right mix
is<00:03:09.989> making<00:03:10.320> sure<00:03:10.470> we<00:03:10.590> still<00:03:10.830> get<00:03:10.980> under<00:03:11.459> the

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
is making sure we still get under the

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.190 
is making sure we still get under the
ball<00:03:11.760> but<00:03:12.180> when<00:03:12.360> we<00:03:12.480> go<00:03:12.630> through<00:03:12.660> we're<00:03:13.080> going

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
ball but when we go through we're going

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.740 
ball but when we go through we're going
to<00:03:13.260> come<00:03:13.410> up<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.950> across<00:03:14.370> your<00:03:14.760> body<00:03:15.000> by

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
to come up and across your body by

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.870 
to come up and across your body by
coming<00:03:16.050> up<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.560> across<00:03:16.890> your<00:03:17.280> body<00:03:17.340> you're

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
coming up and across your body you're

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.820 
coming up and across your body you're
going<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.060> add<00:03:18.239> a<00:03:18.269> lot<00:03:18.690> of<00:03:18.840> spin<00:03:19.140> but<00:03:19.590> you<00:03:19.680> can

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
going to add a lot of spin but you can

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.620 
going to add a lot of spin but you can
still<00:03:20.010> be<00:03:20.160> hitting<00:03:20.370> through<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.790> ball<00:03:20.970> this

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
still be hitting through the ball this

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.820 
still be hitting through the ball this
is<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.870> mistake<00:03:22.110> that<00:03:22.260> most<00:03:22.320> people<00:03:22.590> make

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
is the mistake that most people make

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.070 
is the mistake that most people make
they<00:03:23.130> try<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.400> hit<00:03:23.670> this<00:03:23.880> type<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.209> shot<00:03:24.510> what

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
they try to hit this type of shot what

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.680 
they try to hit this type of shot what
it<00:03:25.170> does<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.470> spins<00:03:25.799> out<00:03:26.040> spinning<00:03:26.970> spinning

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
it does it spins out spinning spinning

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.900 
it does it spins out spinning spinning
out<00:03:27.959> means<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.680> ball<00:03:28.860> really<00:03:29.100> has<00:03:29.549> a<00:03:29.580> lot<00:03:29.880> of

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
out means the ball really has a lot of

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.430 
out means the ball really has a lot of
action<00:03:30.420> on<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.660> but<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:30.870> doesn't<00:03:31.019> do<00:03:31.230> anything

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
action on it but it doesn't do anything

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.810 
action on it but it doesn't do anything
it<00:03:31.620> doesn't<00:03:31.860> go<00:03:31.920> through<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.250> court<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:32.640> is

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
it doesn't go through the court this is

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.009 
it doesn't go through the court this is
an<00:03:32.910> example<00:03:33.180> of<00:03:33.390> it<00:03:35.360> you<00:03:36.360> see<00:03:36.540> me<00:03:36.660> get<00:03:36.810> very

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
an example of it you see me get very

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.870 
an example of it you see me get very
stiff<00:03:37.320> and<00:03:37.470> rigid<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.340> ball<00:03:38.519> tends<00:03:38.760> to

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
stiff and rigid and the ball tends to

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.789 
stiff and rigid and the ball tends to
slow<00:03:39.150> down<00:03:39.299> we<00:03:39.540> don't<00:03:39.720> want<00:03:39.959> that<00:03:40.170> we<00:03:40.590> want<00:03:40.620> a

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
slow down we don't want that we want a

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.650 
slow down we don't want that we want a
powerful<00:03:41.220> forehand<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.910> forehand<00:03:42.390> that<00:03:42.540> can

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
powerful forehand a forehand that can

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.060 
powerful forehand a forehand that can
hurt<00:03:42.810> your<00:03:42.989> opponent<00:03:43.019> and<00:03:43.410> put<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:43.769> in

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
hurt your opponent and put you in

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.160 
hurt your opponent and put you in
position<00:03:44.549> to<00:03:44.940> win<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.299> point<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.660> this<00:03:46.019> is

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
position to win the point and this is

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.270 
position to win the point and this is
how<00:03:46.260> we're<00:03:46.410> going<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.590> do<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:46.799> we're<00:03:47.130> going<00:03:47.220> to

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
how we're going to do it we're going to

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.220 
how we're going to do it we're going to
get<00:03:47.400> under<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.970> ball<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.330> pull<00:03:48.810> across

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
get under the ball and pull across

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.680 
get under the ball and pull across
notice<00:03:50.130> when<00:03:50.250> I'm<00:03:50.340> pulling<00:03:50.519> across<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:51.510> edge

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
notice when I'm pulling across the edge

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.449 
notice when I'm pulling across the edge
of<00:03:51.870> my<00:03:51.989> rack<00:03:52.170> is<00:03:52.320> going<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.470> come<00:03:52.560> up<00:03:52.830> and<00:03:53.130> over

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
of my rack is going to come up and over

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.340 
of my rack is going to come up and over
and<00:03:53.700> finish<00:03:54.090> so<00:03:54.930> again<00:03:55.560> we're<00:03:55.680> going<00:03:55.769> to<00:03:55.830> watch

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
and finish so again we're going to watch

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.840 
and finish so again we're going to watch
again<00:03:58.350> you're<00:03:58.530> going<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.709> see<00:03:58.890> how<00:03:59.070> I'm<00:03:59.340> really

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
again you're going to see how I'm really

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.430 
again you're going to see how I'm really
pulling<00:04:00.150> across<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:02.870> can<00:04:03.870> control<00:04:04.260> the

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
pulling across and I can control the

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.960 
pulling across and I can control the
ball<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:04.799> penetrate<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.489> ball<00:04:05.610> at<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:05.760> same

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
ball and penetrate the ball at the same

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.580 
ball and penetrate the ball at the same
time<00:04:06.180> one<00:04:06.690> more<00:04:08.690> that's<00:04:09.690> finding<00:04:10.350> the<00:04:10.470> right

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
time one more that's finding the right

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.470 
time one more that's finding the right
mix<00:04:10.829> so<00:04:11.640> this<00:04:11.880> is<00:04:12.000> something<00:04:12.269> you're<00:04:12.360> gonna

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
mix so this is something you're gonna

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.060 
mix so this is something you're gonna
have<00:04:12.570> to<00:04:12.630> experiment<00:04:12.989> with<00:04:13.290> finding<00:04:14.010> the

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
have to experiment with finding the

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.150 
have to experiment with finding the
right<00:04:14.190> mix<00:04:14.400> of<00:04:14.579> spin<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:15.239> control<00:04:15.720> now<00:04:16.350> having

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
right mix of spin and control now having

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.310 
right mix of spin and control now having
a<00:04:17.250> big<00:04:17.640> powerful<00:04:17.970> forehand<00:04:18.419> is<00:04:18.570> great<00:04:18.930> but<00:04:19.229> if

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
a big powerful forehand is great but if

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.110 
a big powerful forehand is great but if
you<00:04:19.410> can't<00:04:19.440> get<00:04:19.799> it<00:04:19.919> in<00:04:20.040> it<00:04:20.430> really<00:04:20.820> doesn't

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
you can't get it in it really doesn't

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.390 
you can't get it in it really doesn't
matter<00:04:21.209> so<00:04:21.540> make<00:04:22.229> sure<00:04:22.260> that<00:04:22.590> you're<00:04:23.010> making

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
matter so make sure that you're making

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.339 
matter so make sure that you're making
small<00:04:23.669> adjustments<00:04:24.390> as<00:04:24.479> you<00:04:24.870> get<00:04:25.020> better<00:04:25.229> with

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
small adjustments as you get better with

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.530 
small adjustments as you get better with
the<00:04:25.590> technique<00:04:25.979> that<00:04:26.160> you<00:04:26.280> worked<00:04:26.490> on<00:04:26.669> then

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
the technique that you worked on then

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.670 
the technique that you worked on then
