00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.790
 today we are going to explain a recipe very 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.100
 simple that will get you out of many 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.020
 most trouble at breakfast and 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.000
 pre train when you do not have time to 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.529
 cook the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.529
 use are the following 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.900
 of cocoa we can emphasize that it is a 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.400
 Great antioxidant with high content in 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.400
 magnesium and a natural stimulant 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.840
 Oats is an absorption carbohydrate 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.210
 slow with lots of fibers 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.230
 soluble and insoluble will give you energy 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.230
 for the rest of the day 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.980
 milk is an important source of 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.320
 calcium because of the big dilemmas with 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.510
 animal milk and its processing in 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.829
 lsf we recommend almond milk 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.870
 before animal milk 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.789
 the water simply say that it is 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.129
 very important to stay hydrated 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.129
 70% of our body is water 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.290
 casein will help you not to enter 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.360
 catabolic state supplying 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.750
 proteins to the body for a long period 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.750
 of time 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.200
 the eggs are the most complete protein 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.840
 they have all the essential amino acids 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.940
 and are able to be easily warned 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.320
 They are perfect for both a stage of 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.320
 definition and volume 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.650
 the cinnamon will help you to give it a good 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.080
 flavor your pancakes reduces the levels 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.110
 of blood sugar and relieves discomfort 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.420
 intestinal 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.430
 and finally the banana great contribution of 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.860
 Potassium prevents cramping if taken 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.450
 before the exercise and is a source of 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.320
 fast energy for the body and 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.930
 available 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.960
 to begin we add the water in the 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.780
 blender then we take the eggs 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.680
 and we enter them in order the 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.680
 It has to be this 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.290
 at the end of the video we will put the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.050
 exact amounts of what we're going 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.450
 adding 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.680
 Then we take the casein and the 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.680
 we introduce in the blender 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.099
 with the same case of the protein we take 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.099
 the tupperware and add oats 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.920
 again remind you that the amounts 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.920
 will be explained at the end of the video 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.450
 how much banana you want to throw 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.450
 it's a matter of you 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.959
 then after the banana we take 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.959
 the cocoa and we toss three spoonfuls 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.670
 finally we take the cinnamon and you 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.670
 we throw the amount we want 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.490
 we beat for about three minutes 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.950
 until everything is well mixed 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.500
 the final result must be a 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.870
 thick liquid so that we get some 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.240
 well solid pancakes this is the oil 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.040
 that we are going to use the brand with its 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.550
 properties will be in the description 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.550
 of the video 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.370
 As you can see, the mixture is quite thick 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.960
 this will provide us some pancakes 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.960
 Well solid and easy to cook 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:42.010
 as you can see in 15 minutes cooking 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.110
 we have got 8 pancake a food 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.380
 very nutritious and that will take us out of many 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.380
 troubles
