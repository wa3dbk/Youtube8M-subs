00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.589
 so the big secret the way the question 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.300
 to play and sing the same time is you have 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.490
 to know that we can not 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.719
 think of two things at the same time 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.570
 people can not think and execute 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.029
 two things at the same time, then it's the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.270
 people need to automate one of the two 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.279
 things already playing and singing some a 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.170
 both things need automatic 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.840
 so you can then do another 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.250
 think about the other then you're when 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.230
 Do you see a singer playing and singing? 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.620
 Make sure he's not thinking. 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.710
 on the guitar and on the voice is one of 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.170
 things are automatic and it's much more 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.210
 easy to automate the part of the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.829
 that the part of the letter is 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.600
 because the guitar you saw that has 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.430
 enough and if you already took the songs 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.050
 side the basic course implement already took out 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.120
 some music you see there's a lot 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.739
 acord repeating the same chords 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.500
 for several songs people use the same 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.579
 rhythm for various songs then up to 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.590
 so sometimes you are 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.879
 learning guitar and you know a song 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.050
 that you want to touch you know you run 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.910
 You 'll talk like that. 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.280
 pulls but it's easier to automate letter 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.170
 because I already have it runs right 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.729
 but in fact the guitar is not much more 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.890
 easy to decorate because it always stays 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.170
 repeating the same elements while 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.820
 that the lyrics we collect every time 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.439
 Are you going to say a different phrase to 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.420
 speak with a different intonation 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.970
 different tuning an interpretation 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.570
 you will play stronger weaker 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.350
 Then 99% of the time we do the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.659
 or is it not there and you? 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.600
 can have space to achieve 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.790
 think the letter is in speech and everything else 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.770
 so we have to try to do 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.420
 this work of automating the guitar 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.430
 so if you're still in the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.899
 learning that you are still seeing the 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.210
 chords yet has not decorated all the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.759
 chords rhythm is not 100% movies 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.740
 you give a rolled up rhythm you have to 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.960
 thinking how you have to think about 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.630
 some chord change has to look and 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.880
 chord drawing table for 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.130
 decorate some chords you still do not 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.140
 ready to automate because this 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.399
 Summer automation is what you get 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.350
 play the rhythm of the chords is without you 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.629
 You need to think hard, you do not have to touch 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.599
 without looking you can keep looking 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.099
 He is but your hand already half knows 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.440
 Where are you going to make a deal? 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.599
 next to the corde your pace already knows how 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.250
 behave when you change the chord 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.319
 when there's a stop at the song and everything 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.940
 more then this process 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.390
 automatic so if you are learning 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.730
 guitar and he's not there yet , he heard how I 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.920
 I said the pace is so steady or the 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.349
 chords not so firm you have to give 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.360
 one still thought to do maybe you 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.120
 not yet ready to play and 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.310
 singing at the same time is what 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.379
 It's the trick keep trying because this 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.750
 will continue trying in this process of 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.819
 You try, you'll be able to decorate. 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.730
 some chords decorate the pace and leave 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.890
 this part of pacing is easier 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.690
 more automatic for you to step on need 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.000
 thought then ends life in a training 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.769
 common and you try to fit 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.450
 letter is also in this process that the 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:05.459
 people learn to play and sing 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.920
 so it's fine if you're not no it's not 100% 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.530
 movie on that part of the guitar are you still 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.739
 you are not 100% ready to play and sing 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.260
 but you can keep trying and okay 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.090
 see that it is also this process of 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.709
 automate them frequently goes 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.269
 happens because you can pick up songs 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.920
 with simple chords 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.900
 suddenly starts to get automatic 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.190
 You start singing sometimes you pick up 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.040
 a song that is a bit more difficult 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.940
 has a different rhythm has chords 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.739
 different and then you'll have to do 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.989
 this process back to arrest these 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.239
 new chords learn this new rhythm 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.430
 Are you going on a new process? 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.780
 maybe this right and fumbles one 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.090
 a little to play and sing that one 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.709
 music, but it will also make 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.959
 the same process goes going 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.540
 trying that soon you can do 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:51.180
 the joining of the two and manages to 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.489
 It's there when you, for example, learned 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.989
 the most basic chords with the rhythms 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.269
 lower learn to stay 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.040
 automatically when you go to pick up 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.989
 songs that have these basic chords 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.879
 this basic rhythm you will not need 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.470
 make this process of automation of 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.540
 back where everything will be automatic 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.150
 so this job of fitting you in 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.549
 with the guitar is only in the first 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.390
 songs after you can turn around 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.790
 well him 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.230
 Notice it's more or less like you by 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.730
 learn to drive example 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.620
 I learn to ride a bicycle or 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.960
 anything that involves a sport or 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.540
 involve the movement then, for example 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.160
 You're assuming you're learning to 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.290
 drive a bike at the beginning 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.780
 you have to pay close attention to the 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.120
 movements you have to do and 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.290
 Maybe you can not get the web and talk. 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.440
 at the same time that you are learning 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.120
 to do that sometimes listen to the radio 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.370
 of the car while driving first 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.020
 lots of information and more as you 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.270
 go practicing after you've taken 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.890
 the wallet you already know goes by bike 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.710
 that movement will become more and more 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:53.070
 to the point that you can 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.840
 talk and drive and drive or 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.490
 cycling because movement 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.740
 automatic does not want to think anymore 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.660
 You 're not thinking how to walk 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.890
 or how to do the movements of the 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.450
 for you drove the car is 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.190
 simply doing and can 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.620
 talk if we listen, you can do 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:11.570
 to think of something else is just the same as 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.570
 the guitar as you want to sing along
