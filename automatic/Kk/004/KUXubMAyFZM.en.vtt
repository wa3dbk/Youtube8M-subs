00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.730
 Oh 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.370
 the 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.719
 trainer melamineed 130 victory 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.860
 what did you think of the competition 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:14.360
 guess we just got the woollett game 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.379
 have dominated organized 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.800
 played 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:20.840
 You will come across a lot of goal attempts 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.939
 had many goal opportunities not completed and 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.319
 therefore wolves remained in the competition 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:27.110
 but i have to say the boys are real 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:29.270
 I played very well organized k 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.289
 started the match go 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.879
 yes difficult match he good one 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.530
 opponent is a topper sites 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:35.150
 wheelchair is very important to me 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.710
 naturally win a new year and a 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.599
 important step forward 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.460
 for the country and this is the first of them 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.479
 many top competitions that take place one after the other 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.110
 come 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:46.069
 a good start line yes of course is one 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.930
 so raised one 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:49.129
 And then you definitely dino the guys 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.659
 trust because it is not always 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:51.860
 easy to get behind certain things 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:53.659
 play well organized 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.129
 anyway we have ruben today 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.229
 trust thanked 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:58.759
 the boys believe in it and I think so 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:00.919
 we got the weapons and for the following weeks 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.360
 but this is still no guarantee 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.650
 to say we are champions or committed 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.270
 We still have the champion 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.710
 respect for everyone there are very 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.750
 many teams where a whole 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.029
 the caution should be but it is 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.069
 a nice competitions nice boost 

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:15.440
 and we continue work and we now go the 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:17.389

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:25.879

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:28.909
 side, one behind the other, of course, must 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.199
 quite a number of from winning to real 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:31.729
 play-offs I talent well if they like 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:33.650
 number 1 to get him divided at home 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:34.849
