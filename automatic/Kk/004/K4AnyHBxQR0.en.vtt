would<00:00:33.180> be<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> good<00:00:33.600> application<00:00:33.989> for<00:00:34.890> even

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
would be a good application for even

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.430 
would be a good application for even
having<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:36.059> then<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.719> thought<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.930> myself<00:00:37.020> you

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
having this then I thought to myself you

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.350 
having this then I thought to myself you
know<00:00:37.500> maybe<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:37.920> an<00:00:38.070> adventure<00:00:38.190> map<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:39.210> if

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
know maybe like an adventure map like if

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.500 
know maybe like an adventure map like if
you're<00:00:39.510> using<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.960> eyes<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.200> ender<00:00:40.469> for<00:00:41.510> you

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
you're using the eyes of ender for you

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.560 
you're using the eyes of ender for you
know<00:00:43.280> just<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.370> activate<00:00:44.820> something<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.420> hey

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
know just to activate something like hey

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.080 
know just to activate something like hey
you've<00:00:45.750> come<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.320> far<00:00:46.520> place<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.730> thing<00:00:47.940> in

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
you've come this far place the thing in

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.119 
you've come this far place the thing in
the<00:00:48.180> eye<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.300> ender<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.440> frame<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.010> you

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
the eye of ender in the frame and you

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.010 
the eye of ender in the frame and you
know<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.370> activates<00:00:50.820> something<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.840> we're

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
know it activates something so we're

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.950 
know it activates something so we're
using<00:00:52.230> once<00:00:52.559> again<00:00:52.860> via<00:00:53.270> silent<00:00:54.270> piston<00:00:54.750> list

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
using once again via silent piston list

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.920 
using once again via silent piston list
um<00:00:55.760> bud<00:00:56.760> switch<00:00:56.940> which<00:00:57.390> mean<00:00:57.660> I'm<00:00:57.750> going<00:00:57.840> to

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
um bud switch which mean I'm going to

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.720 
um bud switch which mean I'm going to
run<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.170> thing<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> ground<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.160> just

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
run that thing to the ground I just

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.810 
run that thing to the ground I just
happen<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.030> get<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.899> request<00:01:01.170> involving

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
happen to get like to request involving

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.850 
happen to get like to request involving
but<00:01:02.820> switches<00:01:03.210> which<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.199> friggin<00:01:04.500> convenient

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
but switches which is friggin convenient

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.980 
but switches which is friggin convenient
because<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.580> thing<00:01:05.820> has<00:01:06.360> worked<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:06.840> both

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
because this thing has worked for both

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.500 
because this thing has worked for both
applications<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:08.280> what<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.880> thought<00:01:09.210> though<00:01:09.450> to

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
applications so what I thought though to

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.390 
applications so what I thought though to
myself<00:01:10.049> was<00:01:10.170> like<00:01:10.290> how<00:01:10.590> would<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.770> use<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.280> you

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
myself was like how would I use it you

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.340 
myself was like how would I use it you
know<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.790> don't<00:01:11.850> do<00:01:12.030> adventure<00:01:12.450> maps<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.170> then<00:01:13.290> I

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
know I don't do adventure maps so then I

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.410 
know I don't do adventure maps so then I
thought<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.590> myself<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:14.040> know<00:01:14.100> how<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.610> case<00:01:15.240> i

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
thought to myself I know how in case i

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.060 
thought to myself I know how in case i
tell<00:01:15.630> my<00:01:15.750> douchebag<00:01:15.990> people<00:01:16.439> which<00:01:16.740> actually

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
tell my douchebag people which actually

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.920 
tell my douchebag people which actually
we've<00:01:17.400> already<00:01:17.520> killed<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.939> dragon<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.810> know

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930

let's say I have told them to not come
into<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.060> not<00:01:22.049> coming<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.560> end<00:01:23.070> without

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
into the not coming to the end without

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.490 
into the not coming to the end without

up<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.820> know<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.210> piston<00:01:39.930> list<00:01:40.140> but<00:01:41.100> switch

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
up you know the piston list but switch

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.179 
up you know the piston list but switch
directly<00:01:41.939> underneath<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.869> one<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.890> when<00:01:44.100> you

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
directly underneath this one so when you

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.370 
directly underneath this one so when you
put<00:01:44.430> us<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.060> eye<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.329> ender<00:01:45.509> into<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> frame

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
put us the eye of ender into the frame

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.380 
put us the eye of ender into the frame
and<00:01:46.619> activates<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:47.399> switch<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.759> happens<00:01:48.149> a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
and activates a but switch it happens a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.469 
and activates a but switch it happens a
block<00:01:48.600> update<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.200> happen<00:01:50.060> so<00:01:51.060> basically<00:01:51.450> all

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
block update to happen so basically all

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.840 
block update to happen so basically all
that<00:01:51.810> i<00:01:51.840> did<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.890> i<00:01:53.100> will<00:01:53.250> put<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.490> an<00:01:53.579> NT

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
that i did and i will put in an NT

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.899 
that i did and i will put in an NT
annotation<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.020> video<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.909> basically

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
annotation on that video is basically

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.810 
annotation on that video is basically
put<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.600> pistol<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.710> splits<00:01:58.950> which<00:01:59.189> directly

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
put the pistol and splits which directly

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.819 
put the pistol and splits which directly
underneath<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.680> just<00:02:01.680> build<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.790> again

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
underneath this just build it again

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.249 
underneath this just build it again
alright<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.420> then<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.600> know<00:02:06.719> i<00:02:06.750> just<00:02:06.990> laced

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
alright and then you know i just laced

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.119 
alright and then you know i just laced
the<00:02:07.680> outputs<00:02:08.399> with<00:02:08.670> TMT<00:02:09.149> pretty<00:02:09.479> much<00:02:09.660> i<00:02:10.410> mean

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
the outputs with TMT pretty much i mean

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.530 
the outputs with TMT pretty much i mean
again<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.610> was<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.819> application<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.480> i

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
again that was the application that i

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.130 
again that was the application that i
thought<00:02:12.780> made

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
thought made

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.700 
thought made
sense<00:02:14.480> but<00:02:15.480> yeah<00:02:15.600> that's<00:02:15.870> pretty<00:02:16.410> much<00:02:16.650> the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
sense but yeah that's pretty much the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.610 
sense but yeah that's pretty much the
gist<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:18.540> know<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.720> can't<00:02:19.110> destroy

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
gist of it you know you can't destroy

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.820 
gist of it you know you can't destroy
the<00:02:19.830> item<00:02:20.819> frames<00:02:21.090> or<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.420> eyes<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.720> ender<00:02:21.900> one

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
the item frames or the eyes of ender one

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.530 
the item frames or the eyes of ender one
thing<00:02:23.040> though<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.340> did<00:02:23.610> realize<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.390> that

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
thing though that I did realize is that

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.720 
thing though that I did realize is that
they<00:02:24.720> are<00:02:24.750> transparent<00:02:25.650> blocks<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.310> an<00:02:26.400> extent

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
they are transparent blocks to an extent

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.110 
they are transparent blocks to an extent
so<00:02:27.060> light<00:02:27.840> does<00:02:28.319> shine<00:02:28.560> through<00:02:28.860> them<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.970> make

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
so light does shine through them so make

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.220 
so light does shine through them so make
sure<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.360> know<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.570> would<00:02:30.720> light<00:02:30.900> up<00:02:30.930> your

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
sure you know you would light up your

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.740 
sure you know you would light up your
area<00:02:31.620> otherwise<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.400> would<00:02:32.520> look<00:02:32.750> apparent

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
area otherwise it would look apparent

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.690 
area otherwise it would look apparent
that<00:02:33.840> there's<00:02:34.020> something<00:02:34.350> wrong<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:35.520> then

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
that there's something wrong and then

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.250 
that there's something wrong and then
you<00:02:35.790> know<00:02:35.820> like<00:02:36.120> embellish<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:36.990> that<00:02:37.140> it

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
you know like embellish it so that it

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.680 
you know like embellish it so that it
looks<00:02:37.440> like<00:02:37.650> you're<00:02:38.010> like<00:02:39.000> something<00:02:39.360> else<00:02:39.540> is

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
looks like you're like something else is

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.600 
looks like you're like something else is
going<00:02:39.780> on<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.350> know<00:02:40.470> like<00:02:40.620> it's<00:02:40.770> fancy<00:02:41.250> for<00:02:41.459> no

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
going on you know like it's fancy for no

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.970 
going on you know like it's fancy for no
reason<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.959> way<00:02:43.230> you're<00:02:43.410> able<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.800> hide

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
reason and that way you're able to hide

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.699 
reason and that way you're able to hide
the<00:02:44.190> wiring<00:02:44.610> underneath<00:02:45.560> but<00:02:46.560> yeah<00:02:46.650> I'm

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
the wiring underneath but yeah I'm

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.820 
the wiring underneath but yeah I'm
pretty<00:02:46.950> much<00:02:47.239> that<00:02:48.239> was<00:02:48.330> exactly<00:02:48.720> what<00:02:49.200> I

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
pretty much that was exactly what I

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.949 
pretty much that was exactly what I
thought<00:02:50.190> would<00:02:50.459> be<00:02:50.520> a<00:02:50.640> good<00:02:50.820> use<00:02:50.880> for<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.360> you

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
thought would be a good use for it you

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.300 
thought would be a good use for it you
know<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:52.080> I'll<00:02:52.290> make<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.590> real<00:02:52.709> simple<00:02:52.769> we'll

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
know and I'll make it real simple we'll

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.670 
know and I'll make it real simple we'll
just<00:02:53.489> put<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.730> teensy<00:02:54.269> right<00:02:54.450> above<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.750> but

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
just put a teensy right above that but

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.160 
just put a teensy right above that but
as<00:02:55.769> soon<00:02:55.980> as<00:02:56.100> you<00:02:56.190> place<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:57.090> Avenger<00:02:57.690> the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
as soon as you place the I Avenger the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.370 
as soon as you place the I Avenger the
bud<00:02:58.410> switch<00:02:58.590> reacts<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.430> T&amp;T<00:02:59.850> I<00:03:00.239> it's<00:03:00.959> primed

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
bud switch reacts the T&amp;T I it's primed

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.140 
bud switch reacts the T&amp;T I it's primed
and<00:03:01.680> then<00:03:01.860> you're<00:03:02.040> good<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.220> go<00:03:02.370> murder
