this is the best SMG if you missed my

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.200 
this is the best SMG if you missed my
previous<00:00:19.680> video<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.520> was<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.699> video<00:00:20.970> probably

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
previous video it was a video probably

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.060 
previous video it was a video probably
about<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.510> few<00:00:21.720> weeks<00:00:21.840> ago<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.320> was<00:00:22.619> stating<00:00:22.949> that

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
about a few weeks ago I was stating that

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.700 
about a few weeks ago I was stating that
the<00:00:23.220> vector<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.000> new<00:00:24.210> best<00:00:24.449> SMG<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:25.230> black

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
the vector is the new best SMG in black

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.980 
the vector is the new best SMG in black
ops<00:00:25.890> 2<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.430> why<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.699> because<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.330> vector<00:00:27.900> has

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
ops 2 and why is because the vector has

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.320 
ops 2 and why is because the vector has
rico<00:00:28.650> nice<00:00:29.220> little<00:00:29.550> fire<00:00:29.699> right<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.179> as<00:00:30.269> a

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
rico nice little fire right on it as a

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.440 
rico nice little fire right on it as a
32<00:00:31.260> ammo<00:00:31.679> capacity<00:00:31.830> right<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:33.239> not

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
32 ammo capacity right so it's not

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.170 
32 ammo capacity right so it's not
lacking<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.930> ammo<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.290> department<00:00:34.950> as<00:00:35.100> well

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
lacking in the ammo a department as well

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.549 
lacking in the ammo a department as well
also<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.390> vector<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.809> just<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.230> very<00:00:37.260> good

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
also the vector is just a very good

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.709 
also the vector is just a very good
weapon<00:00:37.890> for<00:00:38.040> up<00:00:38.309> close<00:00:38.340> combat<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.300> that's<00:00:39.510> why

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
weapon for up close combat so that's why

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.020 
weapon for up close combat so that's why
the<00:00:39.780> vector<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.680> new<00:00:40.860> best<00:00:41.040> SMG<00:00:41.550> hitting<00:00:41.969> a
