00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:12.459
 hello to all today's video means like 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:16.500
 would be a video response to the review of one-armed mixes 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:19.600
 from users of technogen 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.380
 so the first thing that I would like 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.500
 say your video mentioned 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.050
 he has such a plan mexico but 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.610
 me model 084 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.560
 16 he has 084 13 means like i already 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.660
 showed other videos where this one is 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.000
 my wicks review means close 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.430
 more comfortable I don't know some guys 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.160
 show that she close the middle 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.610
 I don’t feel like a finger 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.920
 I know it is absolutely not convenient I already 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.730
 showed that it is very convenient and in my opinion 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.320
 most convenient 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.559
 here we just keep wicks push 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:07.299
 index finger and thumb 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:10.299
 nudge if the liner is taut I already 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.939
 also showed in our review we shoot 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.509
 dies and slightly arched as 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.740
 liners 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.950
 if we look completely free 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.270
 and 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.380
 and you can turn it in any direction 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.969
 of course don't overdo it because 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.759
 drive it back will be very difficult 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:32.109
 Here I had a very hard liner 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:34.420
 it was corrected then it’s like 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:41.979
 since I can have clips on mine 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:44.020
 the clip is very convenient and here we are in my 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.119
 very comfortable but naturally not for 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.569
 the width of the room to me and to wear 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.119
 let's say on the pocket somewhere else is joy 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.560
 clinging here on the edge of your pocket what are you 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.479
 legs somewhere deep in your pocket 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.450
 I failed and it was convenient to get 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.670
 Of course it's bad that she does not rearrange 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.930
 let's say it was more convenient for me vata 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.080
 relatively uzhik that is down the eye 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.220
 will we say then that's even been on 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:13.360
 fixing is in this middle position in 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.670
 here it is me 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.870
 hours he stands on fixing that is here 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:23.920
 everywhere here I cooked a square 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.530
 their parts lying on this knife is not 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:35.170
 such a pronounced square like this 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:36.700
 here on this leg it is more rounded 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.739
 and not even as round as here 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.810
 here is the heel 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:45.370
 but still there is such here 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:48.280
 fixing here it is that is when closing 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.989
 one-handed and forefinger we 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.890
 don't risk anything like this 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.720
 part 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:58.690
 stupid can rest on our face 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.500
 let's show closer here 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.510
 we rest with our finger and to what extent 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.489
 we can keep here the very feet 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.060
 fixed 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:13.959
 we turn over here in this 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.519
 the same but it is clear that homemade 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.680
 I will probably tell him tomorrow 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.880
 or the day after tomorrow I already saw the main ones 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.060
 just honestly say still lazy 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:26.579
 here's my opinion I'm nothing 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.579
 I will not speak but this knife 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.430
 fixed too in that position and 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.239
 even here we see what comes up with 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.720
 this side, that is, the square has risen 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.430
 spring has risen but here 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.799
 ordinary obviously flip to another 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:50.010
 I still wanted to side 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:54.160
 show such a nuance 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.889
 I have drunk many times and now I saw them 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.549
 I really wanted to say 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:02.709
 a little bit your opinion means as 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.150
 I have already accumulated a certain amount 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.220
 spare parts their feat saw 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.319
 here someone gives here more recently 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.640
 the man met me too 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:18.039
 Minsk resident and gave not too here are the remnants of 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:25.860
 fuck but I already don’t put a lanet up 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:29.500
 I'll be somewhere there are a caretaker 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.470
 you can see yes here there is such a protrusion 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:36.310
 here it is, that is, when we can 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:39.780
 it turns out closed now I am exactly 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.780
 I 'll put everything as it should be 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.160
 lot 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.680
 here pay attention he rests here 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.870
 Here in this and a piece of iron and 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.790
 to the cutting edge it is clear that this knife 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.580
 already 100 very much but still sochn 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.690
 per millimeter somewhere in Odessa is very 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.120
 long distance 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:10.080
 that is, he rests if so very 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:14.340
 skirt here it is necessary to attach all 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:18.090
 pretty good effort to his 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.340
 click that is here in this place of paint 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.150
 mouth made a tide so whose 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:27.060
 rests the blade and does not get blunt to find out 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.700
 their rico's forget their motives or how it is 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.710
 called here this part here 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.730
 actually this is what i am 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:39.720
 I wanted to tell you how to do some 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:42.270
 tips show how she really is 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.160
 that's how I have it here and of course 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.100
 I also wanted to say shock in this model 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:50.580
 what he showed his models here 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:54.200
 there are remnants of the liner under the screwdriver 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:58.950
 attack the liner but in my see that 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:01.980
 nothing is superfluous is not cut at all 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:04.830
 go 13 model some on interstitial and 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:07.340
 so let's say transition all thanks to all 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.340
 for your attention
