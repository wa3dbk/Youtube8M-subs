00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
we have got the raw frame completed

we have got the raw frame completed
we're<00:01:20.140> going<00:01:20.290> to<00:01:20.350> run<00:01:20.560> some<00:01:20.770> braces<00:01:21.570> probably

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
we're going to run some braces probably

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.760 
we're going to run some braces probably
from<00:01:22.840> here<00:01:23.610> down<00:01:24.610> in<00:01:25.030> here<00:01:25.479> down<00:01:25.750> we<00:01:26.259> also<00:01:26.440> have

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
from here down in here down we also have

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.139 
from here down in here down we also have
to<00:01:26.890> figure<00:01:27.160> out<00:01:27.220> where<00:01:27.520> our<00:01:27.670> motor<00:01:27.850> is<00:01:27.940> going

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
to figure out where our motor is going

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.420 
to figure out where our motor is going
to<00:01:28.210> go<00:01:28.360> with<00:01:28.509> the<00:01:28.570> platform<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.320> put<00:01:30.310> our

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
to go with the platform and put our

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.749 
to go with the platform and put our
steering<00:01:30.850> in<00:01:31.000> but<00:01:31.420> I<00:01:31.720> feel<00:01:32.229> like<00:01:32.380> we're<00:01:32.759> well

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
steering in but I feel like we're well

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.210 
steering in but I feel like we're well
on<00:01:33.790> our<00:01:33.940> way<00:01:34.380> okay<00:01:35.380> we're<00:01:35.680> going<00:01:35.770> to<00:01:35.860> put<00:01:36.040> the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
on our way okay we're going to put the

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.830 
on our way okay we're going to put the
steering<00:01:36.670> shaft<00:01:36.700> in<00:01:37.180> this<00:01:37.360> is<00:01:37.509> a<00:01:37.540> piece<00:01:37.810> of

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
steering shaft in this is a piece of

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.710 
steering shaft in this is a piece of
metal<00:01:38.560> tubing<00:01:39.190> not<00:01:39.520> pipe<00:01:39.850> a<00:01:40.090> tubing<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:40.539> can

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
metal tubing not pipe a tubing you can

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.200 
metal tubing not pipe a tubing you can
see<00:01:40.899> that<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.200> wall<00:01:41.380> is<00:01:41.590> thin<00:01:41.830> I<00:01:42.100> believe<00:01:43.000> it

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
see that the wall is thin I believe it

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.910 
see that the wall is thin I believe it
is<00:01:45.119> 3/4<00:01:46.119> inch<00:01:46.300> tubing<00:01:46.750> we're<00:01:47.560> going<00:01:47.680> to<00:01:47.770> use

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
is 3/4 inch tubing we're going to use

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.170 
is 3/4 inch tubing we're going to use
that<00:01:48.100> for<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.399> steering<00:01:48.640> shaft<00:01:48.759> that's

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
that for the steering shaft that's

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.180 
that for the steering shaft that's
probably<00:01:49.479> going<00:01:49.630> to<00:01:49.720> go<00:01:49.840> right<00:01:50.200> in<00:01:50.530> here<00:01:50.560> so

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
probably going to go right in here so

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.880 
probably going to go right in here so
why<00:01:51.340> don't<00:01:51.460> you<00:01:51.490> guys<00:01:51.640> climb<00:01:52.030> up<00:01:55.229> okay<00:01:56.229> one<00:01:56.800> at

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
right yes okay we'll make sure we wrap

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.140 
right yes okay we'll make sure we wrap
the<00:03:18.850> ends<00:03:19.150> with<00:03:19.300> nice<00:03:19.660> foam<00:03:20.020> so<00:03:20.380> no<00:03:21.250> one<00:03:21.400> we<00:03:21.910> may

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
the ends with nice foam so no one we may

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.030 
the ends with nice foam so no one we may
actually<00:03:22.450> want<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:23.050> drive<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.440> this<00:03:23.620> way<00:03:23.830> this

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
actually want to drive it this way this

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.280 
actually want to drive it this way this
way<00:03:24.220> might<00:03:24.430> be<00:03:24.580> a<00:03:24.610> little<00:03:24.760> safer<00:03:25.060> yeah<00:03:25.720> I<00:03:25.750> kind

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
way might be a little safer yeah I kind

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.500 
way might be a little safer yeah I kind
of<00:03:26.320> like<00:03:26.440> that<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:26.920> way<00:03:27.040> if<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:27.370> stop<00:03:27.730> you

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
of like that that way if you stop you

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.290 
of like that that way if you stop you
put<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.840> brakes<00:03:29.110> on<00:03:29.350> you<00:03:30.040> go<00:03:30.250> forward<00:03:30.790> you're

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
put the brakes on you go forward you're

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.699 
put the brakes on you go forward you're
not<00:03:31.420> gonna<00:03:31.540> get<00:03:31.750> jabbed<00:03:32.020> in<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.380> eye<00:03:32.410> you'll

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
not gonna get jabbed in the eye you'll

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.500 
not gonna get jabbed in the eye you'll
have<00:03:32.860> this<00:03:33.010> nice<00:03:33.310> foam<00:03:33.700> part<00:03:34.090> here<00:03:34.270> I<00:03:34.300> think

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
have this nice foam part here I think

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.270 
have this nice foam part here I think
that'll<00:03:34.750> be<00:03:34.780> safer<00:03:35.290> okay<00:03:35.800> I'm<00:03:35.860> gonna<00:03:36.010> weld

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
that'll be safer okay I'm gonna weld

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.000 
that'll be safer okay I'm gonna weld
these<00:03:36.580> two<00:03:36.910> together<00:03:37.090> real<00:03:37.600> quick<00:03:37.870> let's<00:03:38.680> see

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
these two together real quick let's see

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.080 
these two together real quick let's see
let's<00:03:39.310> do<00:03:39.550> this<00:03:40.230> move<00:03:41.230> hand<00:03:41.640> now<00:03:42.640> hold<00:03:42.940> that

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
let's do this move hand now hold that

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:51.620 
let's do this move hand now hold that
down<00:03:43.300> for<00:03:43.630> me<00:03:43.690> so<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:44.680> doesn't<00:03:44.739> move<00:03:45.130> good<00:03:50.459> now

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
down for me so it doesn't move good now

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.460 
down for me so it doesn't move good now
we<00:03:52.630> could<00:03:52.870> simply<00:03:53.500> weld<00:03:53.739> this<00:03:54.040> on<00:03:54.310> like<00:03:54.970> this

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
we could simply weld this on like this

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.960 
we could simply weld this on like this
but<00:03:56.470> I<00:03:56.500> think<00:03:56.860> it'd<00:03:56.980> probably<00:03:57.220> be<00:03:57.519> better<00:03:57.790> if

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
but I think it'd probably be better if

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.770 
but I think it'd probably be better if
it<00:03:58.209> were<00:03:58.330> up<00:03:58.480> here<00:03:58.930> um<00:04:00.060> although<00:04:01.060> that<00:04:01.630> would

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
it were up here um although that would

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.390 
it were up here um although that would
certainly<00:04:02.110> work<00:04:02.410> so<00:04:02.920> I'm<00:04:02.980> going<00:04:03.130> to<00:04:03.190> put<00:04:03.370> a

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
certainly work so I'm going to put a

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.190 
certainly work so I'm going to put a
little<00:04:03.730> piece<00:04:03.940> of<00:04:04.180> metal<00:04:04.390> that<00:04:04.570> comes<00:04:04.900> down

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
little piece of metal that comes down

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:15.500 
little piece of metal that comes down
here<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:05.830> we're<00:04:06.250> going<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:06.430> weld<00:04:06.640> that<00:04:06.760> on

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.870 

okay<00:04:16.510> right<00:04:16.750> about<00:04:16.989> there<00:04:17.380> it's<00:04:17.590> fine<00:04:17.890> and

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
okay right about there it's fine and

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:34.100 
okay right about there it's fine and
then<00:04:19.209> don't<00:04:19.510> move<00:04:26.310> we<00:04:27.310> want<00:04:27.580> it<00:04:27.729> to<00:04:27.910> be<00:04:29.130> about

just going to tack weld it to the

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:06.510 
just going to tack weld it to the
upright<00:05:04.289> so<00:05:05.289> that<00:05:05.319> it's<00:05:05.589> a<00:05:05.679> little<00:05:06.009> bit<00:05:06.159> easier

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
upright so that it's a little bit easier

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.129 
upright so that it's a little bit easier
to<00:05:06.580> put<00:05:06.849> this<00:05:06.999> all<00:05:07.240> together<00:05:07.419> I<00:05:07.749> won't<00:05:07.959> be

to put this all together I won't be
making<00:05:08.469> every<00:05:08.830> single<00:05:09.039> weld<00:05:10.259> while<00:05:11.259> the

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:11.469 
making every single weld while the

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:13.339 
making every single weld while the
steering<00:05:11.800> wheel<00:05:11.979> is<00:05:12.069> hanging<00:05:12.520> in<00:05:12.610> the<00:05:12.729> air

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
steering wheel is hanging in the air

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:30.899 
steering wheel is hanging in the air
push<00:05:14.349> a<00:05:14.379> little<00:05:14.619> harder<00:05:14.740> there<00:05:15.339> you<00:05:15.429> go<00:05:29.909> okay

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:30.909 
push a little harder there you go okay

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.629 
push a little harder there you go okay
I'm<00:05:31.059> welding<00:05:31.330> in<00:05:31.659> the<00:05:32.050> collars<00:05:32.529> that<00:05:33.399> will

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
I'm welding in the collars that will

00:05:33.639 --> 00:06:06.570 
I'm welding in the collars that will
keep<00:05:34.149> the<00:05:34.860> steering<00:05:35.860> shaft<00:05:35.889> from<00:05:36.279> falling<00:05:36.699> out

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.520 

now<00:06:07.580> the<00:06:07.640> steering<00:06:08.390> shaft<00:06:08.420> and<00:06:09.170> steering

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
now the steering shaft and steering

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:17.530 
now the steering shaft and steering
wheel<00:06:09.620> is<00:06:09.890> fully<00:06:10.360> captured<00:06:13.900> is<00:06:14.900> our<00:06:15.080> stereo
