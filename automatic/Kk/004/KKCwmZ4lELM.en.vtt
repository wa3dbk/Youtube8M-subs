one end and we'll just sew them very
very<00:02:18.260> thinly<00:02:18.650> it's<00:02:19.489> not<00:02:19.760> something<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.209> do

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
very thinly it's not something you do

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.229 
very thinly it's not something you do
need<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.840> thin<00:02:21.320> out<00:02:21.350> and<00:02:21.950> but<00:02:22.610> it<00:02:22.730> does<00:02:22.940> get

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
need to thin out and but it does get

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.620 
need to thin out and but it does get
quite<00:02:23.600> big<00:02:24.050> anyway<00:02:24.940> I'll<00:02:25.940> have<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.239> put<00:02:26.420> some

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
quite big anyway I'll have to put some

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.610 
quite big anyway I'll have to put some
more<00:02:26.810> in<00:02:26.870> my<00:02:27.170> hand<00:02:27.530> but<00:02:28.130> go<00:02:28.310> all<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.700> way<00:02:28.730> along

more in my hand but go all the way along

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.500 
more in my hand but go all the way along
and<00:02:30.620> they<00:02:31.280> should<00:02:32.000> start<00:02:32.530> sprouting<00:02:33.530> and

what you class is a spring which

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.920 
what you class is a spring which
obviously<00:02:50.480> varies<00:02:51.640> per<00:02:52.640> country<00:02:52.970> it's<00:02:53.720> quite

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
obviously varies per country it's quite

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.900

at<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.540> moment<00:02:59.959> where<00:03:00.560> I'm<00:03:00.799> still<00:03:01.220> I'm<00:03:01.459> just

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970

at the moment where I'm still I'm just
sewing<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:03.560> then<00:03:03.769> when<00:03:03.950> we're<00:03:04.130> in<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.430> depths

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
sewing and then when we're in the depths

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.410 
sewing and then when we're in the depths
of our<00:03:05.000> winter<00:03:05.510> seeing<00:03:06.440> you<00:03:06.650> sewing<00:03:07.130> stuff<00:03:07.519> is

of our winter seeing you sewing stuff is

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.880 
of our winter seeing you sewing stuff is
quite<00:03:08.810> sweet<00:03:09.140> because<00:03:09.380> you<00:03:09.530> think<00:03:09.769> our

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
quite sweet because you think our

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.699 
quite sweet because you think our
Springs<00:03:10.280> not<00:03:10.489> that<00:03:10.640> far<00:03:10.910> away<00:03:11.200> so<00:03:12.200> I<00:03:12.230> won't<00:03:12.470> so

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
Springs not that far away so I won't so

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.690 
Springs not that far away so I won't so
all<00:03:12.950> of<00:03:12.980> them<00:03:13.310> are<00:03:13.910> just<00:03:13.970> so<00:03:14.570> enough<00:03:15.549> save<00:03:16.549> the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
all of them are just so enough save the

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.360 
all of them are just so enough save the
rest<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.120> next<00:03:17.390> year<00:03:17.600> and<00:03:18.019> then<00:03:18.769> all<00:03:19.070> you<00:03:19.220> need

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
rest the next year and then all you need

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.620 
rest the next year and then all you need
to<00:03:19.489> do<00:03:19.670> is<00:03:19.940> just

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
to do is just

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.090 
to do is just
cover<00:03:21.630> them<00:03:21.810> up<00:03:22.760> okay<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:25.500> groove<00:03:25.740> that<00:03:25.950> I've

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
cover them up okay the groove that I've

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.520 
cover them up okay the groove that I've
put<00:03:26.400> them<00:03:26.610> in<00:03:26.760> is<00:03:26.970> it's<00:03:27.360> only<00:03:27.780> about<00:03:27.870> half<00:03:28.290> inch

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
put them in is it's only about half inch

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.230 
put them in is it's only about half inch
deep<00:03:29.390> ok<00:03:31.130> so<00:03:32.130> don't<00:03:32.370> need<00:03:32.520> to<00:03:32.670> be<00:03:32.790> much<00:03:32.940> deeper

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
deep ok so don't need to be much deeper

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.800 
deep ok so don't need to be much deeper
than<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.770> so<00:03:34.770> just<00:03:35.010> cover<00:03:35.340> them<00:03:35.490> up<00:03:35.670> if<00:03:36.570> you

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
than that so just cover them up if you

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.040 
than that so just cover them up if you
don't<00:03:36.990> have<00:03:37.290> access<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:38.160> manure<00:03:38.660> then<00:03:39.660> you<00:03:39.810> can

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
don't have access to manure then you can

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.140 
don't have access to manure then you can
buy<00:03:40.230> pellets<00:03:40.830> there's<00:03:41.100> some<00:03:41.370> chicken<00:03:42.000> manure

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
buy pellets there's some chicken manure

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.760 
buy pellets there's some chicken manure
pits<00:03:42.600> pellets<00:03:43.110> which<00:03:43.260> are<00:03:43.410> actually<00:03:43.650> very

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
pits pellets which are actually very

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.970 
pits pellets which are actually very
very<00:03:43.920> good<00:03:44.420> or<00:03:45.420> you<00:03:45.720> could<00:03:45.900> use<00:03:45.930> leaves<00:03:46.470> and

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
very good or you could use leaves and

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.920 
very good or you could use leaves and
but<00:03:47.520> if<00:03:47.610> your<00:03:47.730> soil<00:03:47.970> is<00:03:48.210> very<00:03:48.240> very<00:03:48.570> good<00:03:48.660> you

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
but if your soil is very very good you

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.110 
but if your soil is very very good you
might<00:03:49.050> not<00:03:49.230> need<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.500> use<00:03:49.530> anything<00:03:49.890> ok<00:03:50.580> so

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
might not need to use anything ok so

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.450 
might not need to use anything ok so
I'll<00:03:51.300> just<00:03:51.330> put<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.720> stake<00:03:52.710> at<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:52.980> end<00:03:53.160> and

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
I'll just put a stake at the end and

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.410 
I'll just put a stake at the end and
I'll<00:03:53.640> label<00:03:53.880> it<00:03:54.270> and<00:03:55.200> then<00:03:55.530> they're<00:03:56.460> done<00:03:56.670> ok

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
I'll label it and then they're done ok

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.470 
I'll label it and then they're done ok
well<00:03:57.660> that's<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.170> charge<00:03:58.500> done<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.190> so<00:04:00.120> when

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
well that's the charge done and so when
