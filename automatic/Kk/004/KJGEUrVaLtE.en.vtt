00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.920
 greetings today we are going to do the 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.940
 procedure of hard reset to wow and 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.790
 acp 6 this procedure is done for 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.889
 return the equipment to its configurations 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.570
 factory originals either because a 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.310
 poorly installed application is 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.070
 causing a malfunction of the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.109
 device or simply because what 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.510
 we want to restart we want to return 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.220
 your initial settings or give 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.830
 I start the process simply with the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.980
 team off let's sink the key 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.739
 of power and the up and down key 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.490
 volume at a time and we leave them 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.160
 pressed 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:43.040
 until 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.040
 that does not show you the android logo 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.690
 we are going to observe the device no longer 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.690
 I take this start menu 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.200
 and there he will unfold us some options 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.659
 in this case the third option tells us 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.740
 wide datafactory trier that if we want 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.380
 return the team of their 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.390
 Factory settings with the key 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.310
 of lowering volume we move up to 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.990
 this option 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.790
 and plant claver power we select them 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.790
 then he tells us that if we want 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.100
 confirm the reset effectively 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.090
 new that the key to the volume we go down 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.090
 until the option that says yes and claire of 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.880
 power and we select and it starts 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.670
 be the process of resetting in time the 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.909
 reset may vary according to the 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.590
 number of files we have in the 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.140
 device 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.000
 in this case you are doing the process 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.000
 it takes approximately 30 seconds 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.910
 because the phone is formatted 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.230
 liszt terminated the process of 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.560
 reset and the first option that we 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.050
 it appears tells us exist although if 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.000
 we want to restart the phone now 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.350
 then with the power key we give 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.170
 yes and with this we conclude 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.030
 the process of hard reset as they 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.160
 I explained this process is to return the 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.310
 equipment of its original configurations 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.980
 factory if the video tutorial was 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.600
 of interest and it was served them 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.720
 I thank you very much and until next time 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.720
