00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
a Y XY combat into a leg grab so it's a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
be below 50% health and I'm pretty

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.360 
be below 50% health and I'm pretty
positive<00:00:48.690> because<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> only<00:00:49.649> way<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:49.980> pull

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
positive because the only way I pull

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.299 
positive because the only way I pull
this<00:00:50.520> off<00:00:50.730> was<00:00:51.329> by<00:00:51.510> doing<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.110> combo<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
this off was by doing the combo the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.490 
this off was by doing the combo the
seventh<00:00:53.789> hit<00:00:53.879> combo<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.570> ending<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.379> a

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500

leg cramp

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.490 
leg cramp
so<00:00:57.120> five<00:00:57.449> hit<00:00:57.629> combo<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.020> ended<00:00:58.289> with<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
so five hit combo and ended with the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.860 
so five hit combo and ended with the
labor<00:00:58.739> rather<00:00:59.520> than<00:00:59.760> just<00:01:00.000> doing<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.390> leg<00:01:00.600> grab

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
labor rather than just doing a leg grab

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.759 
labor rather than just doing a leg grab
at<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> end<00:01:01.640> it's<00:01:02.640> been<00:01:02.760> working<00:01:03.180> out<00:01:03.589> and<00:01:04.589> you

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
at the end it's been working out and you

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.560 
at the end it's been working out and you
could<00:01:04.920> even<00:01:05.010> enhance<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.240> actually<00:01:06.360> a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
could even enhance it so it's actually a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:18.760 
could even enhance it so it's actually a
pretty<00:01:06.780> good<00:01:06.960> combo<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.500> general

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.620 

let's<00:01:19.770> do<00:01:19.979> one<00:01:20.189> more<00:01:20.250> time<00:01:21.409> so<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.759> a<00:01:23.759> pretty

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
let's do one more time so you a pretty

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.450 
let's do one more time so you a pretty
hard<00:01:24.869> one<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.170> do<00:01:25.320> actually<00:01:27.829> now<00:01:28.829> once<00:01:29.340> again

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
hard one to do actually now once again

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.719 
hard one to do actually now once again
that<00:01:29.729> comma<00:01:30.000> was<00:01:30.240> back<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.810> a

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
that comma was back a a

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.179 
that comma was back a a
yxy<00:01:32.729> then<00:01:33.630> back<00:01:33.960> forward<00:01:34.409> big<00:01:34.649> so<00:01:35.069> you're

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
yxy then back forward big so you're

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.469 
yxy then back forward big so you're
gonna<00:01:35.280> get<00:01:35.429> the<00:01:35.579> five<00:01:35.819> hits<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:38.329> then<00:01:39.329> you

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
gonna get the five hits and then you

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.620 
gonna get the five hits and then you
