cars<00:00:00.630> run<00:00:01.079> because<00:00:01.620> of<00:00:01.829> meat<00:00:02.810> burn<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:04.110> fuel

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.060 
cars run because of meat burn the fuel

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.629 
cars run because of meat burn the fuel
the<00:00:06.060> turns<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:07.020> cast<00:00:07.350> that's<00:00:07.799> expanding

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
the turns to a cast that's expanding

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.049 
the turns to a cast that's expanding
really<00:00:09.240> fast<00:00:09.510> with<00:00:10.230> gasoline<00:00:10.710> burns<00:00:11.130> these

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
really fast with gasoline burns these

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.029 
really fast with gasoline burns these
clothes<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.799> so<00:00:13.799> we<00:00:14.610> are<00:00:14.730> able<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.830> take<00:00:16.830> that

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
clothes and so we are able to take that

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.599 
clothes and so we are able to take that
heat<00:00:17.310> at<00:00:17.609> expanding<00:00:18.270> gas<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.109> drive<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:20.160> car

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
heat at expanding gas and drive a car

make<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> piston<00:00:21.779> arm<00:00:22.470> up<00:00:22.880> but<00:00:23.880> I'll<00:00:23.970> tell<00:00:24.000> you

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
make a piston arm up but I'll tell you

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.490 
make a piston arm up but I'll tell you
guys<00:00:24.359> those<00:00:24.869> things<00:00:25.199> are<00:00:25.590> quite<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.279> condition

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
guys those things are quite in condition

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.950 
guys those things are quite in condition
using<00:00:28.500> all<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.580> gasoline<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.510> get<00:00:30.660> things

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
using all that gasoline to get things

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.360 
using all that gasoline to get things
that<00:00:31.560> hot<00:00:31.969> the<00:00:32.969> dragon<00:00:33.480> car<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.800> your<00:00:35.190> own

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
that hot the dragon car is on your own

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.049 
that hot the dragon car is on your own
really<00:00:35.880> good<00:00:36.180> day<00:00:36.530> is<00:00:37.530> somewhat<00:00:38.520> less<00:00:38.760> than

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
really good day is somewhat less than

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.010 
really good day is somewhat less than
thirty<00:00:39.540> percent<00:00:39.989> efficient<00:00:41.780> another<00:00:42.780> there's

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
thirty percent efficient another there's

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.139 
thirty percent efficient another there's
two<00:00:43.410> thirds<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.460> energy<00:00:45.200> goes<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.500> waste

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
two thirds of the energy goes to waste

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.750 
two thirds of the energy goes to waste
and<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.809> would<00:00:49.020> matter<00:00:49.350> except<00:00:50.100> we<00:00:50.610> don't

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
and this would matter except we don't

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.380 
and this would matter except we don't
have<00:00:51.059> an<00:00:51.210> infinite<00:00:51.510> about<00:00:51.899> enemy<00:00:52.850> we<00:00:53.850> need<00:00:54.090> to

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
have an infinite about enemy we need to

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.580 
have an infinite about enemy we need to
to<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.590> more<00:00:56.120> with<00:00:57.120> less<00:00:57.390> energy<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.559> is

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
to to more with less energy so this is

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.459 
to to more with less energy so this is
ice<00:00:59.359> just<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.510> speed<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.899> up<00:01:01.020> I'm<00:01:01.230> going<00:01:01.379> to

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
ice just to speed it up I'm going to

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.549 
ice just to speed it up I'm going to
have<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> little<00:01:02.010> water<00:01:02.219> because<00:01:02.699> then<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.559> kids

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
have a little water because then it kids

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.550 
have a little water because then it kids
the<00:01:04.739> heat<00:01:04.920> gets<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.970> cold<00:01:06.210> gets<00:01:06.720> spread<00:01:06.990> out

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.370 

it's<00:01:10.560> good<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.830> know<00:01:11.810> now<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.840> I've<00:01:13.080> tried

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
it's good you know now that I've tried

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.480 
it's good you know now that I've tried
this<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.710> don't<00:01:13.920> think<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.130> could<00:01:14.280> live<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.549> up<00:01:16.490> so

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
this I don't think I could live it up so

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.710 
this I don't think I could live it up so
this<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.060> another<00:01:18.630> type<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.110> engine<00:01:20.000> it<00:01:21.000> has<00:01:21.330> a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
this is another type of engine it has a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.390 
this is another type of engine it has a
piston<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.400> big<00:01:24.650> big<00:01:25.650> around<00:01:25.890> part<00:01:26.280> is

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
piston and on the big big around part is

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.310 
piston and on the big big around part is
there's<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.729> piston<00:01:27.180> inside<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.900> then<00:01:28.049> there's

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
there's a piston inside and then there's

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.090 
there's a piston inside and then there's
a<00:01:28.409> smaller<00:01:28.950> piston<00:01:29.610> up<00:01:29.850> here<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.240> top<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:31.100> so

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
a smaller piston up here on top and so

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.310 
a smaller piston up here on top and so
this<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.729> ice<00:01:33.119> from<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.659> freezer<00:01:33.780> Gua

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
this is just ice from the freezer Gua

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.160 
this is just ice from the freezer Gua
rice<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.520> if<00:01:36.390> everything

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
rice and if everything

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.190 
rice and if everything
Jeff<00:01:39.890> it<00:01:40.890> will<00:01:41.070> run<00:01:41.659> now<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.689> don't<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.049> to

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
Jeff it will run now you don't have to

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.450 
Jeff it will run now you don't have to
know<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.439> much<00:01:43.830> about<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:46.009> you<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:47.189> tell

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
know that much about it but you can tell

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.609 
know that much about it but you can tell
that<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:47.909> going<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.390> be<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.509> pretty<00:01:48.840> efficient

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
that it's going to be a pretty efficient

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.590 
that it's going to be a pretty efficient
engine<00:01:50.119> to<00:01:51.119> run<00:01:51.770> that<00:01:52.770> fast<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.700> nothing<00:01:54.360> but

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
engine to run that fast on nothing but

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.690 
engine to run that fast on nothing but
ice<00:01:56.299> so<00:01:57.299> let<00:01:57.450> me<00:01:57.570> ask<00:01:57.720> you<00:01:57.899> guys<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.700> talked

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
ice so let me ask you guys I talked

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.120 
ice so let me ask you guys I talked
about<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.149> thermos<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.840> door<00:02:01.110> keeps<00:02:01.890> cold

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
about the thermos the door keeps cold

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.550 
about the thermos the door keeps cold
things<00:02:02.399> cold<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.939> hot<00:02:03.090> things<00:02:03.330> hi<00:02:03.539> how<00:02:04.350> does

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
things cold and hot things hi how does

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.880 
things cold and hot things hi how does
it<00:02:04.710> know<00:02:05.479> well<00:02:06.479> what<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.409> source<00:02:07.680> of

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
it know well what is the source of

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.470 
it know well what is the source of
energy<00:02:08.130> that's<00:02:08.580> making<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.239> engine<00:02:09.810> run<00:02:11.480> its

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
energy that's making this engine run its

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.420 
energy that's making this engine run its
heat<00:02:13.670> just<00:02:14.670> like<00:02:14.880> in<00:02:15.060> your<00:02:15.180> car<00:02:16.220> except<00:02:17.220> the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
heat just like in your car except the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.080 
heat just like in your car except the
heat<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:18.120> coming<00:02:18.390> from<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.080> room<00:02:19.819> it's<00:02:20.819> the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
heat is coming from the room it's the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.220 
heat is coming from the room it's the
heat<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.540> room<00:02:22.190> heating<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.340> top<00:02:24.230> black

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
heat of the room heating the top black

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.759 
heat of the room heating the top black
metal<00:02:25.680> blade<00:02:26.239> that's<00:02:27.239> passing<00:02:27.989> through<00:02:28.410> the

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
metal blade that's passing through the

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.710 
metal blade that's passing through the
two<00:02:29.010> Pistons<00:02:30.230> into<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.380> cold<00:02:31.709> ice<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:33.450> if<00:02:33.690> we

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
two Pistons into the cold ice so if we

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.289 
two Pistons into the cold ice so if we
let<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.230> sit<00:02:34.440> here<00:02:34.620> long<00:02:34.799> enough<00:02:35.299> the

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
let it sit here long enough the

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.120 
let it sit here long enough the
difference<00:02:36.810> in<00:02:37.019> temperature<00:02:37.560> between<00:02:37.590> the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
difference in temperature between the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.610 
difference in temperature between the
room<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.610> ice<00:02:38.760> will<00:02:39.150> be<00:02:39.360> too<00:02:39.930> small<00:02:40.260> and

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
room of the ice will be too small and

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.340 
room of the ice will be too small and
will<00:02:40.830> stop<00:02:41.100> running<00:02:41.660> but<00:02:42.660> for<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.930> next<00:02:42.959> few

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
will stop running but for the next few

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.440 
will stop running but for the next few
minutes<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.769> think<00:02:43.799> I<00:02:44.190> believe<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:45.120> will<00:02:45.269> be

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
minutes I think I believe you will be

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.550 
minutes I think I believe you will be
impressed<00:02:45.829> at<00:02:46.829> how<00:02:46.890> efficient<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:47.910> is<00:02:48.120> and

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
impressed at how efficient this is and

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.599 
impressed at how efficient this is and
so<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:49.829> engine<00:02:50.430> is<00:02:51.590> called<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.709> Stirling

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
so this engine is called a Stirling

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.460 
so this engine is called a Stirling
engine<00:02:54.180> named<00:02:54.420> after<00:02:54.630> these<00:02:54.959> two<00:02:55.140> British

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
engine named after these two British

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.190

didn't have to go turn anything off we
just<00:03:19.500> run<00:03:19.770> out<00:03:19.950> on<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.250> Sun<00:03:20.460> but<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.730> hard

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
just run out on the Sun but the hard

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.660 
just run out on the Sun but the hard
part<00:03:21.450> was<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:22.620> would<00:03:22.770> stop<00:03:23.040> when<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.400> fuel

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
part was it would stop when the fuel

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.370 
part was it would stop when the fuel
announced<00:03:24.030> it<00:03:24.300> ran<00:03:24.510> out<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.020> have<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.260> have

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
announced it ran out so you have to have

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.440 
announced it ran out so you have to have
enough<00:03:25.650> fuel<00:03:25.830> to<00:03:26.220> keep<00:03:26.550> it<00:03:26.730> going<00:03:27.060> as<00:03:27.150> long<00:03:27.180> as

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
enough fuel to keep it going as long as

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.470 
enough fuel to keep it going as long as
you<00:03:27.570> want<00:03:28.520> anyway<00:03:29.520> a<00:03:29.550> Stirling<00:03:30.030> engine<00:03:30.330> is

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
you want anyway a Stirling engine is

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.560 
you want anyway a Stirling engine is
quite<00:03:30.990> a<00:03:31.020> bit<00:03:31.560> more<00:03:31.980> efficient<00:03:32.700> than<00:03:33.510> the

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
quite a bit more efficient than the

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.830 
quite a bit more efficient than the
engine<00:03:34.170> in<00:03:34.290> your<00:03:34.320> car<00:03:35.090> much<00:03:36.090> more<00:03:36.360> efficient

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
engine in your car much more efficient

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.400 
engine in your car much more efficient
the<00:03:37.020> trouble<00:03:37.530> with<00:03:37.650> them<00:03:37.860> is<00:03:38.930> they<00:03:39.930> don't

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
the trouble with them is they don't

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.980 
the trouble with them is they don't
speed<00:03:40.800> up<00:03:40.830> and<00:03:41.130> slow<00:03:41.250> down<00:03:41.370> very<00:03:41.910> well<00:03:41.990> that's

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
speed up and slow down very well that's

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.600 
speed up and slow down very well that's
what<00:03:43.290> that's<00:03:43.530> why<00:03:43.680> everybody<00:03:44.040> likes<00:03:44.310> the

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
what that's why everybody likes the

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.580 
what that's why everybody likes the
engines<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.210> cars<00:03:45.480> you<00:03:45.840> can<00:03:45.960> accelerate<00:03:46.350> or

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
engines and cars you can accelerate or

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.840 
engines and cars you can accelerate or
sort<00:03:46.950> out<00:03:47.100> very<00:03:47.400> easily<00:03:47.690> it<00:03:48.690> seems<00:03:49.080> to<00:03:49.230> me<00:03:49.850> we

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
sort out very easily it seems to me we

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.810 
sort out very easily it seems to me we
can<00:03:51.090> do<00:03:51.270> a<00:03:51.300> lot<00:03:51.630> better<00:03:51.830> so<00:03:52.830> for<00:03:53.670> this<00:03:53.760> next

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
can do a lot better so for this next

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:05.680 
can do a lot better so for this next
little<00:03:54.390> thing<00:03:54.750> we<00:03:55.500> need<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.680> volunteer

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.710 
right so what I was young all we have is
this<00:06:09.120> sky<00:06:09.509> of<00:06:09.750> light<00:06:09.780> bulb<00:06:10.880> but<00:06:11.880> nowadays<00:06:12.120> you

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
this sky of light bulb but nowadays you

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.439 
this sky of light bulb but nowadays you
guys<00:06:12.930> have<00:06:13.169> a<00:06:13.289> light-emitting<00:06:13.710> diodes<00:06:14.449> the

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
guys have a light-emitting diodes the

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:17.740 
guys have a light-emitting diodes the
issues<00:06:15.750> I've<00:06:15.960> got<00:06:16.139> a<00:06:16.169> tenth<00:06:16.590> as<00:06:16.889> much<00:06:17.039> energy

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
issues I've got a tenth as much energy

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.650 
issues I've got a tenth as much energy
and<00:06:18.750> ER<00:06:19.910> depends<00:06:20.910> how<00:06:21.030> you<00:06:21.060> count<00:06:21.330> we've<00:06:21.539> got

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
and ER depends how you count we've got

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.920 
and ER depends how you count we've got
about<00:06:21.750> 10<00:06:22.080> times<00:06:22.380> 85<00:06:22.830> so<00:06:23.220> many<00:06:24.180> applications

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
about 10 times 85 so many applications

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.890 
about 10 times 85 so many applications
through<00:06:25.110> a<00:06:25.139> hundred<00:06:25.650> times<00:06:25.830> more<00:06:26.099> efficient

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
through a hundred times more efficient

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.499 
through a hundred times more efficient
and<00:06:27.900> this<00:06:28.139> is<00:06:28.319> just<00:06:28.470> a<00:06:28.620> frickin<00:06:28.949> okay<00:06:29.160> this<00:06:29.509> is

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:30.509 
and this is just a frickin okay this is

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:33.350 
and this is just a frickin okay this is
just<00:06:30.539> the<00:06:30.870> first<00:06:30.900> idea<00:06:31.759> you<00:06:32.759> guys<00:06:33.000> may<00:06:33.330> be

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
just the first idea you guys may be

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.930 
just the first idea you guys may be
alive<00:06:33.810> we<00:06:34.380> can<00:06:34.590> eat<00:06:34.770> their<00:06:34.979> lights<00:06:35.190> even<00:06:35.550> more

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
alive we can eat their lights even more

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.930 
alive we can eat their lights even more
efficient<00:06:36.500> if<00:06:37.500> we<00:06:37.680> do<00:06:37.830> that<00:06:37.860> we'll<00:06:38.430> be<00:06:38.490> doing

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
efficient if we do that we'll be doing

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.860 
efficient if we do that we'll be doing
more<00:06:39.120> with<00:06:39.419> less<00:06:39.479> and<00:06:40.020> we<00:06:40.380> will<00:06:40.590> dare<00:06:40.889> I<00:06:40.919> say

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
more with less and we will dare I say

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.440 
more with less and we will dare I say
change<00:06:42.870> the<00:06:43.199> world
