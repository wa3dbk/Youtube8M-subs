you'll probably see a decent amount of
videos<00:00:26.519> each<00:00:26.730> day<00:00:27.000> anyways<00:00:27.990> I'm<00:00:28.080> moving<00:00:28.289> off

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
videos each day anyways I'm moving off

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.620 
videos each day anyways I'm moving off
with<00:00:28.560> bini<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.039> basically<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.910> decided<00:00:30.330> go<00:00:30.480> for

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
with bini and basically I decided go for

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.930 
with bini and basically I decided go for
the<00:00:30.689> burn<00:00:30.869> that's<00:00:31.800> fine<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.460> then<00:00:32.700> he

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
the burn that's fine and then he

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.670 
the burn that's fine and then he
actually<00:00:33.210> at<00:00:33.660> first<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:34.320> thought<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.590> was

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
actually at first I thought this was

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.900 
actually at first I thought this was
actually<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.160> be<00:00:35.190> very<00:00:35.399> good<00:00:35.610> for<00:00:35.790> me

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
actually going to be very good for me

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.030 
actually going to be very good for me
because<00:00:36.360> he<00:00:36.750> ended<00:00:36.930> up<00:00:37.050> going<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.590> delphox

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
because he ended up going in a delphox

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.700 
because he ended up going in a delphox

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
to something out anyways I didn't really

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.000 
to something out anyways I didn't really
have<00:01:01.469> anything<00:01:01.710> else<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.100> go<00:01:02.250> into<00:01:02.539> so<00:01:03.539> maybe

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
have anything else to go into so maybe

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
have anything else to go into so maybe
that<00:01:05.010> might<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.430> actually<00:01:05.549> been<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.850> better

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
that might have actually been a better

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.520 
that might have actually been a better
idea<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.450> go<00:01:06.540> for<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.750> knockout<00:01:06.900> there<00:01:07.320> than

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
idea to go for the knockout there than

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.320 
idea to go for the knockout there than
just<00:01:07.560> trying<00:01:08.130> over<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.490> destiny<00:01:08.820> bond<00:01:09.030> see<00:01:09.240> if

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
you would go for something else because

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.070 
you would go for something else because

I<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:30.079> for<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.229> Sharpedo<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.100> can't<00:01:32.400> really

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
I have for this Sharpedo I can't really

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.550 
I have for this Sharpedo I can't really
do<00:01:32.759> too<00:01:32.970> much<00:01:33.119> with<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.200> see<00:01:34.380> there

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
do too much with it as you can see there

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.380 
do too much with it as you can see there
I<00:01:34.590> did<00:01:35.040> get<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.220> flange<00:01:35.549> which<00:01:35.790> was<00:01:36.000> pretty<00:01:36.150> nice

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
I did get a flange which was pretty nice

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.270 
I did get a flange which was pretty nice
and<00:01:36.659> fortunately<00:01:37.020> for<00:01:37.259> him<00:01:37.320> now<00:01:37.920> I'm<00:01:38.070> going<00:01:38.189> to

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
and fortunately for him now I'm going to

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.100 
and fortunately for him now I'm going to
decide<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.640> switch<00:01:38.759> out<00:01:39.180> I'm<00:01:39.329> going<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.720> end<00:01:39.900> up

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
decide to switch out I'm going to end up

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.140 
decide to switch out I'm going to end up
going<00:01:40.470> into<00:01:40.590> my<00:01:40.799> reuniclus<00:01:41.220> he<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.939> actually

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
going into my reuniclus he is actually

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.700 
going into my reuniclus he is actually
gonna<00:01:42.420> go<00:01:42.540> for<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> substitute<00:01:43.500> which

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
gonna go for the substitute which

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.590 
gonna go for the substitute which
honestly<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.490> don't<00:01:44.549> really<00:01:44.729> agree<00:01:45.240> with<00:01:45.390> that

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
honestly I don't really agree with that

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.120 
honestly I don't really agree with that
much<00:01:46.079> because<00:01:46.200> he's<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:46.799> going<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.009> end<00:01:47.070> up

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
much because he's just going to end up

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.429 
much because he's just going to end up
losing<00:01:47.460> more<00:01:47.640> HP<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.060> give<00:01:48.570> because<00:01:48.810> now<00:01:49.229> he's

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
losing more HP I give because now he's

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.620 
losing more HP I give because now he's
find<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.770> substitute<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.369> all<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:51.360> he

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
find a substitute and all that but he

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.969 
find a substitute and all that but he
really<00:01:51.750> doesn't<00:01:51.960> do<00:01:52.170> do<00:01:52.380> much<00:01:52.560> but<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.770> all

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
really doesn't do do much but that all

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.530 
really doesn't do do much but that all
he<00:01:53.100> does<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.280> good<00:01:53.579> he<00:01:53.640> goes<00:01:53.820> for<00:01:54.030> seismic<00:01:54.390> toss

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
he does is good he goes for seismic toss

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.660 
he does is good he goes for seismic toss
so<00:01:54.990> honestly<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.920> thought<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.369> should<00:01:56.399> have

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
so honestly I thought you should have

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.889 
so honestly I thought you should have
just<00:01:56.759> gone<00:01:56.939> for<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.270> teeway<00:01:57.689> for

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
just gone for like a teeway for

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.780 
just gone for like a teeway for
something<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.380> know<00:01:58.469> getting<00:01:58.710> paralyzed<00:01:59.310> and

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
something you know getting paralyzed and

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.340 
something you know getting paralyzed and
then<00:01:59.909> start<00:02:00.180> over<00:02:00.450> Ironheads<00:02:00.869> maybe<00:02:01.170> that

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
then start over Ironheads maybe that

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.289 
then start over Ironheads maybe that
would<00:02:01.500> have<00:02:01.590> been<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.740> better<00:02:01.920> situation<00:02:02.299> or

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
would have been a better situation or

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.050 
would have been a better situation or
better<00:02:03.540> play<00:02:03.930> than<00:02:03.960> right<00:02:04.469> now<00:02:04.649> anyways<00:02:05.549> yes<00:02:05.790> I

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.750 
boost in skald doesn't really matter
that<00:02:52.410> much<00:02:52.560> because<00:02:52.740> I<00:02:53.130> mean<00:02:53.310> electrons

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
that much because I mean electrons

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.730 
that much because I mean electrons
really<00:02:54.060> can't<00:02:54.270> do<00:02:54.420> anything<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.810> me<00:02:54.840> so<00:02:55.140> I

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
really can't do anything to me so I

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.690 
really can't do anything to me so I
don't<00:02:55.950> know<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.070> guess<00:02:56.190> he<00:02:56.400> just<00:02:56.430> doesn't

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
don't know I guess he just doesn't

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.190 
don't know I guess he just doesn't
really<00:02:57.000> have<00:02:57.150> anything<00:02:57.360> better<00:02:57.600> for<00:02:57.720> me<00:02:57.959> and

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
really have anything better for me and

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.410 
really have anything better for me and
what<00:02:58.770> he's<00:02:58.860> going<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.040> do<00:02:59.220> now<00:02:59.520> is<00:02:59.550> he's<00:03:00.180> just

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
what he's going to do now is he's just

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.090 
what he's going to do now is he's just
going<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.840> end<00:03:00.959> up<00:03:01.110> pouring<00:03:01.380> into<00:03:01.709> slowking

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
going to end up pouring into slowking

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.680 
going to end up pouring into slowking
which<00:03:02.520> is<00:03:02.820> probably<00:03:03.240> what<00:03:03.420> he<00:03:03.510> should<00:03:03.660> have

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
which is probably what he should have

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.300 
which is probably what he should have
done<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.990> first<00:03:04.170> place<00:03:04.410> because<00:03:04.980> now<00:03:05.250> I'm
