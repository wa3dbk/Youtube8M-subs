00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.230
 the fact you have called the Bay 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.779
 burns there burns hills or brulis for 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.610
 him the burns and it spreads on 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.200
 how many acres of between 10 and that me 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.369
 I think fold under 15 hectares a little 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.720
 close so with aurel we are really 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.239
 just next to the state forest 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.230
 so you can career paf we go on 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.420
 busy right now until 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.649
 cancer fountain we go all the way 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.450
 day all the time but I do 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.130
 all the time in the forest is important 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.989
 for their morale and even their condition 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.570
 physical you love me work without getting 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.010
 report and I think that's the 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.420
 frostbite so well apart from your own 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.500
 stables this is a site also there is 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.940
 a lot of events 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.829
 sports you organize a lot of 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.820
 contest but have made at least forty 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.010
 competition days of the year 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.840
 so it's both the stables of 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.000
 roger-yves bost high level but so to 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.890
 both the owners stables and 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.079
 prices a little bit of going and schedules 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.269
 where I was going moment we are more 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:08.159
 quiet but otherwise it's really 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.159
 for everyone working together 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.610
 so there obviously jean-yves a ride 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.439
 status divides your time anyway between 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.859
 six months of external competitions and six 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:23.170
 indoor months indoor made for 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:25.210
 prepare the big the competitions a 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.460
 in front of the world cups and where it's 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.389
 already a great manager formerly we are going 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.740
 he makes 70 on santa inside for 

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:34.740
 to make courses and all his possessions 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.810
 it's nice there when you look through 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.289
 at the 3 career 1 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.560
 it's good we continue because the road 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.560
 is long 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:02:03.429
 there we arrive at the boss's first box 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:02:07.750
 ideal of the lodge the light well embarrassing 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:09.039
 to orly whose full form there is some 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.509
 it's time to eat his hay then 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.060
 that's a great horse like in 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.739
 longevity eat no it's a show 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.780
 exceptional that brought me a lot 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.390
 who's still in shape we won it the 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.370
 population to someone from paris you know 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.840
 that this is the stallion with the most 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.849
 gains before that was strong delaunay the 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.110
 florian angot horse and how much the 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.880
 war now more than 800 beds there 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.400
 they are coming soon to 900 thousand nine 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.329
 another hundred thousand increase he is 15 years old 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.400
 he is in good shape 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.230
 we target a little important contests 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.239
 but we do a little less but he goes 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.190
 well do you remember that he had gone up to 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.120
 four years old nicolas touzaint nicolas 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.069
 should accept it 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.549
 I think it's still a part 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.810
 from his horse experience and try 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.980
 it's important moments but good 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.980
 the beginning of a choice yeah
