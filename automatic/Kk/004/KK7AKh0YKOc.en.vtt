00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.640
 I welcome everyone today to February 15 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.390
 where there was up to the Soviet troops from 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.630
 afghanistan 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.150
 it also coincides so orthodox 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.990
 Well, we celebrated this holiday today. 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.860
 This I recently watched the transfer 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:35.170
 device microphone and I remembered 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:38.720
 childhood as we played were played and walkie-talkies 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.329
 made from matchboxes a walkie-talkie here I 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.190
 and how we did it with show so 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.040
 little backstory well she just 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.070
 string is pulled 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:52.250
 boxes in the stretch one serves 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.460
 resonator 2 receiver and vice versa here 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:02.840
 so we played it quite once the house was 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:05.570
 corner two houses and my friends on one 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.430
 at the end of the house I know each other 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:12.350
 tightened the thread with such a length and 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.950
 talking and even realized what else 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.500
 3 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.990
 connected to each other account with him 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.360
 apartment 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.520
 I have an example of this side of the house he 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:27.130
 stop shooting and we are even three 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.200
 the threads were taut and somehow audible on 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.350
 our sound is not the best of course 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.880
 cups of that gear are much better 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:41.220
 it resonates but what to own it under 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:45.149
 hand was doing here means test 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:49.060
 look further for this you will need 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:52.990
 the board is timidly match and 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.950
 and string any can use fishing line 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.659
 thicker thread it does not matter that the main well 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.000
 The principle is better, of course, stronger because 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.429
 ordinary thread breaks but we of course 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.670
 stole the scales did not rush took 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:11.080
 mothers do not have a regular thread on every sheet 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.660
 this one was, that is, furniture is not needed even 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.780
 knife principle we show how we 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.290
 do without a knife done like this 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.290
 way 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:31.100
 set fire to the match a little warmed up 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:35.000
 breaks off and on a rough wall 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.730
 sharpen such a little 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:46.220
 although also made toothpicks see same 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:46.220
 sharply literally millet 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:03:00.940
 so here it is pierced approximately 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:00.940
 in the middle is not always sure turned 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:10.850
 there is yes all the same match do not throw away 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:16.520
 she will she serves bond knowledge 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:22.100
 reel will appreciate to and attached well here on 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:28.280
 the match is literally visible there is not even without a node 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:30.250
 just on matane more then this 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.120
 hole 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:42.580
 born yes oh no no our 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.580
 arrows belly should make a knot 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:04:00.020
 there is another match 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:04:03.190
 naturally and broke all make way 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.180
 fix the same thing but now 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.290
 drew on the length that you 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.830
 seems reasonable 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.620
 Of course more here end the same way 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:16.609
 reel on another boxes there 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.509
 repeat the procedure now 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.509
 damn buga sword 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:12.700
 they could not 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:12.700
 attention says Moscow 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.960
 youtube 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.889
 but we weren't very audible but on 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.129
 Actually the sound is like that of the radio 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.870
 so weak such a dying all 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:35.419
 still hear to the person tells us 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:39.889
 This in childhood was very a wonder 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:41.629
 interesting because the site to the workers and not 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.669
 thrown out immediately after use 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:46.759
 wound around the house remained candles 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:50.389
