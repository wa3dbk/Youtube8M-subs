00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:15.260
 I already did the drawing so we'll go 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:17.420
 use as an ink palette these 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.270
 Styrofoam flags that come in 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.050
 foods and in fruits and vegetables that 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.310
 people buy that I always like 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.920
 reuse material 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.279
 so we'll put it out later 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.170
 but had a utility something 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:39.769
 if you want you can also 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:43.219
 with a plastic lining with a later 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:49.329
 the film uses the same flag 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:50.750
 we are going to procel white and blue 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:59.210
 dark 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:01:09.160
 this ink we take an amount 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:23.060
 white can take 31 more years because 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:28.580
 just a little bit of heaven - ink toto 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:31.700
 over here and we will also use the average 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:42.190
 on the acre with which we look at the brush and 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:44.410
 helps to dry a little inside the 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:51.729
 tank 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:53.200
 Let's see the sky from the reference number 384 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:02:03.140
 18 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:05.770
 pink and bristles look a little at the 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.770
 medium 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.290
 white enough 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:27.530
 I get white and just a penguin two streets 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:31.430
 give a little improvement here and do similar and 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.540
 side a on the x-shaped screen 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:39.680
 We're always going to make this move. 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:43.159
 in the form of xis beginning you will have a 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:52.090
 bit of fear because it's natural 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:56.829
 because it is a different material from it 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:00.470
 myths around the waist of the canvas but 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:04.609
 you have to train like any other 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.519
 material any other painting work 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:14.620
 we have to train so we always have 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:14.620
 doing so taking care of the cast not 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:32.690
 It can be cool 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:36.280
 I do not really like it because it gives a 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.280
 cool effect in the sky 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.389
 sometimes I give a little brush 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:56.870
 work but I've mastered the brush 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:04:00.139
 so I do not look much 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:05.269
 medium brush 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:10.040
 the guard will run at work a 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:16.039
 turn a little better but if 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:20.199
 you always do always 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.199
 You'll get a good result. 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:29.410
 to be so filling all going can 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:33.900
 pass again if but you were 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:40.360
 the middle will help not dry fast 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:42.880
 making small areas do more in the 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.590
 the top of the screen we'll go 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:55.690
 put more blue in the brush a little 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:57.670
 More less blue mixture with 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.850
 bottom 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:03.250
 if you can not take too long 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:08.200
 time can not make this mix 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:10.920
 no longer put a little more and 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.920
 White 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:18.180
 otto split a little more than 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.180
 white and blends 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:34.500
 the canopy you will work in the same 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.500
 way 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:52.040
 It's good that you take photos or even so. 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:59.169
 the easier it is to get these magazines 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:06:03.440
 They have a step by step look color 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:06.470
 first study because sometimes the 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:09.139
 things that have nature that people 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:14.600
 see if you can not make the mix 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:18.820
 of the colors in the ink to look like 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:21.350
 with the most natural nature color then 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:26.750
 pick up these magazines with a step 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:30.800
 step color and go training this 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:34.940
 screen size 40 by 50 very good mother 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:37.940
 50 by 70 also I really like it a lot 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:43.630
 small it gives less resources to people 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.630
 works well to a very good size 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:56.810
 wonderfully well to have a 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:07:00.770
 specialize more in style of thing of 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:04.520
 people who only landscape others painted only 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:08.200
 the still life that are the floral with 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.200
 a fruit 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:18.500
 then the more the person 

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:21.820
 specialize it will be the one 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:24.820
 work season what else do we train 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.820
 best 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:39.440
 I came back a little more blue 

00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:46.449
 It's still necessary to know who will make the mark. 

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.840
 I can still mix
