00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.389
 hello today the springer guitars 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.460
 h bridle so with bixby then there 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.380
 ashbritt is the little sister of the 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.290
 serraf which she takes the form 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.689
 general except we're not going to have any 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.059
 sculpture on the table and that's where we got 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.130
 a flat table and what gives us a 

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:30.050
 really rock'n'roll guitar so here we 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.300
 has a vowel maple table made 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.250
 a few millimeters thick since 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.809
 it's not a binding it's the 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.910
 slice of the table in fact we see 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.660
 canned and then back 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.630
 we have the mahogany body the handle is in 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:50.350
 mahogany also with an ebony fingerboard 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:53.840
 so we have a set stick and then 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:58.370
 particularity of this guitar we have 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.560
 pickups at the only heart throne then 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.210
 the winning thrones are if you 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.879
 want it like son Torteron 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.030
 but to the man-of-heart forms and that's 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.500
 a so alone these German 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.170
 worried who makes them and that's 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.380
 really pickups that have a grain 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.759
 very very gretsch in fact very very 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.679
 pleasant to the ear 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.600
 so to drive all that we have a 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:22.759
 volume a tone a selector 3 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.310
 positions well then we note the big bill 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:30.899
 a very impressive with 1 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:35.009
 a horse and a roller and then so if 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:37.049
 Mechanical clu clu sun usual my 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.390
 chapter of what we can notice 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.399
 so that's going to be on the back so you 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.450
 see here we have a very generous cutout 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.759
 which allows the hand to climb up to 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.079
 last boxes and then on the other side 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:55.110
 here we have a fairly important reinforcement 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.119
 under the sign is what is a pledge of 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.799
 solidity 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.539
 so that's me so this album and I 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.640
 find really very very nice very 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:06.679
 pretty and then we will listen now what 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.679
 that she first gives in her clear 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.420
 and 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.819
 and 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.150
 we go now are crunch and we 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.830
 will use a little big bih like that 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.570
 you will see that the guitar keeps 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.750
 perfectly agree even with the big 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.750
 bih 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.370
 and 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.230
 m 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.230
 but 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.560
 m 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.560
 but 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
 e 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.170
 and 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.360
 and then we pass now its saturated 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.700
 where we are going to have the character well 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.310
 gratify none of these pickups that is 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.750
 really very nice so here we are 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.280
 in serious micro and then we will go 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.280
 to the microphone is due as and when 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.770
 we have seen this influx of products d are 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.630
 really very fleshy very organic 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.930
 she is very very nice to play her 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.240
 Bixby works very very well here 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.920
 it's both a guitar that is very 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.930
 well finished very beautiful and who at the same 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:37.420
 time is a real tool of 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.420
 rock'n'roll and on that I greet you well
