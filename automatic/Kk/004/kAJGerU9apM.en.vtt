Heartbreakers this line is another

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.050 
Heartbreakers this line is another
classic<00:00:15.240> line<00:00:15.780> in<00:00:16.020> G<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:19.520> let's<00:00:20.520> get<00:00:20.699> into<00:00:20.880> it

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
classic line in G and let's get into it

00:00:21.060 --> 00:01:00.930 
classic line in G and let's get into it
I<00:00:21.390> guess

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.450 

alright<00:01:01.940> cool<00:01:02.239> that's<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:03.129> very<00:01:04.129> end

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
alright cool that's the very end

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.250 
alright cool that's the very end
obviously<00:01:04.850> and<00:01:05.360> he<00:01:05.420> doesn't<00:01:05.720> embellishment

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
obviously and he doesn't embellishment

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.539 
obviously and he doesn't embellishment
at<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.440> end<00:01:06.560> which<00:01:06.740> is<00:01:06.860> pretty<00:01:07.010> cool<00:01:07.220> I<00:01:07.280> want

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
at the end which is pretty cool I want

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.960 
at the end which is pretty cool I want
to<00:01:07.670> include<00:01:08.000> that<00:01:08.290> so<00:01:09.290> really<00:01:09.500> quick<00:01:09.909> we're<00:01:10.909> in

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
to include that so really quick we're in

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.580 
to include that so really quick we're in
the<00:01:11.060> key<00:01:11.270> of<00:01:11.299> G<00:01:11.750> so<00:01:11.990> that<00:01:12.590> means<00:01:12.940> we're<00:01:13.940> using

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
the key of G so that means we're using

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.590 
the key of G so that means we're using
and<00:01:15.590> at<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.640> end<00:01:16.790> so<00:01:17.060> he's<00:01:17.180> going<00:01:17.270> to<00:01:17.330> use<00:01:17.479> the

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
and at the end so he's going to use the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.609 
and at the end so he's going to use the
upper<00:01:17.869> register<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:18.860> is<00:01:19.820> G<00:01:20.330> and<00:01:20.600> it's<00:01:21.440> going<00:01:21.560> to

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
upper register so is G and it's going to

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.060 
upper register so is G and it's going to
be<00:01:21.710> primarily<00:01:22.190> on<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.369> B<00:01:22.759> and<00:01:23.800> these<00:01:24.800> top

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
be primarily on the B and these top

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.780 
be primarily on the B and these top
three<00:01:25.310> strings<00:01:25.670> actually<00:01:26.470> so<00:01:27.470> I<00:01:27.790> would

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
three strings actually so I would

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.789 
three strings actually so I would
suggest<00:01:28.940> you<00:01:29.390> you<00:01:29.840> know<00:01:29.960> going<00:01:30.440> through<00:01:30.560> the

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
suggest you you know going through the

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:47.880 
suggest you you know going through the
scale<00:01:31.299> G<00:01:32.299> right<00:01:40.630> right<00:01:46.030> all<00:01:47.030> right<00:01:47.179> so<00:01:47.479> um

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
scale G right right all right so um

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.070 
scale G right right all right so um
start<00:01:48.890> with<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:49.190> slide<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.690> finger

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
start with the slide and the finger

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.469 
start with the slide and the finger
right<00:01:51.500> because<00:01:51.770> it's<00:01:51.920> George<00:01:52.340> kind<00:01:53.300> of<00:01:53.330> like<00:01:53.450> a

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
right because it's George kind of like a

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:06.339 
right because it's George kind of like a
plucking<00:01:57.970> real<00:01:58.970> classic<00:02:04.959> right<00:02:05.959> it<00:02:06.140> is<00:02:06.319> a

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:06.349 
plucking real classic right it is a

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:15.850 
plucking real classic right it is a
crime<00:02:06.679> to<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:10.729> major<00:02:11.200> seventh<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:15.500> another

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
crime to the major seventh and another

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.880 
crime to the major seventh and another
climb

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:27.390 

and<00:02:20.890> it's<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.400> third<00:02:21.670> year<00:02:21.910> so<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:26.560> then<00:02:27.160> this

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
and it's the third year so and then this

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:41.070 
and it's the third year so and then this
this<00:02:27.760> little<00:02:27.910> line<00:02:28.210> is<00:02:28.390> pretty<00:02:28.510> cool<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:40.080> and

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
this little line is pretty cool so and

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:53.610 
this little line is pretty cool so and
then<00:02:41.170> after<00:02:41.440> that<00:02:41.560> climb<00:02:41.980> it's<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:53.290> again

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
then after that climb it's so so again

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.410 
then after that climb it's so so again
you're<00:02:53.800> hittin<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.040> note<00:02:54.070> but<00:02:54.790> sliding<00:02:55.180> away

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
you're hittin the note but sliding away

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:08.310 
you're hittin the note but sliding away
really<00:02:55.840> quick<00:02:59.400> and<00:03:00.400> then<00:03:00.490> the<00:03:01.380> resulting<00:03:07.320> and

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
really quick and then the resulting and

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:22.120 
really quick and then the resulting and
the<00:03:08.410> second<00:03:08.740> time<00:03:08.920> he<00:03:09.130> embellishes<00:03:09.580> in

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:31.670 

that's<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.220> crime<00:03:23.490> up<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:30.320> almost<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.530> same

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
that's a crime up I almost the same

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:47.470 
that's a crime up I almost the same
thing<00:03:31.740> as<00:03:32.040> this<00:03:32.370> floor<00:03:32.700> one

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.670 

harmonica<00:03:48.480> on<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.630> fifth<00:03:48.870> fret<00:03:49.020> fifth<00:03:49.470> fret

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
harmonica on the fifth fret fifth fret

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.670 
harmonica on the fifth fret fifth fret
so<00:03:50.480> it's<00:03:51.480> a<00:03:51.540> pretty<00:03:51.690> cool<00:03:51.960> pretty<00:03:52.230> cool<00:03:52.380> line<00:03:52.650> I

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
so it's a pretty cool pretty cool line I

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.010 
so it's a pretty cool pretty cool line I
would<00:03:52.950> suggest<00:03:53.280> going<00:03:54.030> through<00:03:54.330> your<00:03:54.450> G<00:03:54.750> Major

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
would suggest going through your G Major

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:19.620 
would suggest going through your G Major
scale<00:03:55.140> up<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.740> down<00:03:55.980> so<00:03:56.730> you<00:03:56.790> can

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:28.480 

so<00:04:20.630> this<00:04:20.780> is<00:04:20.810> you<00:04:20.989> know<00:04:26.889> try<00:04:27.889> the<00:04:27.949> hardest<00:04:28.340> line

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
so this is you know try the hardest line

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:47.920 
so this is you know try the hardest line
of<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.699> whole<00:04:29.000> thing<00:04:46.360> it's<00:04:47.360> very<00:04:47.630> very

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
of the whole thing it's very very

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.529 
of the whole thing it's very very
melodic<00:04:48.250> check<00:04:49.250> it<00:04:49.370> out<00:04:49.520> and<00:04:49.759> hopefully<00:04:50.240> this

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
melodic check it out and hopefully this

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.729 
melodic check it out and hopefully this
didn't<00:04:50.900> take<00:04:51.050> too<00:04:51.289> long<00:04:51.500> see<00:04:52.490> you<00:04:52.580> guys
