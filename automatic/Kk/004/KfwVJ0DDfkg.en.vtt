 the great inventions of a factor we do not have as a state to consider type 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:16.449
 book 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:17.640
 the doctor pointed 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.939
 for the bechamel 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.800
 we have butter 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.749
 flour 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:23.140
 the milk 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.339
 and there where we can elude with 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.509
 the grated cheese 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.210
 uu bush for 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.420
 muddy pointed to the Allied side 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.420
 oil and salt 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.530
 like butter 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.690
 at other times that he just from the butter 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.760
 what we do is something that I have done in this way we get 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.820
 the melting point 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.900
 and that we do not burn butter 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.180
 good 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.850
 that we were robbed by fusing it to federer for a lot of the penalty I for the exam 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.000
 rose a lot of theft 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.440
 not only as 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.910
 this 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.960
 your percentage of fat to the million 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.080
 then you have to assess how it maintained afellay 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.010
 so 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.580
 If we were a lot of grease work corire of oils we can make more flour 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.770
 the milk 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:24.980
 4 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.460
 help me not to ask me to read recapitulated that this recapitule 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.430
 I say you know 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.910
 in case there was scrap aft 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.010
 and here is scandola clear text start adding 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.549
 3 this 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:43.700
 It is very extensive 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.630
 see more reforms 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.600
 with talent 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.330
 you have to do them even though it has to be for the sake of meat 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.880
 and now we have 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.380
 developed 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.380
 diego córdoba 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.010
 they ask you will find that you cook little because these facts rose to temperature that 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.510
 have

 It melts weight 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.490
 we have made a bechamel 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.990
 together with the doctor butter a little bit of olive oil possible 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.639
 fusions 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.449
 a bull with his dog 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:11.929

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.709
 b involves two others 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:22.719
 his arm 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.019
 a little milk 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.349
 this one is a little better 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.029
 efe for those who are looking for the residents the pilot program developed 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:33.199
 as below 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:35.819
 pure soon 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:36.910
 like when 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.319
 let's go back little by little it slows down and I'm 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.579
 flour 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.119
 the web or 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:46.809
 and this, as usual 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:49.809
 n to breadcrumbs 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:54.279
 for this we support to see it out on Monday in Havana 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:56.090
 sheen and days

 to eye perez and 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:01.369
 like not everyone what will not have to see how he's going to do things 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.529
 in this forum 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:10.529
 sixth district 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:15.329
 I'll stay with you again when you register until these with the forces 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:16.899
 federal 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:20.149
 a lot of them are picked up by federations 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:22.489
 and you can do the pirates and now you do 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.199
 and little roqueta ábrego palitos 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:31.569
 the steps another egg failure if you had was your smallest amount cereals 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.419
 from third parties if we're not barely half of what it's about collecting the bounce 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:37.119
 the rebozo grew and until 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:38.779
 here he knows how to cook meat 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:44.049
