00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:18.810
 the nefilim the legend of the nefilim 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.090
 it is without doubt this legend a terrible 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.890
 headache for the story 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.560
 traditional since the knowledge 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.869
 captured in this legend are difficult 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.570
 to refute this legend is a 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.890
 alternative to the bible but counting the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.040
 same story 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.829
 that yes to accept one or the other is to change 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.649
 side between two opposing positions in 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.690
 all about good and evil although there will be 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.520
 to clarify that there are thousands of religions 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.370
 on earth and not all books 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.010
 they are the bible about the concept of god 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.829
 about who we are our mission in 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.900
 world and our destiny nevertheless already 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.520
 personal level I will say that although the 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.410
 existence of these beings seems 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.820
 undeniable especially since 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.070
 knowledge about genetics and 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.380
 technology in which they speak in the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.060
 tablets of 6,000 years ago do not leave 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.100
 place to doubt all the truth is that 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.369
 neither do you have to accept it outright 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.590
 everything in these theories appears neither 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.960
 on the tablets it appears as I said 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.539
 already some versions have nothing 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.530
 to do with the other versions and in 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.440
 this sense 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.470
 they will be analyzing the incongruence of 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.450
 a literal level version even 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.820
 counting with the tablets there are 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.820
 different versions and chronologies according to 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.979
 whoever analyzes them does not all interpret 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.680
 in the same way what they have found 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.810
 of previous civilizations not all 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.149
 they give them the same interpretation every 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.549
 who each researcher interprets it from 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.040
 different way however the will 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.690
 is to show other alternatives and other 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.729
 opinions that break the story 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.070
 traditional then everyone will take 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.670
 fierce party thus counting and knowing 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.220
 all the existing possibilities as well 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.120
 you can say 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.430
 that the legend of the Nefilim is 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.800
 it is simply a legend about the 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.500
 origin of humanity that says that 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.030
 they came from space and colonized the 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.750
 land in the year 445 thousand to 200 thousand before 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.880
 of Christ 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.920
 and that to the human being the result of the 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.420
 genetic experiments done with 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.600
 those of feeling with the object of 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:33.840
 colonizing the land is simply a 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.840
 theory and a legend the legend of the 9
