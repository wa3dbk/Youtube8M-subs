 a reference to the group of this project in 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.179
 description all my dear friends and 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.800
 my channel subscribers with you again i 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.870
 all creeper and welcome 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.309
 video of my new riston project 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.309
 Well, we drove 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.180
 what else would you like to add to this new 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.680
 Pooh I would like to apologize because 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.600
 last video clip about space was 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.210
 a huge number of bugs maybe they 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.339
 were caused by unsuccessful sony rendering 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.289
 Vegas, I do not know exactly what 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.479
 will add today's mechanism of sweet cherry 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.659
 biomechanism us adds a new boss 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:07.880
 exactly ghost rider and so let's 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.159
 create absolutely any world for example 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.770
 let's put creative and super 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.780
 flat world and yes guys this is my most 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.970
 first mechanism in one command block then 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.679
 there is before i never like 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.830
 mechanism and did not create therefore it 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:24.830
 first under like 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:28.220
 then let's write the gif command my 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.539
 nickname maynkravt commands block for what we 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.450
 do this to get 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.470
 command block then we put it and 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.990
 I prescribe him the next very long 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.060
 command link to which I will leave 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.920
 after this video clip 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.899
 tyscha typed one likes for my 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.209
 the channel is in principle not so much and 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.880
 so then we have to take the activator well 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:47.539
 for example, set the button and activate our 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.550
 command block 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.800
 after which we build the next 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.619
 the mechanism of the guys I tried to do it 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.149
 as compact as possible 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.250
 I got it I learned a lot 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.410
 number of score bards from before i 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.269
 score bards did not know at all specifically 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.349
 order to fit the mechanisms in one 

00:02:02.269 --> 00:02:06.530
 block commands make them more 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:07.220
 compact I learned them and so we 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.929
 do then 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.879
 then we click on this button on 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.250
 all necessary scoreboard are created and 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:16.099
 Well, in general, the necessary rules for 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.260
 games are also installed after this 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.239
 what we do after we prepare for 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.550
 fighting with our boss for this we need 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.550
 First to take the sword and then we have to 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.790
 take necessarily armor so not yet 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.930
 took it so then we take the apples let's 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.590
 go away 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.840
 set the spawn point as prescribed 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.260
 here is spawn point to here 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.670
 reborn well and let's also put 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:46.040
 game keepin roll the curse is excellent 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.050
 all game rules are updated now we 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.239
 can fight our boss let me 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.640
 Immediately get dressed and what do we need for 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.280
 to call upon our boss well in 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.540
 first it is a fireball and also bones 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.400
 necessary for us 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.590
 for calling him now we 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.659
 go out to game mod zero after that we 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.030
 eat an apple well so that we have 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.769
 immediately killed we throw a fireball and 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.510
 bones we have various 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.450
 beautiful effects of a piece we manage 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.120
 his egg call we click on the ground and have 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.250
 we will spawn our boss going 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.930
 various effects 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.819
 Iâ€™ll notice the night and how 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.920
 in the form he attacked us that is he 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.959
 spit fire beneath us blame and 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.519
 now he is on a burning horse 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.799
 we kill the horse right away so that he is with us 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.500
 joined the battle what is 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.419
 himself this ghostly racer of himself he 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.060
 presents such a skeleton dressed in 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:39.799
 lost pro black armor is also his 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.889
 there is a very powerful thing as help 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.870
 whom we will be hurt by this boss 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.500
 besides that we can just 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.329
 Attack 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.760
 there are four abilities at first 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:52.010
 whom you could already see it 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.930
 spawn fire under us also he 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.120
 remembers such beautiful ones here 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.439
 just dynamite and also he has 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.060
 just cheating ability 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.190
 teleport us back and us 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.280
 Damash such as now as 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.049
 last 4 ability he will spawn his 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.750
 assistants who will be us too 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.430
 finish off the answer now sleep it 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.650
 helpers of such are the lights 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.500
 but actually since I 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.780
 was a diamond sword I managed with my 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.720
 enemies to your opponents look 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.930
 very quickly and so his life faltered 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.360
 the next sword shuddered from it yes 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.169
 guys who lets us 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.490
 feel real 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.770
 ghost racer what is he us 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.990
 Well, first of all it adds speed 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.539
 there is as you can see I have become much faster 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.510
 as fast as it was mine 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:43.930
 the adversary before is also upon me 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.970
 superimposed absorption force 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.950
 resistance to damage and fire resistance then 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.590
 there is a fire and friske tria now 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.110
 these freaks houses zeros and I'll just kill them 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.850
 from one time yes guys actually 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.370
 oh such a sword what else to add to it ah 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.110
 yes when I hold it in my hands behind me 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.760
 particles spawn when I clean it 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.950
 particles disappear but strictly speaking 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.450
 as well as 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.370
 like the ghost rider himself let's 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.410
 check rather held such 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.090
 an interesting experiment with a sleepy yet 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.850
 one ghost rider first 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.830
 we will get his egg call by sending him back and 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.380
 see how many blows he will die and 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:22.160
 so first with one blow we endure 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:25.910
 the horse is one hit so it is from us just 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:29.390
 runs away so then second hit third 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.210
 punch and fourth punch yes guys this 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.700
 city â€‹â€‹this sword is much more powerful than any 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.940
 diamond sword i killed this boss 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.250
 literally 4s 4 beats guys but this isn 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.900
 not cool but actually a link to 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.730
 the command I will leave the description after 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.680
 how on this video clip there will be one 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.200
 Thousands of likes and I'm sure the mechanism is very 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.820
 cool it is typed very quickly on 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:54.490
 This is all the guys with you I was stapled 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.490
 We like all good luck to everyone bye
