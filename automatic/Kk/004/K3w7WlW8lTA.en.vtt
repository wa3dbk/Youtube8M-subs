00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
both campuses we've had this part number

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.290 
both campuses we've had this part number
six<00:00:42.660> years<00:00:42.870> now<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.379> originally<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.820> program

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
six years now and originally the program

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.209 
six years now and originally the program
was<00:00:46.610> its<00:00:47.610> inception<00:00:48.149> was<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:49.219> either

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
was its inception was that either

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.689 
was its inception was that either
program<00:00:50.850> could<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.530> accomplished<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:53.100> aud

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
program could have accomplished the aud

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.689 
program could have accomplished the aud
program<00:00:54.739> independently<00:00:55.739> being<00:00:56.100> because<00:00:56.670> of

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
program independently being because of

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.049 
program independently being because of
faculty<00:00:57.480> issues<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.649> we<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.430> worked

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
more than they would get if they're just

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.890 
more than they would get if they're just
you<00:01:52.130> have<00:01:52.250> a<00:01:52.280> faculty<00:01:52.610> on<00:01:53.030> one<00:01:53.210> campus<00:01:53.450> or<00:01:53.810> the

you have a faculty on one campus or the

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.380 
you have a faculty on one campus or the
other<00:01:54.050> so<00:01:54.560> I<00:01:54.800> think<00:01:55.100> that<00:01:55.310> is<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.670> biggest

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
other so I think that is the biggest

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.020 
other so I think that is the biggest
benefit<00:01:59.710> we're<00:02:00.710> not<00:02:00.860> kind<00:02:01.100> of<00:02:01.190> amazed<00:02:01.610> about

but<00:02:20.900> they<00:02:21.080> have<00:02:21.260> really<00:02:22.220> turned<00:02:22.970> into<00:02:23.390> a

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
but they have really turned into a

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.220 
but they have really turned into a
one-class<00:02:24.950> IP<00:02:25.340> know<00:02:25.580> i<00:02:25.760> guess<00:02:25.970> like<00:02:26.020> we<00:02:27.020> have

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
one-class IP know i guess like we have

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.220 
one-class IP know i guess like we have
first<00:02:27.920> years<00:02:28.220> second<00:02:28.910> years<00:02:29.120> third<00:02:29.600> years<00:02:29.900> and

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
first years second years third years and

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.190 
first years second years third years and
four<00:02:30.530> years<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.280> they<00:02:31.790> seem<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.060> be<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.480> real

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
four years and they seem to be a real

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.420 
four years and they seem to be a real
cohesive<00:02:33.890> group<00:02:37.450> we<00:02:38.450> have<00:02:38.600> almost<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:39.470> think

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
cohesive group we have almost I think

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.830 
cohesive group we have almost I think
it's<00:02:40.580> almost<00:02:40.910> very<00:02:41.270> close<00:02:41.540> to<00:02:41.720> one<00:02:41.810> hundred

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
it's almost very close to one hundred

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.310 
it's almost very close to one hundred
percent<00:02:42.050> job<00:02:42.590> placement<00:02:43.220> rate<00:02:43.910> both<00:02:44.660> camp<00:02:44.959> for

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
percent job placement rate both camp for

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.800 
percent job placement rate both camp for
both<00:02:45.470> campuses<00:02:46.090> within<00:02:47.090> three<00:02:47.480> months<00:02:47.630> of

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
both campuses within three months of

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.910 
both campuses within three months of
graduation<00:02:48.350> so<00:02:49.150> we<00:02:50.150> have<00:02:50.360> many<00:02:50.800> students<00:02:51.800> that

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
graduation so we have many students that

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.440 
graduation so we have many students that
I've<00:02:52.040> graduated<00:02:52.160> I<00:02:52.580> think<00:02:52.820> this<00:02:53.000> year<00:02:53.420> is

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450
