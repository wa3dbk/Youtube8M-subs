warfare<00:00:42.120> 3<00:00:42.329> videos<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.579> they<00:00:44.579> planned<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.940> for

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
warfare 3 videos and they planned it for

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.560

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
maps so it's not that big of an issue

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.290 
maps so it's not that big of an issue

with specialist and this class is just
absolutely<00:01:16.200> amazing<00:01:16.530> radius<00:01:17.159> would<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.369> use

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
absolutely amazing radius would you use

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.920 
absolutely amazing radius would you use
the<00:01:18.750> PP<00:01:19.200> 90<00:01:19.560> with<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.580> silencer<00:01:21.270> all<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.689> doesn't

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the PP 90 with a silencer all it doesn't

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.999 
the PP 90 with a silencer all it doesn't
really<00:01:22.020> matter<00:01:22.170> what<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.500> use<00:01:22.590> AI<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
really matter what you use AI like the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.200 
really matter what you use AI like the
silencer<00:01:23.460> excited<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.939> flank<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:25.380> use

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
silencer excited like the flank you use

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.359 
silencer excited like the flank you use
whatever<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.479> like<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.320> rain<00:01:28.500> proficiency<00:01:29.159> but

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
whatever I like the rain proficiency but

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.310 
whatever I like the rain proficiency but
it<00:01:29.520> really<00:01:29.780> depends<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:30.960> what<00:01:31.140> you're

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
it really depends on what you're

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.679 
it really depends on what you're
planning<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:31.979> doing<00:01:32.040> if<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.549> really<00:01:32.880> plan<00:01:33.540> on

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
planning on doing if you really plan on

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.030 
planning on doing if you really plan on
being<00:01:33.900> really<00:01:34.140> up<00:01:34.229> close<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.710> if<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> maps

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
being really up close so if the maps

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.899 
being really up close so if the maps
really<00:01:35.400> close<00:01:35.579> quarters<00:01:36.020> then<00:01:37.020> use<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.909> focus

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
really close quarters then use the focus

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.319 
really close quarters then use the focus
proficiency<00:01:39.509> because<00:01:39.840> with<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.799> could

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
proficiency because with that you could

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.830 
proficiency because with that you could
go<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:43.340> get<00:01:44.340> hit<00:01:44.610> many<00:01:45.119> times<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.659> not<00:01:45.720> have

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
go and get hit many times and not have

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.090 
go and get hit many times and not have
to<00:01:45.899> worry<00:01:45.930> about<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.380> bullet<00:01:46.710> flick<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
to worry about the bullet flick the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.760 
to worry about the bullet flick the
flinch<00:01:47.399> from<00:01:47.490> getting<00:01:47.850> hit<00:01:48.060> mess<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.810> up<00:01:48.840> but

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
because the sound is really good in this

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.720 
because the sound is really good in this
game<00:04:02.560> then<00:04:03.560> after<00:04:03.830> two<00:04:04.040> more<00:04:04.190> kills<00:04:04.430> I<00:04:04.610> have

every<00:04:05.090> single<00:04:05.269> perk<00:04:05.600> in<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:05.840> game<00:04:06.019> and<00:04:06.260> that's

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
every single perk in the game and that's

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.170 
every single perk in the game and that's
just<00:04:06.980> like<00:04:07.220> playing<00:04:07.430> zombies<00:04:07.850> with<00:04:08.000> every

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
just like playing zombies with every

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.820 
just like playing zombies with every
perk<00:04:08.390> you're<00:04:08.600> just<00:04:08.810> an<00:04:08.989> animal<00:04:09.260> you<00:04:09.470> destroy

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
perk you're just an animal you destroy

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.340 
perk you're just an animal you destroy
everyone<00:04:10.190> and<00:04:10.519> it's<00:04:11.420> really<00:04:11.600> easy<00:04:11.720> to<00:04:11.989> do<00:04:12.140> good

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.990 
using this for like a day or two so i
highly<00:05:02.529> suggest<00:05:02.710> that<00:05:03.250> i<00:05:03.310> was<00:05:03.759> kind<00:05:03.939> of

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
highly suggest that i was kind of

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.170 
highly suggest that i was kind of
skeptical<00:05:04.360> but<00:05:05.259> it<00:05:06.039> does<00:05:06.430> really<00:05:06.699> work<00:05:06.879> it's

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
skeptical but it does really work it's

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.990 
skeptical but it does really work it's
really<00:05:07.539> good<00:05:07.750> and<00:05:08.099> right<00:05:09.099> here<00:05:09.310> I<00:05:09.340> make<00:05:09.879> this

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
really good and right here I make this

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.570 
really good and right here I make this
guy<00:05:10.180> rage<00:05:10.419> quit<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:10.960> I<00:05:11.259> lag<00:05:11.650> out<00:05:11.860> of<00:05:11.949> xbox<00:05:12.310> live

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
guy rage quit and I lag out of xbox live

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.309 
guy rage quit and I lag out of xbox live
so<00:05:12.909> I<00:05:12.939> think<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.330> final<00:05:13.509> score<00:05:13.750> i<00:05:13.960> mean<00:05:14.169> this

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:14.319 
so I think the final score i mean this

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.769 
so I think the final score i mean this
game<00:05:14.529> was<00:05:14.770> at<00:05:15.669> this<00:05:15.849> point<00:05:16.150> it<00:05:16.300> was<00:05:16.389> like<00:05:16.569> 20
