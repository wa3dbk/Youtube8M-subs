00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
people usually get themselves in a

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.660 
people usually get themselves in a
situation<00:01:42.869> where<00:01:43.500> they<00:01:43.619> cut<00:01:43.890> too<00:01:44.130> hard<00:01:44.430> and

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
situation where they cut too hard and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.210 
situation where they cut too hard and
where<00:01:45.090> they<00:01:45.240> burn<00:01:45.540> all<00:01:45.810> kinds<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.409> harder

where they burn all kinds of that harder

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.340 
where they burn all kinds of that harder
muscle<00:01:47.700> mass<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:47.909> they<00:01:48.509> do<00:01:48.570> two<00:01:49.020> things

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
muscle mass so they do two things

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.980 
muscle mass so they do two things
generally<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.820> first<00:01:51.149> thing<00:01:51.390> they<00:01:51.570> do<00:01:51.630> is

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
generally the first thing they do is

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.700 
generally the first thing they do is
they<00:01:52.500> set<00:01:52.799> themselves<00:01:53.009> an<00:01:53.540> unreasonable

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
they set themselves an unreasonable

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.469 
they set themselves an unreasonable
expectation<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.829> how<00:01:55.920> quickly<00:01:56.909> they're<00:01:57.270> going

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
expectation of how quickly they're going

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.209 
expectation of how quickly they're going
to<00:01:57.570> burn<00:01:57.689> body<00:01:57.990> fat<00:01:58.110> well<00:01:58.680> how<00:01:58.890> quickly

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
to burn body fat well how quickly

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.830 
to burn body fat well how quickly
they're<00:01:59.490> going<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.759> lose<00:01:59.880> weight<00:02:00.210> or<00:02:00.390> how

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
they're going to lose weight or how

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.209 
they're going to lose weight or how
quickly<00:02:01.200> they're<00:02:01.500> going<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.770> get<00:02:01.920> shredded

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
quickly they're going to get shredded

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.370 
quickly they're going to get shredded
that's<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.030> first<00:02:03.299> thing<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.600> do<00:02:03.659> they<00:02:03.960> start

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
that's the first thing I do they start

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.889 
that's the first thing I do they start
with<00:02:05.130> an<00:02:05.250> unreasonable<00:02:06.149> goal<00:02:06.450> or<00:02:06.689> an<00:02:06.810> i

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
with an unreasonable goal or an i

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.450 
with an unreasonable goal or an i
recently<00:02:07.380> reasonable<00:02:08.190> expectation<00:02:09.090> then

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
recently reasonable expectation then

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.610 
recently reasonable expectation then
the<00:02:10.550> direct<00:02:11.090> flow<00:02:11.420> on<00:02:11.600> effect<00:02:12.020> from<00:02:12.200> that<00:02:12.440> is

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
the direct flow on effect from that is

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.030 
the direct flow on effect from that is
they<00:02:13.070> diet<00:02:13.520> way<00:02:14.360> too<00:02:14.420> hard<00:02:15.200> because<00:02:15.620> they're

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
they diet way too hard because they're

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.940 
they diet way too hard because they're
trying<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.550> achieve<00:02:16.820> this<00:02:17.810> unreasonable<00:02:18.350> goal

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
trying to achieve this unreasonable goal

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.250 
trying to achieve this unreasonable goal
so<00:02:19.610> they<00:02:19.760> go<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.120> they<00:02:20.180> cut<00:02:20.510> their<00:02:20.720> calories

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
so they go and they cut their calories

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.890 
so they go and they cut their calories
to<00:02:21.770> a<00:02:21.800> ridiculous<00:02:22.670> amount<00:02:22.820> to<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.600> point

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
to a ridiculous amount to the point

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.840 
to a ridiculous amount to the point
where<00:02:24.080> their<00:02:24.230> body<00:02:24.470> is<00:02:24.680> screaming<00:02:25.070> out<00:02:25.580> to

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
where their body is screaming out to

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.550 
where their body is screaming out to
them<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.210> the<00:02:26.810> only<00:02:26.960> thing<00:02:27.050> that's<00:02:27.350> going<00:02:27.470> to

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
them and the only thing that's going to

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.890 
them and the only thing that's going to
do<00:02:27.770> is<00:02:28.040> burn<00:02:28.580> muscle<00:02:28.910> mass<00:02:29.300> for<00:02:29.570> energy

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
do is burn muscle mass for energy

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.210 
do is burn muscle mass for energy
because<00:02:30.170> they're<00:02:30.290> not<00:02:30.410> giving<00:02:30.740> it<00:02:30.950> anything

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
because they're not giving it anything

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.360 
because they're not giving it anything
else<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.700> burn<00:02:31.880> for<00:02:32.120> energy<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:32.990> guys<00:02:33.260> Rob<00:02:33.830> Rob

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
else to burn for energy so guys Rob Rob

else to burn for energy so guys Rob Rob
in<00:02:34.520> particular<00:02:34.850> who<00:02:35.450> sent<00:02:35.720> this<00:02:35.750> question<00:02:36.260> in

in particular who sent this question in

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.180 
in particular who sent this question in
the<00:02:37.130> best<00:02:37.490> way<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:38.480> cut<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.140> maintain<00:02:39.920> muscle

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
the best way to cut and maintain muscle

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.240 
the best way to cut and maintain muscle
mass<00:02:40.550> is<00:02:40.760> real<00:02:41.450> simple<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.560> first<00:02:42.920> thing<00:02:43.130> you

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
mass is real simple the first thing you

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.600 
mass is real simple the first thing you
got<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.430> do<00:02:43.700> set<00:02:44.570> yourself<00:02:45.110> a<00:02:45.370> reasonable<00:02:46.370> goal

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
got to do set yourself a reasonable goal

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.420 
got to do set yourself a reasonable goal
a<00:02:46.850> reasonable<00:02:47.540> expectation<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.740> look<00:02:49.160> I<00:02:49.280> can

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
a reasonable expectation and look I can

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.190 
a reasonable expectation and look I can
give<00:02:49.580> you<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.850> rule<00:02:50.060> of<00:02:50.240> thumb<00:02:50.450> it<00:02:50.690> is<00:02:51.020> going

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
give you the rule of thumb it is going

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.530 
give you the rule of thumb it is going
to<00:02:51.290> depend<00:02:51.470> on<00:02:51.950> how<00:02:52.010> much<00:02:52.490> you<00:02:52.730> weigh<00:02:52.940> whether

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
to depend on how much you weigh whether

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.420 
to depend on how much you weigh whether
you're<00:02:53.780> male<00:02:54.050> or<00:02:54.080> female<00:02:54.770> those<00:02:55.040> sort<00:02:55.340> of

you're male or female those sort of

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.370 
you're male or female those sort of
things<00:02:55.640> how<00:02:55.850> hard<00:02:56.090> your<00:02:56.300> training<00:02:56.780> what<00:02:57.230> your

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
things how hard your training what your

things how hard your training what your
weight<00:02:57.590> is<00:02:57.800> that<00:02:58.010> obviously<00:02:58.330> but<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.480> rule<00:02:59.750> of

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
weight is that obviously but the rule of

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.720 
weight is that obviously but the rule of
thumb<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.410> what<00:03:00.530> we<00:03:00.650> use<00:03:00.890> for<00:03:00.920> our<00:03:01.160> athletes

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
that reasonable expectation get yourself

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.540 
that reasonable expectation get yourself
in<00:03:41.270> a<00:03:41.360> calorie<00:03:41.750> deficit<00:03:42.440> that<00:03:42.920> isn't<00:03:43.310> too
