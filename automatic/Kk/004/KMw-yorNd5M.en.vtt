the<00:00:44.100> tiny<00:00:44.340> tiny<00:00:44.579> pc<00:00:45.180> board<00:00:45.420> it's<00:00:45.840> located

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
the tiny tiny pc board it's located

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.190 
the tiny tiny pc board it's located
right<00:00:46.739> about<00:00:47.579> here<00:00:48.000> inside<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.870> there's<00:00:49.020> just

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
right about here inside and there's just

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.880 
right about here inside and there's just
a<00:00:49.289> blob<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.950> some<00:00:50.579> resistors<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.289> stuck<00:00:52.710> my

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
a blob and some resistors so I stuck my

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.000 
a blob and some resistors so I stuck my
fingers<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.340> there<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.610> found<00:00:54.230> a<00:00:55.230> pitch<00:00:55.739> Bend

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
fingers on there and found a pitch Bend

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.790 
fingers on there and found a pitch Bend
and<00:00:56.520> that's<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.870> wired<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.440> up<00:00:58.649> and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
and that's it so I wired that up and

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.970 
and that's it so I wired that up and
there<00:00:59.789> are<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.480> body<00:01:00.750> contest<00:01:01.379> right<00:01:01.680> there

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
there are the body contest right there

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.500 
there are the body contest right there
and<00:01:02.510> if<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.660> turn<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.350> console<00:01:05.240> if<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.330> hear

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
and if I turn on the console if you hear

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.460 
and if I turn on the console if you hear
that<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.170> some<00:01:07.409> lovin<00:01:07.799> right<00:01:09.049> we<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.350> get

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
that so I some lovin right we can get

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.510 
that so I some lovin right we can get
the<00:01:10.770> body<00:01:11.640> contacts<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.979> get<00:01:14.189> some<00:01:14.340> noise

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
the body contacts and get some noise

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:32.420 
the body contacts and get some noise
gone

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.609 

of<00:01:33.430> course<00:01:33.670> it<00:01:33.790> also<00:01:33.909> affects<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:35.259> default

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
of course it also affects the default

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.210 
of course it also affects the default
sounds<00:01:36.009> I'll<00:01:36.390> get<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.509> snare<00:01:37.720> going<00:01:38.080> can<00:01:38.950> trap

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
sounds I'll get the snare going can trap

00:01:39.220 --> 00:02:00.350 
sounds I'll get the snare going can trap
it<00:01:42.090> prolong<00:01:43.090> it<00:01:43.439> try<00:01:44.439> the<00:01:44.500> symbol<00:01:46.649> hard<00:01:56.670> home

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.440 

yeah<00:02:02.190> not<00:02:03.190> very<00:02:03.369> exciting<00:02:03.610> but<00:02:04.049> what<00:02:05.049> I<00:02:06.360> when<00:02:07.360> I

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
yeah not very exciting but what I when I

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.010 
yeah not very exciting but what I when I
score<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.810> noisemaker

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.050 

ah
