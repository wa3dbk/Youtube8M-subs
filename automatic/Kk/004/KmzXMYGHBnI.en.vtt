from<00:01:53.799> A<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.009> Z<00:01:54.189> I<00:01:54.399> did<00:01:54.670> everything

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.900 

it<00:02:10.950> basically<00:02:11.490> took<00:02:11.790> me<00:02:12.030> about<00:02:13.070> maybe<00:02:14.070> 10.5

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
more just to be safe but my first time

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:30.080 
more just to be safe but my first time
doing<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:20.630> would<00:02:21.630> come<00:02:21.870> out<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:24.270> Rings<00:02:29.090> second

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
I even got a little creative right here

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.850 
I even got a little creative right here
on<00:03:06.160> this<00:03:06.310> side<00:03:06.720> this<00:03:07.720> was<00:03:07.930> actually<00:03:08.110> done<00:03:08.530> the

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
on this side this was actually done the

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.699 
on this side this was actually done the
whole<00:03:09.040> cars<00:03:09.280> flat<00:03:09.549> black<00:03:09.819> and<00:03:10.390> this<00:03:11.379> was<00:03:11.590> done

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
whole cars flat black and this was done

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.710 
whole cars flat black and this was done
with<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.010> colossal<00:03:12.400> fire<00:03:12.549> is<00:03:13.150> basically<00:03:13.599> just

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
with the colossal fire is basically just

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.380 
with the colossal fire is basically just
tape<00:03:14.049> off<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:15.220> parts<00:03:15.519> you<00:03:15.610> want<00:03:15.700> to<00:03:15.849> paint<00:03:16.060> and

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
tape off the parts you want to paint and

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.720 
tape off the parts you want to paint and
then<00:03:17.349> you've<00:03:17.500> been<00:03:17.680> over<00:03:17.980> it<00:03:18.069> and<00:03:18.340> you<00:03:18.519> take<00:03:18.670> it

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
then you've been over it and you take it

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.250 
then you've been over it and you take it
off<00:03:18.940> you<00:03:19.590> have<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.769> be<00:03:20.890> careful<00:03:21.220> with<00:03:21.340> that<00:03:21.370> so

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
off you have to be careful with that so

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.750 

you<00:03:39.750> just<00:03:39.930> have<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.200> be<00:03:40.409> careful<00:03:40.590> but<00:03:41.459> for<00:03:41.640> my

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
you just have to be careful but for my

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.100 
you just have to be careful but for my
