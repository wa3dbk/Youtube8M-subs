00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
blues lick but it's kind of more of a

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.100 
blues lick but it's kind of more of a
hardrock<00:00:18.529> side<00:00:18.860> of<00:00:18.980> a<00:00:19.070> blues<00:00:19.400> thing<00:00:19.730> and<00:00:20.450> I

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
want to show you how you can use this

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.999 
want to show you how you can use this
one<00:00:23.840> Lincoln<00:00:24.230> a<00:00:24.259> couple<00:00:24.710> of<00:00:24.800> different

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009 
one Lincoln a couple of different

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.580 
one Lincoln a couple of different
positions<00:00:25.599> so<00:00:26.919> the<00:00:27.919> lick<00:00:28.130> actually<00:00:28.669> is<00:00:29.480> a<00:00:29.590> this

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
positions so the lick actually is a this

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:40.690 
positions so the lick actually is a this
and<00:00:30.950> I'm<00:00:31.099> gonna<00:00:31.219> show<00:00:31.369> you<00:00:31.399> real<00:00:31.640> slow<00:00:39.700> so

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
and I'm gonna show you real slow so

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.250 
and I'm gonna show you real slow so
basically<00:00:41.060> I'm<00:00:41.210> going<00:00:41.420> up<00:00:41.570> my<00:00:41.690> blues<00:00:41.960> scale

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
basically I'm going up my blues scale

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.220 
basically I'm going up my blues scale
and<00:00:42.550> this<00:00:43.550> is<00:00:43.700> probably<00:00:44.450> the<00:00:44.870> pattern<00:00:45.170> you

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
and this is probably the pattern you

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
and this is probably the pattern you
know<00:00:45.350> already<00:00:48.040> so<00:00:49.040> I'm<00:00:49.130> going<00:00:49.430> to<00:00:51.010> flat<00:00:52.010> five

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
know already so I'm going to flat five

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.400 
know already so I'm going to flat five
over<00:00:52.520> here

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.549 

in<00:00:58.950> my<00:00:59.100> flat<00:00:59.340> seven<00:01:00.500> back<00:01:01.500> down<00:01:01.790> so<00:01:03.559> what's

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
in my flat seven back down so what's

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.230 
in my flat seven back down so what's
cool<00:01:04.860> about<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.400> creates<00:01:05.909> an<00:01:06.120> odd

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
cool about it is it creates an odd

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.730 
cool about it is it creates an odd
grouping<00:01:06.780> timing-wise

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
grouping timing-wise

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:19.520 
grouping timing-wise
so<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> way<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.580> counted<00:01:09.120> is<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:18.350> okay

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
so the way you counted is this okay

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.400 
so the way you counted is this okay
and<00:01:20.360> you<00:01:21.360> can<00:01:21.509> do<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.660> a<00:01:21.810> couple<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.320> different

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
and you can do it a couple of different

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.290 
and you can do it a couple of different
positions<00:01:22.979> also<00:01:23.190> so<00:01:23.610> I'm<00:01:23.759> just<00:01:24.000> going<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.210> go

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
positions also so I'm just going to go

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.340 
positions also so I'm just going to go
up<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.630> octave<00:01:26.509> but<00:01:27.509> instead<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.869> going<00:01:28.200> up

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
up the octave but instead of going up

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:42.830 
up the octave but instead of going up
here<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:33.500> so<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.590> link<00:01:34.770> becomes<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:41.840> can

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
here and so the link becomes this can

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.359 
here and so the link becomes this can
also<00:01:42.960> move<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.350> up<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.500> another<00:01:43.890> familiar

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
also move it up to another familiar

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.930 
also move it up to another familiar
position<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.940> the<00:01:45.030> twelfth<00:01:45.330> fret<00:01:45.710> and<00:01:46.940> it

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
position on the twelfth fret and it

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:56.180 
position on the twelfth fret and it
would<00:01:48.060> look<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:54.860> then<00:01:55.860> if<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.039> go

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
would look like this and then if you go

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:07.479 
would look like this and then if you go
up<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.490> octave<00:01:56.640> from<00:01:56.910> there<00:01:58.850> you<00:01:59.850> get<00:02:00.030> this

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:09.859 

okay<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:08.970> I'm<00:02:09.030> gonna<00:02:09.119> break<00:02:09.299> this<00:02:09.479> Lake<00:02:09.690> down

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
okay so I'm gonna break this Lake down

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.479 
okay so I'm gonna break this Lake down
and<00:02:10.229> show<00:02:10.769> how<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.979> pick<00:02:11.190> it

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
and show how to pick it

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.569 
and show how to pick it
so<00:02:11.880> I'm<00:02:12.420> actually<00:02:12.900> sometimes<00:02:13.519> I'll<00:02:14.519> use

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
so I'm actually sometimes I'll use

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.270 
so I'm actually sometimes I'll use
hammer-ons<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.299> pull-offs<00:02:15.390> in<00:02:15.810> different

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
hammer-ons and pull-offs in different

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.199 
hammer-ons and pull-offs in different
positions<00:02:17.280> or<00:02:17.489> different<00:02:17.850> with<00:02:17.940> different

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
positions or different with different

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.699 
positions or different with different
fingers<00:02:18.360> for<00:02:18.720> whatever<00:02:18.930> feels<00:02:19.230> good<00:02:19.350> for<00:02:19.620> the

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
fingers for whatever feels good for the

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.910 
fingers for whatever feels good for the
lick<00:02:19.890> but<00:02:20.549> I'm<00:02:21.060> going<00:02:21.269> to<00:02:21.299> show<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.769> one<00:02:22.769> way

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
lick but I'm going to show you one way

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:32.520 
lick but I'm going to show you one way
of<00:02:23.010> doing<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.280> here

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.060 

so<00:02:33.530> what<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:33.680> usually<00:02:33.740> do<00:02:34.220> is<00:02:34.490> pick<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:36.830> first

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
so what I usually do is pick the first

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:46.800 
so what I usually do is pick the first
couple<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.430> notes<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:39.680> then<00:02:39.800> do<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:39.950> pull<00:02:40.220> off

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.720 

and<00:02:47.810> in<00:02:48.230> this<00:02:48.320> case<00:02:48.560> I'm<00:02:48.860> gonna<00:02:49.190> pull<00:02:49.370> off<00:02:49.520> from

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
and in this case I'm gonna pull off from

00:02:49.730 --> 00:03:01.270 
and in this case I'm gonna pull off from
the<00:02:49.850> flat<00:02:50.060> 5<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.570> 4<00:02:50.810> 5<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.030> flat<00:02:56.240> 5<00:03:00.280> and

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
the flat 5 to the 4 5 to the flat 5 and

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.670 
the flat 5 to the 4 5 to the flat 5 and
then<00:03:01.459> from<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.670> flat<00:03:01.910> 5<00:03:02.120> is<00:03:02.270> for<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:03.880> okay<00:03:05.680> so

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
then from the flat 5 is for it okay so

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.140 
then from the flat 5 is for it okay so
now<00:03:07.100> when<00:03:07.310> you<00:03:07.370> move<00:03:07.550> it<00:03:07.670> up<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.970> next

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
now when you move it up to the next

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:16.570 
now when you move it up to the next
position<00:03:13.750> look<00:03:14.750> like<00:03:14.930> this<00:03:15.170> I<00:03:15.440> move<00:03:16.370> it<00:03:16.459> up

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
position look like this I move it up

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.520 
position look like this I move it up
here<00:03:16.610> and<00:03:17.000> look<00:03:17.270> the<00:03:17.450> same<00:03:17.660> as<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:18.170> did<00:03:18.350> on<00:03:18.410> the

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
here and look the same as it did on the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:25.990 
here and look the same as it did on the
sixth<00:03:18.860> string<00:03:19.010> basic<00:03:24.580> and<00:03:25.580> then<00:03:25.790> when<00:03:25.910> you

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
sixth string basic and then when you

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.410 
sixth string basic and then when you
move<00:03:26.090> up<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.270> the<00:03:26.450> last<00:03:26.660> position<00:03:28.090> here<00:03:29.090> which

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
move up to the last position here which

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.330 
move up to the last position here which
is<00:03:29.600> one<00:03:29.750> of<00:03:29.840> my<00:03:29.959> favorite<00:03:30.290> positions<00:03:30.770> actually

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
is one of my favorite positions actually

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.740 
is one of my favorite positions actually
to<00:03:31.760> play<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.810> blues<00:03:33.050> scale<00:03:33.200> in<00:03:34.420> it<00:03:35.420> looks<00:03:35.630> like

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
to play the blues scale in it looks like
