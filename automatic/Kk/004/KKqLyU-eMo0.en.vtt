00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.410 

hi<00:00:10.260> today<00:00:10.740> we're<00:00:10.920> in<00:00:11.010> clean<00:00:11.610> health<00:00:11.850> in<00:00:12.059> Sydney

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
hi today we're in clean health in Sydney

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.480 
hi today we're in clean health in Sydney
Australia<00:00:13.020> I'm<00:00:13.230> going<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.010> talk<00:00:14.160> about<00:00:14.309> the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
Australia I'm going to talk about the

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.290 
Australia I'm going to talk about the
extended<00:00:14.790> sets<00:00:15.770> in<00:00:16.770> women<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.460> men<00:00:17.520> we<00:00:18.030> try<00:00:18.240> to

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
extended sets in women and men we try to

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.240 
extended sets in women and men we try to
improve<00:00:18.539> with<00:00:18.780> chin<00:00:18.960> ups<00:00:19.110> one<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.590> best

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
improve with chin ups one of the best

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.520 
improve with chin ups one of the best
ways<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.640> do<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.570> do<00:00:21.660> an<00:00:21.780> extended<00:00:22.170> set

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.530 
ways to do that is to do an extended set

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.679 
ways to do that is to do an extended set
so<00:00:22.740> what<00:00:22.860> we<00:00:23.009> do<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.250> we<00:00:23.369> take<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:24.029> grip<00:00:24.330> will

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
so what we do is we take the grip will

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.019 
so what we do is we take the grip will
release<00:00:25.289> mechanical<00:00:25.980> advantage<00:00:26.339> which<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.000> a

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
release mechanical advantage which is a

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.300 
release mechanical advantage which is a
white<00:00:27.300> grip<00:00:27.509> pull<00:00:27.720> up<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.710> get<00:00:28.830> as<00:00:28.920> many<00:00:29.070> clock

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
white grip pull up you get as many clock

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.450 
white grip pull up you get as many clock
reps<00:00:29.699> as<00:00:29.849> possible<00:00:30.269> arrest<00:00:30.869> on<00:00:31.619> 10<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.130> 15

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
reps as possible arrest on 10 to 15

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.420 
reps as possible arrest on 10 to 15
seconds<00:00:33.030> move<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.870> supinated<00:00:34.320> grip<00:00:34.620> do

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
seconds move on to a supinated grip do

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.640 
seconds move on to a supinated grip do
as<00:00:35.550> many<00:00:35.730> reps<00:00:35.970> as<00:00:36.090> possible<00:00:36.600> then<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.380> arrest

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
as many reps as possible then we arrest

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.800 
as many reps as possible then we arrest
under<00:00:37.860> 15<00:00:38.190> seconds<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.790> we<00:00:39.240> do<00:00:39.360> as<00:00:39.450> many<00:00:39.600> reps

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:39.810 
under 15 seconds and we do as many reps

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.870 
under 15 seconds and we do as many reps
as<00:00:39.900> possible<00:00:40.380> with<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.560> neutral<00:00:40.950> grip<00:00:41.130> so<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:41.880 
as possible with a neutral grip so the

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.090 
as possible with a neutral grip so the
total<00:00:42.090> number<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.420> reps<00:00:42.720> will<00:00:43.110> be<00:00:43.260> higher<00:00:43.470> or

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
total number of reps will be higher or

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.200 
total number of reps will be higher or
what<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.370> does<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.790> you<00:00:45.360> basically<00:00:46.140> use<00:00:46.680> a

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
what it does is that you basically use a

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.550 
what it does is that you basically use a
greater<00:00:48.210> mechanical<00:00:48.840> advantage<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.410> make

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
greater mechanical advantage to make

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.830 
greater mechanical advantage to make
your<00:00:49.710> lats<00:00:49.950> work<00:00:50.340> belonging<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.420> let's<00:00:51.660> look

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
your lats work belonging so let's look

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.210 
your lats work belonging so let's look
with<00:00:52.050> our<00:00:52.080> friend<00:00:52.830> Lauren<00:00:54.770> first<00:00:55.770> one<00:00:55.950> she

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
with our friend Lauren first one she

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.660 
with our friend Lauren first one she
will<00:00:56.370> do<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:57.240> the<00:00:57.360> magnet<00:00:57.720> pull-up

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.109 

one

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:14.139 

or

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.289 

and<00:01:15.149> stop<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.990> soon<00:01:16.259> here<00:01:17.100> your<00:01:17.909> chin<00:01:18.179> above

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
and stop so soon here your chin above

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.569 
and stop so soon here your chin above
the<00:01:18.539> bar<00:01:18.719> we<00:01:18.929> stopped<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.319> don't<00:01:19.499> want<00:01:19.679> garbage

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
the bar we stopped I don't want garbage

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.010 
the bar we stopped I don't want garbage
reps<00:01:20.850> garbage<00:01:21.299> reps<00:01:21.509> piece<00:01:21.719> of<00:01:21.840> garbage

she<00:01:43.690> means<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:44.080> partner

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
she means the partner

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:17.059 
one two three four five six seven eight
and<00:02:01.020> Wow

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.940 

what<00:02:17.519> we<00:02:17.670> notice<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.269> that<00:02:18.299> she's<00:02:18.870> done<00:02:19.079> a<00:02:19.379> very

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
what we notice is that she's done a very

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.089 
what we notice is that she's done a very
long<00:02:20.219> set<00:02:20.579> the<00:02:21.569> 15<00:02:21.989> seconds<00:02:22.469> engine<00:02:22.739> set<00:02:22.950> is

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
long set the 15 seconds engine set is

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.580 
long set the 15 seconds engine set is
just<00:02:23.370> long<00:02:23.549> enough<00:02:23.579> for<00:02:24.030> her<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:25.260> threshold

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
just long enough for her to a threshold

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.190 
just long enough for her to a threshold
more<00:02:25.889> units<00:02:26.340> but<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.939> allows<00:02:27.180> her<00:02:27.359> to<00:02:27.389> make<00:02:28.049> her

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
more units but it allows her to make her

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.739 
more units but it allows her to make her
last<00:02:28.499> much<00:02:29.489> longer<00:02:29.519> than<00:02:29.909> normal<00:02:30.060> then<00:02:30.450> if<00:02:30.599> she

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:30.749 
last much longer than normal then if she

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.259 
last much longer than normal then if she
just<00:02:30.930> did<00:02:31.170> one<00:02:31.650> function<00:02:32.189> up<00:02:32.310> thank<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.150> very

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
just did one function up thank you very

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:40.370 
just did one function up thank you very
much

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.440 

you
