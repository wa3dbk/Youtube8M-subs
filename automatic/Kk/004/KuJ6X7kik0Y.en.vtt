 and how the advertisers do not work today 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.550
 to the flair 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.220
 we have an old topic 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.310
 but a changed subject area was selected 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.260
 One of you can be a memorial 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.600

 Wittwer Bättig yes 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.239
 No, that's just it 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.239
 wanting to live out their homes outstanding 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.980
 and we want 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.010
 By chance, that would be important now 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.690
 in the end, states seem to be threes 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.550
 but probably not giving in 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.530
 No but not all understood is sounded alarm he has been criticizing since 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.550

 Constance via follow 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.650
 and all of FCS 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.540
 we both now with Lech Walesa beginning I had off »is that so always me 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.570
 Desperate who so I have allowed both here because I live myself 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.530
 started and it's all so boring and it's certainly already 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.220
 even 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.409
 the week or so 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.030
 but so I overload the collar Dr

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.600
 it is or at 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.320
 St I'm sleeping that's exactly what we need to do now but pass by the residents 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.510
 reported 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.880
 and 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.350
 we thought about it, we just make a channel because 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.869
 each one of us wanted Glen a bit and made Ammann think about it 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.749
 Simply all players have a Allez Les Cayes and shop also wanderlust 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.840
 And although the roads he was Waltrop shows what we have in ours

 JAL to pull 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.830
 looked bad 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.010
 Only then will it be so, but ultimately it was Ernst from Bielefeld 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.010
 but the bridge for the stuff Pokemon our Camaro salary times desire 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.069
 have it 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.830
 and us only my tennis if whole time continued then to comment 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:29.139
 But sometimes you just have a phase where you spend four weeks at the BAG 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.919
 think you just have to leave a little bit it would have 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.549

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.789
 been sacrificed 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:58.039
 St that's it's true September will play the opening game 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.179
 however, there is something else 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:05.009
 Bad Wildbad percent then gets out of the full 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:06.459

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.109
 in the case XMP well found to subscribe 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.189

 Dr right 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.180
 guess that almost every day will come to me, we have something safe 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:29.489

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.169
 What 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.109
 and then we can do that a bit 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.229
 to talk about other things 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:57.039

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:01.109
 he had ate the aso else from mw2 said that is still active or 

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:02.509
 the Briton 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:07.109
 until clarification the folk rock band Pieter Brueghel fashion into the 2 because I 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.609
 just around there 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.250
 What I'm not an ore or Cox again so was this June 

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:18.039
 the break from the game is good in front of the screens and the bohemian Prix group 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.569
 not with mixed smoke on 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:23.740
 that was not closed like that 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.720
 The Russians would have stated that I have this this Thale 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.550
 19 to 18 after me 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.659
 What do I not remember in the second matchday, the rector had weeks again 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:34.159

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:37.110
 in the year with the corner points the games like to play 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.150
 Berner newspaper 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.229

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:45.979
 in China as "open" 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.370
 so 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.420
 it's always fun in the 2 since I'm also around 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.090
 a no 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.490

 Lemgo 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.159
 in ORF one in the 2 Anytime more and more fun 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.080
 So I had a bit of Nuremberg and we're excited 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.059
 us everything possible at the 1 Landis was just more fun especially 

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:12.949
 because of those writing weapons or the Chevrolet 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.650
 and a possible downtown unhurt 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.780
 I do not know if you are 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.300
 The attacks Milan achieved but with Aachens defy next to Pepe also on the 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.670
 Wieden also grazing animals wild bridge of Brazil have to preppy 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.099

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:33.110
 RMB 2 percent it's such a thing I'm so sharing right now 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.639
 one of the hurrying alternates 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.639
 So draw the 4 with two and more short 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.479
 and plaque topgame currently one with the least 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:44.360
 Zurich 4 most 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.560
 mw2 too so sometimes but that also excites me sometimes even if i have to 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.560
 I'm honest, but where is it likely? 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.389
 has not been played for a long time and that we are not quite there yet 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.150
 brilliant team play would 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.610
 4 an investigator 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.050

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.919
 just like any opponent, Norbert Haug went down 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.039
 that the exchange rate Fr 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:17.499
 the markets the ZDF he comes again so 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:20.379
