to<00:01:54.360> wait<00:01:54.570> for<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.899> come<00:01:55.079> back<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.860> maybe

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
to wait for it to come back and maybe

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.350 
to wait for it to come back and maybe
they<00:01:56.340> did<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.520> little<00:01:56.729> tweak<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.240> could

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
they did a little tweak that you could

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.109 
they did a little tweak that you could
have<00:01:57.479> done<00:01:57.570> yourself<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:58.560> know<00:01:58.649> what<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.770> mean

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
have done yourself you know what I mean

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.120 
have done yourself you know what I mean
so<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.149> thought<00:02:00.540> let's<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:01.320> open<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.710> up<00:02:01.890> and

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
so I thought let's just open it up and

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.740 
so I thought let's just open it up and
follow<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.549> advice<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.880> some<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.390> my<00:02:03.509> viewers

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
follow the advice of some of my viewers

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.520 
follow the advice of some of my viewers
actually<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.579> see<00:02:05.579> if<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.969> can't<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:07.320> pull

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
actually and see if I can't just pull

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.550 
actually and see if I can't just pull
that<00:02:07.560> spring<00:02:08.190> out<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.610> little<00:02:08.879> bit

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
that spring out a little bit

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.830 
that spring out a little bit
I<00:02:09.649> showed<00:02:10.520> you<00:02:10.610> before<00:02:10.700> but<00:02:11.209> this<00:02:11.569> spring

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
I showed you before but this spring

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.050 
I showed you before but this spring
right<00:02:12.110> here<00:02:14.230> see<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:15.550> that<00:02:16.550> spring<00:02:16.790> right

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
right here see that that spring right

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.720 
right here see that that spring right
there<00:02:17.739> basically<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.860> problem<00:02:19.130> was<00:02:19.430> the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
there basically the problem was the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.350 
there basically the problem was the
shock<00:02:19.970> had<00:02:20.300> caused<00:02:20.599> that<00:02:20.810> spring<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:22.360> push

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
shock had caused that spring to push

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.390 
shock had caused that spring to push
down<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:23.599> little<00:02:23.840> too<00:02:24.080> far<00:02:24.319> and<00:02:24.650> sort<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.130> stay

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
down a little too far and sort of stay

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.030 
down a little too far and sort of stay
down<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.700> little<00:02:26.030> too<00:02:26.150> far<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:27.500> what<00:02:27.620> my<00:02:27.709> viewers

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
down a little too far so what my viewers

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.710 
down a little too far so what my viewers
said<00:02:28.310> well<00:02:28.670> why<00:02:28.790> don't<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.000> just<00:02:29.150> get<00:02:29.300> a<00:02:29.360> pair

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
said well why don't you just get a pair

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.420 
said well why don't you just get a pair
of<00:02:29.750> pliers<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.140> pull<00:02:30.530> that<00:02:30.680> out<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.920> little<00:02:31.190> bit

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
of pliers and pull that out a little bit

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.280 
of pliers and pull that out a little bit
that<00:02:31.640> should<00:02:32.180> fix<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.569> problem<00:02:32.599> and<00:02:33.140> I<00:02:33.230> was

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
that should fix the problem and I was

that didn't quite do it so I pulled it
out<00:02:49.519> a<00:02:49.580> little<00:02:49.670> bit<00:02:49.819> more<00:02:50.170> then<00:02:51.170> till<00:02:51.380> it<00:02:51.470> got

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
out a little bit more then till it got

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.229 
out a little bit more then till it got
to<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:51.860> point<00:02:52.069> where<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:52.610> was<00:02:52.760> fine

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
to the point where it was fine

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.710 
to the point where it was fine
and<00:02:53.840> now<00:02:54.049> here<00:02:54.319> we<00:02:54.440> are<00:02:54.700> with<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:56.060> stream<00:02:56.569> light

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
and now here we are with a stream light

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.140 
and now here we are with a stream light
poly<00:02:56.959> tack<00:02:57.200> that<00:02:57.230> works<00:02:57.620> as<00:02:57.799> good<00:02:57.920> as<00:02:58.069> new

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.740 

and<00:03:02.150> that's<00:03:02.330> all<00:03:02.510> it<00:03:02.599> took<00:03:03.430> so<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:05.420> light<00:03:05.599> is

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
and that's all it took so the light is

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.900 
and that's all it took so the light is
not<00:03:05.870> dead<00:03:06.170> for<00:03:06.380> good<00:03:06.530> it's<00:03:07.280> just<00:03:07.640> fine

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
not dead for good it's just fine

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:08.500 
not dead for good it's just fine
actually

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
actually

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.220 
actually
I<00:03:08.690> do<00:03:09.650> not<00:03:10.010> intend<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.670> mount<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.330> again<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:12.080> my

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
decision is made this light is no good

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.410 
decision is made this light is no good

you<00:04:24.990> gonna<00:04:25.080> do<00:04:25.170> with<00:04:25.290> it

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
you gonna do with it

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.300

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
well what I'm probably gonna do you

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.500 
well what I'm probably gonna do you
might<00:04:29.460> think<00:04:29.700> will<00:04:29.880> you<00:04:30.000> mount<00:04:30.180> this<00:04:30.270> for<00:04:30.450> the

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
might think will you mount this for the

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.690 
might think will you mount this for the
10/22<00:04:30.930> I<00:04:31.320> thought<00:04:31.530> about<00:04:31.650> doing<00:04:31.770> that<00:04:32.130> but

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
10/22 I thought about doing that but

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.100 
10/22 I thought about doing that but
I'll<00:04:32.820> probably<00:04:32.970> do<00:04:33.150> is<00:04:33.240> take<00:04:33.420> this<00:04:33.570> amount<00:04:33.930> it

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
I'll probably do is take this amount it

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.380 
I'll probably do is take this amount it
to<00:04:34.230> the<00:04:34.350> 1022<00:04:34.980> I'll<00:04:35.610> probably<00:04:35.850> won't<00:04:36.090> I

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
to the 1022 I'll probably won't I

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.880 
to the 1022 I'll probably won't I
probably<00:04:36.780> will<00:04:37.020> not<00:04:37.230> put<00:04:37.530> this<00:04:37.650> on<00:04:37.800> the

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
probably will not put this on the

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.310 
probably will not put this on the
shotgun<00:04:38.300> probably<00:04:39.300> won't<00:04:39.480> even<00:04:40.020> though<00:04:40.170> it's
