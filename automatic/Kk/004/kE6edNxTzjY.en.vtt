war<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.530> was<00:01:16.649> really<00:01:16.859> into<00:01:17.039> that<00:01:17.069> game<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.939> only

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
war I was really into that game the only

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.249 
war I was really into that game the only
thing<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.359> was<00:01:18.450> awkward<00:01:18.630> was<00:01:18.990> when<00:01:19.140> you

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
thing that was awkward was when you

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.510 
thing that was awkward was when you
looked<00:01:19.469> down<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.829> your<00:01:19.979> shadow<00:01:20.189> when<00:01:20.399> you're

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
looked down and your shadow when you're

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.969 
looked down and your shadow when you're
sprinting<00:01:21.170> your<00:01:22.170> armors<00:01:22.560> would<00:01:22.740> dislocate

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
sprinting your armors would dislocate

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.499 
sprinting your armors would dislocate
from<00:01:23.280> your<00:01:23.399> body<00:01:23.609> so<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.179> kinda<00:01:24.420> awkward

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
from your body so it's kinda awkward

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.169 
from your body so it's kinda awkward
like<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.049> but<00:01:25.349> don't<00:01:26.099> worry<00:01:26.219> it's<00:01:26.729> cool<00:01:27.000> now

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
like that but don't worry it's cool now

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.270

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
and it looks pretty decent so we're

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.580
