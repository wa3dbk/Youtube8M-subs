less we get the center of the shoulders
in<00:00:18.279> any<00:00:18.640> way<00:00:19.180> from<00:00:19.660> here<00:00:20.109> near<00:00:20.830> the<00:00:21.010> center<00:00:21.609> or

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
in any way from here near the center or

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.339 
in any way from here near the center or
from<00:00:22.449> this<00:00:22.810> shoulder<00:00:23.320> line<00:00:24.179> okay<00:00:25.179> so<00:00:25.599> we<00:00:25.839> start

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
from this shoulder line okay so we start

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.310 
from this shoulder line okay so we start
our<00:00:26.619> sewing<00:00:26.890> with<00:00:27.640> the<00:00:27.820> needle<00:00:28.300> going<00:00:28.869> under

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
our sewing with the needle going under

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.310 
our sewing with the needle going under
the<00:00:29.589> seam<00:00:30.130> allowance<00:00:30.730> of<00:00:30.909> the<00:00:31.060> shoulder<00:00:31.630> then

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
the seam allowance of the shoulder then

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.610 
the seam allowance of the shoulder then
pass<00:00:32.950> this<00:00:33.310> again<00:00:33.820> on<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.150> other<00:00:34.300> side<00:00:34.720> of<00:00:35.290> the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
pass this again on the other side of the

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.970 
pass this again on the other side of the
shoulder<00:00:35.950> seam<00:00:36.579> allowance<00:00:37.530> making<00:00:38.530> sure<00:00:38.770> that

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
shoulder seam allowance making sure that

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.279 
shoulder seam allowance making sure that
the<00:00:39.219> thread<00:00:39.579> does<00:00:39.850> not<00:00:40.120> appear<00:00:40.629> on<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.079> right

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
the thread does not appear on the right

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:46.950 
the thread does not appear on the right
side<00:00:41.320> of<00:00:42.010> the<00:00:42.219> Laois<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:45.910> will<00:00:46.120> run<00:00:46.510> another

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
side of the Laois we will run another

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.619 
side of the Laois we will run another
stitch<00:00:47.469> so<00:00:47.859> that<00:00:48.070> this<00:00:48.280> will<00:00:48.579> be<00:00:48.760> more<00:00:49.000> secure

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
stitch so that this will be more secure

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.490 
stitch so that this will be more secure
and<00:00:49.929> then<00:00:50.559> run<00:00:51.039> a<00:00:51.070> stitch<00:00:51.579> this<00:00:51.969> way<00:00:52.500> crosswise

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
and then run a stitch this way crosswise

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.270 
and then run a stitch this way crosswise
and<00:00:53.980> from<00:00:54.760> here<00:00:55.390> we<00:00:55.870> will<00:00:56.079> form<00:00:56.440> a<00:00:56.620> loop<00:00:56.890> this

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
and from here we will form a loop this

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.020 
and from here we will form a loop this
way

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
way

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.020 
way
did<00:00:58.390> you<00:00:58.570> see<00:00:58.780> this<00:00:59.140> and<00:00:59.379> with<00:01:00.309> this<00:01:00.519> longer

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
did you see this and with this longer

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.989 
did you see this and with this longer
thread<00:01:01.600> we<00:01:01.960> will<00:01:01.989> draw<00:01:02.500> it<00:01:02.829> in<00:01:03.219> the<00:01:03.460> loop<00:01:03.670> this

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:03.999 
thread we will draw it in the loop this

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:07.050 
thread we will draw it in the loop this
way<00:01:04.300> and<00:01:04.629> pull<00:01:05.170> it<00:01:05.379> to<00:01:05.770> form<00:01:06.070> some<00:01:06.370> kind<00:01:06.670> of<00:01:06.880> a

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
way and pull it to form some kind of a

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.069 
way and pull it to form some kind of a
rope<00:01:07.330> not<00:01:07.360> just<00:01:08.200> keep<00:01:08.470> doing<00:01:08.950> this<00:01:09.250> until<00:01:10.079> we

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079 
rope not just keep doing this until we

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:13.679 
rope not just keep doing this until we
get<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.799> width<00:01:12.070> of<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.520> strap<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:12.939> a<00:01:13.299> little

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
get the width of the strap and a little

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.410 
get the width of the strap and a little
allowance<00:01:14.680> so<00:01:15.009> that<00:01:15.040> there's<00:01:15.610> some<00:01:15.909> kind<00:01:16.180> of

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
allowance so that there's some kind of

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.890 
allowance so that there's some kind of
easing<00:01:17.020> and<00:01:18.009> guess<00:01:18.460> this<00:01:18.759> is<00:01:19.000> enough<00:01:19.509> length

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
easing and guess this is enough length

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.969 
easing and guess this is enough length
for<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.590> bra<00:01:20.829> strap<00:01:21.310> around<00:01:21.899> 20<00:01:22.899> knots<00:01:23.290> or<00:01:23.710> 80

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
for the bra strap around 20 knots or 80

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.420 
for the bra strap around 20 knots or 80
knots<00:01:24.490> then<00:01:25.149> we<00:01:25.600> finalize<00:01:26.350> this<00:01:26.740> by<00:01:27.009> putting

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
knots then we finalize this by putting

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.420 
knots then we finalize this by putting
the<00:01:27.909> needle<00:01:28.390> inside<00:01:29.079> to<00:01:29.770> lock<00:01:30.009> the<00:01:30.460> nut<00:01:32.430> then

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
the needle inside to lock the nut then

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.990 
the needle inside to lock the nut then
we<00:01:33.670> get<00:01:33.909> this<00:01:34.390> automatic<00:01:35.170> button<00:01:35.469> and<00:01:36.009> attach

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
we get this automatic button and attach

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.180 
we get this automatic button and attach
it<00:01:37.299> on<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.630> bra<00:01:37.899> strap<00:01:38.320> holder

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.970 

we<00:01:46.190> run<00:01:46.430> around<00:01:46.700> for<00:01:47.420> stitches<00:01:48.170> for<00:01:48.650> just

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
we run around for stitches for just

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.670 
we run around for stitches for just
three<00:01:49.340> because<00:01:50.210> if<00:01:50.360> this<00:01:50.570> is<00:01:50.810> too<00:01:51.080> thick<00:01:51.410> we

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
three because if this is too thick we

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.480 
three because if this is too thick we
might<00:01:51.890> have<00:01:52.190> a<00:01:52.220> difficult<00:01:52.670> time<00:01:53.330> locking<00:01:53.900> the

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
might have a difficult time locking the

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.730 
might have a difficult time locking the
automatic<00:01:55.490> three<00:01:56.120> or<00:01:56.300> four<00:01:56.600> will<00:01:56.810> do<00:01:57.050> and<00:01:57.350> then

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
automatic three or four will do and then

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.270 
automatic three or four will do and then
again<00:01:58.340> on<00:01:58.670> this<00:01:59.210> side<00:01:59.570> of<00:01:59.840> the<00:02:00.080> bra<00:02:00.350> strap<00:02:00.830> we

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
again on this side of the bra strap we

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.960 
again on this side of the bra strap we
will<00:02:01.610> lock<00:02:02.000> our<00:02:02.330> stitches<00:02:03.020> or<00:02:03.710> threads<00:02:04.160> this

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
will lock our stitches or threads this

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.980 
will lock our stitches or threads this
way<00:02:06.340> more<00:02:07.340> or<00:02:07.460> less<00:02:07.610> this<00:02:07.850> is<00:02:07.910> also<00:02:08.330> how<00:02:08.929> you

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
way more or less this is also how you

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.800 
way more or less this is also how you
can<00:02:09.470> do<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:09.710> belt<00:02:10.070> holder<00:02:10.700> on<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.240> waistline

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
can do a belt holder on the waistline

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.940 
can do a belt holder on the waistline
then<00:02:12.410> you<00:02:12.590> cut<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.130> threads<00:02:13.460> off<00:02:14.230> okay<00:02:15.230> now

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
then you cut the threads off okay now

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.580 
then you cut the threads off okay now
you<00:02:16.010> have<00:02:16.220> your<00:02:16.640> bra<00:02:17.060> strap<00:02:17.480> holder<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.290> then

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
you have your bra strap holder and then

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.980 
you have your bra strap holder and then
of<00:02:18.770> course<00:02:19.100> you<00:02:19.490> have<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.940> attach<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.810> other

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
of course you have to attach the other

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.660 
of course you have to attach the other
part<00:02:21.470> of<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.800> automatic<00:02:22.660> here
