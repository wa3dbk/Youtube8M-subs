00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.719 
that it does the job and I love that
about<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.460> now<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.649> will<00:02:04.649> say<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.890> get<00:02:05.219> much

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
about it now I will say I get much

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.430 
about it now I will say I get much
fuller<00:02:06.329> coverage<00:02:06.719> with<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.350> brush<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.069> I

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
fuller coverage with this brush and I

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.650 
fuller coverage with this brush and I
is<00:02:08.800> because<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.400> bristles<00:02:09.640> are<00:02:10.000> so<00:02:10.180> compact

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
is because the bristles are so compact

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.750 
is because the bristles are so compact
they're<00:02:10.960> tightly<00:02:11.410> packed<00:02:11.680> in<00:02:11.890> together<00:02:12.280> and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
they're tightly packed in together and

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.630 
they're tightly packed in together and
to<00:02:13.750> stipple<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.230> on<00:02:14.290> yeah<00:02:15.070> I'm<00:02:15.250> putting<00:02:15.430> on<00:02:15.610> a

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
to stipple it on yeah I'm putting on a

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.060 
to stipple it on yeah I'm putting on a
lot<00:02:16.030> more<00:02:16.060> makeup<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.930> concentrated<00:02:17.770> amount

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
lot more makeup and concentrated amount

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.280 
lot more makeup and concentrated amount
so<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.430> gives<00:02:18.640> me<00:02:18.820> a<00:02:18.850> fuller<00:02:19.330> coverage<00:02:19.660> it<00:02:20.080> does

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
so it gives me a fuller coverage it does

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.980 
so it gives me a fuller coverage it does
take<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.560> little<00:02:20.800> bit<00:02:20.920> more<00:02:21.220> time<00:02:21.520> but<00:02:21.990> it's

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
take a little bit more time but it's

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.200 
take a little bit more time but it's
worth<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.560> payoff<00:02:23.770> because<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.610> get<00:02:25.000> full

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
in my makeup as I applied it because I

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.410 
in my makeup as I applied it because I

I<00:04:24.729> haven't<00:04:25.240> used<00:04:25.479> this<00:04:25.810> in<00:04:26.080> quite<00:04:26.500> some<00:04:26.800> time

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
I haven't used this in quite some time

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.780 
I haven't used this in quite some time
but<00:04:29.110> I<00:04:29.470> have<00:04:30.160> been<00:04:31.290> using<00:04:32.430> my<00:04:33.430> Revlon

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
but I have been using my Revlon

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.750 
but I have been using my Revlon
Colorstay<00:04:34.330> and<00:04:35.020> I<00:04:35.590> think<00:04:36.310> it<00:04:36.460> might<00:04:36.580> be<00:04:36.729> a

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
Colorstay and I think it might be a

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.550 
Colorstay and I think it might be a
little<00:04:36.940> bit<00:04:37.150> too<00:04:37.300> dark<00:04:37.540> for<00:04:37.600> me<00:04:37.840> so<00:04:38.199> I'm<00:04:38.500> just

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
little bit too dark for me so I'm just

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:48.620 
little bit too dark for me so I'm just
going<00:04:38.919> ahead<00:04:39.070> right<00:04:39.370> now<00:04:39.550> I<00:04:39.820> can<00:04:40.300> apply<00:04:40.630> in<00:04:45.720> my

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
going ahead right now I can apply in my

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.480 
going ahead right now I can apply in my
black<00:04:49.630> gradient<00:04:49.900> and<00:04:50.470> I<00:04:50.919> think<00:04:51.160> this<00:04:51.310> is<00:04:51.460> a

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
black gradient and I think this is a

00:04:51.490 --> 00:05:00.600 
black gradient and I think this is a
carob<00:04:54.840> again<00:04:55.840> I<00:04:57.449> forget<00:04:58.449> oh<00:04:58.810> no<00:04:59.650> it's<00:05:00.220> in<00:05:00.430> on

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
carob again I forget oh no it's in on

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.830 
carob again I forget oh no it's in on
cashmere<00:05:01.710> 8412<00:05:03.000> and<00:05:04.380> I<00:05:05.380> didn't<00:05:06.010> like<00:05:06.250> this

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
cashmere 8412 and I didn't like this

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.540 
cashmere 8412 and I didn't like this
when<00:05:07.840> I<00:05:08.080> used<00:05:08.199> to<00:05:08.680> use<00:05:08.919> it<00:05:09.070> because<00:05:09.220> it

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
when I used to use it because it

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.770 
when I used to use it because it
transferred<00:05:10.210> so<00:05:10.510> easily<00:05:12.300> but<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.419> color<00:05:13.660> was

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
transferred so easily but the color was

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.440 
transferred so easily but the color was
a<00:05:14.440> really<00:05:14.860> great<00:05:15.160> blend<00:05:15.550> for<00:05:15.970> my<00:05:16.090> complexion

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
a really great blend for my complexion

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.740 
a really great blend for my complexion
it<00:05:16.900> was<00:05:17.050> great<00:05:17.380> coverage<00:05:18.010> on<00:05:18.400> the<00:05:19.270> color<00:05:19.510> was

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
it was great coverage on the color was

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:26.719 
it was great coverage on the color was
on<00:05:19.960> point<00:05:20.289> but<00:05:22.320> it<00:05:23.320> just<00:05:23.770> throughout<00:05:24.610> the<00:05:24.789> day

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
on point but it just throughout the day

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.670 
on point but it just throughout the day
it<00:05:27.729> was<00:05:27.910> not<00:05:28.090> good<00:05:28.300> for<00:05:28.330> me<00:05:28.599> because<00:05:29.200> I<00:05:29.470> do<00:05:29.530> have

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
it was not good for me because I do have

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:40.640 
it was not good for me because I do have
oily<00:05:30.099> skin<00:05:30.630> combination<00:05:31.630> of<00:05:31.690> oily<00:05:31.990> skin

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.340 

when<00:05:41.370> I<00:05:41.400> use<00:05:41.729> this<00:05:42.030> brush<00:05:42.360> with<00:05:42.780> my<00:05:42.960> Revlon

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
when I use this brush with my Revlon

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:50.090 
when I use this brush with my Revlon
Colorstay<00:05:44.300> the<00:05:45.300> coverage<00:05:45.690> goes<00:05:45.930> on<00:05:48.650> so<00:05:49.650> full

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
Colorstay the coverage goes on so full

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.909 
Colorstay the coverage goes on so full
that<00:05:50.130> it<00:05:50.630> gives<00:05:51.630> me<00:05:51.870> like<00:05:52.020> a<00:05:52.080> darker<00:05:52.680> color

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
that it gives me like a darker color

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.860 
that it gives me like a darker color
payoff<00:05:53.160> so<00:05:53.580> I<00:05:53.610> can't<00:05:54.000> really<00:05:54.180> use<00:05:54.330> it<00:05:54.720> with

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
payoff so I can't really use it with

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.570 
payoff so I can't really use it with
this<00:05:55.050> brush<00:05:55.380> because<00:05:55.590> I<00:05:56.100> end<00:05:57.030> up<00:05:57.270> being<00:05:58.580> darker

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
this brush because I end up being darker

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.379 
this brush because I end up being darker
in<00:05:59.850> the<00:05:59.910> face<00:06:00.300> that<00:06:00.620> what<00:06:01.620> I<00:06:01.650> really<00:06:02.010> am<00:06:02.389> which
