00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.339
 Hello 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.170
 and I will comment on my experience 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.910
 record was married to light 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.910
 in more detail 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.140
 sad 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.950
 commented that she would divorce then 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:30.460
 already one 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.510
 it is important that we have a 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.219
 couple or the eco psychopathy 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.399
 but unfortunately all the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.380
 relationships that musician was leading 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.070
 that we were in a series 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.770
 It was very beautiful and everything else but 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.850
 nothing serious to form a home 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.270
 or something 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.170
 hard for sure he's always looking 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:59.050
 then this led me to a change of 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.390
 what are we going through with me if I was the 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.920
 problem 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.920
 and that I'm failing 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:13.340
 even it was no longer that some friends 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.670
 I asked them what they thought constant 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:21.340
 questions so that at least know 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.340
 they also allow 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.120
 ecological actors maybe they helped me 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.140
 because it 's the brush I had proof of 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:39.560
 self esteem 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:39.560
 and it is that I 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.719
 avn avn I asked what it said 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.719
 conquer a woman 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:59.799
 we chop a lot of thousands of d link 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.860
 clark and I was investigating with the desire 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.200
 to search and find answers to my 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.899
 questions 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.819
 and metro is like seeing with the page of 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.080
 buildings if I loved it a lot because of 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.239
 professionalism 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.990
 I want to apply to look for something 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:23.970
 to my questions something practical 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.970
 and that wind because I decided to 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.180
 d 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:36.010
 dress small to the point I liked 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:38.300
 too much from the first day 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.530
 leave present 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.170
 and I understood 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.569
 have a day to answer greetings other 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.250
 my 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:52.440
 I understood this so deep 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.680
 and start things differently 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.040
 it's like yes 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.660
 I was asleep but I started 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.930
 this way of things 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.600
 in terms of relations with the sexes 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.660
 and removing more 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.800
 and so that the benefits of being 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.050
 all right 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.100
 it's the boys 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.100
 I after 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.970
 chopped 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.160
 or I am a witness of good 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.350
 why 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.460
 currently on when it comes back to me 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.920
 same as I do not have because I know that 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.400
 I because of infections as he says 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.560
 view the female chorus 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:44.099
 forms of music is full of diverse 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.159
 techniques and their technical gods for Juan 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:50.610
 that line and downside that of control of 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:52.950
 very interesting anxiety 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.620
 and bonus 5 more what kind of 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.190
 reach of the last in the last 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.500
 in the last session well 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.630
 in which I find it a little funny 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.300
 It seemed funny and very effective 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.740
 and that yes having study because it has 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.050
 community and queues but very 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.170
 interesting 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:17.130
 was pressed itself traction 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.680
 have changed or changed me and 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.620
 afterwards and this is to make a production 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:27.050
 with sex 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:31.789
 also good I can tell you that 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:34.960
 that you have in the councils and they are all 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:38.919
 very effective like how to use facebook 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:42.500
 besides telephone is simply friends 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:45.129
 stars are presentations and theron 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.129
 very much 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:53.050
 and also 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.819
 and it does not feel like a disk where 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.819
 liked a phrase of sean 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.780
 when you buy 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:21.800
 let's find our taste for that 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.840
 our phase followed to one and another time 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.020
 and the same way 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.310
 I should also do the same with the 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.880
 mens 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:37.420
 wants to have at least three parts and several 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.680
 lessons to really find out what 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.680
 that the mouth 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.800
 it is not 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:50.180
 with all this experience that I have had 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:54.610
 in this this workshop is not very rich for 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.930
 me here friends just tell you that 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.320
 you will learn much more than you old 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:04.409
 adopt paradigms that some have 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:08.879
 that trained for so many years 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:11.849
 and if all these strategies can we 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:13.409
 we use division sheet degrees of 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:15.720
 according to each context he says 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:19.170
 indicates 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.180
 They are effective effective when you can 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:26.009
 get in 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:29.910
 is the incredible but true I myself 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:31.050
 I checked and I'll tell you that I feel good and 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.259
 I would like 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:38.220
 and I want you to also feel 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:41.900
 comfortable thus winning 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.900
 if it bothers you 

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:50.009
 from being wrong because we were wrong 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:55.810
 that's why I control many 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.660
 blessings and thanks to the group to the team 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:01.570
 of said for helping me 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.810
 and I hope you find the way and 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.400
 third parties 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.000
 to you 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.000
 against home 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
