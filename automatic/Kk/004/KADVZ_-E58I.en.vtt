nice<00:02:51.840> this<00:02:52.020> car<00:02:52.260> comes<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:52.710> a<00:02:52.940> rolling<00:02:53.940> chassis

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
nice this car comes is a rolling chassis

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.240 
nice this car comes is a rolling chassis
with<00:02:54.810> all<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.170> carbon<00:02:55.410> fiber<00:02:55.740> you<00:02:55.980> see<00:02:56.160> the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
with all that carbon fiber you see the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.590 
with all that carbon fiber you see the
silver<00:02:56.490> carbon<00:02:56.910> fiber<00:02:57.090> right<00:02:57.270> there<00:02:57.480> yeah

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
silver carbon fiber right there yeah

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.020 
silver carbon fiber right there yeah
that's<00:02:57.990> pretty<00:02:58.250> but<00:02:59.250> that's<00:02:59.580> what<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.850> comes

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.560 
with that thunder power right there's
usually<00:03:03.960> when<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.290> run<00:03:04.470> in<00:03:04.620> my<00:03:04.680> cars<00:03:05.300> but<00:03:06.300> once

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
usually when I run in my cars but once

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.000

running this is the hyper 9 electric

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.420 
running this is the hyper 9 electric
it's<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:55.050> lot<00:03:55.260> like<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.650> first<00:03:55.890> one<00:03:56.130> I<00:03:56.160> showed

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
it's a lot like the first one I showed

you in this film the hyper star electric

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.260 
you in this film the hyper star electric
just<00:03:59.700> it's<00:04:00.600> it's<00:04:01.410> it's<00:04:02.010> different<00:04:02.670> when<00:04:03.150> it

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
just it's it's it's different when it

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.860 
just it's it's it's different when it
comes<00:04:03.300> to<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:04.050> a<00:04:04.470> arms<00:04:04.850> it's<00:04:05.850> got<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.420> pivot

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
comes to the a arms it's got the pivot

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.620 
comes to the a arms it's got the pivot
ball<00:04:07.050> suspension<00:04:07.860> what<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.489> hybrid<00:04:09.000> the

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
ball suspension what the hybrid the

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.780 
ball suspension what the hybrid the
hyper<00:04:09.840> star<00:04:10.260> has<00:04:10.500> pivot<00:04:10.920> ball<00:04:11.070> this<00:04:11.340> just<00:04:11.610> has

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
hyper star has pivot ball this just has

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.360 
hyper star has pivot ball this just has
a<00:04:11.820> regular<00:04:12.320> regular<00:04:13.320> linkage<00:04:13.890> you<00:04:14.010> can<00:04:14.160> see

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
a regular regular linkage you can see

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.890 
a regular regular linkage you can see
that<00:04:14.400> this<00:04:14.880> one<00:04:15.090> haven't<00:04:15.360> really<00:04:15.510> set<00:04:15.750> up<00:04:15.870> for

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
that this one haven't really set up for

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.750 
that this one haven't really set up for
racing<00:04:16.470> image<00:04:16.830> and<00:04:16.950> it's<00:04:17.160> got<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.280> transponder

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
racing image and it's got a transponder

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.610 
racing image and it's got a transponder
on<00:04:18.030> it<00:04:18.180> and<00:04:18.270> all<00:04:18.359> but<00:04:19.070> it's<00:04:20.070> got<00:04:20.280> a<00:04:20.310> castle

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
on it and all but it's got a castle

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.650 
on it and all but it's got a castle
motor<00:04:22.620> in<00:04:22.890> it<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.250> we<00:04:23.820> all<00:04:23.940> know<00:04:24.120> castle

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
motor in it and we all know castle

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.530 
motor in it and we all know castle
was<00:04:24.830> it's<00:04:25.830> good<00:04:26.160> it's<00:04:26.550> very<00:04:26.670> good<00:04:26.940> but<00:04:27.150> it's

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
was it's good it's very good but it's

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.370 
was it's good it's very good but it's
not<00:04:27.720> as<00:04:27.930> precise<00:04:28.380> as<00:04:28.410> Deaconess<00:04:30.230> so<00:04:31.230> that

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
not as precise as Deaconess so that

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.690 
not as precise as Deaconess so that
one's<00:04:31.530> more<00:04:31.650> of<00:04:31.770> just<00:04:31.860> a<00:04:32.010> basher<00:04:32.430> in<00:04:32.580> my

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
one's more of just a basher in my

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.870 
one's more of just a basher in my
opinion<00:04:32.940> it<00:04:33.150> it's<00:04:33.990> got<00:04:34.200> a<00:04:34.670> transponder<00:04:35.670> in

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
opinion it it's got a transponder in

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.330 
opinion it it's got a transponder in
case<00:04:36.030> I<00:04:36.180> ever<00:04:36.210> want<00:04:36.540> to<00:04:36.600> go<00:04:36.800> race<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:38.040> but<00:04:38.070> uh

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
case I ever want to go race it but uh

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:47.180 
case I ever want to go race it but uh
and<00:04:38.820> then<00:04:39.660> here's<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.110> jam<00:04:40.860> at<00:04:41.070> x2<00:04:42.170> CRT<00:04:44.210> I<00:04:46.190> like

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
putting on the list of build is the

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.830 
putting on the list of build is the
kyosho<00:06:13.310> so<00:06:14.310> I<00:06:14.640> think<00:06:14.850> I'll<00:06:15.120> build<00:06:15.360> that<00:06:15.540> one

kyosho so I think I'll build that one

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.550 
kyosho so I think I'll build that one
and<00:06:16.110> then<00:06:16.590> I'll<00:06:17.070> show<00:06:17.100> it<00:06:17.580> but<00:06:17.880> 10<00:06:18.290> until<00:06:19.290> then
