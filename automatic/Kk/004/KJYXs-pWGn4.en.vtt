00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.379
 streetwear because is today I'm going 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.820
 introduce you to how to make the gentleman 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.800
 loeb anyway how well do it succeed 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.330
 there are different ways to succeed the 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.070
 first way to roll on the ground 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.660
 opts for a beginner's head in the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.640
 swinging the swaying this is the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.600
 first step to succeed a gentleman 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.310
 so I'm not talking to you to do a 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.840
 disgusting swaying swayed towards 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.230
 before and then to miss all your word 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.910
 slut 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.740
 but I'm telling you to swing towards 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.240
 the front and once it's done you 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.920
 additionally operate to send you your 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.750
 bar at the chin level and that's where 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.529
 moment there that you will send your 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.149
 second step 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.649
 so I know it's hard I know that 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.719
 it's not easy it's trying 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.149
 difficult you are not motivated but 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.930
 yet we must succeed 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.850
 after when you have acquired a 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.020
 some experience of a that you 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.329
 would not even need you anymore 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.010
 swing that will come like that the second 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.840
 step of your hand this was in the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.239
 wrist rotation indeed when 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.920
 you send your gold body to the level of 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.809
 traction to have your part that 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.850
 is below the chin there should 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.100
 what to do will be pushed to the maximum 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.829
 with the strength of your arms and with the help of 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.650
 your back help shoulder you either 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.030
 send your wrists this is the method 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.400
 the most common among practitioners of 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.920
 strip workout without it it's impossible 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.540
 practically to make a nice offer the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.100
 to succeed in the beginning I speak for the 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.799
 beginners so it'll be 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.659
 this effect of two rotations of the hands 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.520
 when you send your bar like that 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.380
 at the chin level there you go to do 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.490
 a twist of the wrists to be able to 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.530
 send a lot of 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.909
 so I know it's hard I know that 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.220
 it's proving I know you're not 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.540
 not motivated by a firm shut up you 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.460
 see that from the moment you 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.020
 will succeed in balancing well at 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.759
 level of wrist rotation that's fine 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.320
 to be downright simpler for this 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.000
 third step it's going to be the most 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.829
 complicated because in fact will 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.870
 lift your own right but he 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.400
 will also have to be in the finish 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.280
 so here to succeed this third 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.080
 step you will have to drink a good coke 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.830
 see a beautiful oasis where there can be a 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.260
 good orange juice 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.030
 once this wrist rotation 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.890
 made from that moment on you have 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.600
 two choices they oppose you either 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.310
 you stay cablecom sarah bar with the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.780
 strength of your arms and you chained 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.550
 to the end or send your 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.780
 elbows to have your bar go 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.250
 find at the bottom of the opecst 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.080
 and there you have more than to push 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.160
 just in ips I know it's 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.110
 not something easy it's for 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.420
 that I advise beginners to 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.370
 succeed in linking 15 traction 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.060
 in a row before you can train 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.830
 grinding stones 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.440
 you know a big man to say day 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.060
 race you people but you will see 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.530
 will be lighter so that's what I 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.530
 I shaved my legs 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.140
