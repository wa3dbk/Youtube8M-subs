00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
the side show you the inside of the box

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.580 
the side show you the inside of the box
got<00:02:22.050> your<00:02:22.290> charging<00:02:23.069> wall<00:02:24.000> adapter<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:25.500> have

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
got your charging wall adapter you have

about that stuff but we what we are
concerned<00:02:42.989> about<00:02:43.170> today<00:02:43.650> is<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:45.120> actual

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
concerned about today is the actual

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.570 
concerned about today is the actual
phone<00:02:45.959> itself<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:47.040> i'm<00:02:47.220> going<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.430> go<00:02:47.489> ahead

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
phone itself so i'm going to go ahead

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.100 
phone itself so i'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:47.850> pull<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:48.360> out<00:02:49.910> discard<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.420> here

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
and pull this out discard that and here

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.570 
and pull this out discard that and here
it<00:02:52.230> is<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:54.470> photon<00:02:55.470> 4g<00:02:56.040> i<00:02:56.070> was<00:02:56.220> trying<00:02:56.519> to

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
it is the photon 4g i was trying to

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.800 
it is the photon 4g i was trying to
clean<00:02:56.820> this<00:02:56.970> up<00:02:57.209> real<00:02:58.170> quick<00:02:58.440> get<00:02:58.620> nice<00:02:58.890> and

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
clean this up real quick get nice and

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.970 
clean this up real quick get nice and
nice<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.050> pretty<00:03:01.320> haven't<00:03:01.739> gotten<00:03:01.860> the

nice and pretty haven't gotten the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.030 
nice and pretty haven't gotten the
screen<00:03:02.220> protector<00:03:02.760> yet<00:03:02.989> so<00:03:03.989> finger<00:03:04.650> smudges

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
screen protector yet so finger smudges

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.100 
screen protector yet so finger smudges
are<00:03:05.340> really<00:03:06.000> on<00:03:06.209> there<00:03:06.510> but<00:03:07.970> ok<00:03:08.970> much<00:03:09.810> better

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
are really on there but ok much better

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.069 
are really on there but ok much better
alright<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.250> photon<00:03:11.820> 4g<00:03:12.329> let's<00:03:12.570> just<00:03:12.750> look<00:03:12.870> at

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
alright so photon 4g let's just look at

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.949 
alright so photon 4g let's just look at
the<00:03:13.670> front<00:03:14.670> strong<00:03:15.000> with<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.239> front<00:03:15.540> as<00:03:15.690> you

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
the front strong with the front as you

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.520 
the front strong with the front as you
can<00:03:16.110> see<00:03:16.380> there<00:03:16.620> is<00:03:16.799> a<00:03:17.390> huge<00:03:18.390> front<00:03:19.049> facing
