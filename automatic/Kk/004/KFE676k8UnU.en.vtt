00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.019

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:40.579
 well, water and still seemingly earth poems 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.579
 something like that started to start scrub 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:49.410
 Here's what we can have crab 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:54.930
 twirl the future no head on 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:01:00.260

 only in the mix lay my all lend a 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.979
 nowhere else is there such here 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.840
 original eyes because I really 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:26.340
 like and I think it's an octopus after all 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.340
 because of seeing these attempts to start 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.310
 asus mylogo also have such things on 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:38.070
 the tentacles of this this thought are the sums 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:44.060
 leg eight feet and this 4 here so 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:47.750
 Crabik I remind they cost 250 rubles yes 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:52.439
 Well , someone like me is worth 250 rubles 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:56.159
 then we can go to the water element 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:02:00.299
 Here is the water element and it looks like 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.810
 remember that sometimes my son comes across 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.360
 such black little ones 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.509
 not me who come across me here 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.299
 caught one new 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:16.280
 It means that there is a little bit of water. 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:17.480
 music like a village and here let's 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.540
 consider it 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:25.569
 I think he is the coolest 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:30.079
 because you look at his hands 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:36.620
 Now here they are here so bend him 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:37.879

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:44.409

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:49.220
 something like also legs move and 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:53.150
 still such a thing, but there is something to blame 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:57.310
 These are helmets which can be put on 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:00.560
 man and these are ordinary heads 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.810
 these are ordinary heads only on them 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.810
 eyes are drawn and it's very cool 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:12.949
 during the name of this character colombo from 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:16.629
 addition turbo something like that do not judge strictly 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:20.660
 so because i'm not complete 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:23.120
 Well, the last element I just 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.660
 one bill we sat down with each 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:31.750
 the elements took a monster like this 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.129
 there is a tail or such a toothy mouth 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:39.699
