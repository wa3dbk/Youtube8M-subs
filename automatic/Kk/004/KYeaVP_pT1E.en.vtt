you what I have on the lathe here this
is<00:00:07.629> just<00:00:07.779> a<00:00:07.959> quick<00:00:08.259> example<00:00:08.769> of<00:00:09.009> what<00:00:09.250> you<00:00:09.429> can

do with scraps or broken or blown out

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.400 
do with scraps or broken or blown out
materials<00:00:13.509> what<00:00:14.290> I<00:00:14.320> have<00:00:14.620> here<00:00:14.980> is<00:00:15.219> I<00:00:16.380> had<00:00:17.380> some

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
materials what I have here is I had some

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.920 
materials what I have here is I had some
pieces<00:00:17.949> of<00:00:18.160> true<00:00:19.090> stone<00:00:19.330> that<00:00:19.510> I<00:00:19.539> had<00:00:19.689> drilled

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
pieces of true stone that I had drilled

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.980 
pieces of true stone that I had drilled
out<00:00:20.140> a<00:00:20.170> couple<00:00:20.560> weeks<00:00:20.800> ago<00:00:20.980> and<00:00:21.400> over<00:00:22.390> the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
out a couple weeks ago and over the

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.839 
out a couple weeks ago and over the
course<00:00:23.199> of<00:00:23.320> time<00:00:23.470> I<00:00:23.529> broke<00:00:23.890> two<00:00:24.099> of<00:00:24.369> these<00:00:24.490> a

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
course of time I broke two of these a

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.710 
course of time I broke two of these a
green<00:00:25.570> one<00:00:25.810> and<00:00:25.990> this<00:00:26.170> pink<00:00:26.439> one<00:00:26.679> and<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:28.090> really

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
green one and this pink one and I really

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.060 
green one and this pink one and I really
hate<00:00:28.990> to<00:00:29.109> throw<00:00:29.289> away<00:00:29.380> true<00:00:29.650> stone<00:00:29.890> because

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
hate to throw away true stone because

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.459 
hate to throw away true stone because
it's<00:00:30.220> so<00:00:30.369> expensive<00:00:30.670> and<00:00:31.269> it<00:00:31.869> was<00:00:32.050> basically

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:32.469 
it's so expensive and it was basically

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.040 
it's so expensive and it was basically
just<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:33.070> last<00:00:33.340> bottom<00:00:34.090> half<00:00:34.300> here<00:00:34.329> cracked

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
just the last bottom half here cracked

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.380 
just the last bottom half here cracked
when<00:00:35.500> I<00:00:35.530> was<00:00:35.739> drilling<00:00:35.950> even<00:00:36.309> taking<00:00:37.180> all<00:00:37.300> the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
when I was drilling even taking all the

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.529 
when I was drilling even taking all the
precautions<00:00:37.989> it<00:00:38.140> can<00:00:38.289> still<00:00:38.559> happen<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:40.390> is

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539 
precautions it can still happen this is

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.779 
precautions it can still happen this is
the<00:00:40.660> other<00:00:40.840> half<00:00:41.170> of<00:00:41.320> them<00:00:41.559> so<00:00:42.129> what<00:00:42.280> I<00:00:42.309> did<00:00:42.430> was

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
the other half of them so what I did was

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:45.389 
the other half of them so what I did was
I<00:00:42.940> just<00:00:42.969> kind<00:00:43.390> of<00:00:43.539> drew<00:00:44.200> a<00:00:44.230> little<00:00:44.590> little

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
I just kind of drew a little little

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.850 
I just kind of drew a little little
swirl<00:00:45.789> line<00:00:46.180> on<00:00:46.420> there<00:00:46.629> little<00:00:46.899> s<00:00:47.079> line<00:00:47.410> across

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
swirl line on there little s line across

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.209 
swirl line on there little s line across
the<00:00:48.039> first<00:00:48.250> one<00:00:48.550> cut<00:00:49.210> it<00:00:49.329> on<00:00:49.449> the<00:00:49.570> band<00:00:49.690> saw<00:00:50.219> put

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
the first one cut it on the band saw put

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.630 
the first one cut it on the band saw put
it<00:00:51.309> on<00:00:51.430> top<00:00:51.640> of<00:00:51.699> the<00:00:51.969> other<00:00:52.210> broken<00:00:52.899> piece<00:00:53.109> and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
it on top of the other broken piece and

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.660 
it on top of the other broken piece and
matched<00:00:54.640> it<00:00:54.910> and<00:00:55.090> then<00:00:55.270> cut<00:00:55.539> that<00:00:55.570> out<00:00:55.809> and

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
matched it and then cut that out and

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.150 
matched it and then cut that out and
then<00:00:57.670> took<00:00:57.850> an<00:00:58.030> old<00:00:58.210> gift<00:00:59.079> card<00:00:59.410> I<00:00:59.590> have<00:01:00.129> a

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
then took an old gift card I have a

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.860 
then took an old gift card I have a
source<00:01:00.489> gave<00:01:00.760> me<00:01:00.850> a<00:01:00.879> whole<00:01:01.059> box<00:01:01.300> of<00:01:01.539> these<00:01:01.629> one

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
source gave me a whole box of these one

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.170 
source gave me a whole box of these one
time<00:01:02.050> and<00:01:02.350> I<00:01:02.890> cut<00:01:03.070> a<00:01:03.100> little<00:01:03.370> piece<00:01:03.579> of<00:01:03.850> the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
time and I cut a little piece of the

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.160 
time and I cut a little piece of the
plastic<00:01:04.420> out<00:01:04.810> and<00:01:06.150> glued<00:01:07.150> and<00:01:07.510> clamped<00:01:07.570> that

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
plastic out and glued and clamped that

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.050 
plastic out and glued and clamped that
together<00:01:08.530> under<00:01:08.860> real<00:01:09.070> high<00:01:09.280> pressure<00:01:09.610> I<00:01:09.910> let

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
together under real high pressure I let

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.640 
together under real high pressure I let
it<00:01:10.180> dry<00:01:10.210> for<00:01:10.360> several<00:01:10.870> days<00:01:10.990> because<00:01:11.170> I<00:01:11.290> wasn't

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
it dry for several days because I wasn't

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.840 
it dry for several days because I wasn't
in<00:01:11.710> a<00:01:11.800> hurry<00:01:11.980> you<00:01:12.070> just<00:01:12.310> let<00:01:12.430> it<00:01:12.460> sit<00:01:12.700> on<00:01:12.790> the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
in a hurry you just let it sit on the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.420 
in a hurry you just let it sit on the
bench<00:01:13.060> and<00:01:13.390> now<00:01:13.960> I'm<00:01:14.170> spinning<00:01:14.680> it<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:15.130> see<00:01:15.310> how

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
bench and now I'm spinning it to see how

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.360 
bench and now I'm spinning it to see how
it<00:01:15.610> looks<00:01:15.850> here<00:01:16.200> worst<00:01:17.200> case<00:01:17.470> if<00:01:17.800> it<00:01:18.040> doesn't

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
it looks here worst case if it doesn't

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.790 
it looks here worst case if it doesn't
work<00:01:18.520> out<00:01:18.670> it<00:01:19.300> was<00:01:19.510> junk<00:01:19.810> anyways<00:01:20.200> if<00:01:20.500> it<00:01:20.650> does

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
work out it was junk anyways if it does

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.220 
work out it was junk anyways if it does
work<00:01:21.010> out<00:01:21.160> I've<00:01:21.460> got<00:01:21.610> a<00:01:21.640> cool<00:01:21.910> design<00:01:22.180> and<00:01:22.750> I

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
work out I've got a cool design and I

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.470 
work out I've got a cool design and I
saved<00:01:23.620> some<00:01:23.740> really<00:01:24.130> expensive<00:01:24.340> materials<00:01:25.090> so

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
saved some really expensive materials so

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.120 
saved some really expensive materials so
i'ma<00:01:25.570> show<00:01:25.720> you<00:01:25.810> how<00:01:25.870> it<00:01:26.050> comes<00:01:26.170> out<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:26.650> we'll

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
i'ma show you how it comes out and we'll

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.980 
i'ma show you how it comes out and we'll
take<00:01:27.220> a<00:01:27.280> look<00:01:27.430> at<00:01:27.610> it<00:01:27.700> here<00:01:27.820> on<00:01:27.940> the<00:01:28.030> lathe<00:01:28.180> you

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
take a look at it here on the lathe you

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.860 
take a look at it here on the lathe you
can<00:01:29.140> see<00:01:29.410> here<00:01:29.970> I've<00:01:30.970> actually<00:01:31.180> started<00:01:31.750> to

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
can see here I've actually started to

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.200 
can see here I've actually started to
turn<00:01:32.050> this<00:01:32.290> piece<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:33.550> it<00:01:33.670> already<00:01:33.820> is

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
turn this piece and it already is

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.050 
turn this piece and it already is
looking<00:01:34.720> like<00:01:34.810> it'll<00:01:35.110> have<00:01:35.260> a<00:01:35.290> cool<00:01:35.620> design

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
looking like it'll have a cool design

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.270 
looking like it'll have a cool design
this<00:01:37.060> is<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.300> little<00:01:37.690> shape<00:01:38.620> I<00:01:38.830> was<00:01:38.950> telling

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
this is the little shape I was telling

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.680 
this is the little shape I was telling
you<00:01:39.400> I<00:01:39.430> made<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:39.940> then<00:01:40.000> cut<00:01:40.240> on<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.480> bandsaw

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
you I made and then cut on the bandsaw

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.530 
you I made and then cut on the bandsaw
and<00:01:41.110> as<00:01:41.710> long<00:01:41.860> as<00:01:41.890> I<00:01:42.100> match<00:01:42.340> those<00:01:42.700> perfect<00:01:43.390> I

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
and as long as I match those perfect I

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.690 
and as long as I match those perfect I
had<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.320> tube<00:01:44.530> already<00:01:44.950> drilled<00:01:45.310> because<00:01:45.670> I

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
had the tube already drilled because I

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.460 
had the tube already drilled because I
was<00:01:45.910> drilling<00:01:46.210> when<00:01:46.480> I<00:01:46.510> broke<00:01:46.870> both<00:01:46.900> pieces

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.540

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
so got the handle finished pretty

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.090 
so got the handle finished pretty
pleased<00:02:27.880> about<00:02:28.060> came<00:02:28.510> out<00:02:28.770> like<00:02:29.770> I<00:02:29.860> said<00:02:29.890> I

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
pleased about came out like I said I

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.050 
pleased about came out like I said I
hate<00:02:30.280> throwing<00:02:30.430> away<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.880> true<00:02:31.390> stone<00:02:31.690> and

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
hate throwing away the true stone and

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.110 
hate throwing away the true stone and
the<00:02:34.470> while<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.650> design<00:02:35.980> of<00:02:36.310> how<00:02:36.460> I<00:02:36.490> shaped<00:02:36.880> it

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
the while the design of how I shaped it

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.910 
the while the design of how I shaped it
I<00:02:37.270> probably<00:02:37.600> would<00:02:37.870> make<00:02:37.990> it<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.260> little<00:02:38.560> more

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
I probably would make it a little more

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.120 
I probably would make it a little more
dramatic<00:02:39.160> next<00:02:39.940> time<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.420> make<00:02:40.660> sure<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.980> you

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
dramatic next time to make sure that you

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.880 
dramatic next time to make sure that you
know<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:42.490> was<00:02:42.640> intentional<00:02:43.330> versus<00:02:43.890> just

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
know it was intentional versus just

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.830 
know it was intentional versus just
stuck<00:02:45.130> together<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:46.180> actually<00:02:46.510> came<00:02:46.660> out

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
stuck together it actually came out

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.170 
stuck together it actually came out
really<00:02:47.110> well

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
really well

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.970 
really well
the<00:02:49.180> colors<00:02:49.630> seem<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.380> work<00:02:50.590> pretty<00:02:50.620> good

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
the colors seem to work pretty good

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.530 
the colors seem to work pretty good
together<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.550> think<00:02:51.700> this<00:02:52.030> will<00:02:52.180> be<00:02:52.270> a<00:02:52.300> great

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
together I think this will be a great

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.830 
together I think this will be a great

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
this the true stone is a great material

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.810 
this the true stone is a great material
it<00:03:06.490> polishes<00:03:07.180> really<00:03:07.810> well<00:03:08.070> it<00:03:09.070> was<00:03:09.400> very

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
it polishes really well it was very

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.760 
it polishes really well it was very
interesting<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.420> be<00:03:10.570> cutting<00:03:11.110> two<00:03:11.350> different

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
interesting to be cutting two different

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.400 
interesting to be cutting two different
kinds<00:03:12.220> right<00:03:12.970> next<00:03:13.300> to<00:03:13.390> each<00:03:13.510> other<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:14.020> haven't

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
kinds right next to each other I haven't

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.860 
kinds right next to each other I haven't
ever<00:03:14.500> done<00:03:14.740> that<00:03:14.770> before<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:16.270> paint<00:03:16.600> cut<00:03:16.840> a

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
ever done that before the paint cut a

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.470 
ever done that before the paint cut a
lot<00:03:17.110> easier<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:17.860> smoother<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:19.030> green<00:03:19.240> was<00:03:19.450> a

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
lot easier and smoother that green was a

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.990 
lot easier and smoother that green was a
little<00:03:19.750> more<00:03:19.870> challenging<00:03:20.610> so<00:03:21.610> it's<00:03:21.760> kind<00:03:21.940> of

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
little more challenging so it's kind of

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.150 
little more challenging so it's kind of
cool<00:03:22.180> to<00:03:22.240> see<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.660> difference<00:03:23.020> there<00:03:23.230> I<00:03:23.590> would

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
cool to see the difference there I would

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.130 
cool to see the difference there I would
highly<00:03:24.430> recommend<00:03:24.490> the<00:03:25.240> true<00:03:25.450> stone<00:03:25.750> for

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
highly recommend the true stone for

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.920 
highly recommend the true stone for
razors<00:03:26.710> because<00:03:27.670> they<00:03:27.880> are<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.090> nice<00:03:28.390> solid

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
razors because they are a nice solid

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.790 
razors because they are a nice solid
handle<00:03:29.320> they<00:03:29.680> can<00:03:29.860> handle<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.310> water<00:03:31.800> whereas

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
handle they can handle the water whereas

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.590 
handle they can handle the water whereas
the<00:03:32.980> wood<00:03:33.190> is<00:03:33.340> a<00:03:33.370> little<00:03:33.520> more<00:03:33.850> tricky<00:03:34.300> on<00:03:34.570> a

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
the wood is a little more tricky on a

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.830 
the wood is a little more tricky on a
razor<00:03:35.460> true<00:03:36.460> stone<00:03:36.730> can<00:03:37.060> be<00:03:37.180> purchased<00:03:37.660> at<00:03:37.780> a
