where you can cut down the time one of

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.050 
where you can cut down the time one of
them<00:01:49.470> being<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.159> have<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.369> buzzer<00:01:50.700> make

them being if you have a buzzer make

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.730 
them being if you have a buzzer make
sure<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.360> call<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.140> do<00:01:52.200> here

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
sure you call it in like I do here

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.690 
sure you call it in like I do here
because<00:01:53.100> there's<00:01:53.250> going<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.430> be<00:01:53.490> at<00:01:53.670> least

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
because there's going to be at least

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.730 
because there's going to be at least
four<00:01:54.270> different<00:01:54.509> destinations<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.560> you

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
four different destinations that you

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
have to go to so the sooner you calling

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.330 
have to go to so the sooner you calling
the<00:01:57.750> buzzards<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.170> better<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.770> those<00:01:58.950> places

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the buzzards the better and those places

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.539 
the buzzards the better and those places
are<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.060> drug<00:02:00.329> deal<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.990> depot<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:02.009> airport

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
are the drug deal the depot the airport

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.160 
are the drug deal the depot the airport
and<00:02:02.729> then<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.149> Martin's<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:03.899> you're<00:02:04.020> going<00:02:04.110> to

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
and then to Martin's so you're going to

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.780 
and then to Martin's so you're going to
have<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.350> lot<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.590> traveling<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.280> do<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.640> this

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
have a lot of traveling to do on this

have a lot of traveling to do on this
mission<00:02:06.060> which<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.630> why<00:02:06.780> i<00:02:06.810> recommend<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
mission which is why i recommend the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.350 
mission which is why i recommend the
buzzer<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.979> obviously<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.759> doable<00:02:09.119> without

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
buzzer and obviously is doable without

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.880 
buzzer and obviously is doable without
the<00:02:09.750> buzzer<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.229> just<00:02:10.379> going<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.560> take<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.860> a

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.290 
the buzzer is just going to take you a
little<00:02:11.039> bit<00:02:11.250> longer<00:02:11.489> when<00:02:11.879> you're<00:02:11.970> having<00:02:12.239> to

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.000 
you go to the hangar then as soon as you
steal<00:04:04.600> the<00:04:04.750> code<00:04:04.959> from<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.290> hangar<00:04:05.739> the

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
steal the code from the hangar the

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.440 
steal the code from the hangar the
supplier<00:04:06.340> will<00:04:06.579> take<00:04:06.760> off<00:04:06.910> in<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.120> airplane

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
supplier will take off in the airplane

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.420
