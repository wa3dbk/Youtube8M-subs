00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.800
 learn today hear called juice tune the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.600
 waist 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.660
 Let's explain to you why and 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.160
 cissokho takes that name but it 's fine with me 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.840
 I'll show you the ingredients that you 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.670
 need 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:34.160
 You're going to need half a lemon. 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:38.690
 Squeezed 12 green grapes in ice lump 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.790
 250ml of coconut water and a small bowl 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.340
 for you to put your juice and leave 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.789
 he was more special than he was 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.250
 Talk about tuning your waist. 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.050
 the gloves are rich in fibers as well 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.739
 as most fruits are rich in 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.020
 fibers 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.070
 but he chose something because he has 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.379
 less calories and their fibers help 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.960
 to make our body work 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.479
 a more effective example of our 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.299
 the fibers will decrease the 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.760
 contact of the fat that we generate with 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.509
 the wall of our intestines and that makes 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.979
 decrease the absorption of this ingredient 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:21.869
 ingredient does not contain the nutrient 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:25.140
 people do not want it so much and for doing 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.150
 lens is our management and this 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.270
 let our bowels have to 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.880
 work later manage finish 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.310
 that particular food because it 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.259
 as it is rich in nutrients by 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.000
 example because it is the link element in the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.680
 stretch our own further delay to 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.140
 to please and this increases 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.869
 metabolism and this makes people 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.810
 had the fat mostly in the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.970
 abdominal part that the mouse fat 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.299
 in case not that the others are face 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.460
 for the case but because it is where the people 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.970
 Checks 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.369
 if the person can bring it can take risks 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.320
 of cardiovascular diseases through 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.960
 abdominal fat for several programs 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.700
 tvs always talk this forever to take 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.740
 care about the fat of the region 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.989
 that we can have a 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.569
 parameter of how should be with you 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.450
 inside and out there is all that 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.800
 How deep within us is it done? 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.010
 so come on you will need a 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.290
 blender 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.989
 we put our range of 50 ml 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.989
 water of natural preference 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.459
 thus improved its extreme with over 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.250
 industrialized products 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.530
 only that even though they are natural they 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.410
 contain from preservative to 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.310
 example a natural coconut water it does not 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.739
 will last 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.660
 I put the property now that you like the most 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.420
 unnatural it will last 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.130
 the validity of a coconut shop 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.690
 for example those that people 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.739
 see the supermarket 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:03.100
 so even if you say you do not see assets 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:07.450
 somehow comes to power 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:10.269
 extend the life of the feed cesium 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:16.480
 we put here in the blender the 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:19.299
 green gloves that ice because 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.470
 the ice we lower the temperature of the 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.090
 our organism 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.540
 then your metabolism it has to 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.570
 to work harder to get the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.880
 Normal human body temperature by 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.190
 that helps ice and accelerates the 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.040
 metabolism because it takes away our 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.350
 metabolism in the comfort zone of the 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.459
 temperature 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.410
 human body that he is accustomed to 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.989
 let's just put our function 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.970
