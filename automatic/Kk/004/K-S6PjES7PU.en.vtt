00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
anything about it I really can't just

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.430 
anything about it I really can't just
gonna<00:04:46.759> have<00:04:47.389> to<00:04:47.539> hope<00:04:47.690> that<00:04:47.720> he<00:04:47.960> doesn't<00:04:48.199> get<00:04:48.380> a

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
gonna have to hope that he doesn't get a

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.230 
gonna have to hope that he doesn't get a
feel<00:04:48.620> of<00:04:48.650> a<00:04:48.740> range<00:04:48.979> and<00:04:49.759> then<00:04:49.880> he<00:04:49.940> makes<00:04:50.120> a

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
feel of a range and then he makes a

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.700 
feel of a range and then he makes a
mistake<00:04:50.330> he's<00:04:50.840> already<00:04:51.050> pretty<00:04:51.289> much<00:04:51.440> there

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
mistake he's already pretty much there

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.749 
mistake he's already pretty much there
so<00:04:52.570> this<00:04:53.570> jet<00:04:53.930> sweep<00:04:54.289> could<00:04:54.740> be<00:04:54.979> so<00:04:55.400> huge<00:04:55.699> right

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759
