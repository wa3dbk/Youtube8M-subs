00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.590
 this tube that holds the root between its 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.629
 genes the lineage that you love yourself 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.120

 I observe complete in excellence I am this 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.589
 arrogant abusing an experience without 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.930
 clemency this is the true school 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.820
 academy of the four elements of the 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.010
 entities and laundresses we carry the street 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.760
 it will be the asphalt in the sole we walk 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.100
 with hood inside the new era 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.410

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.630
 four elements but the flag itself 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.940
 I go down on the street scene the asphalt in 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.920
 the sole we walked with hood inside 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.900
 the new one was firm step I continue in a 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.180
 indefinite contract woke up double 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.160
 incentive sound to my ear not to stop 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.320
 never cut the slogan and knocked down 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.330
 burn my veins the asphalt on the sole 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.910
 from this street life who fills me with 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.430
 joy I remain firm the way are thousands the 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.230
 cruises past melancholy and envy 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.880
 that would follow if in this there is no return 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.340
 back inmates are serving the sentence 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.170
 with rap the down sprays their 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.300
 graffiti on occasion with rollers 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.430
 microphone sometimes grinds 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.290
 stereo and its moved and this pencil takes 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.210
 initiative to write and follow are 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.100
 the things that motivate the walls by 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.860

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.510

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.679
 entities and laundresses we carry the street 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.500

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.659

 true academy of the four 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.989
 elements but in itself the flag we carry 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.390
 on the street scene the asphalt on the 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.400
 sole we walked with hood inside the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.799

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.909
 consistency only strong roots break 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.889
 who is a more accessories appearance 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.200

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:39.540
 experience demonstrating both two dogs 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.950
