00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.080
 it's good there when he restarts so the 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.400
 rd has me waiting for normal resolution 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.599
 I am in optimized resolution 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:17.640
 retina optimized retina this is a 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:20.609
 correctly little something during 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.220
 that they look on the lattice apple 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:31.199
 flash of the apple he counted but that 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:34.410
 it's normal now we change the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.430
 resolution have not shown anyway 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.290
 in what resolution we were at 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.840
 start we were in optimized resolution 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.989
 for the retina screen optimized for 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.719
 the screen retina now we move on to 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.670
 the scale and we want a little space 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.890
 to breathe a bit because it's 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.890
 true that with such a beautiful screen is 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.610
 pity not to be able to enjoy it 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.980
 so now we are in a 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.690
 resolution a little about right 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.090
 still not in 2008 100 because by 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.460
 a good is not available but in 1920 in 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.460
 2010 among 200 years starts 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.460
 focus 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.020
 I 'm going to be a youth concern 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.020
 watch the TV punch and its plug 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.200
 here is the apple and appears but look 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.350
 that makes the little blink of the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.970
 apple here and there she will not go up in 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.050
 did you see that it seemed weird 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.510
 what is the world you did it's 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:02.390
 make a flash of the screen and it goes up 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:05.420
 not there we're lucky we're on the screen 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.640
 but once in three or four 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.760
 the screen is all black after after the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.990
 connection of clear desmares still the 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:21.510
 assignment to the session it's after that 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:23.700
 go back and we do not know how much you expect me 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.810
 do you pass valid and you find yourself 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.810
 with a black screen 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.260
 finally like this but you're supposed 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.260
 to be connected 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:39.120
 the apple the apple that flash that's 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.960
 normal and the palm there it's a flash 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:48.090
 instead of having the apple going up 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:50.880
 we try is the way the black screen boom 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.480
 and it works put it in a either the exit 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.150
 of the box 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.860
 it's nice of me to play 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.860
 now to hi paul
