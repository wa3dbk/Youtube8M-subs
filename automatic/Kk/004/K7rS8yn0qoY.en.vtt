the new mob of the dead which is the new
zombies<00:00:18.060> map<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.420> case<00:00:18.600> you've<00:00:18.840> been<00:00:18.869> under<00:00:19.380> a

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
zombies map in case you've been under a

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.090 
zombies map in case you've been under a
rock<00:00:19.470> for<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.830> past<00:00:19.970> day<00:00:21.109> so<00:00:22.109> anyway<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.710> yeah

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
rock for the past day so anyway and yeah

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.290 
rock for the past day so anyway and yeah
they're<00:00:23.279> not<00:00:23.369> particularly<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.880> hard<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:24.240> I

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
they're not particularly that hard so I

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.370 
they're not particularly that hard so I
thought<00:00:24.420> I'd<00:00:24.539> combine<00:00:24.810> them<00:00:24.900> into<00:00:25.019> one<00:00:25.080> video

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
thought I'd combine them into one video

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.519 
thought I'd combine them into one video
and<00:00:26.330> yeah<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:27.599> anyway<00:00:27.840> let's<00:00:28.109> get<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.320> with<00:00:28.349> it

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
and yeah so anyway let's get on with it

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.439 
and yeah so anyway let's get on with it
so<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> first<00:00:29.400> one<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.970> open<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.269> door

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449

points<00:01:14.880> however<00:01:15.090> much<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.130> then

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
points however much it is and then

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.499

obviously<00:01:17.280> go<00:01:17.580> back<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.820> yourself<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.240> revive

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
obviously go back to yourself and revive

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.539 
obviously go back to yourself and revive
yourself<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> other<00:01:20.009> achievement<00:01:20.460> when

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
yourself so the other achievement when

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.580 
yourself so the other achievement when
we<00:01:20.670> go<00:01:20.820> through<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.810> obtain<00:01:22.049> hell's

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
we go through is to obtain hell's

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.890 
we go through is to obtain hell's
retriever<00:01:22.799> which<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> tomahawk<00:01:24.330> which<00:01:24.689> is

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
retriever which is a tomahawk which is

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.780 
retriever which is a tomahawk which is
covered<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.590> lava<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:26.369> pretty<00:01:26.610> useful

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
covered in lava and it's pretty useful

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.550 
covered in lava and it's pretty useful
to<00:01:27.060> be<00:01:27.180> honest<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.689> more<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> sort<00:01:28.530> of

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
to be honest it's more like a sort of

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.800 
to be honest it's more like a sort of
boomerang<00:01:29.009> as<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.880> tends<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.180> sort<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.570> bounced

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
boomerang as it tends to sort of bounced

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.929 
boomerang as it tends to sort of bounced
around<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.770> think<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> one<00:01:32.369> hit

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
around and this I think it's a one hit

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.719 
around and this I think it's a one hit
kill<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.450> until<00:01:33.689> around<00:01:33.829> round<00:01:34.829> 14<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.520> think

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
kill up until around round 14 I think

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.719 
kill up until around round 14 I think
could<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.329> 30<00:01:36.570> i'm<00:01:36.780> not<00:01:36.990> sure<00:01:37.170> but<00:01:37.549> you<00:01:38.549> can

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
could be 30 i'm not sure but you can

i'm<00:03:10.709> pretty<00:03:10.950> sure<00:03:11.220> both<00:03:11.610> of<00:03:11.640> these<00:03:11.940> might<00:03:12.780> have

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
i'm pretty sure both of these might have

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.720 
i'm pretty sure both of these might have
something<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.230> do<00:03:13.380> with<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:13.609> will<00:03:14.609> be

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
something to do with it will be

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.130 
something to do with it will be
surprised<00:03:15.120> if<00:03:15.269> it's<00:03:15.390> something<00:03:15.540> like<00:03:15.630> a<00:03:15.750> snake

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
surprised if it's something like a snake

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.660 
surprised if it's something like a snake
involved<00:03:16.620> because<00:03:16.739> in<00:03:17.280> case<00:03:17.459> you're

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
involved because in case you're

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.490 
involved because in case you're
wondering<00:03:17.700> this<00:03:18.390> is<00:03:18.450> probably<00:03:18.840> based<00:03:19.230> on

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
wondering this is probably based on

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.560 
wondering this is probably based on
Cerberus<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.340> Cerebus<00:03:20.820> not<00:03:21.030> sorry<00:03:21.299> browser

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
Cerberus of Cerebus not sorry browser

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.319 
Cerberus of Cerebus not sorry browser
which<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:22.019> Greek<00:03:22.829> mythology<00:03:23.519> which<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:24.000> about

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
which is Greek mythology which is about

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.479 
which is Greek mythology which is about
the<00:03:24.390> three-headed<00:03:25.200> dog<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:26.040> guards<00:03:26.340> the

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
the three-headed dog that guards the

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.970 
the three-headed dog that guards the
gates<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.850> hell<00:03:27.140> so<00:03:28.140> we'll<00:03:28.380> be<00:03:28.470> surprised<00:03:28.799> if

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
gates of hell so we'll be surprised if

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.770 
gates of hell so we'll be surprised if
is<00:03:29.130> like<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.310> snake<00:03:29.640> tail<00:03:29.910> involved<00:03:30.660> because

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
is like a snake tail involved because

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.930 
is like a snake tail involved because
that's<00:03:31.200> what<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:31.410> had<00:03:31.650> but<00:03:32.280> we<00:03:32.400> don't<00:03:32.579> know<00:03:32.730> man

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
that's what I had but we don't know man

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.270 
that's what I had but we don't know man
we'll<00:03:33.510> find<00:03:33.750> out<00:03:33.870> soon<00:03:34.109> Sonia<00:03:34.829> back<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.220> the

achievement to feed the dog you got to

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.140 
achievement to feed the dog you got to
give<00:03:37.590> them<00:03:37.650> about<00:03:37.920> like<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:38.519> think<00:03:38.790> it's<00:03:38.910> five

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
give them about like I think it's five

zombies<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.810> might<00:03:39.959> be<00:03:40.079> a<00:03:40.109> little<00:03:40.320> bit<00:03:40.470> more<00:03:40.650> or

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
zombies it might be a little bit more or

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.880 
zombies it might be a little bit more or
less<00:03:40.950> probably<00:03:41.519> more<00:03:41.670> but<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:43.500> just<00:03:43.530> got<00:03:43.769> to

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
knew the pathway it better but soon as

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.270 
knew the pathway it better but soon as
you<00:04:05.470> I'm<00:04:05.560> just<00:04:05.770> terrible<00:04:06.070> with<00:04:06.130> directions

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
anyway and it is a brand new map out

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.310 
anyway and it is a brand new map out
today<00:04:08.880> but<00:04:09.880> so<00:04:10.060> far<00:04:10.240> I<00:04:10.300> do<00:04:10.420> like<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:10.810> map<00:04:11.110> it

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
today but so far I do like the map it

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.440 
today but so far I do like the map it
seems<00:04:11.740> pretty<00:04:11.950> fun<00:04:12.310> I<00:04:12.520> wasn't<00:04:12.940> too<00:04:13.120> impressed

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
seems pretty fun I wasn't too impressed

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.630 
seems pretty fun I wasn't too impressed
by<00:04:14.020> the<00:04:14.080> old<00:04:14.500> maps<00:04:14.800> we<00:04:14.980> got<00:04:15.130> with<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.340> game<00:04:15.520> in

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
by the old maps we got with the game in

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.520 
by the old maps we got with the game in
the<00:04:15.670> new<00:04:15.850> town<00:04:16.060> one<00:04:16.330> I<00:04:16.540> did<00:04:17.110> used<00:04:17.260> to<00:04:17.320> love

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
the new town one I did used to love

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.699 
the new town one I did used to love
zombies<00:04:17.980> back<00:04:18.250> in<00:04:18.459> black<00:04:18.880> ops<00:04:19.380> like<00:04:20.380> I<00:04:20.500> think

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
zombies back in black ops like I think

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.490 
zombies back in black ops like I think
probably<00:04:21.330> launch<00:04:22.330> was<00:04:22.750> it<00:04:22.870> called<00:04:23.020> münchner

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
probably launch was it called münchner

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.890 
probably launch was it called münchner
was<00:04:23.680> called<00:04:23.980> I<00:04:24.310> know<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.210> one<00:04:25.300> that<00:04:25.450> like<00:04:25.780> the

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
was called I know the one that like the

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.330 
was called I know the one that like the
ones<00:04:26.080> we<00:04:26.200> had<00:04:26.290> a<00:04:26.350> rocket<00:04:26.740> taking<00:04:26.920> off<00:04:27.070> on<00:04:27.250> it

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
ones we had a rocket taking off on it

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.040 
ones we had a rocket taking off on it
anyway<00:04:27.580> that<00:04:27.700> was<00:04:27.730> probably<00:04:27.970> my<00:04:28.150> favorite<00:04:28.570> if

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
anyway that was probably my favorite if

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.730 
anyway that was probably my favorite if
not<00:04:29.530> a<00:04:29.560> darice<00:04:30.990> but<00:04:31.990> I'm<00:04:32.110> glad<00:04:32.230> to<00:04:32.440> see<00:04:32.560> there's

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
not a darice but I'm glad to see there's

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.270 
not a darice but I'm glad to see there's
no<00:04:32.920> ridiculous<00:04:33.880> amounts<00:04:34.150> of<00:04:34.240> fire<00:04:34.450> and<00:04:35.280> little

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.400 
stupid gremlins and no George Romero
falling<00:04:39.970> around<00:04:40.060> although<00:04:40.450> that<00:04:40.720> big<00:04:40.930> hulking

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410
