00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 beautiful all guys I am ep thousand and 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.240
 here we are with this brand new video there 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:11.130
 we find on gta 5 is using the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.200
 character named trevor and takes the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.299
 what i want to do in this video is 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.820
 go to the borders of the world to the borders 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.710
 of the gta 5 map try to 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.210
 overcome them to see what happens lived 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.070
 I never went there 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.590
 so I would start from here for later 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.109
 get kind here that already blocks me here 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.179
 let's say the signal let's say the map e 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.360
 to try to overcome it and see a 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.770
 little what happens and I do n't know if not 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.780
 I know if there will be a barrier 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.239
 invisible or what I know there will be a 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.940
 mega alien monster who pulls pirates 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.550
 will send in space or a super mega 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.070
 shark will destroy the trance ship 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.760
 ra net head I have no more 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.399
 pale idea 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.520
 so we just have to find out and in 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.500
 Meanwhile I'm going there I would like to 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.859
 say a few little words let's say on gta 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.329
 5 then 3 euros first let's start 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.129
 from the trevor character you can 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.070
 unlock as soon as you are done 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.060
 the mission of the jewelry I have there 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.560
 proposed in the last video just the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.470
 sees that present mission finished and 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.840
 cones for the characters michael and franklin 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.340
 and you need to keep a low profile e 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.810
 so obviously if you play then 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.119
 with those characters it's difficult 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.280
 keep a low profile by playing a 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.490
 gta and therefore the game has thought well of 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.439
 present and introduce at that time 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.390
 just this new character then 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.890
 you will move right of location because 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.380
 this character as you well know 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.979
 even better than me and lives relative outside 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.740
 santos is a feature of this 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.790
 character is that present if activated 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.700
 her 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.860
 a super super final move what his 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.350
 trent becomes immortal to the blows of 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.150
 gun while becoming a beast and 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.340
 sciotta takes a few hits with the 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.200
 opponents therefore with this character 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.640
 it's a bit difficult to do missions 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.390
 even if I only made three per 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.210
 today he made the record of deaths 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.800
 because the game will only propose you 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.470
 missions where you have to kill a big one 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.210
 number of people because thanks 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.060
 to the special point skill of trevor that 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.620
 becomes immortal present and therefore vi 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.550
 will propose maybe here to destroy 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.530
 whole farms or other things are done e 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.110
 sees a little bit where we have arrived 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.850
 ok we're going better than there 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.620
 let's move a little bit here towards 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.030
 so here we turn a little bit better 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.350
 here I have lost I say ok and then others 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.750
 tell you then with this character 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.280
 it is introduced after the robbery 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.950
 I told you a little in the bank 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.810
 its special characteristics and therefore it is 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.190
 a little difficult the missions there 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.150
 will propose joe anyway of this 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.040
 character though 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.560
 so right now this 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.030
 all three characters 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.980
 it takes now trevor would be the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.770
 Michael's best friend from what I have 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.010
 only understood that Michael faked the 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.310
 own death and therefore trevor relative it 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.940
 considered dead and 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.380
 and so nothing this here now end is 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.700
 came to know that never with the 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.170
 reality is alive and well and so is it 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.209
 went to find a little bit in santos 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.040
 to see how he was doing and seen 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.260
 that three will want a beautiful villa a beautiful one 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.080
 beautiful beautiful things beautiful cars toute a 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.209
 placed in the right direction 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.550
 ok i already passed it let's say the part 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.340
 here this part has passed today 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.410
 so let's say the map I have not seen 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.970
 invisible barriers and therefore you can 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.319
 continue to see a little bit here 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.510
 where the game takes us and nothing instead 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.340
 I don't know Michael's skill 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.650
 the special ability instead the skill 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.000
 frank special should type 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.230
 slow down time then with 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.540
 machines much easier to guide them here 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.090
 and then a fun mission beyond 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.790
 that of robbery is obviously one 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.670
 michael's mission where you really have to 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.269
 dress up as a nerd we can say is 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.130
 present pretend a famous in a 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.340
 IT expert and an assistant 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.349
 computer so you have to enter 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.810
 a famous high fruit industry 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.980
 where he was going to get where he is going to 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.389
 a new mobile phone be presented 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:20.139
 life with 5.0 I know something about 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:23.139
 genre takes the one steve jobs of the 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.750
 situation the friend of michael wanted him 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.210
 so you died as a good good person 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.360
 person china go inside you pretend 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:35.650
 assistant come in without caring for you 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.410
 nobody enters the building and trent 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.660
 place a chip inside the phone 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.360
 so then you come home happily 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.030
 watch the mobile presentation 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.550
 15 st this presenter that would be the 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.080
 creator dellai fruit and that if it is 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.540
 presenting just take it out the 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.370
 cell phone you have to call him brent 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.530
 and responds live live 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.060
 world is present leaps into the air at 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.820
 cell phone then also blows up the 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.500
 capoccia we say of the engineer 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.870
 let's say cellphone manufacturer 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.460
 the inventor of the cell phone and nothing 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.100
 meanwhile I'm moving forward but 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.500
 it seems that this area never ends 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.970
 so we can also continue to 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.950
 continue are not at all what 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.710
 be under me and I hope not sharks 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.510
 monstrous giants or rain that you 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.560
 blow up 15 I'm afraid a 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.000
 dive then I continued I continue 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.470
 luckily invisible barriers do n't 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.680
 I found so you can too 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:32.530
 continue courage special aliens not 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.150
 I'm seeing so you can continue 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.160
 obviously the waves of the sea are always 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.470
 well done well taken care of is this 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.570
 surely it must be said and also the seabed 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.740
 marine as soon as I get the 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.840
 diving suit 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.490
 I will try to go to propose you 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.580
 definitely a video where I will show you the 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.010
 coral reef and nothing I'm here 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.270
 continuing to continue 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.120
 towards the north 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.710
 I don't know what is sel or north ok here 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.400
 without even seeing the map of lo 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.590
 santos 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.560
 I'm going really far 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.240
 so boh let's continue 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.479
 I don't know what will happen, hopefully 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.880
 nothing of monstrous destruction ah here 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.569
 I didn't stop but it is really there 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.669
 ship that is perhaps the ship 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:15.860
 maybe the watercraft and you are 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.749
 affirming voluntarily and 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.279
 then I am sinking calmly 

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:21.679
 here's what happens when we get to 

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:23.509
 border map and lambo and the motorcycle o 

00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:25.639
 what is on the motorcycle again and 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:27.139
 the car is the watercraft turns off 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:29.990
 whatever it was using yes 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:32.240
 turn off and go to its bottom from 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.610
 note again I'm not dying year no 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:39.469
 in a while I'll probably die with 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:41.300
 choking software facts and therefore 

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:43.749
 see you at the next beautiful video all 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.749
 the boys
