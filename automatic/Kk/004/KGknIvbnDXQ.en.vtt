00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.480 

and<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:06.899> small<00:00:07.200> stream<00:00:07.500> like<00:00:07.650> the<00:00:07.859> short<00:00:08.219> cast

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
and a small stream like the short cast

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.400 
and a small stream like the short cast
of<00:00:08.730> 15<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.150> 20<00:00:09.540> feet<00:00:09.719> are<00:00:09.900> all<00:00:10.020> that's<00:00:10.230> required

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
of 15 to 20 feet are all that's required

of 15 to 20 feet are all that's required
a<00:00:14.630> common<00:00:15.630> mistake<00:00:15.750> made<00:00:16.049> by<00:00:16.349> the<00:00:16.560> beginner<00:00:16.980> in

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
a common mistake made by the beginner in

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.400 
a common mistake made by the beginner in
a<00:00:17.220> situation<00:00:17.430> like<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.420> after<00:00:18.599> a<00:00:18.779> fairly

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
a situation like this is after a fairly

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.979 
a situation like this is after a fairly
good<00:00:19.590> cast<00:00:19.860> upstream<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.689> that<00:00:21.689> he<00:00:21.840> or<00:00:21.960> she

00:00:21.979 --> 00:00:21.989 
good cast upstream is that he or she

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.249 
good cast upstream is that he or she
will<00:00:22.320> tend<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.649> fish<00:00:22.860> that<00:00:23.070> cast<00:00:23.340> out<00:00:23.550> too<00:00:23.759> long

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
will tend to fish that cast out too long

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.589 
will tend to fish that cast out too long
allowing<00:00:25.259> the<00:00:25.320> fly<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.590> float<00:00:25.919> back<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.599> close

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
allowing the fly to float back to close

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.359 
allowing the fly to float back to close
to<00:00:27.809> the<00:00:27.899> rod<00:00:28.079> tip<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.590> end<00:00:29.070> up<00:00:29.189> with

to the rod tip and end up with

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.220 
to the rod tip and end up with
insufficient<00:00:30.059> line<00:00:30.239> beyond<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.840> end<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.079> the
