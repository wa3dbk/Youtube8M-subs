00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:11.259
 Today is a housewife c navigator Ishibashi, but I usually stand in the kitchen 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.259
 We will continue to introduce the much-valued recipes from in 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.500
 I am 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:28.050
 I would like to make my favorite gratin so I can warm it once a week 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:34.050
 I used this local shrimp but it was a bit unusual, not just gratin 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.530
 I will introduce gratin, so I would like to first cut my anchovy 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.700
 I will 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.250
 If there seems to be a mixer 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:47.130
 I think that you may mix it with the three 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:50.140
 Do not wait raster or use this Pastor I think want to make gratin 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.680
 I will put salt in the hot water 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.770
 I 'm hungry 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.950
 The texture of pasta here 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.280
 I will follow to change to the texture of macaroni 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:05.400
 Are moving this very much that Nde temperature hard 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:10.020
 It will be narrowed to about Masumoto, which tried to just keep in step-by-step advance 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:18.940
 Now I'm here at the point where the boiled Pastor 5 minutes but will be Te' put 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:20.840
 Because the shrimp tastes salty, boiling it with pasta will save you time 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.429
 It will be Shimeji 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.909
 It may be fun because people who put a lot of shimeji have a texture 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:32.500
 Ne 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:35.860
 Since it has been changed to a nice color , please keep track after the rest 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.220
 I think we will do it firmly in the after this gratin dish 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.800
 It is a degree table to get some hatchling 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.550
 Name g 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.890
 is b 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.970
 This is a mixture of anchovies and soft milk . This is an alternative to white sauce. 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:57.159
 I will put 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:02:00.369
 I think that I think it already seems like what it tastes like 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:04.210
 I think I will put enough cheese 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:10.280
 I also love cheese, so the rest is the oven 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:12.190
 In about 20 to 25 minutes in 100 degrees to 250 degrees approximately 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:20.280
 done 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:21.590
 Now finished I was Ow E-brown and there is possible to have Ne scent 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.920
 here we go 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.920
 How is it? Completion of shrimp storage using pasteter 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.180
 Hm 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.180
 We Jai 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.939
 U 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:51.460
 The compatibility between cheese and shrimp is really good 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:57.910
 And I use milk instead of white sauce and 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:03:01.680
 As milk contains anchovies in the country, those who have never eaten anchovies are by all means 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.680
 I would like to try it
