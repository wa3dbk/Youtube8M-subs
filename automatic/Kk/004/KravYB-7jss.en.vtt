not<00:03:34.170> tell<00:03:34.320> that<00:03:34.440> just<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.769> gets<00:03:34.800> a<00:03:34.920> little

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
not tell that just so it gets a little

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.620

moist<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.370> then<00:03:35.489> this<00:03:35.550> goes<00:03:35.760> on<00:03:35.880> top<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.239> then

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
moist and then this goes on top and then

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.759 
moist and then this goes on top and then
you<00:03:36.720> start<00:03:36.959> again<00:03:37.019> so<00:03:37.320> we're<00:03:37.410> gonna<00:03:37.500> start

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
the matter which way yeah but you do it

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.229 
the matter which way yeah but you do it
differently<00:03:43.800> it<00:03:44.190> really<00:03:44.549> doesn't<00:03:44.940> get<00:03:45.000> so

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
simple it's hard to mess if I was doing

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:47.900 
simple it's hard to mess if I was doing
the<00:03:46.890> other<00:03:46.920> way<00:03:47.100> before<00:03:47.250> but<00:03:47.519> on<00:03:47.640> say<00:03:47.820> it's
