00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.499
 Hello people, here it is finally a kite dick 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.419
 To establish a company with the extra fat I have only one finger in it 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:12.570
 but good you have to see what you have in a situation 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.989
 makes it 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:17.769
 and that's why I finally have several different syncro soft finally 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.230
 she's always big like someone 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.069
 17 clock begins 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:25.769
 2 Mark Bly 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.789
 a colossal fights 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.499
 a single tear after 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.290
 Samer Sparrow also has Rosenbauer 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.990
 Pachter Strache 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.930
 Star dust 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.770
 Qatar so 8 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.180
 we claim 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.480
 and therefore not as big as mine 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.320
 the other one off 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.140
 and now discovered 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.140
 that was not the complete extra thick 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.060
 about commercial Weichert rent extra tip 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.810
 a blue-eyed ultimate revenge 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.670
 So percent can already see that the dragon mountain on the 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.180
 blue-eyed white dragon is constructed 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.340
 I defiantly defiantly 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.440
 and a Dragon Master MA 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.760
 5000 visitors Effect 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.050
 the view points every day on my side of the field 500 extra 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.410
 Points and already has 5000 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.480
 and really cool Cat 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.480
 April starts with the normal monsters of Manta x 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.230
 Dragon the Cave of 2000 Defense Position What more could you want 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.100
 make such 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.230
 Although more is enough I had once I played it 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.550
 but that was beside 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.000
 There are four of them 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 four stars breaks 100 super 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.880
 a rotor every Schwarzenbacher 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.790
 the viewer himself a gig 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.350
 pretty bad 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.080
 normal monster seven stars 2400 attack 2000 distribution points 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.870
 as I can not do anything with it 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.300
 but if you have the rotor-gene dark dragon then he has 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.510
 he is quite good 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.530
 so 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.299
 then 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.609
 three white of the 8th 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:11.869
 8 stars 3000 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:14.869
 very well 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.539
 so now to the effects monsters 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:20.519
 Vanguard of the dragons 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.159
 I can lay a firecracker from the hand in the cemetery then crawls this 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.849
 300 card and has four stars 2000 different points 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.409
 and if a cartoon effect of my opponent in the cemetery 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.409
 I can throw a normal pocket monster thrown 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.710
 Aras, for example, can be in the Weissacher 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.299
 because he does not stand steps 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.929
 not bad at all 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:47.669
 Gallerier make Klopp protects in Aachen from too high quality corner 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:49.529
 took 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:52.529
 Mattner Aachen to synchronize 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:56.139
 two masked dragons 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.179
 percent 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:59.779
 looking for the cards 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.359
 Of course Emtec is very relieved by her 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.569
 can be a kite with a thousand 500 or less items but out of my way 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.569
 Special shoe undefeated honest Cape Town will 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.259
 two-headed melancholy 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:19.499
 the skat is good there if it gets destroyed once again 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:22.499
 come back with a thousand other Sunthausen perfumes points 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:25.799
 very good actually 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.599
 so 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.449
 2 Sievert emperors 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.999
 Galler two tribute users for the tribute show by a non-monster 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:34.609
 to be used 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.609
 because we have three white dragons and all are not 

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:41.789
 actually very good 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:43.789
 Koehler revenge 

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:45.439
 who do business in the year 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.480
 because with the known pieces can be the monster 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.859
 Dragon Munster 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.000
 level 7 from a cemetery 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 summon as special shoes 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:59.899
 and then I can attack target so if Perry is attacked 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.459
 on this monster around left when I return then for example wheat stuff 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:05.119
 without 

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:08.239
 yes, then he no longer fought with the little he so close to the 3008 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:13.559
 an engine before and above their life or register it again 

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:16.139
 get back 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.139
 Kruppa Dragon around 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.729
 4 billion destroyers 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.889
 Ederer serve 4 million but only during the Battle for the Planet 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.309
 the opponent 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:30.180
 Marschner 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.300
 good reputation to defend 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.849
 Tiger revenge 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:39.300
 you can also file it to a month 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.150
 With beautiful 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.570
 look at a kind of Mona Empire because if it comes by percent tribute incantation 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.300
 he can use two to the stretcher concealed to accident and destroy the opponent 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.120
 controlled 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.020
 Aachen turned white 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.610
 good effect 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.970
 and a rotor rather dark revenge 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.969
 something with the dragons 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:02.520
 as a shiny black soldier is still missing 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.520
 for the merger 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:08.860
 Sauter org 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.860
 black gloss ride before 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:14.999
 Percent rebirth 

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:17.370
 telltale swords 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.849
 fine control 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:21.379
 lightning strike 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:24.339
 WÃ¼st the show under radio 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:27.639
 Marsh if instructing us to redirect all attack deployment opinion 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.930
 question 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.910
 witty map of the opponents must guess which monster is doing just fine 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.020
 you are fat when he lives wrong what is usually it 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:42.909
 then I can lock the monster special mix 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:46.749
 Dragon tide 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:48.250
 Fusion Store 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.250
 because that saved Colin Gillis action twice 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.210
 and reduce costs 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.210
 since we have taken quite a few high-level monsters 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.059
 Of course that makes it much easier 

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:03.419
 the complaints 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.069
 Scare the bellow 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:08.899
 I do not know exactly what the top corner is it is 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.700
 Misprint I have no idea 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.930
 In any case, very cool card b ends up being the Battle Faso so to speak 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:22.150
 because my opponent can not attack this turn 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.150
 once the sim card has activated 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:30.099
 Rainbow life 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:33.659
 Stockton have 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:38.839
 Stress test of a traveler brings you a lot of defense of proximity 

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:40.900
 Enemy must if he attacks 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.919
 choose a card of my hand 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:46.350
 and then say if that went to the Monster Zone Far East men case wrote that 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:49.349
 Monster left Grafite on his hand 

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:52.399
 if he gets really fit just keep going 

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:54.710
 and a jacket too big 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.469
 that was my kite fat 

00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:59.180
 Causa failed 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.990
 Please write what is distributed again 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.699
 and then until next time Shari
