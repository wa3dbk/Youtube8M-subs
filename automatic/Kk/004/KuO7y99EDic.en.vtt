Sol<00:00:38.790> Republic<00:00:38.940> headsets<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.140> reviewed

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
Sol Republic headsets that I reviewed

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.310 
Sol Republic headsets that I reviewed
just<00:00:40.739> really<00:00:41.460> incredible<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.780> by<00:00:43.050> far<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
just really incredible it's by far the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.479 
just really incredible it's by far the
best<00:00:43.530> times<00:00:43.920> I've<00:00:44.340> ever<00:00:44.430> owned<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.820> my<00:00:44.879> life

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
best times I've ever owned in my life

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:54.729 
best times I've ever owned in my life
hopefully<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:48.420> one<00:00:48.950> will<00:00:49.950> not<00:00:50.129> disappoint

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:02.900 

so<00:00:56.480> it's<00:00:57.480> got<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:59.030> really<00:01:00.030> funky<00:01:01.879> there

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
so it's got this really funky there

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.609 
so it's got this really funky there
ergonomic<00:01:03.750> kind<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.229> like<00:01:04.409> headset<00:01:05.040> band<00:01:05.400> and

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
ergonomic kind of like headset band and

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.320 
ergonomic kind of like headset band and
the<00:01:07.619> main<00:01:07.799> difference<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.430> between<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
the main difference is between the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.600 
the main difference is between the
regular<00:01:09.750> tracks<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.470> HD<00:01:11.130> tracks<00:01:11.659> are<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
regular tracks and HD tracks are the

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.330 
regular tracks and HD tracks are the
sides<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:16.110> cans<00:01:16.350> themselves<00:01:17.159> it's

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
sides of the cans themselves it's

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.870 
sides of the cans themselves it's
actually<00:01:17.790> stainless<00:01:18.240> steel<00:01:19.310> so<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
actually stainless steel so it's a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.060 
actually stainless steel so it's a
little<00:01:21.060> bit<00:01:21.150> more<00:01:21.299> durable<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.680> other<00:01:22.860> one

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
little bit more durable the other one

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.800 
little bit more durable the other one
actually<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.640> more<00:01:23.790> plastic<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.540> kind<00:01:24.780> of

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
actually is more plastic it's kind of

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.370 
actually is more plastic it's kind of
like<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.229> reflective<00:01:25.799> plastic<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:27.380> this

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
like it's reflective plastic and this

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:37.270 
like it's reflective plastic and this
one<00:01:28.850> has<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:31.460> Sol<00:01:32.460> Republic<00:01:34.250> logo<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:36.030> top

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
one has the Sol Republic logo on the top

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.399 
one has the Sol Republic logo on the top
so<00:01:38.280> these<00:01:38.820> are<00:01:39.030> actually<00:01:39.479> memory<00:01:39.810> foams<00:01:40.110> I

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
so these are actually memory foams I

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.350 
so these are actually memory foams I
thought<00:01:41.100> they<00:01:41.250> were<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:41.460> regular<00:01:41.700> foams<00:01:42.119> but

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
thought they were just regular foams but

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.230 
thought they were just regular foams but
I<00:01:42.780> actually<00:01:43.079> did<00:01:43.530> check<00:01:43.880> they're<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.000> fact

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
I actually did check they're in fact

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.030 
I actually did check they're in fact
memory<00:01:45.720> foam<00:01:45.899> that's<00:01:46.170> why<00:01:46.380> they're<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:46.710> comfy

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
memory foam that's why they're so comfy

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.600 
memory foam that's why they're so comfy
so<00:01:48.890> what<00:01:49.890> else<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.340> here

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
so what else is in here

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.010 
so what else is in here
oh<00:01:51.649> that's<00:01:52.649> cool<00:01:53.070> it's<00:01:53.430> got<00:01:53.729> like<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.180> really

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
this is really gonna be a lot better

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:47.930 
this is really gonna be a lot better
than<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.860> other<00:02:34.920> one<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:47.040> far<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:47.550> good<00:02:47.580> it

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
than the other one so far so good it

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.630 
than the other one so far so good it
fits<00:02:48.720> really<00:02:48.990> well<00:02:49.190> it's<00:02:50.190> very<00:02:50.430> comfy<00:02:50.850> and

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
fits really well it's very comfy and

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.280 
fits really well it's very comfy and
it's<00:02:53.640> definitely<00:02:54.180> solid<00:02:54.600> like<00:02:54.900> they<00:02:55.170> actually

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
it's definitely solid like they actually

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.340 
it's definitely solid like they actually
say<00:02:55.770> that<00:02:55.980> this<00:02:56.250> part<00:02:56.760> right<00:02:56.940> here<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:58.110> band

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
say that this part right here the band

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.830 
say that this part right here the band
is<00:02:58.590> pretty<00:02:58.800> much<00:02:59.010> indestructible<00:02:59.460> and<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.600> kind

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
is pretty much indestructible and I kind

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.320 
is pretty much indestructible and I kind
of<00:03:00.870> believe<00:03:01.140> them<00:03:01.350> it's<00:03:01.650> very<00:03:02.130> durable<00:03:02.430> like

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
of believe them it's very durable like

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.940 
of believe them it's very durable like
actually<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:03.840> did<00:03:04.230> try<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.970> beats<00:03:05.970> by<00:03:06.240> dre<00:03:06.950> and

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
actually I did try the beats by dre and

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.550 
actually I did try the beats by dre and
the<00:03:08.880> ones<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:09.270> actually<00:03:09.390> fold<00:03:09.930> are<00:03:10.200> very

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
the ones that actually fold are very

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.070 
the ones that actually fold are very
flimsy<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:11.370> feel<00:03:12.150> like<00:03:12.330> they<00:03:12.540> would<00:03:12.660> just<00:03:12.720> break

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
flimsy I feel like they would just break

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.530 
flimsy I feel like they would just break
and<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:14.190> know<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.520> someone<00:03:14.760> like<00:03:14.970> me<00:03:15.270> who's

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
and you know and someone like me who's

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
like either at the gym or running or

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.220 
like either at the gym or running or
working<00:03:17.970> out<00:03:18.300> like<00:03:18.600> something<00:03:18.959> like<00:03:19.200> that

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
working out like something like that

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.370 
working out like something like that
would<00:03:19.680> just<00:03:19.709> be<00:03:20.040> like<00:03:20.250> I<00:03:20.900> don't<00:03:21.900> know<00:03:22.050> I<00:03:22.320> just

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
would just be like I don't know I just

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.400 
would just be like I don't know I just
wouldn't<00:03:22.830> last<00:03:23.010> with<00:03:23.250> me<00:03:23.459> so<00:03:23.820> um<00:03:24.060> I<00:03:24.320> think<00:03:25.320> this

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
wouldn't last with me so um I think this

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.790 
wouldn't last with me so um I think this
design<00:03:25.770> is<00:03:25.830> so<00:03:26.130> much<00:03:26.280> better<00:03:26.489> -<00:03:27.200> so<00:03:28.200> let's<00:03:28.560> see

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
design is so much better - so let's see

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.680 
design is so much better - so let's see
how<00:03:28.980> well<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.310> performs<00:03:29.820> I'm<00:03:30.090> gonna<00:03:30.300> listen<00:03:30.540> to
