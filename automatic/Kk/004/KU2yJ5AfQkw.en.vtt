athletes have asked me how they can

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.890 
athletes have asked me how they can
generate<00:00:10.139> more<00:00:10.469> power<00:00:10.889> in<00:00:11.340> their<00:00:11.910> swing<00:00:12.269> so<00:00:12.870> a

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
generate more power in their swing so a

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.120 
generate more power in their swing so a
lot<00:00:13.050> of<00:00:13.080> our<00:00:13.200> Batesville<00:00:13.590> athletes<00:00:14.009> are

ball farther hit it longer now will is
already<00:00:21.989> gone<00:00:22.169> through<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.470> full<00:00:22.800> rolling<00:00:23.130> and

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
already gone through a full rolling and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.150 
already gone through a full rolling and
the<00:00:24.329> dynamic<00:00:24.869> warm-up<00:00:25.259> he's<00:00:25.800> done<00:00:25.980> some

the dynamic warm-up he's done some
corrective<00:00:26.460> exercises<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.210> now<00:00:27.300> we're<00:00:27.419> going

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
corrective exercises and now we're going

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:29.749 
corrective exercises and now we're going
to<00:00:27.599> write<00:00:27.899> some<00:00:28.290> rotational<00:00:28.980> exercises<00:00:29.669> that

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
to write some rotational exercises that

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.880 
to write some rotational exercises that
are<00:00:29.790> going<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.059> help<00:00:30.239> him<00:00:30.320> generate<00:00:31.320> more

go<00:00:56.420> good<00:00:57.420> stop<00:00:57.860> now<00:00:58.860> to<00:00:58.920> make<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.220> a<00:00:59.280> little

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
go good stop now to make this a little

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.220 
go good stop now to make this a little
more<00:00:59.820> challenging<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.720> progress<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
more challenging and to progress the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.780 
more challenging and to progress the
exercises<00:01:01.800> food<00:01:01.980> weeks<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.430> can<00:01:02.610> move

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
exercises food weeks you can move

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.399 
exercises food weeks you can move
slightly<00:01:03.120> back<00:01:03.450> right<00:01:03.810> there's<00:01:03.989> good<00:01:04.199> we'll

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
slightly back right there's good we'll

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.600 
slightly back right there's good we'll
start<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.979> get<00:01:05.070> nice<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.280> slow<00:01:05.579> and<00:01:07.610> now

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
start to get nice and slow and now

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.190 
start to get nice and slow and now
moving<00:01:09.030> back<00:01:09.240> gonna<00:01:09.600> force<00:01:09.900> him<00:01:10.050> to<00:01:10.080> throw

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
moving back gonna force him to throw

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.320 
moving back gonna force him to throw
that<00:01:10.500> ball<00:01:10.650> harder<00:01:11.040> creating<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.670> rotational

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
that ball harder creating the rotational

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.920 
that ball harder creating the rotational
power<00:01:16.250> good<00:01:17.250> snack<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.760> exercise<00:01:18.240> Will's

power good snack and exercise Will's

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.820 
power good snack and exercise Will's
gonna<00:01:19.080> stand<00:01:19.409> facing<00:01:19.680> me<00:01:20.720> and<00:01:21.770> now<00:01:22.770> we're

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
gonna stand facing me and now we're

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.550 
gonna stand facing me and now we're
gonna<00:01:23.010> move<00:01:23.190> that<00:01:23.250> same<00:01:23.729> right<00:01:24.120> side<00:01:24.450> nice<00:01:25.320> and

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
gonna move that same right side nice and

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.560 
gonna move that same right side nice and
slow

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
slow

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.750 
slow
when<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.600> say<00:01:27.870> go<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.350> gonna<00:01:28.470> do<00:01:28.650> 10<00:01:28.950> powerful

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
when I say go it's gonna do 10 powerful

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.890 
when I say go it's gonna do 10 powerful
quick<00:01:30.000> let's<00:01:30.270> go<00:01:34.940> good<00:01:35.940> now<00:01:36.299> here<00:01:36.510> in<00:01:36.570> language

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
quick let's go good now here in language

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.840 
quick let's go good now here in language
we<00:01:37.049> use<00:01:37.200> our<00:01:37.320> cinderblock<00:01:37.770> walls<00:01:38.040> we<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.640> 10

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
we use our cinderblock walls we have 10

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.609 
we use our cinderblock walls we have 10
pounds<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.479> balls<00:01:39.659> Will's<00:01:40.020> progress<00:01:40.440> up

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
pounds of balls Will's progress up

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.560 
pounds of balls Will's progress up
taxing<00:01:41.040> them<00:01:41.159> using<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.580> 15<00:01:42.060> pound<00:01:42.360> medicine

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
taxing them using the 15 pound medicine

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.719 
taxing them using the 15 pound medicine
ball<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.110> then<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:43.650> can<00:01:43.799> even<00:01:43.950> get<00:01:44.220> up<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.400> even

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
ball and then we can even get up to even

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.210 
ball and then we can even get up to even
heavier<00:01:45.090> loads<00:01:45.750> throwing<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.619> ball<00:01:46.770> harder

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
heavier loads throwing the ball harder

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.789 
heavier loads throwing the ball harder
and<00:01:47.340> harder<00:01:47.670> creating<00:01:48.000> more<00:01:48.180> rotational

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
and harder creating more rotational

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.380 
and harder creating more rotational
power<00:01:49.799> now<00:01:50.549> one<00:01:50.850> will

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.370 

go<00:01:54.390> ahead<00:01:55.580> he's<00:01:56.580> loading<00:01:57.450> map<00:01:57.720> and<00:01:57.990> then

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
go ahead he's loading map and then

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.710 
go ahead he's loading map and then
exploding<00:01:59.010> loading<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.119> then<00:02:00.210> explode

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
exploding loading and then explode

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.200 
exploding loading and then explode
Laurie<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.950> exploding<00:02:02.460> he's<00:02:02.550> not<00:02:02.729> stopping

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
Laurie and exploding he's not stopping

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.359 
Laurie and exploding he's not stopping
Midway<00:02:03.570> he's<00:02:04.320> letting<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.710> ball<00:02:04.950> take<00:02:05.190> him

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
Midway he's letting the ball take him

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.060 
Midway he's letting the ball take him
back<00:02:05.550> and<00:02:05.820> those<00:02:06.210> exploding<00:02:08.119> good<00:02:09.860> so<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:10.920> can

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
back and those exploding good so you can

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.560
