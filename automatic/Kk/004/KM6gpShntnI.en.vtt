00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.849
 coconut and freezes hope you're fine 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.080
 so today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.570
 nail art tutorial 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.950
 I know it's been a long time since I 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.630
 did not do it and I decided to do 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.730
 something easy for us 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.310
 all we can get there and have 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.660
 spectacularly beautiful hockey nails 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.400
 today I did not say bernie because 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.830
 that precisely I removed this varnish there 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.990
 but before that I'll introduce you to 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.070
 galaxy nail art so firstly that 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.070
 looks like this 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.100
 and it's really like I tell you 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.230
 saying something 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.879
 it's very simple to achieve you'll have 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.309
 need some varnish in shades 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.230
 blue violet pink a white and 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.430
 glitter for the stars but especially 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.989
 you will need a point of stupidity 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.030
 foam are the little brushes that we 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.640
 so wrong is a make-up and who 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.989
 are not tip top to realize the 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.909
 makeup for the eyes but for those 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.680
 born the bow it's great it's a lot 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.659
 simpler than a sponge 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.940
 we have not everywhere on the hands and I 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.310
 you swear it's very easy to do 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.090
 so if this is the one you like and 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.390
