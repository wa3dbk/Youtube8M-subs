00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.620
 duel with the whole enemy garrison 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.709

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.970
 the lonely tank crew of Paul Paul was 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.400
 opportunity to lay low in the city and 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.870
 wait for their own but the Soviet tankers 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.030

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.590
