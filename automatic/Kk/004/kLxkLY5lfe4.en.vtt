00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
catch them by pushing them into a corner

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.490 
catch them by pushing them into a corner
and<00:00:22.000> working<00:00:22.240> them<00:00:22.570> together<00:00:22.779> when<00:00:23.349> you're

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
and working them together when you're

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.990 
and working them together when you're
moving<00:00:23.800> them<00:00:23.920> from<00:00:24.070> one<00:00:24.160> pasture<00:00:24.610> to<00:00:24.970> another

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.420 
moving them from one pasture to another
or<00:00:25.480> from<00:00:25.540> one<00:00:26.020> pen<00:00:26.259> to<00:00:26.470> another<00:00:26.739> they<00:00:27.279> will

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
or from one pen to another they will

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.609 
or from one pen to another they will
often<00:00:27.880> follow<00:00:28.390> each<00:00:28.630> other<00:00:28.869> and<00:00:29.140> move

together<00:00:30.239> sheep<00:00:31.239> often<00:00:31.840> startle<00:00:32.349> very<00:00:32.529> easily

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
together sheep often startle very easily

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.160 
together sheep often startle very easily
therefore<00:00:33.670> they<00:00:33.790> might<00:00:33.970> jump<00:00:34.329> or<00:00:34.660> they<00:00:34.989> can

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
therefore they might jump or they can

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.750 
therefore they might jump or they can
often<00:00:35.350> but<00:00:35.710> you<00:00:35.860> with<00:00:35.980> their<00:00:36.160> heads<00:00:36.370> as<00:00:36.579> well

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
when pushing them into a corner it's the

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.790 
when pushing them into a corner it's the
sheep's<00:00:39.489> instinct<00:00:40.059> to<00:00:40.329> flee<00:00:40.510> not<00:00:41.260> fight<00:00:41.590> back

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.849 
them sheep and goats tend to be very
sure-footed<00:00:52.059> so<00:00:52.750> they<00:00:52.899> handle<00:00:53.230> a<00:00:53.320> variety<00:00:53.440> of

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859 
sure-footed so they handle a variety of

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.250 
sure-footed so they handle a variety of
fluorine<00:00:54.309> and<00:00:54.489> floor<00:00:55.089> surfaces<00:00:55.660> very<00:00:55.719> well

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
is a simple rope halter however many

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.080 
is a simple rope halter however many
people<00:01:16.290> use<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.890> rope<00:01:17.070> halter<00:01:17.280> incorrectly

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
people use the rope halter incorrectly

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.670

or putting it on incorrectly and

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.530 
or putting it on incorrectly and
therefore<00:01:20.220> do<00:01:20.370> not<00:01:20.490> have<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.880> full<00:01:21.090> control

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
therefore do not have this full control

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.810 
therefore do not have this full control
over<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> animal<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.920> part<00:01:23.190> that<00:01:23.400> slides

over the animal the part that slides
through<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.780> loop<00:01:25.010> should<00:01:26.010> go<00:01:26.190> under<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
through the loop should go under the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.840 
through the loop should go under the
chin<00:01:26.910> and<00:01:27.150> come<00:01:27.750> out<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.080> Lambs<00:01:28.380> left<00:01:28.980> side<00:01:29.280> so

hand the middle part goes over the nose
and<00:01:34.230> the<00:01:34.620> top<00:01:34.830> part<00:01:35.070> goes<00:01:35.370> right<00:01:35.940> behind<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
and the top part goes right behind the

when entering the pen to catch a lamb

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.720 
when entering the pen to catch a lamb
it's<00:01:57.260> a<00:01:57.410> good<00:01:57.590> idea<00:01:57.740> to<00:01:57.950> bunch<00:01:58.280> them<00:01:58.520> in<00:01:58.640> a

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
it's a good idea to bunch them in a

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.700 
it's a good idea to bunch them in a
corner<00:01:59.060> because<00:01:59.390> they<00:01:59.720> are<00:01:59.870> gregarious<00:02:00.410> as<00:02:00.590> we

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
corner because they are gregarious as we

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.860 
corner because they are gregarious as we
mentioned<00:02:01.040> in<00:02:01.220> nature<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.330> they<00:02:02.480> liked<00:02:02.750> a

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
mentioned in nature so they liked a

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.110 
mentioned in nature so they liked a
bunch<00:02:03.080> push<00:02:03.590> them<00:02:03.770> into<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.010> corner<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:04.670> then

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
bunch push them into the corner and then

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.660 
bunch push them into the corner and then
catch<00:02:05.360> them<00:02:05.540> around<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:06.080> lower<00:02:06.290> jaw<00:02:06.670> moving

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
catch them around the lower jaw moving

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.090 
catch them around the lower jaw moving
up<00:02:07.910> along<00:02:08.060> their<00:02:08.450> side<00:02:08.690> this<00:02:09.500> is<00:02:09.710> also<00:02:09.920> a

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
up along their side this is also a

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.740 
up along their side this is also a
points<00:02:10.580> where<00:02:10.760> you<00:02:10.790> could<00:02:11.120> get<00:02:11.270> knocked<00:02:11.510> over

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
points where you could get knocked over

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.890 
points where you could get knocked over
or<00:02:12.590> but<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.460> as<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.850> animal<00:02:14.240> tries<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.690> flee

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
or but it as the animal tries to flee

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:22.880 
or but it as the animal tries to flee
from<00:02:15.050> you
