00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.370 

kind<00:05:17.970> of<00:05:18.030> an<00:05:18.120> interesting<00:05:18.360> take<00:05:19.050> on<00:05:19.199> the

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
kind of an interesting take on the

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.830 
kind of an interesting take on the
Ibanez<00:05:19.919> logo<00:05:20.520> without<00:05:20.759> the<00:05:21.060> little<00:05:21.240> swoop<00:05:21.630> D

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
Ibanez logo without the little swoop D

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.719 
Ibanez logo without the little swoop D
it's<00:05:22.320> still<00:05:22.530> the<00:05:22.620> same<00:05:22.800> font<00:05:23.190> but<00:05:23.430> without<00:05:23.639> the

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
it's still the same font but without the

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:31.279 
it's still the same font but without the
little<00:05:23.880> wood<00:05:24.270> I<00:05:29.750> really<00:05:30.750> like<00:05:30.900> the<00:05:30.990> fact<00:05:31.139> that

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
little wood I really like the fact that

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.620 
little wood I really like the fact that
it's<00:05:31.500> neck<00:05:31.710> through<00:05:32.479> usually<00:05:33.479> that's

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
it's neck through usually that's

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.870 
it's neck through usually that's
sustained<00:05:34.310> basically<00:05:35.310> this<00:05:35.460> guitar<00:05:35.729> is<00:05:35.850> a

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
sustained basically this guitar is a

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.990 
sustained basically this guitar is a
very<00:05:36.090> solid<00:05:36.479> chunk<00:05:36.720> of<00:05:36.810> wood<00:05:37.580> because<00:05:38.580> there's

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
very solid chunk of wood because there's

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.749 
very solid chunk of wood because there's
no<00:05:39.410> route<00:05:40.410> for<00:05:40.860> a<00:05:40.889> Floyd<00:05:41.580> Rose<00:05:41.910> or<00:05:43.340> any<00:05:44.340> kind<00:05:44.669> of

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 
no route for a Floyd Rose or any kind of

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:48.589 
no route for a Floyd Rose or any kind of
neck<00:05:45.120> pocket<00:05:45.630> thing<00:05:45.840> going<00:05:46.139> on<00:05:46.669> it's<00:05:47.669> just<00:05:48.150> one

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
neck pocket thing going on it's just one

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.469 
neck pocket thing going on it's just one
great<00:05:48.870> big<00:05:48.990> resonating<00:05:49.919> piece<00:05:50.070> of<00:05:50.250> wood<00:05:50.479> which

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
great big resonating piece of wood which

00:05:51.479 --> 00:06:03.110 
great big resonating piece of wood which
is<00:05:51.590> pretty<00:05:52.590> good<00:05:52.710> for<00:05:52.770> the<00:05:52.949> tone<00:05:53.130> I<00:05:53.160> think

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.770 

four<00:06:03.570> days

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
four days

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.530 
four days
you<00:06:04.990> go<00:06:05.320> out<00:06:05.500> ever<00:06:06.040> buy<00:06:06.340> and<00:06:06.910> come<00:06:07.120> back<00:06:07.300> and

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
you go out ever buy and come back and

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.890 
you go out ever buy and come back and
still<00:06:07.780> be<00:06:07.900> going

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.620 

of<00:06:13.320> course<00:06:13.860> not<00:06:14.790> everybody<00:06:15.180> likes<00:06:15.389> a<00:06:15.480> neck

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
of course not everybody likes a neck

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.150 
of course not everybody likes a neck
through<00:06:15.930> some<00:06:16.350> people<00:06:16.560> think<00:06:16.740> that<00:06:16.770> a<00:06:16.860> bolt-on

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
through some people think that a bolt-on

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.110 
through some people think that a bolt-on
sounds<00:06:17.460> better<00:06:18.620> personally<00:06:19.620> I<00:06:19.650> like<00:06:20.120> the

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
sounds better personally I like the

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.420 
sounds better personally I like the
stability<00:06:21.570> of<00:06:21.600> a<00:06:21.720> neck<00:06:21.930> through<00:06:22.229> because<00:06:22.650> what

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
stability of a neck through because what

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.800 
stability of a neck through because what
you<00:06:23.520> don't<00:06:23.729> get<00:06:24.000> that<00:06:24.270> you<00:06:24.360> didn't<00:06:24.600> get<00:06:24.690> on
