00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
drop five drop but it's got very good

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.389 
drop five drop but it's got very good
mana<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.790> we<00:00:41.790> can<00:00:41.940> cast<00:00:42.090> anything<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.570> can

mana and we can cast anything we can
draw<00:00:45.140> obviously<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.440> not<00:00:46.680> great<00:00:47.280> if<00:00:47.700> we

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
draw obviously it's not great if we

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.799 
draw obviously it's not great if we
don't<00:00:48.360> get<00:00:48.719> some<00:00:49.610> early<00:00:50.610> drops<00:00:50.969> but<00:00:51.329> we<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.780> a

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
don't get some early drops but we have a

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.590 
don't get some early drops but we have a
lot<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.960> 3<00:00:52.170> drops<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:53.219> seems<00:00:53.370> fine<00:00:53.600> this

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
lot of 3 drops and this seems fine this

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.130 
lot of 3 drops and this seems fine this
will<00:00:54.750> not<00:00:54.870> mulligan<00:00:56.449> we<00:00:57.449> lost<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.989> die<00:00:58.109> roll

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
will not mulligan we lost the die roll

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.400 
will not mulligan we lost the die roll
again<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.829> he<00:00:59.190> gets<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.460> play<00:00:59.550> first<00:01:00.410> civic

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
again and he gets to play first civic

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.539 
again and he gets to play first civic
saber<00:01:01.649> that's<00:01:01.770> probably<00:01:02.219> not<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.370> great<00:01:02.550> sign

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
saber that's probably not a great sign

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.820 
saber that's probably not a great sign
that<00:01:05.549> means<00:01:05.729> he<00:01:05.909> could<00:01:06.060> easily<00:01:06.560> be<00:01:07.560> some<00:01:07.710> sort

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
that means he could easily be some sort

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.120 
that means he could easily be some sort
of<00:01:07.920> aggro<00:01:08.189> deck<00:01:09.560> sabers<00:01:10.560> not<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> worst<00:01:10.950> i

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
of aggro deck sabers not the worst i

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.560 
of aggro deck sabers not the worst i
guess<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.490> lets<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.760> guys<00:01:11.909> kind<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.270> trade<00:01:12.450> up

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
guess it lets you guys kind of trade up

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.929 
guess it lets you guys kind of trade up
a<00:01:12.689> little<00:01:12.930> bit<00:01:14.420> that's<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.509> good<00:01:15.600> draw<00:01:16.490> so<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:17.850> we

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
a little bit that's a good draw so if we

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.460 
a little bit that's a good draw so if we
draw<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> 3<00:01:18.509> drop<00:01:18.720> here<00:01:18.900> I'm<00:01:19.049> feeling<00:01:19.350> pretty

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
draw a 3 drop here I'm feeling pretty

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.490 
draw a 3 drop here I'm feeling pretty
good<00:01:20.390> otherwise<00:01:22.700> helping<00:01:23.700> out<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.909> best

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
good otherwise helping out the best

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.280 
good otherwise helping out the best
alright<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.770> he<00:01:25.890> has<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> 42<00:01:26.460> flyer<00:01:27.200> well<00:01:28.200> at

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
alright so he has a 42 flyer well at

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.569 
alright so he has a 42 flyer well at
least<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.530> can<00:01:28.619> trade<00:01:28.890> with<00:01:28.920> an<00:01:29.159> eyes<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
least we can trade with an eyes in the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:38.639 
least we can trade with an eyes in the
sky<00:01:30.829> he<00:01:32.390> isn't<00:01:33.390> going<00:01:33.479> very<00:01:33.570> well<00:01:35.600> yep<00:01:36.600> pass

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
sky he isn't going very well yep pass

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.809 
sky he isn't going very well yep pass
so<00:01:39.649> I<00:01:40.100> guess<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:40.579> plan<00:01:40.789> is<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:42.729> trade<00:01:43.729> with

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
so I guess the plan is to trade with

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:46.240 
so I guess the plan is to trade with
that<00:01:43.969> next<00:01:44.210> turn<00:01:44.679> since<00:01:45.679> we<00:01:45.799> kind<00:01:46.039> of<00:01:46.100> just

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
that next turn since we kind of just

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.209 
that next turn since we kind of just
have<00:01:46.399> to<00:01:46.520> take<00:01:46.640> it<00:01:46.789> here<00:01:46.939> and<00:01:48.039> just<00:01:49.039> hope<00:01:49.130> he

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
have to take it here and just hope he

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:52.389 
have to take it here and just hope he
doesn't<00:01:49.250> play<00:01:49.549> a<00:01:49.579> land<00:01:50.380> nope<00:01:51.380> mono<00:01:52.100> blue

interesting nope still don't have
anything<00:01:58.209> this<00:01:59.209> is<00:01:59.390> exactly<00:01:59.719> what<00:02:00.109> our<00:02:00.140> for

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
anything this is exactly what our for

drop<00:02:00.979> five<00:02:01.189> drop<00:02:01.429> hand<00:02:01.670> could<00:02:01.909> potentially<00:02:02.359> do

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
drop five drop hand could potentially do

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.789 
drop five drop hand could potentially do
as<00:02:03.950> I<00:02:04.039> don't<00:02:04.189> feel<00:02:04.280> too<00:02:04.549> guilty<00:02:04.729> here<00:02:08.709> so<00:02:09.709> he's

talking<00:05:12.730> like<00:05:12.880> this<00:05:12.970> games<00:05:13.210> over<00:05:13.360> it's

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
talking like this games over it's

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.080 
talking like this games over it's
probably<00:05:13.990> because<00:05:14.170> it<00:05:14.410> is<00:05:14.730> case<00:05:15.730> you<00:05:15.850> didn't

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
probably because it is case you didn't

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:24.810 
probably because it is case you didn't
guess<00:05:17.760> okay<00:05:20.340> no<00:05:21.340> pump<00:05:21.580> spell<00:05:23.550> swift<00:05:24.550> justice

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
guess okay no pump spell swift justice

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.050 
guess okay no pump spell swift justice
would<00:05:25.030> be<00:05:25.120> another<00:05:25.300> kick<00:05:25.540> in<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:25.690> nuts<00:05:25.950> okay
