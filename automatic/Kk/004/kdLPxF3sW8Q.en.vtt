00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
can poke it in the fork it's just kind

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.660 
can poke it in the fork it's just kind
of<00:03:22.409> like<00:03:23.299> almost<00:03:24.299> disassembly<00:03:25.430> it's<00:03:26.430> real

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
of like almost disassembly it's real

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.850 
of like almost disassembly it's real
real<00:03:26.849> soft<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.480> then<00:03:28.349> what<00:03:28.950> I'm<00:03:29.040> gonna<00:03:29.159> do<00:03:30.860> my

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.260 
not butter we're gonna add one and a
half<00:05:16.479> servings<00:05:17.310> serving<00:05:18.310> is<00:05:18.400> 15<00:05:18.759> grams<00:05:18.789> I

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
half servings serving is 15 grams I

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.580 
half servings serving is 15 grams I
think<00:05:19.419> I'm<00:05:19.479> gonna<00:05:19.569> do<00:05:19.979> 21<00:05:21.389> grams<00:05:22.389> that's<00:05:23.349> gonna

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
think I'm gonna do 21 grams that's gonna

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.620 
think I'm gonna do 21 grams that's gonna
equate<00:05:23.830> to<00:05:23.889> 12<00:05:24.370> grams<00:05:24.580> of<00:05:24.699> fat<00:05:24.909> nothing<00:05:25.449> else

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
equate to 12 grams of fat nothing else

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.159 
equate to 12 grams of fat nothing else
before<00:05:26.319> the<00:05:26.530> whole<00:05:26.680> thing<00:05:26.710> keep<00:05:27.099> in<00:05:27.130> mind<00:05:27.430> so

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
before the whole thing keep in mind so

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.459 
before the whole thing keep in mind so
let's<00:05:29.169> do<00:05:29.319> that<00:05:29.349> so<00:05:29.800> when<00:05:30.789> I<00:05:30.849> say<00:05:31.030> 21<00:05:31.870> why<00:05:32.289> am<00:05:32.409> i

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:32.469 
let's do that so when I say 21 why am i

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:38.119 
let's do that so when I say 21 why am i
adding<00:05:32.590> 21<00:05:33.099> grams<00:05:33.599> again<00:05:34.599> I<00:05:35.020> have<00:05:35.199> no<00:05:35.319> idea

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:38.129 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:47.760 

eighty

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:58.209 

okay<00:05:49.300> lastly<00:05:50.300> I'd<00:05:50.419> read<00:05:55.689> energy<00:05:56.689> a<00:05:57.219> half

00:05:58.209 --> 00:05:58.219 
okay lastly I'd read energy a half

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:01.240 
okay lastly I'd read energy a half
serving<00:05:58.669> of<00:05:58.759> cottage<00:05:59.060> cheese<00:05:59.090> wife<00:06:00.250> your
