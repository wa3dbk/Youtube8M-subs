 finished and proceed to unpacking itself 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:17.710
 I already showed a little how it looks

 back side of the camera side 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.970
 let's start by the way the camera on 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.310
 photos and videos for some reason 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.320
 it seemed so much more 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:37.340
 here but in life she is very very very 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:45.280
 small so we immediately see it 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:45.280
 instruction we have boxes so 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:57.130
 instruction in different languages japanese and 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.130
 english for 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:11.440
 so she looks like herself 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:22.610
 the camera is nothing more than a box with us 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:25.670
 no, she is miniature, this is a very fact 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.590
 I mean, compare with my hand 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.850
 my hands are not very big but very 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.360
 small two cameras and microphones and so 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.360

 normal usb inside a bit of a layout 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:15.360
