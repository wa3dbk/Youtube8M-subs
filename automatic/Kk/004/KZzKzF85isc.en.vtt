00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.450
 here is the cockpit 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.910
 so thanks to the cockpit I can fly 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.889
 my package in real time I find 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.350
 on the cockpit the number of my line 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.760
 the package I have subscribed and 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.189
 storytellers who told me that anytime where 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.080
 I am of my consumption 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:19.130
 I was told that also down there the number of 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.200
 days remaining before the next 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.489
 automatic reloading of my package 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.650
 So how does it work 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:27.259
 for example so I click on my 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.840
 package I see the offer I chose 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.550
 for my line here I retained the offer to 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.010
 10 euros and I customize them in 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.560
 adding 250 megawatts data so the 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.330
 total of my subscription is 13 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.250
 euros a month I could of a simple 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.790
 custom click differently package 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.790
 voices have changed 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.280
 in the cockpit so my consumption the one in 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.050
 real time here we see that I have nothing left 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.290
 more than eight minutes of calls on my 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.670
 package 2h and I have 25 days left 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.060
 their automatic loading of my 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.650
 flat rate 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.070
 I will reload my package 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.860
 now 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.740
 I add an hour I validate by my word 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.510
 password and that's my cockpit 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.190
 instantly updated and I have 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.190
 now 1h08 call 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.750
 even to go further if I need to 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.940
 interrupt my package a click on the 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.200
 button on off will suspend their 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.840
 automatic loading of malines who 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.770
 for now is expected in 25 days 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.690
 so of course in the meantime I can 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.750
 still use the credit that I already have 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.040
 bought and then I 'll be able to 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.960
 make a call but I could still 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.880
 receive calls receive text messages 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.740
 for six months and without losing my 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.370
 number at any time during 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.870
 these six months 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.120
 after two days after three 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.890
 month after six months I can 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.120
 return to select again 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.370
 package and here it is again 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.380
 the cockpit is an accessible web app 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.030
 from any smartphone and you 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.840
 find it also on the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.950
