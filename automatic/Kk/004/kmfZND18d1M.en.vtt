00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.070

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.970
 night treatments for your 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.579
 daniel bud hair and the bid of 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.369
 the nutrition line both are 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.659
 night treatments the garnier 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.989
 says it's a restorative treatment 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:31.050
 night of the line today river that has 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:33.660
 micro nutritious oils and says it is 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.140
 for damaged or sensitized hair 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.969
 and this one that is the nutrition bid is a 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.149
 treatment also nocturnal says that 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.079
 has an intensive action of 12 hours and 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.659
 says it's for dry or parched hair 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:52.190
 as for the amount the bernier 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:54.920
 brings more 200 ml and the bid trade 150 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.420
 ml the prices are out there of pity if 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.850
 they find offers are not in two 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.589
 by one what is usual in most 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.610
 of pharmacy chains can 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:07.220
 find now in regards to the community 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.880
 I really like the fructis dispenser 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.929
 and I find it more complicated and dirty to use 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.450
 look at the one of the bid el de l'orÃ©al el olor 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:19.190
 bernier fruit you know that 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.679
 It is wonderful and tastes like fruits 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.240
 tropical as well as insurmountable and the 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.420
 serving does not bother me but really 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.979
 I prefer the garnier 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.150
 as for the amounts I already told you 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.250
 this brings a little more with it 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.740
 amount of money bordering are between 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.780
 the 3,000 and 4,000 pesos depends on 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.100
 what time do you find it if you are or not in 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.409
 promotion and as to what they did 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.630
 with my hair I tell them 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.819
 l garnier is the second one I buy is 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.520
 the second I use and it's almost over 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:51.640
 finish the bid is the second I use 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.960
 but today it's going to be in the middle but in 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.590
 indeed the days when you used 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.659
 it is more or less the same an average of 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.290
 almost two months each separately 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:06.450
 this and then two months tetro 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:09.009
 l garnier I really like the first 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.120
 uses the first 34 days yo 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:17.410
 I really feel my hair a lot more 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.600
 soft much more docile and without frizz that's 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.220
 what I like most kept me frizz 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.430
 under control he uses it especially 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.560
 during the winter I liked it very much 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.690
 it dries pretty fast it does not leave the 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.330
 wet feeling of my hair and I do not know 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.610
 goop to 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.770
 the inconvenience that I found with this 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.120
 night treatment is that by going from 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.250
 the days I felt that I did not 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.100
 effect needed like so much more 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:45.200
 amount so that my hair like that 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.550
 I felt the same effect and then I gave myself 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.740
 realize that what was happening 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.930
 It was collapsing like my hair fiber 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.450
 because when I used to stamp me 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.340
 as clarifiers that have as their object 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.750
 how to get all the waste out of all 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.760
 the products that you were using 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.290
 in the day to day in your hair and forgetting 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.390
 sometimes there again sense the same 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.670
 effect as in the first time with the 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.470
 bid does not happen to me, what I do feel is 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.600
 which is less hydrating or less instant 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.410
 if you want, it does not reduce me so much 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.140
 frizz and if I leave that effect as a means 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.870
 like a weird average half gel texture 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.760
 then next how to apply a little 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.580
 the hair to each other but in the morning 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.680
 Sevilla immediately so that 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.830
 no longer exists in the background is no longer 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.920
 complication now in the long run the one that most 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.600
 I liked it is that of the day I noticed that my 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.640
 hair like it does not get used to like 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.530
 that does not collapse me like the fibers 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.260
 capillaries really absorb it and it's not 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.510
 like I'm filling in short and 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.190
 about creating a layer like greasy 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.560
 maybe a little annoying what it is that 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.390
 occurs with garnier fruit and also 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.200
 my hair reacts much better 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.360
 to products after this lacquer 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.100
 it feels good even using this what 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.680
 that did not happen to me with the garnier fruit 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.480
 that has as an effect like who 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.830
 repels a bit like competing a bit 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.540
 with the rest of the products that I 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.400
 I use for hair what I do not 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.230
 happens with the bid that gives me the 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.630
 feeling that if I do not have no 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.130
 give me as much medication as this 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.280
 my hair 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.900
 assimilates better and does not prevent does not interact 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.139
 in a bad way with the rest of the 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.329
 products 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.949
 so your precious one anyway 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.719
 like the others are excellent options 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:25.530
 but I 'm going to continue using the 

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:28.080
 elvis 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.560
 and this I'm going to thank you I'm going to 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.110
 let go so that would precisely give 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.030
 with this but I wanted to do the review 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.910
 because some of you asked me 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.190
 between things that have similar and 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.440
 the differences and I send them a kiss 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.230
 huge and remember that you can write me 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.550
 to my mail at the office at 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.260
 gmail.com to make me all your 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.330
 requests when instead of those 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.620
 little loves sweethearts colors and 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.200
 all those beautiful things that to me 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.580
 love send me tables and giant and the 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.580
 of another idea bye bye
