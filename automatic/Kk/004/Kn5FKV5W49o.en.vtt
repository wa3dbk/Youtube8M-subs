00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
really wasn't inexpensive I feel like

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.580 
really wasn't inexpensive I feel like
for<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.420> drugstore<00:02:18.960> was<00:02:19.020> like<00:02:19.170> fifteen

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
for the drugstore was like fifteen

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.650 
for the drugstore was like fifteen
dollars<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.310> used<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.210> in<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.420> one

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.500 
dollars and I used it in that one
tutorial<00:02:22.080> but<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:22.980> just<00:02:23.370> feel<00:02:23.640> like<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:24.150> clung

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
tutorial but I just feel like it clung

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.530 
tutorial but I just feel like it clung
to<00:02:24.720> all<00:02:24.900> my<00:02:25.110> dry<00:02:25.380> patches<00:02:25.710> and<00:02:26.250> just<00:02:26.520> was<00:02:27.450> like

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
to all my dry patches and just was like

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.110 
to all my dry patches and just was like
a<00:02:27.600> laser<00:02:27.960> beam<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:28.530> all<00:02:28.710> my<00:02:28.890> dry<00:02:29.130> spots<00:02:29.490> so<00:02:29.790> I

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
a laser beam to all my dry spots so I

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.000 
a laser beam to all my dry spots so I
don't<00:02:30.450> know<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.570> felt<00:02:31.020> I<00:02:31.290> feel<00:02:31.560> like<00:02:31.650> it's<00:02:31.800> more

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
don't know I felt I feel like it's more

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.220 
don't know I felt I feel like it's more
of<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.190> glorified<00:02:32.760> sunscreen<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.810> do<00:02:33.870> like

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
of a glorified sunscreen and I do like

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.080 
of a glorified sunscreen and I do like
the<00:02:34.290> texture<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.640> think<00:02:35.850> I'll<00:02:35.940> get

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
the texture of it and I think I'll get

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.670 
the texture of it and I think I'll get
more<00:02:36.270> use<00:02:36.480> out<00:02:36.630> of<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.840> in<00:02:36.960> the<00:02:37.050> summer<00:02:37.260> just

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
more use out of it in the summer just

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.320 
more use out of it in the summer just
when<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.040> need<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.310> sunscreen<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.150> really

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
when I need a sunscreen but it really

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.510 
when I need a sunscreen but it really
didn't<00:02:39.600> have<00:02:39.660> any<00:02:39.870> coverage<00:02:40.350> so<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:41.070> did<00:02:41.340> pick

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
didn't have any coverage so I did pick

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.680 
didn't have any coverage so I did pick

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.940 
together go
nicely<00:04:30.540> I<00:04:30.750> don't<00:04:31.260> know<00:04:31.320> if<00:04:31.440> it<00:04:31.560> was<00:04:31.650> because<00:04:31.800> I

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
nicely I don't know if it was because I

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.800 
nicely I don't know if it was because I
just<00:04:32.250> had<00:04:32.400> vaseline<00:04:33.000> on<00:04:33.120> my<00:04:33.240> lip<00:04:33.450> and<00:04:33.600> then<00:04:33.780> I

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
just had vaseline on my lip and then I

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.360 
just had vaseline on my lip and then I
put<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.110> lip<00:04:34.320> pencil<00:04:34.680> on<00:04:34.770> but<00:04:34.980> it<00:04:35.070> didn't

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
put the lip pencil on but it didn't

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.000 
put the lip pencil on but it didn't
really<00:04:35.870> opaquely<00:04:36.870> cover<00:04:37.320> it<00:04:37.500> so<00:04:37.530> I<00:04:37.650> think<00:04:37.740> if<00:04:37.920> I

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
really opaquely cover it so I think if I

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.010 
really opaquely cover it so I think if I
just<00:04:38.160> had<00:04:38.340> nothing<00:04:38.880> on<00:04:39.180> my<00:04:39.300> lip<00:04:39.510> and<00:04:39.540> put<00:04:39.810> it<00:04:39.900> on

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
just had nothing on my lip and put it on

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.290 
just had nothing on my lip and put it on
I'd<00:04:40.200> get<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.440> lot<00:04:40.650> more<00:04:40.680> coverage<00:04:41.280> but<00:04:41.940> in<00:04:42.150> that

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
I'd get a lot more coverage but in that

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.270 
I'd get a lot more coverage but in that
video<00:04:42.540> I<00:04:42.690> had<00:04:42.990> on<00:04:43.170> this<00:04:43.440> and<00:04:43.770> then<00:04:43.950> I<00:04:43.980> put<00:04:44.250> the

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
video I had on this and then I put the

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.550 
video I had on this and then I put the
gloss<00:04:44.550> on<00:04:44.790> top<00:04:44.820> and<00:04:45.300> I<00:04:45.390> really<00:04:45.960> really<00:04:46.290> liked

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
gloss on top and I really really liked

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.850 
gloss on top and I really really liked
the<00:04:47.190> combination<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.120> it<00:04:49.110> wore<00:04:49.530> really

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
the combination and it wore really

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.380 
the combination and it wore really
nicely<00:04:50.070> and<00:04:50.460> I<00:04:50.520> feel<00:04:50.700> like<00:04:50.730> it<00:04:50.940> kind<00:04:51.090> of<00:04:51.210> leaves

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
nicely and I feel like it kind of leaves

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.850 
nicely and I feel like it kind of leaves
a<00:04:51.510> little<00:04:51.630> bit<00:04:51.840> of<00:04:51.930> a<00:04:52.020> stain<00:04:52.290> behind<00:04:52.620> on<00:04:52.770> your

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
a little bit of a stain behind on your

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.370 
a little bit of a stain behind on your
lip<00:04:53.100> so<00:04:53.820> you're<00:04:54.630> going<00:04:54.720> to<00:04:54.780> get<00:04:54.930> pretty<00:04:55.200> good

sheets<00:05:36.270> because<00:05:36.390> I<00:05:36.510> don't<00:05:36.900> tend<00:05:37.350> to<00:05:37.470> wear<00:05:37.620> a

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
sheets because I don't tend to wear a

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.430 
sheets because I don't tend to wear a
bright<00:05:38.190> lip<00:05:38.490> all<00:05:38.730> the<00:05:39.030> time<00:05:39.270> so<00:05:39.990> I<00:05:40.020> just<00:05:40.260> feel

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
bright lip all the time so I just feel

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.600 
bright lip all the time so I just feel
like<00:05:40.470> it's<00:05:40.680> not<00:05:40.770> really<00:05:41.070> worth<00:05:41.280> you<00:05:41.580> know

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610
