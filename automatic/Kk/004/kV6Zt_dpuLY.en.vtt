like this is greg and scott likely to

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.610 
like this is greg and scott likely to
try<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.280> get<00:00:29.460> it

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.210 

I<00:00:35.680> suppose<00:00:36.160> image<00:00:36.430> of<00:00:36.550> this

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
I suppose image of this

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.500 
I suppose image of this
I<00:00:38.310> was<00:00:38.550> looking<00:00:38.730> around<00:00:38.940> for<00:00:39.210> something<00:00:39.390> to

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
I was looking around for something to

00:00:39.510 --> 00:01:36.690 
I was looking around for something to
eat

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.950 

unbelievable

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.840 

also<00:01:40.680> quite<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> small<00:01:41.070> islets<00:01:41.490> probably<00:01:41.760> about

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
also quite a small islets probably about

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.640 
also quite a small islets probably about
twice<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.180> size<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.750> post-budget<00:01:43.170> l<00:01:43.470> which

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
twice the size of a post-budget l which

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.359 
twice the size of a post-budget l which
is<00:01:43.680> something<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.280> see<00:01:44.460> but<00:01:44.640> more

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
is something we see but more

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.520 
is something we see but more
analytically<00:01:47.369> put<00:01:47.580> this<00:01:47.729> next<00:01:47.940> to<00:01:48.119> her<00:01:48.500> like<00:01:49.500> a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
analytically put this next to her like a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.960 
analytically put this next to her like a
very<00:01:49.830> illegal<00:01:50.159> log<00:01:50.400> that<00:01:50.520> we've<00:01:50.670> seen<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> few

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
very illegal log that we've seen a few

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.320 
very illegal log that we've seen a few
times<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.450> would<00:01:51.570> literally<00:01:51.840> be<00:01:51.990> dwarfed<00:01:52.229> by

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
times it would literally be dwarfed by

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:40.240 
times it would literally be dwarfed by
some<00:01:54.330> same<00:01:54.659> size<00:01:54.900> is<00:01:55.080> like<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> goshawk<00:01:55.530> maybe

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.000 

fack<00:02:40.850> tomorrow<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.330> say<00:02:41.480> this<00:02:41.630> is<00:02:42.010> possibly

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
fack tomorrow to say this is possibly

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.000 
fack tomorrow to say this is possibly
the<00:02:43.100> best<00:02:43.280> view<00:02:43.550> of<00:02:43.610> in<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:43.940> head

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.740 

never<00:02:48.489> seen<00:02:48.760> one<00:02:48.849> that<00:02:48.909> SAT<00:02:49.209> around<00:02:49.420> for<00:02:49.510> so

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
never seen one that SAT around for so

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.089 
never seen one that SAT around for so
long<00:02:49.870> it's<00:02:50.049> obviously<00:02:50.319> focused<00:02:50.590> on<00:02:50.890> something

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
long it's obviously focused on something

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
as well you can see it carefully turning

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.650 
as well you can see it carefully turning
its<00:02:53.799> head<00:02:53.860> now<00:02:54.129> and<00:02:54.159> again<00:02:54.489> and<00:02:54.640> listening

can pinpoint mastering in there we go

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.430 
can pinpoint mastering in there we go
somewhere

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440
