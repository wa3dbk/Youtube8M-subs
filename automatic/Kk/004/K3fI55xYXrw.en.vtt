00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.649 

it's<00:00:00.599> called<00:00:00.989> final<00:00:01.530> racking<00:00:02.190> and<00:00:02.399> the<00:00:03.300> final

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
it's called final racking and the final

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.590 
it's called final racking and the final
racking<00:00:04.140> will<00:00:04.350> rack<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:05.700> meat<00:00:05.910> off<00:00:06.120> all<00:00:06.390> the

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
racking will rack the meat off all the

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.140 
racking will rack the meat off all the
the<00:00:06.960> sediment<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.710> accumulated<00:00:08.519> from<00:00:08.880> the

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
the sediment that accumulated from the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.450 
the sediment that accumulated from the
last<00:00:09.389> time<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.019> we'll<00:00:10.650> put<00:00:10.889> it<00:00:10.980> in<00:00:11.070> there<00:00:11.309> and

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
last time and we'll put it in there and

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.850 
last time and we'll put it in there and
let<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:11.639> sit<00:00:12.000> for<00:00:12.030> another<00:00:12.450> four<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.290> six<00:00:13.559> weeks

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
let it sit for another four to six weeks

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.849 
let it sit for another four to six weeks
take<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.610> look<00:00:14.910> here<00:00:15.500> undo<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:17.119> light<00:00:18.119> block

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
take a look here undo the light block

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.359 
take a look here undo the light block
and<00:00:19.859> there<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.279> all<00:00:21.029> its<00:00:21.359> glory<00:00:21.949> as<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.160> can

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
and there it is all its glory as you can

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.359 
and there it is all its glory as you can
see<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:24.060> pretty<00:00:24.449> clear<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.980> then<00:00:26.130> down<00:00:26.340> on

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
see it's pretty clear and then down on

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.120 
see it's pretty clear and then down on
the<00:00:26.640> bottom<00:00:27.170> there's<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.320> sediment<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:28.980> those

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
the bottom there's a sediment and those

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.640 
the bottom there's a sediment and those
two<00:00:29.400> oak<00:00:29.730> spirals<00:00:30.359> which<00:00:30.630> we<00:00:30.900> had<00:00:31.199> put<00:00:31.619> in

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
two oak spirals which we had put in

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.880 
two oak spirals which we had put in
there<00:00:31.920> right<00:00:32.130> at<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.369> end<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:32.850> now<00:00:33.860> we're<00:00:34.860> just

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
there right at the end so now we're just

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.690 
there right at the end so now we're just
going<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.250> ease<00:00:36.000> off<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.750> airlock<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.980> then

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
going to ease off the airlock and then

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.200 
going to ease off the airlock and then
put<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.090> our<00:00:39.239> racking<00:00:39.660> tube<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.110> get<00:00:40.230> busy

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
put in our racking tube and get busy

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.200 
put in our racking tube and get busy
well<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.480> carefully<00:00:43.260> put<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.969> here<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.120> a

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
well just carefully put this here in a

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.660 
well just carefully put this here in a
sanitizer<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:46.710> don't<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.160> keep<00:00:47.340> doing

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
sanitizer so we don't have to keep doing

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:57.049 
sanitizer so we don't have to keep doing
that<00:00:49.309> so<00:00:52.399> racking<00:00:53.399> cane<00:00:53.610> jelly<00:00:54.539> filter<00:00:56.059> there

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
that so racking cane jelly filter there

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.950 
that so racking cane jelly filter there
we<00:00:57.239> are<00:00:58.789> nice<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.090> easy<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.390> as<00:01:00.629> not<00:01:00.899> to

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
we are nice and easy so as not to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.860 
we are nice and easy so as not to
disturb<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.590> sediment<00:01:02.250> then<00:01:03.239> we'll<00:01:03.449> put<00:01:03.719> on

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
disturb the sediment then we'll put on

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.060 
disturb the sediment then we'll put on
the<00:01:04.199> siphon<00:01:04.890> hose<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.489> get<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.090> started

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
the siphon hose and get it started

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.690 
the siphon hose and get it started
siphon<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.310> started<00:01:09.860> so<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.460> our

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
siphon is started so here is our

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.200 
siphon is started so here is our
blackberry<00:01:12.600> Mead<00:01:13.490> that's<00:01:14.490> being<00:01:14.850> siphoned

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
blackberry Mead that's being siphoned

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.730 
blackberry Mead that's being siphoned
out<00:01:15.619> for<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> final<00:01:17.009> racking<00:01:18.259> which<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
out for the final racking which is the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.890 
out for the final racking which is the
polishing<00:01:20.369> after<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.240> step<00:01:21.740> will<00:01:22.740> bottle<00:01:23.310> it

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
polishing after this step will bottle it

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.600 
polishing after this step will bottle it
but<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.930> think<00:01:25.049> it'll<00:01:25.380> be<00:01:25.560> another<00:01:25.830> month<00:01:26.100> or<00:01:26.369> so

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
but I think it'll be another month or so

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.429 
but I think it'll be another month or so
until<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.270> ready<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.810> we're<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.380> to

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
until it's ready so we're just going to

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.219 
until it's ready so we're just going to
rack<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.829> off<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.280> stuff<00:01:29.840> let<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.960> sit

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
rack it off of this stuff let it sit

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.249 
rack it off of this stuff let it sit
another<00:01:31.500> six<00:01:32.400> weeks<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.930> then<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.140> all

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
another six weeks and then if it all

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.900 
another six weeks and then if it all
looks<00:01:34.530> good<00:01:34.770> we'll<00:01:35.040> bottle<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.520> then

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:46.590 

so<00:01:39.910> there<00:01:40.150> it<00:01:40.240> is<00:01:40.980> the<00:01:41.980> meed<00:01:43.500> they're<00:01:45.600> finished

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
so there it is the meed they're finished

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.800 
so there it is the meed they're finished
with<00:01:46.750> that<00:01:47.010> now<00:01:48.010> I<00:01:48.040> just<00:01:48.160> have<00:01:48.550> to<00:01:48.760> put<00:01:49.690> the

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
with that now I just have to put the

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.070 
with that now I just have to put the
airlock<00:01:50.200> on<00:01:50.410> that<00:01:50.650> thing<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:52.479> clean<00:01:52.810> that<00:01:53.020> up

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
airlock on that thing and clean that up

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.980 
airlock on that thing and clean that up
and<00:01:53.440> then<00:01:54.130> we'll<00:01:54.430> be<00:01:54.550> done<00:01:55.800> so<00:01:57.720> here's<00:01:58.720> the

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
and then we'll be done so here's the

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:08.389 
and then we'll be done so here's the
airlock<00:02:00.300> like<00:02:01.300> so<00:02:04.170> get<00:02:05.170> this<00:02:05.380> out<00:02:05.619> of<00:02:05.650> the<00:02:05.770> way

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.360 

we<00:02:09.399> are<00:02:09.580> finally<00:02:09.940> racked<00:02:10.450> or<00:02:11.040> to<00:02:12.040> be<00:02:12.190> more

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
we are finally racked or to be more

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.250 
we are finally racked or to be more
precise<00:02:12.820> we<00:02:13.180> have<00:02:13.300> completed<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:14.050> final

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
precise we have completed the final

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.400 
precise we have completed the final
racking<00:02:14.880> nothing<00:02:15.880> left<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.239> do<00:02:16.390> but<00:02:16.420> wait<00:02:16.690> so

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
racking nothing left to do but wait so

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.040 
racking nothing left to do but wait so
we'll<00:02:17.739> see<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:17.980> back<00:02:18.250> here<00:02:18.670> in<00:02:18.730> about<00:02:19.690> six
