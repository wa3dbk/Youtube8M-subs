00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
end of these trees you can see the track

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.470 
end of these trees you can see the track
is<00:00:51.320> different<00:00:51.710> levels<00:00:51.860> of<00:00:52.100> dampness<00:00:52.460> this<00:00:53.240> is

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
is different levels of dampness this is

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.540 
is different levels of dampness this is
a<00:00:53.630> horrendous<00:00:53.990> right<00:00:54.770> Hank<00:00:55.010> oh<00:00:55.220> here<00:00:55.340> we<00:00:55.430> go
