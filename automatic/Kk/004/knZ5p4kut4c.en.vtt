actually tends to shrivel up a little
bit<00:00:25.750> as<00:00:25.930> it<00:00:26.170> gets<00:00:26.349> mature<00:00:26.770> this<00:00:27.759> one<00:00:28.029> is<00:00:28.150> pretty

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
bit as it gets mature this one is pretty

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.780 
bit as it gets mature this one is pretty
hard<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:32.710> doesn't<00:00:32.920> shrivel<00:00:33.370> up<00:00:33.489> let<00:00:33.580> me<00:00:33.670> see

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
hard it it doesn't shrivel up let me see

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.530 
hard it it doesn't shrivel up let me see
if<00:00:33.879> I<00:00:33.940> can<00:00:34.090> find<00:00:34.239> it

alright<00:00:38.379> so<00:00:38.530> here<00:00:38.710> we<00:00:38.830> have<00:00:39.040> it<00:00:39.250> you<00:00:39.430> know<00:00:39.640> low

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
alright so here we have it you know low

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.299 
alright so here we have it you know low
which<00:00:40.780> is<00:00:40.809> shriveled<00:00:41.500> up<00:00:41.590> as<00:00:41.769> you<00:00:41.920> can<00:00:42.010> see<00:00:42.190> it

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
which is shriveled up as you can see it

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.540 
which is shriveled up as you can see it
starts<00:00:42.580> off<00:00:42.760> like<00:00:43.000> this<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:44.739> this<00:00:45.160> yellow

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
starts off like this but this yellow

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.450 
starts off like this but this yellow
color<00:00:45.790> when<00:00:46.570> it<00:00:46.720> gets<00:00:46.930> me<00:00:47.140> really<00:00:47.799> mature<00:00:48.280> it

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460

Chino lower passion fruit the grand idea

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.229 
Chino lower passion fruit the grand idea
does<00:00:55.989> not<00:00:56.019> shrivel<00:00:56.769> up<00:00:56.890> and<00:00:57.190> let's<00:00:58.030> take<00:00:58.210> a

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
does not shrivel up and let's take a

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.539 
does not shrivel up and let's take a
look<00:00:58.479> on<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.659> inside<00:00:58.870> to<00:00:59.260> see<00:00:59.470> what<00:00:59.680> the<00:00:59.890> the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.549 
look on the inside to see what the the

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:05.550 
look on the inside to see what the the
inside<00:01:00.850> looks<00:01:01.089> like<00:01:03.750> okay<00:01:04.750> so<00:01:04.809> here<00:01:05.229> we<00:01:05.379> have

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
inside looks like okay so here we have

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.310 
inside looks like okay so here we have
the<00:01:05.799> inside<00:01:06.340> of<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.580> grand<00:01:06.790> idea<00:01:07.320> another

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
the inside of the grand idea another

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.500 
the inside of the grand idea another
reviewer<00:01:08.740> looked<00:01:09.040> I'd<00:01:09.909> said<00:01:10.119> that<00:01:10.240> it<00:01:10.360> looks

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
reviewer looked I'd said that it looks

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.380 
reviewer looked I'd said that it looks
like<00:01:10.720> kind<00:01:11.440> of<00:01:11.530> like<00:01:11.650> tadpoles<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:13.210> they're

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
like kind of like tadpoles and they're

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.539 
like kind of like tadpoles and they're
in<00:01:13.510> their<00:01:13.689> little<00:01:13.930> slime<00:01:14.200> sack<00:01:14.530> after<00:01:14.860> well

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
in their little slime sack after well

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.670 
in their little slime sack after well
before<00:01:15.909> they're<00:01:16.510> born<00:01:16.780> for<00:01:17.110> they<00:01:17.200> hatch<00:01:17.409> out

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
before they're born for they hatch out

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.120 
before they're born for they hatch out
and<00:01:17.950> I<00:01:18.159> agree<00:01:18.850> with<00:01:19.000> that<00:01:19.440> the<00:01:20.440> taste<00:01:20.740> of<00:01:20.980> this

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
and I agree with that the taste of this

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:30.520 
and I agree with that the taste of this
fruit<00:01:21.640> is<00:01:24.090> kind<00:01:25.090> of<00:01:25.180> sweet<00:01:25.420> but

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.810 

very<00:01:31.530> difficult<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:32.070> compare<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.640> anything

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
very difficult to compare to anything

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.270 
very difficult to compare to anything
because<00:01:33.120> of<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> texture<00:01:34.010> kind<00:01:35.010> of<00:01:35.130> has<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
because of the texture kind of has a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.880 
because of the texture kind of has a
taste<00:01:35.970> kinda<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.330> a<00:01:36.360> plum<00:01:36.690> I<00:01:36.720> guess<00:01:37.020> but<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
taste kinda like a plum I guess but the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.190 
taste kinda like a plum I guess but the
texture<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.310> totally<00:01:38.610> different

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
texture is totally different

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.040 
texture is totally different
anyway<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.260> get<00:01:40.560> these<00:01:40.710> seeds<00:01:41.130> out<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.370> here

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
anyway to get these seeds out of here

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.940 
anyway to get these seeds out of here
you<00:01:43.050> can<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.350> put<00:01:43.500> them<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.680> your<00:01:43.800> mouth

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
you can just put them in your mouth

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.040 
you can just put them in your mouth
really<00:01:44.370> and<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:45.360> kind<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.630> wiggle<00:01:45.810> them

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
really and just kind of wiggle them

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.480 
really and just kind of wiggle them
around<00:01:46.260> until<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.710> get<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:46.980> seed<00:01:47.220> out<00:01:47.370> of<00:01:47.400> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
around until you get the seed out of the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.070 
around until you get the seed out of the
set<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.830> mean<00:01:49.830> you'll<00:01:50.040> know<00:01:50.250> when<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.520> comes<00:01:50.700> out

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
set I mean you'll know when it comes out

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.350 
set I mean you'll know when it comes out
and<00:01:52.080> then<00:01:52.260> you<00:01:52.290> can<00:01:52.470> just<00:01:52.620> use<00:01:52.800> that<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.360> plant

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
and then you can just use that to plant

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.360 
and then you can just use that to plant
which<00:01:54.900> I'll<00:01:55.110> show<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.350> guys<00:01:55.650> in<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.950> second

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
which I'll show you guys in a second

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.020 
which I'll show you guys in a second

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.860 
them you probably can't see it here but
what<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.440> did<00:02:28.740> was<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.010> took<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.370> razor<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:30.750> has

this<00:02:31.020> white<00:02:31.350> age<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.100> on<00:02:32.280> all<00:02:32.460> of<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.700> seeds<00:02:32.970> I

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
this white age and on all of the seeds I

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.360 
this white age and on all of the seeds I
kind<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.570> just<00:02:33.750> made<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.470> little<00:02:34.650> scar<00:02:35.070> on<00:02:35.100> the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
kind of just made a little scar on the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.600 
kind of just made a little scar on the
white<00:02:35.550> edge<00:02:35.820> up<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.870> down<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.370> they'll

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
white edge up and down so that they'll

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.030 
white edge up and down so that they'll
have<00:02:38.730> an<00:02:38.850> easier<00:02:39.000> time<00:02:39.209> germinating<00:02:40.080> just

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
have an easier time germinating just

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.370 
have an easier time germinating just
leave<00:02:41.160> them<00:02:41.340> in<00:02:41.430> here<00:02:41.580> in<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.760> warm<00:02:42.030> room<00:02:42.350> know<00:02:43.350> a

leave them in here in a warm room know a
couple<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.740> weeks<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.370> month<00:02:44.610> see<00:02:44.940> what

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
germinating I have plenty of them so if

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.430 
germinating I have plenty of them so if
they're<00:02:55.390> at<00:02:55.480> all<00:02:55.600> viable<00:02:55.960> we<00:02:56.170> should<00:02:56.320> at<00:02:56.410> least

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
they're at all viable we should at least

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.940 
they're at all viable we should at least
get<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.710> few<00:02:56.800> germinating<00:02:57.550> we'll<00:02:57.760> see
