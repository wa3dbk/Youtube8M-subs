00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
was the idea of this pavilion of this

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.270 
was the idea of this pavilion of this
creation<00:00:30.520> this<00:00:30.850> year<00:00:31.180> and<00:00:31.739> what<00:00:32.739> can<00:00:32.920> we<00:00:33.070> see

you<00:00:34.050> well<00:00:35.050> I<00:00:35.080> figured<00:00:35.739> this<00:00:36.670> pavilion<00:00:37.150> is

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
you well I figured this pavilion is

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.750 
you well I figured this pavilion is
about<00:00:37.570> seeing<00:00:38.500> yourself<00:00:39.040> and<00:00:39.309> discovering

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
about seeing yourself and discovering

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.060 
about seeing yourself and discovering
yourself<00:00:39.970> it's<00:00:40.930> not<00:00:41.199> so<00:00:41.379> much<00:00:41.620> a<00:00:41.650> pavilion

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
yourself it's not so much a pavilion

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.040 
yourself it's not so much a pavilion
where<00:00:42.430> I<00:00:42.489> would<00:00:42.940> tell<00:00:43.210> you<00:00:43.239> what<00:00:43.570> you<00:00:43.720> have<00:00:43.870> to

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
where I would tell you what you have to

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.280 
where I would tell you what you have to
see<00:00:44.260> it's<00:00:44.739> exactly<00:00:45.400> that<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:45.909> theme<00:00:46.150> to<00:00:47.050> just

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
see it's exactly that the theme to just

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.040 
see it's exactly that the theme to just
see<00:00:47.470> yourself<00:00:47.920> and<00:00:48.159> the<00:00:48.970> luteal<00:00:49.330> spoke<00:00:49.809> out

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
see yourself and the luteal spoke out

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.700 
see yourself and the luteal spoke out
and<00:00:50.440> said<00:00:51.129> reprise<00:00:52.229> contribution<00:00:53.229> was<00:00:53.409> much

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
and said reprise contribution was much

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.090 
and said reprise contribution was much
more<00:00:53.890> about<00:00:54.040> perceiving<00:00:54.970> than<00:00:55.239> about

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
more about perceiving than about

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:10.800 
more about perceiving than about
physically

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.710 

so<00:01:11.810> how<00:01:12.080> do<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:12.530> let<00:01:13.430> people<00:01:13.700> see<00:01:14.240> themselves

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
so how do you let people see themselves

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.320 
so how do you let people see themselves
what<00:01:14.990> kind<00:01:15.170> of<00:01:15.229> media<00:01:15.590> did<00:01:15.800> you<00:01:15.890> use<00:01:16.240> well<00:01:17.240> you

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
what kind of media did you use well you

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.120 
what kind of media did you use well you
can<00:01:17.510> see<00:01:17.720> it's<00:01:17.869> more<00:01:18.140> like<00:01:18.320> a<00:01:18.350> theater<00:01:18.830> with

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
can see it's more like a theater with

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.420 
can see it's more like a theater with
these<00:01:19.310> trolleys<00:01:19.580> where<00:01:19.970> students<00:01:20.720> bring<00:01:20.930> in

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
focus on education and how important is

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.150

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
architecture yeah I think that's a

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.720 
architecture yeah I think that's a
always<00:02:43.450> important<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:44.290> students<00:02:44.740> come<00:02:45.070> to<00:02:45.700> a

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
always important that students come to a

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.830 
always important that students come to a
Biennale<00:02:46.360> this<00:02:46.780> time<00:02:47.350> or<00:02:48.240> any<00:02:49.240> time<00:02:49.570> I<00:02:49.600> think

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
Biennale this time or any time I think

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.390 
Biennale this time or any time I think
there<00:02:50.230> is<00:02:50.320> a<00:02:50.350> I<00:02:50.950> think<00:02:51.400> as<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.640> student<00:02:53.160> is<00:02:54.160> a

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
there is a I think as the student is a

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.370 
there is a I think as the student is a
important<00:02:55.390> moment<00:02:55.630> in<00:02:55.720> your<00:02:55.810> life<00:02:56.050> where

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
important moment in your life where

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.320 
important moment in your life where
hopefully<00:02:57.070> you<00:02:57.250> are<00:02:57.340> more<00:02:57.550> open<00:02:57.700> than<00:02:58.030> later

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
hopefully you are more open than later

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.080 
hopefully you are more open than later
and<00:02:58.660> also<00:02:59.350> have<00:02:59.620> more<00:02:59.800> time<00:02:59.860> than<00:03:00.370> later<00:03:00.820> and

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
and also have more time than later and

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.630 
and also have more time than later and
you<00:03:01.959> should<00:03:02.200> take<00:03:02.410> on<00:03:02.590> board<00:03:02.830> as<00:03:03.040> much<00:03:03.280> as<00:03:03.490> you

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
you should take on board as much as you

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.460 
you should take on board as much as you
can<00:03:03.880> to<00:03:04.180> make<00:03:04.420> your<00:03:04.720> own<00:03:04.990> opinion<00:03:05.760> because<00:03:07.470> you

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
can to make your own opinion because you

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.380 
can to make your own opinion because you
know<00:03:08.560> and<00:03:08.740> this<00:03:08.890> is<00:03:09.070> also<00:03:09.250> going<00:03:09.850> back<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.209> the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
know and this is also going back to the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
know and this is also going back to the
the<00:03:11.110> issue<00:03:11.380> of<00:03:11.620> this<00:03:11.770> pavilion<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:14.290> know

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
the issue of this pavilion you know

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.830 
the issue of this pavilion you know
instead<00:03:14.920> of<00:03:14.980> ideologies<00:03:15.850> and<00:03:16.150> believing<00:03:16.720> in

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
instead of ideologies and believing in

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.300 
instead of ideologies and believing in
something<00:03:17.110> I<00:03:17.500> think<00:03:17.800> it's<00:03:17.890> very<00:03:17.950> important

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
something I think it's very important

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.430 
something I think it's very important
that<00:03:18.340> you<00:03:18.520> learn<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.760> see<00:03:19.570> with<00:03:19.930> your<00:03:20.050> own<00:03:20.110> eyes

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
that you learn to see with your own eyes

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.699 
that you learn to see with your own eyes
and<00:03:20.470> try<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.250> understand<00:03:21.810> what<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:23.050> believe

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
and try to understand what you believe

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.239 
and try to understand what you believe
is<00:03:23.890> important<00:03:24.489> and<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:24.880> not
