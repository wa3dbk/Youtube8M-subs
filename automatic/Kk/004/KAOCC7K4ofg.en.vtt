refer<00:00:20.560> to<00:00:20.590> this<00:00:20.860> engine<00:00:21.310> you<00:00:21.520> know

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
refer to this engine you know

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.030 
refer to this engine you know
specifically<00:00:22.119> about<00:00:22.360> 43<00:00:22.869> originally<00:00:23.800> and

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.040 
specifically about 43 originally and

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.800 
specifically about 43 originally and
then<00:00:24.070> you<00:00:24.730> know<00:00:24.850> we<00:00:24.970> came<00:00:25.119> to<00:00:25.270> a<00:00:25.300> conclusion<00:00:25.450> of

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
then you know we came to a conclusion of

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.510 
then you know we came to a conclusion of
other<00:00:26.320> people<00:00:26.619> actually<00:00:26.860> have<00:00:26.890> used<00:00:27.189> for<00:00:27.400> this

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
other people actually have used for this

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.460 
other people actually have used for this
and<00:00:27.790> I<00:00:28.029> think<00:00:28.240> it's<00:00:28.360> pretty<00:00:28.599> amazing<00:00:28.840> that<00:00:29.080> you

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
and I think it's pretty amazing that you

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.929 
and I think it's pretty amazing that you
know<00:00:29.529> you<00:00:29.590> guys<00:00:29.860> are<00:00:30.279> making<00:00:30.460> a<00:00:30.610> racing<00:00:30.910> game

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
know you guys are making a racing game

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.690 
know you guys are making a racing game
of<00:00:31.240> our<00:00:31.540> engine<00:00:31.960> it<00:00:32.650> is<00:00:32.710> definitely<00:00:33.190> because

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
of our engine it is definitely because

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.120 
of our engine it is definitely because
you<00:00:34.239> know<00:00:34.329> without<00:00:34.480> the<00:00:34.630> engine<00:00:35.050> we<00:00:35.350> we

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.130 
you know without the engine we we

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.470 
you know without the engine we we
wouldn't<00:00:36.430> have<00:00:36.520> been<00:00:36.550> able<00:00:36.700> to<00:00:37.000> deliver<00:00:37.239> our

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
wouldn't have been able to deliver our

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.780 
wouldn't have been able to deliver our
concept<00:00:37.930> and<00:00:38.170> using<00:00:38.800> the<00:00:38.890> key<00:00:39.160> technologies

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
concept and using the key technologies

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.360 
concept and using the key technologies
with<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.090> engine<00:00:40.329> provides<00:00:44.040> powerful<00:00:45.040> from

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
with the engine provides powerful from

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.009 
with the engine provides powerful from
it<00:00:45.430> is<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:45.940> true<00:00:46.239> success<00:00:46.660> to<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:46.809> bathroom

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
it is the true success to the bathroom

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.049 
it is the true success to the bathroom
too<00:00:47.379> we<00:00:47.859> need<00:00:48.010> to<00:00:48.160> make<00:00:48.399> everything<00:00:48.730> bigger

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
too we need to make everything bigger

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.060 
too we need to make everything bigger
and<00:00:49.449> better<00:00:49.600> basically<00:00:50.230> we<00:00:50.500> need<00:00:50.530> to<00:00:50.710> develop

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
and better basically we need to develop

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.400 
and better basically we need to develop
new<00:00:51.370> technology<00:00:52.030> for<00:00:52.570> doing<00:00:52.809> that<00:00:52.960> so<00:00:53.199> one<00:00:53.320> of

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
new technology for doing that so one of

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.500 
new technology for doing that so one of
those<00:00:53.530> think<00:00:53.769> is<00:00:53.890> streaming<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:55.000> contents

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
those think is streaming the contents

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.569 
those think is streaming the contents
into<00:00:55.750> the<00:00:55.780> maps<00:00:56.079> with<00:00:56.500> that<00:00:56.800> we<00:00:56.949> can<00:00:57.100> build<00:00:57.309> the

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
into the maps with that we can build the

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:58.860 
into the maps with that we can build the
biggest<00:00:57.730> part<00:00:57.969> where<00:00:58.179> we<00:00:58.210> haven't<00:00:58.690> done

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
biggest part where we haven't done

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.930 
biggest part where we haven't done
before<00:00:58.929> and<00:00:59.559> I<00:01:00.219> think<00:01:00.429> that<00:01:00.550> that's<00:01:00.579> something

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
before and I think that that's something

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.759 
before and I think that that's something
that<00:01:01.059> you<00:01:01.269> also<00:01:01.449> benefit<00:01:02.199> a<00:01:02.230> lot<00:01:02.260> from<00:01:02.410> right

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
that you also benefit a lot from right

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.979 
that you also benefit a lot from right
definitely<00:01:03.429> we<00:01:03.609> need<00:01:03.640> for<00:01:03.940> speed<00:01:04.150> the<00:01:04.690> concept

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
definitely we need for speed the concept

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.090 
definitely we need for speed the concept
that<00:01:05.110> we<00:01:05.199> weren't<00:01:05.350> with<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.680> coast<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:05.980> coast

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
that we weren't with the coast to coast

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.040 
that we weren't with the coast to coast
erase<00:01:06.430> really<00:01:07.210> couldn't<00:01:07.450> been<00:01:07.570> built<00:01:07.780> without

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
erase really couldn't been built without

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.960 
erase really couldn't been built without
scale<00:01:08.470> in<00:01:08.770> order<00:01:09.010> to<00:01:09.100> pull<00:01:09.310> off<00:01:09.460> what<00:01:09.700> we<00:01:09.820> need

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
scale in order to pull off what we need

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.520 
scale in order to pull off what we need
to<00:01:10.120> do<00:01:10.240> we<00:01:10.450> basically<00:01:10.720> doubled<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.260> length<00:01:11.350> of

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
to do we basically doubled the length of

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.680 
to do we basically doubled the length of
our<00:01:11.620> tracks<00:01:11.950> we<00:01:12.370> quadrupled<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:13.420> number<00:01:13.450> of

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
our tracks we quadrupled the number of

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.270 
our tracks we quadrupled the number of
textures<00:01:14.080> you<00:01:14.440> know<00:01:14.530> four<00:01:14.890> times<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.190> number

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
textures you know four times the number

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.760 
textures you know four times the number
of<00:01:15.430> objects<00:01:15.820> so<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.630> scale<00:01:16.930> for<00:01:17.170> us<00:01:17.320> just

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
of objects so the scale for us just

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.060 
of objects so the scale for us just
wasn't<00:01:17.920> a<00:01:18.070> team<00:01:18.250> or<00:01:18.430> old

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
wasn't a team or old

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.890 
wasn't a team or old
and<00:01:19.580> it's<00:01:19.909> the<00:01:20.030> terrain<00:01:20.330> system<00:01:20.690> that<00:01:20.810> you

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
and it's the terrain system that you

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.600 
and it's the terrain system that you
guys<00:01:21.050> developed<00:01:21.470> obviously<00:01:21.890> it<00:01:21.979> allows<00:01:22.159> us<00:01:22.190> to

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
guys developed obviously it allows us to

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.040 
guys developed obviously it allows us to
basically<00:01:22.729> have<00:01:23.030> our<00:01:23.180> vistas<00:01:23.570> that<00:01:23.600> we<00:01:23.840> have

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
basically have our vistas that we have

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.480 
basically have our vistas that we have
you<00:01:24.560> know<00:01:24.680> when<00:01:24.860> you<00:01:24.950> drive<00:01:25.159> down<00:01:25.190> the

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
you know when you drive down the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.010 
you know when you drive down the
highways<00:01:25.790> you<00:01:25.940> can<00:01:26.060> see<00:01:26.210> for<00:01:26.420> miles<00:01:26.600> out<00:01:26.930> in

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
highways you can see for miles out in

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.330 
highways you can see for miles out in
the<00:01:27.050> desert<00:01:27.229> can<00:01:27.620> see<00:01:27.740> for<00:01:27.890> miles<00:01:28.040> up<00:01:28.310> the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
the desert can see for miles up the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.430 
the desert can see for miles up the
mountains<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.030> it<00:01:29.540> really<00:01:29.690> sells<00:01:29.990> that<00:01:30.200> sense

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
mountains and it really sells that sense

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.250 
mountains and it really sells that sense
of<00:01:30.530> journey

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.200 

the<00:01:35.260> destruction<00:01:35.830> enables<00:01:36.340> us<00:01:36.490> now<00:01:36.850> to<00:01:36.910> do

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
the destruction enables us now to do

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.360 
the destruction enables us now to do
things<00:01:37.510> that<00:01:37.630> no<00:01:37.900> one<00:01:38.320> else<00:01:38.560> is<00:01:38.830> able<00:01:39.190> to<00:01:39.280> do

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
things that no one else is able to do

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.460 
things that no one else is able to do
really<00:01:39.580> like<00:01:39.910> just<00:01:40.480> seeing<00:01:40.750> other<00:01:41.050> players

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
really like just seeing other players

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.260 
really like just seeing other players
from<00:01:41.860> other<00:01:42.040> thing<00:01:42.370> of<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.610> shooters<00:01:42.970> coming

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
from other thing of the shooters coming

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.240 
from other thing of the shooters coming
into<00:01:43.540> belfield<00:01:44.020> where<00:01:44.530> you<00:01:44.860> know<00:01:44.950> why<00:01:45.070> not

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
into belfield where you know why not

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.100 
into belfield where you know why not
play<00:01:45.490> back<00:01:45.729> there<00:01:45.970> now<00:01:46.150> it's<00:01:46.390> natural<00:01:46.900> for<00:01:46.930> me

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
play back there now it's natural for me

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.200 
play back there now it's natural for me
to<00:01:47.140> just<00:01:47.410> go<00:01:47.560> through<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:48.130> walls<00:01:48.340> so<00:01:48.910> if<00:01:49.060> I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
to just go through the walls so if I

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.240 
to just go through the walls so if I
driving<00:01:49.540> a<00:01:49.720> tank<00:01:49.960> and<00:01:50.350> someone<00:01:50.740> hiding<00:01:51.010> behind

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
driving a tank and someone hiding behind

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.040 
driving a tank and someone hiding behind
the<00:01:51.520> wall<00:01:51.670> there's<00:01:51.940> life<00:01:52.210> for<00:01:52.450> somewhere<00:01:52.720> far

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
the wall there's life for somewhere far

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.870

really has allowed us to set the bar a

we<00:02:44.329> rewrote<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:44.720> whole<00:02:44.900> rendering<00:02:45.409> engine

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
we rewrote the whole rendering engine

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.220 
we rewrote the whole rendering engine
from<00:02:45.890> scratch<00:02:46.189> and<00:02:46.849> that<00:02:46.970> enables<00:02:47.420> us<00:02:47.599> to<00:02:47.659> have

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
from scratch and that enables us to have

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.350 
from scratch and that enables us to have
more<00:02:48.709> light<00:02:49.220> sources<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.879> make<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.150> more

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
more light sources to make it more

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.780 
more light sources to make it more
cinematic<00:02:50.840> we<00:02:51.170> can<00:02:51.349> do<00:02:51.890> both<00:02:52.099> indoor<00:02:52.579> and

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
cinematic we can do both indoor and

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.729 
cinematic we can do both indoor and
outdoor<00:02:52.849> lighting<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:53.959> you<00:02:54.019> see<00:02:54.349> actually

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
outdoor lighting so you see actually

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.949 
outdoor lighting so you see actually
real<00:02:55.340> shadows<00:02:55.819> going<00:02:56.120> around<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.510> game<00:02:56.720> and

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
real shadows going around the game and

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.199 
real shadows going around the game and
just<00:02:57.379> with<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.159> destruction<00:02:58.519> we<00:02:58.849> have<00:02:59.030> all

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
just with the destruction we have all

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.940 
just with the destruction we have all
these<00:02:59.329> explosions<00:02:59.780> and<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.260> smoke<00:03:00.650> coming

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
these explosions and the smoke coming

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.520 
these explosions and the smoke coming
out<00:03:01.220> when<00:03:02.060> he<00:03:02.209> needed<00:03:02.659> a<00:03:02.810> particle<00:03:03.290> so<00:03:03.439> they

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
out when he needed a particle so they

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.259 
out when he needed a particle so they
affected<00:03:03.890> look<00:03:04.010> really<00:03:04.430> good<00:03:04.549> as<00:03:04.760> well<00:03:04.790> like

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
affected look really good as well like

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.390 
affected look really good as well like
really<00:03:05.480> cinematic<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.590> obviously<00:03:06.950> for<00:03:07.040> us<00:03:07.220> by

and<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.370> that<00:03:23.299> grand<00:03:23.690> scale<00:03:23.989> actually<00:03:24.709> boils

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
and and that grand scale actually boils

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.830 
and and that grand scale actually boils
down<00:03:25.040> some<00:03:25.400> of<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.549> smaller<00:03:25.849> pieces<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:26.599> I

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
down some of the smaller pieces and I

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.179 
down some of the smaller pieces and I
think<00:03:27.049> the<00:03:27.109> players<00:03:27.290> would<00:03:27.500> pick<00:03:27.680> up<00:03:27.769> on<00:03:27.950> which

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:28.189 
think the players would pick up on which

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.129 
think the players would pick up on which
is<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.819> know<00:03:28.849> the<00:03:29.120> tire<00:03:29.329> spray<00:03:29.689> going<00:03:29.870> through

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
is you know the tire spray going through

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.349 
is you know the tire spray going through

done dynamically and that's what our

engine actually does with the audio so

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.940 
engine actually does with the audio so
you<00:04:10.640> can<00:04:10.819> actually<00:04:11.209> distinguish<00:04:11.840> what<00:04:12.409> gun<00:04:12.739> is

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.650 
the distance that it feels the right it
feels<00:04:43.949> balanced<00:04:44.639> and<00:04:45.000> you<00:04:45.360> get<00:04:45.539> the

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
feels balanced and you get the

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.969 
feels balanced and you get the
perception<00:04:46.229> and<00:04:46.380> that<00:04:46.500> everything<00:04:46.710> is

perception and that everything is

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:56.690 
perception and that everything is
working<00:04:47.280> as<00:04:47.520> a<00:04:47.940> package

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.670 

we<00:04:57.700> live<00:04:57.850> back<00:04:58.330> at<00:04:58.690> this<00:04:58.870> porch<00:04:59.230> game<00:04:59.440> actually

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
we live back at this porch game actually

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.490 
we live back at this porch game actually
looks<00:04:59.920> looking<00:05:00.400> at<00:05:00.490> fifa<00:05:00.940> madden<00:05:01.540> and<00:05:02.380> what

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
looks looking at fifa madden and what

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.810 
looks looking at fifa madden and what
they've<00:05:02.680> done<00:05:02.920> but<00:05:02.980> the<00:05:03.190> players<00:05:03.460> when

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
they've done but the players when

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.890 
they've done but the players when
they're<00:05:03.970> running<00:05:04.060> around<00:05:04.510> and<00:05:04.720> are<00:05:04.810> keeping

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
they're running around and are keeping

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.920 
they're running around and are keeping
the<00:05:05.140> ball<00:05:05.290> it<00:05:05.530> looks<00:05:05.740> so<00:05:06.040> realistic<00:05:06.280> and

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
the ball it looks so realistic and

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.240 
the ball it looks so realistic and
imagine<00:05:07.930> that<00:05:07.960> we<00:05:08.170> took<00:05:08.590> that<00:05:08.830> animation

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
imagine that we took that animation

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.100 
imagine that we took that animation
system<00:05:09.580> and<00:05:10.060> brought<00:05:10.300> that<00:05:10.480> into<00:05:10.720> a<00:05:10.900> sugar

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
system and brought that into a sugar

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.990 
system and brought that into a sugar
game<00:05:11.470> so<00:05:11.800> when<00:05:12.040> the<00:05:12.160> soldiers<00:05:12.610> are<00:05:12.700> running

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
game so when the soldiers are running

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.180 
game so when the soldiers are running
around<00:05:13.090> gunning<00:05:13.750> each<00:05:13.840> other<00:05:14.050> it<00:05:14.680> looks<00:05:14.950> so

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
around gunning each other it looks so

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.460 
around gunning each other it looks so
fluid<00:05:15.490> so<00:05:16.000> realistic<00:05:16.330> and<00:05:16.660> then<00:05:16.870> for<00:05:17.080> us<00:05:17.200> you

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
fluid so realistic and then for us you

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.370 
fluid so realistic and then for us you
know<00:05:17.500> we<00:05:17.740> start<00:05:18.100> the<00:05:18.250> game<00:05:18.430> at<00:05:18.610> a<00:05:18.760> very<00:05:18.940> tense

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
know we start the game at a very tense

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.080 
know we start the game at a very tense
cinematic<00:05:20.380> moment<00:05:20.770> and<00:05:20.950> frostbite<00:05:21.610> basically

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
cinematic moment and frostbite basically

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.480 
cinematic moment and frostbite basically
has<00:05:22.600> allowed<00:05:22.870> us<00:05:22.930> to<00:05:23.140> create<00:05:23.410> that<00:05:23.860> very<00:05:24.100> human

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
has allowed us to create that very human

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.010 
has allowed us to create that very human
aspect<00:05:24.910> which<00:05:25.060> we're<00:05:25.210> going<00:05:25.360> our<00:05:25.540> key<00:05:25.690> tenants

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
aspect which we're going our key tenants

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.180 
aspect which we're going our key tenants
for<00:05:26.170> the<00:05:26.260> game<00:05:26.470> and<00:05:26.710> really<00:05:26.890> bring<00:05:27.160> the

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
for the game and really bring the

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.980 
for the game and really bring the
emotion<00:05:27.640> out<00:05:27.700> in<00:05:27.850> Jack<00:05:28.090> because<00:05:28.330> he's<00:05:28.480> he

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
emotion out in Jack because he's he

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.410 
emotion out in Jack because he's he
opens<00:05:29.380> the<00:05:29.500> game<00:05:29.680> up<00:05:29.890> and<00:05:30.130> beyond<00:05:30.730> that<00:05:30.820> I<00:05:31.180> mean

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
opens the game up and beyond that I mean

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.910 
opens the game up and beyond that I mean
as<00:05:31.570> we've<00:05:32.020> described<00:05:32.410> some<00:05:32.620> of<00:05:32.650> the<00:05:32.740> moments

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
as we've described some of the moments

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.010 
as we've described some of the moments
you<00:05:33.160> go<00:05:33.310> through<00:05:33.580> over<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.030> course<00:05:34.150> a<00:05:34.510> lot<00:05:34.660> of

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
you go through over the course a lot of

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.780 
you go through over the course a lot of
them<00:05:35.110> are<00:05:35.290> very<00:05:35.410> animated<00:05:35.590> moments<00:05:36.370> and<00:05:36.520> so

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
them are very animated moments and so

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.400 
them are very animated moments and so
the<00:05:36.910> animation<00:05:37.420> and<00:05:37.600> din<00:05:37.720> across<00:05:38.050> fighters

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
the animation and din across fighters

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.840 
the animation and din across fighters
that<00:05:38.530> allowed<00:05:38.800> us<00:05:38.830> to<00:05:39.010> pull<00:05:39.400> off<00:05:39.550> some<00:05:39.820> of

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
that allowed us to pull off some of

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.150 
that allowed us to pull off some of
these<00:05:40.330> moments<00:05:40.630> and<00:05:41.020> these<00:05:41.110> these<00:05:41.530> epic<00:05:41.920> beats

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
these moments and these these epic beats

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.920 
these moments and these these epic beats
in<00:05:42.400> the<00:05:42.490> part<00:05:42.790> of<00:05:42.850> the<00:05:42.940> journey<00:05:43.090> that<00:05:43.270> we<00:05:43.780> would

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
in the part of the journey that we would

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.850 
in the part of the journey that we would
have<00:05:44.080> been<00:05:44.200> otherwise

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
have been otherwise

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.089 
have been otherwise
I<00:05:48.990> think<00:05:49.990> it's<00:05:50.080> great<00:05:50.199> that<00:05:50.289> we've<00:05:50.590> made<00:05:50.919> this

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
I think it's great that we've made this

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:53.129 
I think it's great that we've made this
engine<00:05:51.550> and<00:05:51.699> then<00:05:51.819> be<00:05:52.090> able<00:05:52.150> to<00:05:52.360> share<00:05:52.659> it<00:05:52.870> so

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
engine and then be able to share it so

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:55.529 
engine and then be able to share it so
with<00:05:53.289> other<00:05:53.409> teams<00:05:53.710> and<00:05:53.979> just<00:05:54.159> like<00:05:54.400> focus<00:05:55.389> and

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
with other teams and just like focus and

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:57.059 
with other teams and just like focus and
actually<00:05:55.780> making<00:05:55.990> the<00:05:56.110> game<00:05:56.379> and<00:05:56.650> not<00:05:56.949> the

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:57.069 
actually making the game and not the

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:58.860 
actually making the game and not the
technology<00:05:57.430> just<00:05:58.060> that<00:05:58.210> we<00:05:58.449> actually<00:05:58.599> got

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
technology just that we actually got

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.959 
technology just that we actually got
that<00:05:59.199> stuff<00:05:59.439> back<00:05:59.650> from<00:05:59.710> you<00:06:00.009> guys<00:06:00.219> we<00:06:00.699> have

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:00.969 
that stuff back from you guys we have

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.360 
that stuff back from you guys we have
roads<00:06:01.270> and<00:06:01.599> they<00:06:01.870> built<00:06:02.139> a<00:06:02.500> tool<00:06:02.740> for<00:06:02.800> the

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
roads and they built a tool for the

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.100 
roads and they built a tool for the
building<00:06:03.669> road<00:06:03.849> or<00:06:04.449> actually<00:06:04.719> could<00:06:04.870> bring

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
building road or actually could bring

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.689 
building road or actually could bring
that<00:06:05.319> tool<00:06:05.530> back<00:06:05.710> to<00:06:05.860> valco<00:06:06.250> so<00:06:06.400> we<00:06:06.520> could

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
that tool back to valco so we could

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.059 
that tool back to valco so we could
build<00:06:06.879> roads<00:06:07.419> faster<00:06:08.020> for<00:06:08.259> example<00:06:08.620> that<00:06:08.860> I

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:09.069 
build roads faster for example that I

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:10.800 
build roads faster for example that I
think<00:06:09.250> that's<00:06:09.400> not<00:06:09.639> pretty<00:06:09.849> cool<00:06:10.060> and<00:06:10.629> then

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
think that's not pretty cool and then

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.659 
think that's not pretty cool and then
for<00:06:11.020> us<00:06:11.139> we<00:06:11.500> knew<00:06:11.650> the<00:06:11.860> game<00:06:11.979> we<00:06:12.129> want<00:06:12.340> to<00:06:12.490> make

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
for us we knew the game we want to make

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:13.529 
for us we knew the game we want to make
we<00:06:12.909> looked<00:06:13.090> at<00:06:13.210> a<00:06:13.240> number<00:06:13.330> of<00:06:13.479> different

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:13.539 
we looked at a number of different

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.260 
we looked at a number of different
options<00:06:14.139> and<00:06:14.349> frostbite<00:06:15.280> 2<00:06:15.520> was<00:06:15.729> the<00:06:15.909> one<00:06:16.060> that

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
options and frostbite 2 was the one that

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.269 
options and frostbite 2 was the one that
allowed<00:06:16.509> us<00:06:16.539> to<00:06:16.780> develop<00:06:17.050> the<00:06:17.529> concept<00:06:17.710> and

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:18.279 
allowed us to develop the concept and

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:20.040 
allowed us to develop the concept and
build<00:06:18.490> the<00:06:18.610> game<00:06:18.789> that<00:06:19.060> we<00:06:19.180> want<00:06:19.389> to<00:06:19.509> do<00:06:19.629> you

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
build the game that we want to do you

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.209 
build the game that we want to do you
know<00:06:20.169> what<00:06:20.590> we've<00:06:20.740> delivered<00:06:20.949> this<00:06:21.159> year

greater things in the future you know
the<00:06:25.240> run<00:06:25.689> is<00:06:25.870> just<00:06:26.080> to<00:06:26.199> start<00:06:26.439> what<00:06:26.680> we<00:06:26.770> think

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979 
the run is just to start what we think

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:52.439 
the run is just to start what we think
we<00:06:27.069> can<00:06:27.099> do<00:06:27.310> it's<00:06:27.460> boss<00:06:27.639> fight
