00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
to say that the chopper gunner did do a

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.269 
to say that the chopper gunner did do a
lot<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.689> work<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.560> wasn't<00:00:25.949> playing<00:00:26.099> it

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
lot of work so it wasn't playing it

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.550 
lot of work so it wasn't playing it
quite<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> bit<00:00:26.609> but<00:00:26.910> nonetheless<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.720> 46<00:00:28.439> and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.670 
guys want to see you guys would you guys
rather<00:01:05.970> see<00:01:06.210> mother<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:06.630> three<00:01:06.840> or<00:01:07.020> black<00:01:07.409> ops

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
rather see mother for three or black ops

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.700 
rather see mother for three or black ops
gameplay<00:01:08.510> when<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.540> talk<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.200> do<00:01:10.320> commenters

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
gameplay when I talk and do commenters

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.740 
gameplay when I talk and do commenters
over<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.010> because<00:01:11.189> black<00:01:12.030> ops<00:01:12.240> 2<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.479> coming

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
over that because black ops 2 is coming

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.010 
over that because black ops 2 is coming
up<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.260> think<00:01:13.530> black<00:01:14.130> ops<00:01:14.400> 1<00:01:15.020> gameplay

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
up and I think black ops 1 gameplay

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.620 
up and I think black ops 1 gameplay
would<00:01:16.470> probably<00:01:16.799> be<00:01:16.920> more<00:01:17.100> relevant<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.850> uh<00:01:17.880> I

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
would probably be more relevant and uh I

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.570 
would probably be more relevant and uh I
don't<00:01:18.960> know<00:01:19.080> just<00:01:19.409> whatever<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.799> guys<00:01:19.950> want

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
don't know just whatever you guys want

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.300 
don't know just whatever you guys want
to<00:01:20.670> see<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.119> will<00:01:21.360> try<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.869> get<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.320> play

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
to see I will try to get and play

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.280 
to see I will try to get and play
because<00:01:23.670> at<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.299> time<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.570> do<00:01:24.750> have<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> lot<00:01:25.259> of

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
because at this time I do have a lot of

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.429 
because at this time I do have a lot of
mother<00:01:25.619> 43<00:01:26.600> gameplays<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.020> don't<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.409> a

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
mother 43 gameplays and I don't have a

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.230 
mother 43 gameplays and I don't have a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
lot of black ops game plays but you know

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.910 
lot of black ops game plays but you know
I<00:01:30.270> could<00:01:30.509> probably<00:01:30.540> get<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.869> not<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.439> not

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
I could probably get it not that not

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.190 
I could probably get it not that not
that<00:01:31.950> difficult<00:01:32.280> it's<00:01:32.759> uh<00:01:33.119> black<00:01:33.960> ops<00:01:34.140> game

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
that difficult it's uh black ops game
