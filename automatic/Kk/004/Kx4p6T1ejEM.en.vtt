00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.929 

I<00:00:00.299> want<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.290> do<00:00:01.380> a<00:00:01.410> quick<00:00:01.589> explanation<00:00:01.920> of<00:00:02.520> how

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
I want to do a quick explanation of how

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.420 
I want to do a quick explanation of how
3d<00:00:03.389> coat<00:00:03.600> or<00:00:04.290> any<00:00:04.529> voxel<00:00:04.920> sculpting<00:00:05.279> program

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
3d coat or any voxel sculpting program

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.070 
3d coat or any voxel sculpting program
works<00:00:05.970> by<00:00:06.569> explaining<00:00:07.049> what<00:00:07.470> voxels<00:00:07.919> are<00:00:08.189> and

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
works by explaining what voxels are and

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.499 
works by explaining what voxels are and
how<00:00:10.080> they<00:00:10.950> use<00:00:11.099> that<00:00:11.130> for<00:00:11.400> sculpting<00:00:11.670> so<00:00:12.330> this

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
how they use that for sculpting so this

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.360 
how they use that for sculpting so this
is<00:00:12.630> Maya<00:00:12.809> which<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.530> have<00:00:13.679> more<00:00:13.860> ability<00:00:14.009> to

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
is Maya which I have more ability to

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.290 
is Maya which I have more ability to
show<00:00:14.639> off<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.630> exact<00:00:16.350> voxels<00:00:17.000> to<00:00:18.000> look<00:00:18.180> at

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
show off the exact voxels to look at

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.840 
show off the exact voxels to look at
this<00:00:18.680> so<00:00:19.680> what<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.340> like<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> grid<00:00:20.820> of

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
this so what this is like a grid of

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.570 
this so what this is like a grid of
voxels<00:00:21.330> an<00:00:22.199> array<00:00:22.500> whatever<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.220> basically

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
voxels an array whatever you basically

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.089 
voxels an array whatever you basically
have<00:00:23.850> stacks<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.779> cubes<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.740> cubes<00:00:25.980> can

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
have stacks of cubes and the cubes can

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.670 
have stacks of cubes and the cubes can
hold<00:00:26.250> any<00:00:26.460> kind<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.789> information<00:00:27.199> in<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.349> voxel

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
hold any kind of information in a voxel

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.630 
hold any kind of information in a voxel
sculpting<00:00:29.039> program<00:00:29.160> they're<00:00:29.460> going<00:00:29.580> to

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
sculpting program they're going to

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.759 
sculpting program they're going to
mostly<00:00:29.939> hold<00:00:30.179> density<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:30.840> possibly<00:00:31.590> they

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
mostly hold density but possibly they

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.860 
mostly hold density but possibly they
can<00:00:31.920> hold<00:00:32.250> other<00:00:32.550> information<00:00:33.149> but<00:00:33.719> most

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
can hold other information but most

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.010 
can hold other information but most
importantly<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.469> best<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.010> understand<00:00:36.020> that

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
importantly it's best to understand that

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.080 
importantly it's best to understand that
they<00:00:37.320> are<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:38.399> cubes<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.850> hold

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
they are just cubes that hold

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.810 
they are just cubes that hold
information<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.260> what<00:00:40.680> resolution<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.579> is

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
information so what resolution is is

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.240 
information so what resolution is is
going<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.090> be<00:00:42.210> how<00:00:42.540> dense<00:00:42.870> these<00:00:43.110> cubes<00:00:43.440> are<00:00:43.649> so

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
going to be how dense these cubes are so

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.410 
going to be how dense these cubes are so
when<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.550> when<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.879> fear<00:00:45.090> modeling

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
when you when you fear modeling

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.970 
when you when you fear modeling
something<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.840> any<00:00:46.020> resolution<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.800> but

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
something of any resolution is but

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.200 
something of any resolution is but
you're<00:00:47.190> really<00:00:47.520> going<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.760> be<00:00:47.850> working<00:00:48.120> at

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
you're really going to be working at

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.060 
you're really going to be working at
something<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:48.600> much<00:00:49.559> higher<00:00:49.829> like

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
something like much higher like

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.860 
something like much higher like
something<00:00:50.610> like<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:51.000> which<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.480> why<00:00:51.510> they

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
something like this which is why they

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.400 
something like this which is why they
often<00:00:52.230> don't<00:00:52.800> display<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:54.750> box<00:00:54.960> will<00:00:55.170> grid

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
often don't display the box will grid

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.200 
often don't display the box will grid
we're<00:00:56.100> going<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.280> work<00:00:56.430> at<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> low<00:00:57.000> resolution

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
we're going to work at a low resolution

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.450 
we're going to work at a low resolution
just<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:58.170> demonstration<00:00:58.440> purposes<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.399> I'm

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
just for demonstration purposes and I'm

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.299 
just for demonstration purposes and I'm
also<00:00:59.609> going<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.940> go<00:01:00.149> back<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.359> an<00:01:00.629> easier

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
also going to go back to an easier

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.060 
also going to go back to an easier
viewing<00:01:02.309> method<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.989> look<00:01:04.500> at<00:01:04.680> how

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
viewing method so to look at how

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.690 
viewing method so to look at how
sculpting<00:01:05.700> works<00:01:06.290> we<00:01:07.290> would<00:01:07.500> basically<00:01:08.220> add

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
sculpting works we would basically add

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.859 
sculpting works we would basically add
density<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.170> grid<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:12.270> basically<00:01:12.630> right

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
density to the grid so basically right

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.030 
density to the grid so basically right
now<00:01:12.900> I'm<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.320> adding<00:01:13.650> density<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.740> area

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
now I'm just adding density to this area

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.510 
now I'm just adding density to this area
and<00:01:17.369> when<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.640> go<00:01:17.790> back<00:01:17.939> here<00:01:18.240> we<00:01:18.390> see<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:19.520> mesh

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
and when we go back here we see a mesh

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.590 
and when we go back here we see a mesh
so<00:01:21.119> what<00:01:21.270> that's<00:01:21.390> happening<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
so what that's happening is we have a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.990 
so what that's happening is we have a
mesh<00:01:24.600> covering<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:26.310> voxels<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.880> have

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
mesh covering the voxels that have

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.020 
mesh covering the voxels that have
density<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:28.290> basically<00:01:28.470> just

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
density so it's basically just

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.660 
density so it's basically just
encompassing<00:01:30.030> all<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:31.530> density<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.040> if<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.430> can

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
encompassing all the density so if I can

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.969 
encompassing all the density so if I can
display<00:01:33.030> what<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.450> density<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
display what the density is this is the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.950 
display what the density is this is the
density<00:01:35.310> values<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.299> may<00:01:36.450> notice<00:01:36.750> that

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
density values and you may notice that

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.260 
density values and you may notice that
this<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.770> what<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> bias<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.670> actually<00:01:39.060> I'm<00:01:39.150> glad

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
this is what a bias is actually I'm glad

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.749 
this is what a bias is actually I'm glad
that<00:01:39.509> happened<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.990> basically<00:01:40.680> there's<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
that happened so basically there's a

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.940 
that happened so basically there's a
little<00:01:42.689> bit<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.840> density<00:01:43.470> here<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:43.799> not

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
little bit of density here but not

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.440 
little bit of density here but not
enough<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.399> it's<00:01:44.549> going<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.909> decide<00:01:45.270> to

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
enough that it's going to decide to

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.300 
enough that it's going to decide to
cover<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.110> bias<00:01:46.320> says<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.890> has<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.220> have

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
cover it so the bias says it has to have

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.010 
cover it so the bias says it has to have
at<00:01:47.399> least<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.820> much<00:01:48.000> density<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.659> order<00:01:48.869> to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
at least this much density in order to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.260 
at least this much density in order to
have<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.500> mesh<00:01:49.740> cover<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.430> sometimes<00:01:50.970> when

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
have a mesh cover it so sometimes when

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.580 
have a mesh cover it so sometimes when
you're<00:01:51.420> sculpting<00:01:51.659> you'll<00:01:51.990> see<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.409> like

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
you're sculpting you'll see that like

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.960 
you're sculpting you'll see that like
you'll<00:01:52.799> have<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.950> piece<00:01:53.189> over<00:01:53.430> here<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.820> then

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
you'll have a piece over here and then

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.480 
you'll have a piece over here and then
it<00:01:54.119> disappears<00:01:54.740> when<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.829> smooth<00:01:56.100> because

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
it disappears when you smooth because

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.800 
it disappears when you smooth because
basically<00:01:56.759> what's<00:01:57.030> happening<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.540> smooth

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
basically what's happening is the smooth

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.410 
basically what's happening is the smooth
is<00:01:57.990> making<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.890> boxful<00:01:59.310> areas<00:01:59.670> around<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.210> all

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
is making the boxful areas around it all

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.620 
is making the boxful areas around it all
have<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.899> load<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.549> mesh<00:02:03.000> encompassing

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
have to load to have a mesh encompassing

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.059 
have to load to have a mesh encompassing
it<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.460> I'm<00:02:05.670> going<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:06.060> quickly<00:02:06.360> demonstrate

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
it so I'm going to quickly demonstrate

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.589 
it so I'm going to quickly demonstrate
what<00:02:08.069> it's<00:02:08.220> like<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.640> when<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.119> crease<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
what it's like to when I crease the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.999 
what it's like to when I crease the
resolution<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.080> Maya<00:02:10.259> just<00:02:10.530> disappears

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
resolution of Maya just disappears

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.110 
resolution of Maya just disappears
because<00:02:11.190> I'm<00:02:11.370> not<00:02:11.489> doing<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.030> proper<00:02:12.239> way

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
because I'm not doing it the proper way

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.780 
because I'm not doing it the proper way
let's<00:02:13.209> even<00:02:13.360> go<00:02:13.890> higher<00:02:14.890> this<00:02:15.280> is<00:02:15.400> not<00:02:15.549> even

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
let's even go higher this is not even

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.729 
let's even go higher this is not even
that<00:02:15.819> high<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.330> we<00:02:17.049> will<00:02:17.230> paint<00:02:19.739> something

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
that high and we will paint something

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.670 
that high and we will paint something
let's<00:02:21.129> move<00:02:21.810> slider<00:02:22.810> no<00:02:23.379> locked<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:25.680> so

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
let's move slider no locked it so

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.839 
let's move slider no locked it so
essentially<00:02:29.220> it's<00:02:30.220> actually<00:02:30.579> going<00:02:30.730> really

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
essentially it's actually going really

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.390 
essentially it's actually going really
slow<00:02:31.269> because<00:02:31.989> my<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.349> not<00:02:32.500> a<00:02:32.709> box<00:02:33.250> of

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
slow because my is not a box of

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.140 
slow because my is not a box of
sculpting<00:02:33.760> program<00:02:34.260> it's<00:02:35.260> a<00:02:35.879> thinking<00:02:36.879> really

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
sculpting program it's a thinking really

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.180 
sculpting program it's a thinking really
hard<00:02:37.269> I<00:02:37.659> actually<00:02:37.780> did<00:02:38.079> not<00:02:38.230> expect<00:02:38.769> it<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.099> be

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
hard I actually did not expect it to be

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.899 
hard I actually did not expect it to be
this<00:02:39.220> slow<00:02:39.549> it<00:02:39.700> should<00:02:39.909> work<00:02:40.090> all<00:02:40.810> right<00:02:41.909> there

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
this slow it should work all right there

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.240 
this slow it should work all right there
goes<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.450> now<00:02:43.569> when<00:02:43.720> we<00:02:43.810> go<00:02:43.840> back<00:02:44.140> this<00:02:45.010> is<00:02:45.160> the

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
goes so now when we go back this is the

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.430 
goes so now when we go back this is the
voxels<00:02:45.760> as<00:02:47.069> as<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.640> is<00:02:48.760> as<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:48.940> mesh<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.319> can

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
voxels as as it is as a mesh and you can

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.660 
voxels as as it is as a mesh and you can
start<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.680> see<00:02:50.769> that<00:02:51.160> like<00:02:51.340> now<00:02:51.519> you're

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
start to see that like now you're

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.009 
start to see that like now you're
starting<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.940> get<00:02:52.060> details<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:52.720> stuff<00:02:52.810> in

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
starting to get details and stuff in

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.630 
starting to get details and stuff in
there<00:02:53.140> but<00:02:53.170> of<00:02:53.379> course<00:02:53.620> as<00:02:53.859> a<00:02:53.920> sculptor<00:02:54.280> you'd

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
there but of course as a sculptor you'd

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.759 
there but of course as a sculptor you'd
want<00:02:54.879> even<00:02:55.209> more<00:02:55.239> details<00:02:55.780> but<00:02:56.470> this<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:56.739> just

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
want even more details but this is just

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.349 
want even more details but this is just
to<00:02:56.950> give<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.129> a<00:02:57.160> sense<00:02:57.340> why<00:02:57.609> the<00:02:57.670> computer

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
to give you a sense why the computer

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.000 
to give you a sense why the computer
goes<00:02:58.540> gets<00:02:58.870> really<00:02:59.140> slows<00:02:59.500> because<00:02:59.769> it's

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
goes gets really slows because it's

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.220 
goes gets really slows because it's
already<00:03:00.430> making<00:03:00.879> tons<00:03:01.269> of<00:03:01.450> voxels<00:03:01.840> in<00:03:02.019> order

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
already making tons of voxels in order

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.610 
already making tons of voxels in order
to<00:03:02.409> fill<00:03:03.190> in<00:03:03.340> this<00:03:03.519> shape<00:03:04.440> anyway<00:03:05.440> I<00:03:05.470> just

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
to fill in this shape anyway I just

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.830 
to fill in this shape anyway I just
wanted<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:06.040> give<00:03:06.159> this<00:03:07.000> demonstration<00:03:07.599> to

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
wanted to give this demonstration to

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.390 
wanted to give this demonstration to
give<00:03:08.019> people<00:03:08.409> a<00:03:08.500> better<00:03:08.620> idea<00:03:08.890> of<00:03:09.129> what's

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
give people a better idea of what's

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.130 
give people a better idea of what's
going<00:03:09.459> on<00:03:09.760> behind<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.239> scenes<00:03:10.510> just<00:03:10.690> a<00:03:10.870> little

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
going on behind the scenes just a little

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.289 
going on behind the scenes just a little
bit<00:03:11.319> even<00:03:11.950> conceptually<00:03:12.430> so<00:03:12.879> that<00:03:13.030> we<00:03:13.120> can

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
bit even conceptually so that we can

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:14.910 
bit even conceptually so that we can
understand<00:03:13.810> why<00:03:14.019> things<00:03:14.079> are<00:03:14.440> happening<00:03:14.470> when

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
understand why things are happening when

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.520 
understand why things are happening when
they<00:03:15.010> do<00:03:15.209> when<00:03:16.209> you're<00:03:16.329> sculpting<00:03:16.569> I<00:03:16.930> hope

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
they do when you're sculpting I hope

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.950 
they do when you're sculpting I hope
this<00:03:17.650> helps
