00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello dear friends today with us 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.190
 There will be such a review consisting of two 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.080
 parts 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.760
 the fact is that we talk today 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.840
 knives which was provided by the shop 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.230
 knives have such a blade 15 10 15 050 bone 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.609
 the collector from the company screwed in did 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.830
 something that may have been similar to the channel 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.600
 I would like to tell you in detail 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.800
 about him I do not see the needs just today 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.109
 saw him in a slightly different version 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.750
 in the store took the laptop to show viewers 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.279
 yes that they have been and several others here 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.410
 so let's do so kratenko 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.120
 look at the knife itself and then there will be some 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.410
 the second part of the review which may be 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.910
 it will not be very interesting to someone 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.510
 more emotional somewhat more 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.530
 general what exactly this knife 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.360
 here and you thought he was already on 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.270
 The channel was showing the overlay made of 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.260
 medical cards here is such a green black 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.930
 it looks pretty accurate 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.610
 less statement cool done but damn 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.719
 to the shelves of bone collector otherwise knife 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.899
 you that the same steel d2 lock back-lock 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:00.270
 the blade is thick there by 4 blending 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.899
 who is he like that here 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:11.400
 let's say a little weight so briefly 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:12.990
 then such a knife 113 grams about 10 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.119
 centimeters if I remember correctly 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.390
 here close to that wedge 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.210
 here 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:23.960
 which made up to 2 model number made 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.340
 maybe not states of america so clem 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.960
 boom boom boom collector in more detail what 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.400
 This is a series of other reviews in general. 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.180
 can you see me told 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.040
 already in this fact actually in 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.560
 I already told the previous review that as 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.210
 It seemed to me such a kind of such 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.310
 the model is interesting is it is your 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.840
 sort of development tank 110 companies 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.479
 Pinchuk, that is, I sometimes 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.810
 it seems that every self-respecting 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.450
 companies well on live at large 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.850
 yes there is thin but also development here 110 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.439
 bork 's model is just that 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.750
 on its own tank to understand this is not just a knife 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.090
 companies tank yes it's just generally such 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.399
 here it is just here some kind of folding 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.729
 knives here can not be so says that this is 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.610
 exactly 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.500
 some kind there 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.300
 look for something separate models this in 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.890
 her lessons are really kind she more 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.750
 50 years on the market how to justify 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.190
 has a stable demand both in different 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.470
 most performances from different companies 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.650
 like that buys here actually 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.570
 we are dealing with such a pretty expensive 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.990
 versions of such knives 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.060
 Olja buck 110 up but companies are stuffing but 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.820
 what's totally cool how would you 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.450
 all watts where there will not talk about 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.660
 that how normal 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.220
 talk about the existence of such 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.870
 variations like hunting folding knives 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.940
 because well understood here is like 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.550
 a series of questions but let's talk 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.470
 about it so buck 110 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.850
 This, too, hunting a folding knife and on so 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.130
 positioned by the manufacturer and 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.630
 sold for 50 years that is why 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.760
 let's probably not argue about it 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.260
 I myself do not quite agree with the concept 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.270
 folding hunting knife but she 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.250
 exists and there will actually be a bone 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.620
 collector he by and large carcasses are not 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.750
 I refer here and in its way it is also 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.550
 wonderful opener here, in principle, 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.410
 probably like in front of the camera and his 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.940
 twisted enough so that anyone could 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.470
 on him just admire what else 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.570
 there were these knives and now we 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.430
 own talk why there have been 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.709
 because here I want to put here 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.570
 so they learn to tell you that the series 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.260
 boom collector a couple of years ago she was removed from 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.720
 production 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.030
 but so close to two years here and 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.489
 replaced by a series of bandage milhan 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.390
 benchmark hunt which is simply called 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.400
 Hunter knives 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.110
 then it was bold but i'm at first 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.870
 moment thought that people and contract dog 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.459
 dark because the bone collector is 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.930
 noise and American television of some kind 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.390
 there was as if there existed 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.250
 I know hunting is such a creep apparently 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.830
 which will end and just with a little 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.900
 alterations have become successful models of this 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.519
 series translate here in the hunting line 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.519
 our company benchmade 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:53.290
 here is the result of this translation 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:57.019
 next one this knife didnâ€™t get there and 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.790
 Now bearing in mind that there is published 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.620
 ruslan kiyas release wonderful video 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.989
 about the knife 746 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.540
 from the benchmade company I want to 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.000
 say another thing for example 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.709
 sorry vodka would mundo the quality of the company 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.900
 bench we are in terms of marketing i 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.810
 in general, in principle, I do not understand what they are 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.430
 guided when they take and almost 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.949
 half your punch 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.009
 lower models of folding knives are removed 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.990
 serial production, that is, let's say 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:27.110
 nipples decide that I recently showed 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.539
 we understood that yes they removed him from 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.139
 Syria began to release there ugly 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:36.199
 dear limitki with him well, as if clear here 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:38.060
 let's say here 746 Ivan slot in principle 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.800
 Ruslan said that all that he seems to be 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.780
 produced the most so simple and 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.960
 in some places is not very clear performance and 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.460
 then the simplest improvements that could 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.470
 would be in the serial model easily 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.330
 only fleming is done for others. 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.590
 already quite money but this knife 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.070
 1550 bone collector is wonderful 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.419
 add up completely in your niche 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.270
 just disappeared from sales that is just 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.520
 disappeared and all its big the same nonsense 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.680
 There are a number of others of our company . 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.270
 which are simply taken out of production 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.430
 although it is absolutely wonderful knives 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.060
 that is, as far as I remember, and if not 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.620
 I am mistaken now is not produced torrent 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.180
 from disappeared all the dishes and in due time 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.820
 was quite trial on the secondary 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.530
 the market can be found 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.090
 there is the same thing disappeared near the deja vu mask 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.949
 for example as if that is just too 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.090
 took off the production all why its even 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:28.940
 in or not as well, no matter how but 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.919
 absolutely wonderful here and again 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.020
 and still have to attend to such examples 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:35.180
 you can call a lot for example there by me 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.860
 favorite acts only on me there 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.300
 hitler as a soldier for example was shot 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.539
 produced the same garbage 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:45.169
 bench mine completed my apparently contract 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:47.030
 With Heckler Koch launched some simply 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.710
 black series tactical so to speak 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.020
 knives and this one is the best 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.780
 drop dead lightweight 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.280
 practically all stainless steel with 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.500
 A plastic handle is very 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.360
 reliably without any liners there weight on 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.280
 there is less blood 70 if not mistaken then 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.860
 the channel has a review of one of its 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.380
 versions just disappeared from sale why 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.419
 damn so i don't understand how would i just 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.449
 for my taste bench mother takes off with 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:13.099
 production of almost everything on the belly 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:14.659
 unless we can't see the magicians 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:17.009
 who are there for a long time and for a long time 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:20.050
 produced 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:22.449
 how to say so lucky really 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.399
 model but for the most part most 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:27.309
 their most successful models exchange with 

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:29.469
 production took off and you look at it 

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:32.679
 what comes out new and honestly have 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:34.419
 big question is it possible under this new 

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:36.309
 replace those great models 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:38.559
 knives that were made let's say there 

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:41.499
 five years ago a huge bunch and which 

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:43.689
 did the company name beachwood now about 

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:45.129
 I can't say it but actually 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:46.809
 but the boom could become a collector output 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:48.610
 I hear admire hope you too 

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:51.339
 interesting and nice despite my tut 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.899
 such cries of company displeasure. 

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:56.069
 I hope that you were interested in a lot 

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:56.069
 thanks for watching bye
