 gorgeous victoria yushkevich which in 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.290
 mostly located behind cameras and 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.269

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.080
 beach on california beach david and but 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.039
 sunset 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.640
 really you often asked me 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.260
 about dinner how to eat right 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.060
 in the evening especially after training 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.480
 because all day we can do everything 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:38.790
 right but if you spoil everything in the evening 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.590
 any pasta for sure 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.899
 friends if you did everything all day 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.300
 right in breakfast as needed all 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.430
 day ate fed on eating protein equal 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.930
 portions of the most important thing in the evening all 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.600
 do too right then why are you 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.600
 already grabbed these brokers so they knew 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.399
 what can there be so many marriages 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.780
 no, not only this huge 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.180
 piece of tuna 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.940
 guys but this tuna was real 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.829
 caught in the pacific fish not 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.920
 surely no but fish 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.080
 if she is not fat rich in protein always 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.570
 and here is such a healthy piece 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.970
 will give you at least this piece will give 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.560
 80 grams of protein for me here's broccoli with 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.360
 the point is just perfect for men 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.960
 and of course a little soy sauce 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.539
 before the age also committed yes because the topic 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.460
 the site usually does not tell him salt i am not 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.140
 I open it because it is practically not 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.159
 I 'm eating like this, friends, I think 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.159
 move from words to deeds 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.479
 dean he scold me now 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.899
 but I will do it baby like a piece 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.310
 one point 450 grams but a little less 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.560
 400 grams life 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.890
 went the process will become fry with two 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.020
 sides two three minutes in the middle he 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.030
 should become and professionals 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.770
 They said that a piece of such thickness is 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.130
 ok that is what cut along not 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.289
 you need a cold, you want everyone 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:04.500
 god now it's gonna be eaten 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:07.380
 and everything is well, not straight before bedtime in the second 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.780
 Although there is a before bedtime in this 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.370
 case we have pure protein 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.580
 that is, fat here in general is practically 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.350
 no but broccoli 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.720
 naturally fiber bound vegetables 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.799
 will be fried without oil a drop 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.989
 oils we did not use 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.780
 that is, we fry on a non-stick 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.489
 coated and allowed us to glory 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.830
 god so guys i wanted you 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.470
 tell about proteins and about dinner 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.970
 right and how about including 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.989
 reduce the amount of subcutaneous fat 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.120
 because it seems to me the majority 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.709
 question then denis how to dry to 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.590
 just friends to dry with 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.860
 strictest control over carbohydrates this 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.079
 mean that in the afternoon all 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.620
 depends on you if there is will power not 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.230
 to eat 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.880
 no side dishes, I'm talking about 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.100
 everyones 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.709
 doris pasta buckwheat nothing potatoes 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.819

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:03.450
 no buns cookies there is oksana and 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:06.480
 sweets yes or juice or even coffee with 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.239
 sugar if you have the strength to hold on 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.239
 egg whites or fish lean on 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.980
 vegetables here is the key diet but naturally 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.230
 need to understand that this protein went 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.760
 him as an energy industry all over again 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.440
 will not be able to use protein as 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.060
 energy but to this protein 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.910
 was used as a building 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.680
 muscle material 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.440
 you need to preload your muscles 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.060
 so a perfect evening is built on my 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.670
 the look as follows is very cool 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.300

 eat right first 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.030
 turn to really study your 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.360
 organism that only comes with time with 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.740
 years of training and years of trying 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.020
 adapt to all this 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.110
 variety of food that is in the world 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.910
 such that i tell you what the key is the key 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.590
 it is to break up protein intake 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.390
 throughout the day with equal portions 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.670
 that is, the protein we have goes you say 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.570
 horizontal carbohydrate lines do we have 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.350
 always go down the line always 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.450
 do you train us a lot 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.430
 do you train on the terrain or even 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.410
 dramatically dry you carbohydrates 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.230
 always go down the line 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:34.100
 that is, in the morning it can be either a lot 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:36.590
 either a little but they should be in the evening 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.150
 there will be either little or zero in this 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.920
 the case is almost zero 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.630
 I'll tell you what I'm used to 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.970
 no problem dine without carbohydrates 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.650
 absolutely and thanks to that i 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.940
 support the percentage of complex fat 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.160
 between eighty 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.630
 if i put up i want to do now 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.580
 the next few weeks here 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.470
 california is to rest and make six 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.940
 percent of subcutaneous fat but there through 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.940
 month will see places 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:07.350
 tastier than I really thought
