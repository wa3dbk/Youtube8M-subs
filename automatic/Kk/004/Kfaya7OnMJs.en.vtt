aggro<00:00:18.300> list<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.869> guess<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.710> changes<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.160> I

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
aggro list I guess the changes that I

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.609 
aggro list I guess the changes that I
would<00:00:20.609> make<00:00:20.789> in<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.060> deck<00:00:21.300> would<00:00:21.750> definitely

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
would make in this deck would definitely

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.759 
would make in this deck would definitely
be<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.460> bring<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.970> flings<00:00:24.410> fling<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.619> up

then<00:03:25.290> in<00:03:25.530> response<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.040> them<00:03:26.190> not<00:03:26.880> doing

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
then in response to them not doing

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.610 
then in response to them not doing
anything<00:03:27.390> you<00:03:27.660> Boros<00:03:28.020> charm<00:03:28.290> give<00:03:28.500> them
