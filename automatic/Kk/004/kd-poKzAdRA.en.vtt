00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello in touch oleg patsy 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.799
 smm blog art business in this video 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.719
 i will tell you some chips in 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.660
 targeted advertising vkontakte 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.969
 namely, they will be 15 I hope you will find 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.310
 something useful trick number 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.380
 one the less action the better 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.539
 the result therefore with a targeted 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.910
 advertising is better to drive traffic to the landing 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.519
 page where you can purchase 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.830
 product or service rather than community 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.260
 In general, it depends on the masters who did 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.149
 community or landing page can 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.980
 disperse the community which will 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.610
 sell no worse than landing 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.530
 page 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.989
 but in most cases pus is better 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.510
 traffic directly to the external resource chip 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.520
 number two exclusive ad format 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.680
 it is better to use retargeting base 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.260
 because such ads are costing 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.840
 more expensive and impressive retargeting base 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.820
 thus reducing the cost of such a clique 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.399
 in a way to profitably promote special 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.680
 shares on existing base chip number 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.410
 three carefully watch the speed 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.870
 growth indicator reach audience divided 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.119
 on 2 types of those who click and those who do not 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.350
 Clicking coverage allows you to increase 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.020
 number of audience 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.479
 Therefore, this indicator is so important only 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.390
 with increasing coverage you get new clicks 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.700
 chip number four if coverage is not growing 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.340
 then no clicks shows can go 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.770
 there are no clicks for the same audience 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.990
 then it will fall networks if city or 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.570
 falls then increase the cost per thousand 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.390
 hits so the coverage rate 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.210
 will grow again and networks will rise 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.909
 chip number five using the payment method 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.100
 for impressions in pay per click high 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.439
 competition and there achieve value 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.930
 a click at ten thirty kopecks is unreal 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.159
 make an urgent announcement and become a way 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.770
 pay for shows 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.020
 chip number six with payment method for 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.600
 Impressions Limit up to one hundred impressions 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.850
 per person there is no need to drain the budget 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.950
 those who do not click chip number seven 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.439
 using ad format big 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.110
 image picture plays an important role 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.729
 to attract the attention of the target 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.490
 audience and this is exactly what we need 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.950
 chip number eight using object 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.679
 advertising an external site even if 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.780
 promoting communities 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.390
 external site can put scripts 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.250
 redirect to your communities and script 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.319
 to collect retargeting base 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.959
 it is important to collect in one base those who 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.730
 clicks on your ads later this 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.540
 You can show new audiences 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.489
 ads 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.769
 chip number nine in settings 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.719
 Ads use retargeting bases 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.540
 showing ads only target 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:34.609
 the audience or vice versa excluding some 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.469
 specific database without showing ads 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:38.480
 those who are in this database 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:40.700
 for example, you can create a separate database 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.889
 buyers and me show yours 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.560
 promotional offer for which they already 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:47.629
 agreed chip number 10 always do 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.970
 both testing ad testing 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.549
 all image headers target 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.310
 landing page audience leaves 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.810
 only effective chip number 11 if 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.939
 are you sure your ad and not 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.010
 contrary to the rules of the VKontakte 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.200
 send ads for moderation again 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.389
 maybe it was rejected by mistake 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.150
 probably next time approve chip 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:10.069
 number 12 celsius in the interests of the target 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.730
 audience using communities by 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.310
 interests 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.010

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.819
 sites for aiming 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.449
 this is another good way of getting into 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.479
 interests 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:26.030

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.750
 chip number 15 for each ad becoming 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.909

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.359

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.889
 once ads run out of clicks 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.139
 stop going about the budget will
