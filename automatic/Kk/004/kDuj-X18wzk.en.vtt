00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.530
 Now let's talk about legislation. 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.140
 be aware of the changes in the tracks and plates of the trucks that now have new 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.240
 regulation of denatran hatoyama 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.709
 in recent years several laws have been created have stopped the security of the 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.689
 So our take is here for the advantage. 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.740
 the first discussion arose in the early 2000s I want the 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:27.559
 obligatory installation of these reflective strips both in the pocket and 

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:29.050
 on the bumper of the truck 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.190
 now the discussion can back and around another reflective range that this 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.230
 hence known as gold band on it are placed used date the door of the 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.970
 vehicle and also from your home city 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.310
 but will the installation of gold track sar to further increase the 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.310
 safety of those in the running 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.359
 instead of sitting in the door of the truck on the body 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:59.239
 began in the 1950's the paintings were on green background with red lettering 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.650
 and not all put this information 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.450
 listing besides shows who some trucks the data of the apav also 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.820
 hit with the painting done on the chest 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.820
 which to place order in the business the option was adopted a reflective band 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.160
 and with a better contrast the yellow river black 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.840
 the technology used 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.299
 is the same maid in the manufacture of white and red bands 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:27.850
 one of the most advanced in signaling 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.860
 is the film with microcrystals that facilitated the return of light and allows the 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.620
 track to be searched overnight for other vehicles 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.110
 when it uses the reflective strip on the back of the truck 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.750
 he is not only going to have security for himself because it is one more item 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.700
 Reflecting on the truck 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.130
 which facilitates visibility by other vehicles coming from behind 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.820
 as well as the part of it will be easily seen 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.800
 today's security systems aimed at the safety of the truck itself. 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.980
 It's okay for all the pavilions to be bold again. 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.990
 which weighed more 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.990
 but there are many roadblocks who still do not even know that the modification 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.219
 needs to be done left over 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:20.290
 the other will have to prepare my so far I could not swim was okay 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.059
 What do you think of this new determination of the contract 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.079
 so far rafael marques 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.669
 for mothers 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:29.649
 increases the safety of those who are on the road 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:33.240
 but the safety for the best scene radars 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.439
 we have a king's cup 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:35.889
 direct look 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:39.649
 I think this helps prevent deadly accidents I believe now 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:40.789
 leaves 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:43.309
 I want to feel like a full bottle 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:45.279
 it's missing a long way 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:47.799
 but everything was not bad 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.609
 This car told the delegate 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:54.540
 he is your partner lulinha roamed the great sÃ£o paulo and region of campinas 

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:59.459
 making a prayer there is a seller's orbit of the products so that the 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.679
 has been legalized 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:03.859
 it is they who have already become aware 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.099
 and really the knife is not for lunch at home for them is for own 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.439
 trucker's safety when leaving Grandma's house is about nothing now 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.520
 that he just took off 719 set 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.669
 I fight to make the delivery of hortifruti 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:21.589
 What did you think of this new counter-resolution? 

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:22.979
 then I thought it was great 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:25.229
 it will be wonderful 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:28.259
 I will repeat the very safe time practiced 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.609
 the tite is 45 reais 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:37.139
 in wooden bodies focused on the regular surface the sticker is glued 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.189
 on an aluminum plate and then turned upside down 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.359
 the reinaldo is one more that is now inside the law so we have to do 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.079
 at 7 o'clock 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.310
 On thursday 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.039
 aa safety for all of us 

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:51.719
 so you have to do it correctly 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.540
 you leverage to sell from the computer team to the other goals 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.390
 in the long run there would be more was the remote attack the good stature 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.259
 certainly every part 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:04.989
 use the little they have 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.780
 moreover it began to 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.280
 but from September who does not have the truck standardized 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.769
 was entitled to a fine of 120 reais and sixty-nine cents 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:18.619
 five points in the portfolio and vehicle retention 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.250
 and very careful with the pirated product 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.950
 product has no validity what movie must have the 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.160
 approved application denatran and the manufacturer's mark 

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:35.149
 For example, the moratorium has returned to comply with the 

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:38.149
 required 

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:43.240
 the partnership since it is to increase the safety in the advantage 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.680
 the collapse of this afternoon by the leaf in the reflective strip in the forest own car 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.830
 of reporting 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.290
