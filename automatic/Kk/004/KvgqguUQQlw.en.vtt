00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.950
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.900
 special edition of winter tire test us 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.820
 compare three alternatives for today 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.340
 the winter and betrayed in which of 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.020
 best tire for you is for the test 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.320
 we brought along a thoroughbred 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.020
 winter tires the cheap alternative 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.520
 a retreaded winter tire and 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.340
 a so-called year-round or 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.320
 All-weather tires are still on the 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.880
 Car tires are summer tires and it 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.160
 should be clear to everyone that in the 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.110
 Winter does not work three of the 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.030
 Tires come from the same house 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.460
 namely of goodyear dunlop 's 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.730
 retreaded is a rest of winter m 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.620
 and s even when the car is in the 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.540
 level with summer tires still moving 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.910
 is not later than the first light 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.980
 Hill ends and turns the mature first 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.580
 once through the adhesion breaks completely 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.900
 and then there is no stopping 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.370
 what you see here is a full stop 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.830
 with summer tires off 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.040
 step speed no question 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.330
 Summer tires have lost nothing here 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.939
 surprisingly good at this 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.409
 Exercise already the all-season tire 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:15.189
 co-director four seasons of the hill becomes 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.189
 effortlessly mastered 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.469
 when accelerating in the plane 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.409
 reached test car with it for a short time 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:28.009
 after the winter tires ultra grip 8 tempo 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.299
 30 and before the retreaded too 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.429
 Downhill you have to be with this 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.159
 all-season tires cause little worries 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:36.979
 what else for all three mature with 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.479
 m s symbol on the flank is added 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.670
 this measurement lies between the 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.649
 winter tires and the retreaded one 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.550
 car length squeezes in between 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.770
 all season tires 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.720
 in principle one can with all three 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.760
 mature types so winter tires 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.650
 retreaded winter tires but also 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.320
 good for the whole year tires 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.710
 Winter are coming like beating each other 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.330
 These tires when there is no snow for 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.520
 the wet and dry attempts attract that 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.500
 Test team in the much warmer region 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.260
 on the mediterranean and changes again 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.910
 diligent mature 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.980
 the test center of goodyear dunlop in 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.060
 Their choice offers with their former 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:16.590
 formula 1 stretch ideal conditions of 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.630
 Summer tire feels more dry 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.490
 road much better the retreaded 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.310
 Winter tire shows when braking 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.170
 significant weaknesses 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.270
 So be careful at high speed 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.270
 however, this applies to all winter profiles 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.260
 It is amazing that the pure 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.000
 winter tires are even better delayed here 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.190
 as the all-season tire of 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.190
 retreaded needs a full ten meters 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.210
 more than the summer tire 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.400
 The testers are waiting for the 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.290
 try results of the night at 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.570
 brakes on a wet road fall 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.950
 differ rather low of course 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.489
 also because the initial speed 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.230
 here is only 80 km h 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.030
 even if the distance is not great is the 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.370
 Nevertheless, summer tires can noticeably more 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.349
 transmitted braking force 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.720
 The last discipline is when it is wet 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.610
 split into two straight and in curves 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.560
 The tires must show how good they are 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.780
 Pizzas get along the refried 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.790
 winter tires plow straight on 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.010
 but not through puddles 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.260
 Curves of summer tires with his 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.159
 lower profile depth displaces the 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.159
 Water is not that good 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.239
 our conclusion the timely change 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.900
 between summer and winter tires 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.000
 ideal 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.519
 while the cheap retreads 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.319
 for occasion drivers always from who 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.390
 But the change completely save 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.580
 i want to be the most expensive mature in the world 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.650
 Test well served the all-season tires 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.650
 actually works everywhere
