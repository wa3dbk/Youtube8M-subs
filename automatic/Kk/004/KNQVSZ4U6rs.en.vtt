the guys at the bike shop we're telling

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.700 
the guys at the bike shop we're telling
me<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:38.670> too<00:00:38.820> much<00:00:39.000> watch<00:00:39.270> for<00:00:39.570> me<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.870> didn't

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
me it's too much watch for me I didn't

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.590 
me it's too much watch for me I didn't
need<00:00:40.800> anything<00:00:41.129> that's<00:00:41.489> complicated<00:00:41.850> but<00:00:42.300> I

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
need anything that's complicated but I

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.329 
need anything that's complicated but I
found<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.620> really<00:00:43.890> wasn't<00:00:44.309> that

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
found that it really wasn't that

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.639 
found that it really wasn't that
complicated<00:00:44.659> you<00:00:45.659> know<00:00:45.780> after<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.140> get<00:00:46.350> into

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
complicated you know after you get into

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.380 
complicated you know after you get into
it<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.859> little<00:00:47.070> bit<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.399> instructions<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:48.359> be

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
it a little bit the instructions can be

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.299 
it a little bit the instructions can be
a<00:00:48.510> little<00:00:48.629> tricky<00:00:48.749> but<00:00:49.499> once<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.800> get<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> plan

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
a little tricky but once you get to plan

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.130 
a little tricky but once you get to plan
with<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.519> watch<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.690> made<00:00:51.870> everything

information that you find important in
your<00:02:10.679> workout<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.940> let's<00:02:12.180> say<00:02:12.300> for<00:02:12.510> instance

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
your workout so let's say for instance

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.250 
your workout so let's say for instance
for<00:02:13.020> this<00:02:13.230> particular<00:02:14.120> screen<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.420> have<00:02:15.870> the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
for this particular screen I have the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.800 
for this particular screen I have the
time<00:02:16.530> or<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.310> duration<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.420> actual

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
time or the duration of the actual

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.380 
time or the duration of the actual
workout<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.470> have<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.819> average

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
workout I have the average

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.050 
workout I have the average
speed<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.590> distance<00:02:23.069> travel<00:02:23.520> as<00:02:23.670> well<00:02:23.730> as

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
speed and the distance travel as well as

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.610 
speed and the distance travel as well as
the<00:02:24.180> calories<00:02:24.600> so<00:02:24.900> this<00:02:25.140> setting<00:02:25.530> in

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
the calories so this setting in

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.470 
the calories so this setting in
particular<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.370> when<00:02:26.580> i'm<00:02:26.730> typically<00:02:27.120> riding

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
particular is when i'm typically riding

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.260 
particular is when i'm typically riding
my<00:02:27.569> bicycle<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:29.040> gives<00:02:29.220> me<00:02:29.430> an<00:02:29.550> idea<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:30.060> how

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
my bicycle so it gives me an idea of how

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.480 
my bicycle so it gives me an idea of how
long<00:02:30.480> I've<00:02:30.630> been<00:02:30.660> doing<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.470> actual<00:02:31.800> activity

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
long I've been doing the actual activity

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.480 
long I've been doing the actual activity
how<00:02:32.940> fast<00:02:33.270> I'm<00:02:33.540> going<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:34.560> distance<00:02:34.770> travel

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
how fast I'm going the distance travel

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.640 
how fast I'm going the distance travel
and<00:02:35.640> how<00:02:35.819> many<00:02:36.030> calories<00:02:36.240> but<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.200> thought<00:02:37.440> that

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
and how many calories but I thought that

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.150 
and how many calories but I thought that
was<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:37.950> but<00:02:38.060> if<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.840> can<00:02:39.990> set<00:02:40.290> up<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.770> four

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
was it but if you you can set up to four

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.960 
was it but if you you can set up to four

the watch I hadn't done the swimming

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.180 
the watch I hadn't done the swimming
aspect<00:04:18.060> of<00:04:18.239> it<00:04:18.390> yet<00:04:18.570> so<00:04:18.930> I<00:04:19.260> guess<00:04:19.829> I<00:04:20.039> don't

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
aspect of it yet so I guess I don't

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.370 
aspect of it yet so I guess I don't
really<00:04:20.400> do<00:04:20.579> water<00:04:20.850> but<00:04:21.120> if<00:04:21.539> I<00:04:21.750> ever<00:04:21.870> swim<00:04:22.229> or

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
really do water but if I ever swim or

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.710 
really do water but if I ever swim or

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
something of that nature i probably will

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.110 
something of that nature i probably will
do<00:04:25.470> another<00:04:25.710> video<00:04:25.950> to<00:04:26.220> let<00:04:26.520> you<00:04:26.580> guys<00:04:26.789> know

watch<00:05:28.350> I<00:05:28.680> think<00:05:29.370> it<00:05:29.520> will<00:05:29.640> help<00:05:29.820> you<00:05:30.060> push<00:05:30.360> your

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
watch I think it will help you push your

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.800 
watch I think it will help you push your
goals<00:05:31.620> to<00:05:31.980> new<00:05:32.130> levels<00:05:32.370> because<00:05:33.330> you'll<00:05:33.570> have

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
goals to new levels because you'll have

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.050 
goals to new levels because you'll have
more<00:05:34.080> feedback<00:05:34.410> and<00:05:34.890> with<00:05:35.220> fitness<00:05:35.610> sometimes

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060

that's what you're lacking feedback and
you<00:05:38.970> don't<00:05:39.150> need<00:05:39.270> a<00:05:39.330> coach<00:05:39.600> for<00:05:39.810> this<00:05:39.990> you<00:05:40.320> know
