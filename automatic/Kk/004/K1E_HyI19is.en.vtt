now<00:01:57.970> believe<00:01:58.450> in<00:01:58.870> the<00:01:59.520> supervision<00:02:00.520> version

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
now believe in the supervision version

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.990 
now believe in the supervision version
there<00:02:02.890> is<00:02:03.130> no<00:02:03.900> energy<00:02:04.900> counter<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:06.490> we<00:02:06.790> can

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
there is no energy counter so we can

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.370 
there is no energy counter so we can
just<00:02:07.210> shoot<00:02:07.450> or<00:02:07.690> faster<00:02:08.320> as<00:02:08.560> much<00:02:09.009> as<00:02:09.220> you<00:02:09.369> want
