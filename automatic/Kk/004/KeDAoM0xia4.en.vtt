guys a walkthrough hi everybody thanks
for<00:00:35.399> watching<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.750> main<00:00:37.050> spawn<00:00:37.559> room

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
for watching this is the main spawn room

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.790 
for watching this is the main spawn room
for<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.340> humans<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.899> red<00:00:40.110> marker<00:00:40.590> or

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
for the humans this is the red marker or

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.910 
for the humans this is the red marker or
the<00:00:40.980> ominous<00:00:41.960> monument<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.170> has<00:00:43.350> created

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the ominous monument that has created

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.940 
the ominous monument that has created
this<00:00:44.090> disastrous<00:00:45.090> outbreak<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
this disastrous outbreak and so the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.619 
this disastrous outbreak and so the
humans<00:00:47.280> basically<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.820> two<00:00:48.000> choices<00:00:48.300> when

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
humans basically have two choices when

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.819 
humans basically have two choices when
they<00:00:48.690> spawn<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:48.989> here<00:00:49.289> they<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.559> either<00:00:49.649> go

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
they spawn in here they can either go

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.310 
they spawn in here they can either go
left<00:00:50.100> or<00:00:50.460> they<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.730> go<00:00:50.850> right<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.719> we're<00:00:52.260> gonna

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
left or they can go right so we're gonna

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.920 
left or they can go right so we're gonna
start<00:00:52.649> going<00:00:52.770> right<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.449> right<00:00:54.449> here<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.870> is

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
start going right and right here this is

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.510 
start going right and right here this is
going<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.199> take<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.829> first<00:00:56.160> half<00:00:56.340> of

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
going to take you to the first half of

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.700 
going to take you to the first half of
the<00:00:56.610> map<00:00:56.760> which<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.300> kind<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.140> reminiscent<00:00:58.440> of

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the map which is kind of reminiscent of

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.340 
the map which is kind of reminiscent of
the<00:00:58.859> original<00:00:58.890> map<00:00:59.370> this<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.390> staircase

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the original map this is the staircase

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.380 
the original map this is the staircase
which<00:01:01.649> again<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.160> another<00:01:02.190> hold<00:01:02.820> up<00:01:03.000> position

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
which again is another hold up position

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.240 
which again is another hold up position
except<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.439> first<00:01:04.650> map<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.010> wasn't

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
except in the first map it wasn't

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.940 
except in the first map it wasn't
exactly<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:06.049> we<00:01:07.049> didn't<00:01:07.320> exactly<00:01:07.530> really<00:01:07.860> have

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
exactly a we didn't exactly really have

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.859 
exactly a we didn't exactly really have
a<00:01:08.010> point<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.640> was<00:01:08.820> only<00:01:08.880> there<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.210> be<00:01:09.720> had<00:01:09.840> a

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
a point it was only there to be had a

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.960 
a point it was only there to be had a
hold<00:01:10.260> up<00:01:10.380> position<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:10.920> now<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.580> actually

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
hold up position so now you can actually

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.000 
hold up position so now you can actually
go<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.150> different<00:01:12.450> levels<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.140> map<00:01:13.320> but

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
go to different levels of the map but

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.950 
go to different levels of the map but
there's<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.640> bolt<00:01:14.790> shot<00:01:14.970> spawn<00:01:15.299> up<00:01:15.509> there<00:01:15.720> and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
there's the bolt shot spawn up there and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.010 
there's the bolt shot spawn up there and
just<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.009> cool<00:01:17.549> little<00:01:17.700> place<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.150> hold<00:01:18.330> out<00:01:18.509> so

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
just a cool little place to hold out so

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.960 
just a cool little place to hold out so
we'll<00:01:19.140> go<00:01:19.259> down<00:01:19.290> one<00:01:19.680> more<00:01:19.830> floor<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.400> now

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
we'll go down one more floor and now

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.859 
we'll go down one more floor and now
here<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.920> medical<00:01:22.920> bay<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.600> we'll<00:01:24.600> get<00:01:24.720> to

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
here is the medical bay and we'll get to

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.899 
here is the medical bay and we'll get to
that<00:01:24.900> glowing<00:01:25.470> green<00:01:25.710> room<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.250> minute<00:01:26.340> but

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
that glowing green room in a minute but

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.090 
that glowing green room in a minute but
if<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.270> all<00:01:27.360> remember<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:28.100> recharge

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
if you all remember the recharge

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.859 
if you all remember the recharge
stations<00:01:29.189> they<00:01:29.670> work<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.420> same<00:01:30.450> as<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
stations they work just the same as the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.149 
stations they work just the same as the
other<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.170> though<00:01:31.560> they<00:01:31.740> may<00:01:31.829> look<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.130> little

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
other one though they may look a little

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.800 
other one though they may look a little
bit<00:01:32.340> better<00:01:32.520> now<00:01:32.729> I've<00:01:32.909> put<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> little<00:01:33.509> more

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
bit better now I've put a little more

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.679 
bit better now I've put a little more
aesthetic<00:01:34.259> design<00:01:34.619> into<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.759> coming

your<00:01:41.070> shields<00:01:41.400> if<00:01:41.490> you're<00:01:41.579> gonna<00:01:41.670> decay<00:01:42.000> this

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
your shields if you're gonna decay this

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.179 
your shields if you're gonna decay this
is<00:01:42.720> again<00:01:43.079> reminiscent<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> original<00:01:44.070> map

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
is again reminiscent of the original map

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.639 
is again reminiscent of the original map
it<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.820> basically<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.750> contamination<00:01:46.409> zone

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
it is basically the contamination zone

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.550 
it is basically the contamination zone
this<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.430> where<00:01:47.960> part<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.110> outbreak<00:01:49.530> was

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
this is where part of the outbreak was

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.590 
this is where part of the outbreak was
studied<00:01:50.100> people<00:01:50.640> were<00:01:50.729> dissected<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.420> this

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
studied people were dissected on this

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.310 
studied people were dissected on this
table<00:01:51.990> here<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:53.570> it<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:54.840> basically<00:01:55.049> a

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
table here and it just basically a

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.170 
table here and it just basically a
contagions<00:01:55.950> got<00:01:56.159> loose<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:56.880> when<00:01:57.090> you

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
contagions got loose and so when you

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.639 
contagions got loose and so when you
come<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.479> here<00:01:57.780> your<00:01:58.229> shields<00:01:58.469> are<00:01:58.560> gonna

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
come in here your shields are gonna

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.709 
come in here your shields are gonna
decay<00:01:59.009> much<00:01:59.280> like<00:01:59.490> they<00:01:59.640> decayed<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.329> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
decay much like they decayed in the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.719 
decay much like they decayed in the
other<00:02:01.320> map<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.979> we'll<00:02:02.100> cut<00:02:02.219> through<00:02:02.369> here<00:02:02.579> and

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
other map so we'll cut through here and

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.090 
other map so we'll cut through here and
we'll<00:02:02.820> go<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.119> other<00:02:03.210> hallway<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.100> this

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
we'll go to the other hallway and this

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.789 
we'll go to the other hallway and this
is<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.369> airlock<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.659> originally<00:02:07.439> had<00:02:07.590> one

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
is the airlock and I originally had one

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.169 
is the airlock and I originally had one
on<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.920> other<00:02:08.069> door<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:08.789> didn't

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
on the other door but it just didn't

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.999 
on the other door but it just didn't
work<00:02:09.330> for<00:02:09.390> gameplays<00:02:09.929> sake<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.739> we<00:02:10.800> can<00:02:10.920> look

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
work for gameplays sake and we can look

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.290 
work for gameplays sake and we can look
through<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.310> window<00:02:11.520> here<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.120> long

through this window here in the long

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.150 
through this window here in the long
hall<00:02:12.629> and<00:02:12.959> we'll<00:02:13.230> see<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.560> warehouse

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
hall and we'll see the warehouse

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.610

it's a pretty good hold out position you

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.210 
it's a pretty good hold out position you
can<00:02:30.570> look<00:02:30.750> down<00:02:31.080> here<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.620> can<00:02:31.800> see<00:02:32.010> the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
see them coming through the other way

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.850 
see them coming through the other way
through<00:02:36.360> this<00:02:36.480> broken<00:02:36.930> wall<00:02:37.140> which<00:02:37.590> we'll<00:02:37.770> get

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
through this broken wall which we'll get

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.460 
through this broken wall which we'll get
to<00:02:37.920> this<00:02:38.640> links<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.600> elevator<00:02:40.260> shaft

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
to this links you to the elevator shaft

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.800 
to this links you to the elevator shaft
which<00:02:41.400> in<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.820> fiction<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.270> map<00:02:42.450> this<00:02:42.660> is

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
which in the fiction of the map this is

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.930 
which in the fiction of the map this is
where<00:02:42.990> they<00:02:43.410> came<00:02:43.980> down<00:02:44.250> from<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.490> first<00:02:44.700> map

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
where they came down from the first map

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.470 
where they came down from the first map
because<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:46.080> first<00:02:46.290> map<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:47.330> mining<00:02:48.330> colony

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
because the first map is a mining colony

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.900 
because the first map is a mining colony
and<00:02:48.810> this<00:02:48.930> one's<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.200> actual<00:02:49.890> mine<00:02:50.100> so<00:02:50.760> down

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
and this one's the actual mine so down

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.490 
and this one's the actual mine so down
here<00:02:51.180> we<00:02:51.240> also<00:02:51.510> have<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.810> other<00:02:52.140> research

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
here we also have the other research

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.110 
here we also have the other research
station<00:02:52.920> which<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.220> just<00:02:53.400> saw<00:02:53.550> you<00:02:53.610> using<00:02:53.970> and

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
station which I just saw you using and

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.120 
station which I just saw you using and
after<00:02:54.990> about<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.290> minute<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.710> half<00:02:55.860> the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
after about a minute and a half the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.530 
after about a minute and a half the
zombies<00:02:56.400> will<00:02:56.520> be<00:02:56.610> able<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.850> actually<00:02:57.000> spawn

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
zombies will be able to actually spawn

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.900 
zombies will be able to actually spawn
in<00:02:57.960> on<00:02:58.710> the<00:02:58.830> top<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.280> elevator<00:02:59.460> shaft<00:02:59.790> and

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
in on the top of the elevator shaft and

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.780 
in on the top of the elevator shaft and
drop<00:03:00.150> down<00:03:00.390> on<00:03:00.720> people<00:03:01.350> camping<00:03:01.770> in<00:03:01.890> here<00:03:02.130> but

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
drop down on people camping in here but

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.150 
drop down on people camping in here but
we'll<00:03:03.570> get<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.870> that<00:03:04.050> little<00:03:04.440> aspect<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.070> the

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
we'll get to that little aspect of the

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.080 
we'll get to that little aspect of the
map<00:03:05.310> later<00:03:05.570> through<00:03:06.570> here<00:03:06.900> we'll<00:03:07.290> get<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.680> the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
map later through here we'll get to the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.670 
map later through here we'll get to the
warehouse<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.960> warehouse<00:03:10.260> is<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.470> pretty

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
warehouse and the warehouse is a pretty

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.070 
warehouse and the warehouse is a pretty
good<00:03:10.890> holdout<00:03:11.580> room<00:03:11.820> be<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.690> little<00:03:12.900> bit

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
good holdout room be it a little bit

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.620 
good holdout room be it a little bit
close<00:03:13.650> quarters<00:03:14.130> you'll<00:03:14.940> see<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.270> up<00:03:15.390> there

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
close quarters you'll see that up there

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.180 
close quarters you'll see that up there
there's<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.900> little<00:03:16.020> vent<00:03:16.350> access<00:03:16.890> which<00:03:17.160> is

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
there's a little vent access which is

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.610 
there's a little vent access which is
actually<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.209> new<00:03:18.450> way<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:19.050> zombies<00:03:19.440> can

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
actually the new way that zombies can

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.650 
actually the new way that zombies can
get<00:03:19.740> into<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.070> map<00:03:20.250> they<00:03:20.970> don't<00:03:21.270> get<00:03:21.480> in

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
get into the map they don't get in

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.690 
get into the map they don't get in
through<00:03:22.110> spawning<00:03:22.620> in<00:03:22.830> space<00:03:23.100> anymore<00:03:23.340> now

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
through spawning in space anymore now

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.699 
through spawning in space anymore now
they<00:03:23.910> have<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.120> closed<00:03:24.870> off<00:03:25.080> spawn<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.650> they

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
they have a closed off spawn and they

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.140 
they have a closed off spawn and they
can<00:03:25.860> decide<00:03:25.980> where<00:03:26.490> they<00:03:26.670> want<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:26.880> attack

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
can decide where they want to attack

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.690 
can decide where they want to attack
from<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:28.080> right<00:03:28.230> here<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.770> usual<00:03:29.340> hold<00:03:29.550> up

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
from so right here is the usual hold up

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.310 
from so right here is the usual hold up
position<00:03:30.030> everybody<00:03:30.390> sits<00:03:30.690> here<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.200> they

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
position everybody sits here and they

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.199 
position everybody sits here and they
can<00:03:31.500> watch<00:03:32.160> coming<00:03:32.520> from<00:03:32.700> different<00:03:32.880> corners

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
can watch coming from different corners

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.240 
can watch coming from different corners
except<00:03:33.840> you're<00:03:34.410> usually<00:03:34.560> going<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:34.950> die<00:03:35.070> if

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
except you're usually going to die if

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.220 
except you're usually going to die if
you<00:03:35.310> stay<00:03:35.370> in<00:03:35.670> here<00:03:35.880> but<00:03:36.150> it's<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.450> good<00:03:36.630> last

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
you stay in here but it's a good last

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.850 
you stay in here but it's a good last
stand<00:03:37.800> position<00:03:38.190> so<00:03:39.230> we<00:03:40.230> come<00:03:40.500> back<00:03:40.650> through

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
stand position so we come back through

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.310 
stand position so we come back through
this<00:03:41.010> door<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.280> we're<00:03:41.550> over<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.300> or<00:03:42.989> back

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
this door and we're over to the or back

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.740 
this door and we're over to the or back
to<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.560> red<00:03:43.680> marker<00:03:44.010> room<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.400> actually<00:03:45.300> if<00:03:45.630> I

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
to the red marker room and actually if I

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.440 
to the red marker room and actually if I
could<00:03:45.930> kill<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.170> I<00:03:46.620> can<00:03:46.800> show<00:03:46.830> you<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.700> new

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
could kill you I can show you the new

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.660 
could kill you I can show you the new
spawn<00:03:48.900> mechanism<00:03:49.380> so<00:03:49.860> almost<00:03:50.340> give<00:03:50.520> you<00:03:50.610> a

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
spawn mechanism so almost give you a

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.449 
spawn mechanism so almost give you a
kill<00:03:50.880> their<00:03:51.120> hits<00:03:51.959> works<00:03:52.230> similarly<00:03:52.739> except

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
kill their hits works similarly except

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.180 
kill their hits works similarly except
since<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.510> title<00:03:54.720> update<00:03:55.140> I've<00:03:55.650> had<00:03:55.980> to

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
since the title update I've had to

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.030 
since the title update I've had to
revise<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.239> game<00:03:57.420> types<00:03:57.660> so<00:03:58.080> all<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.770> revised

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
revise the game types so all the revised

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.010 
revise the game types so all the revised
game<00:03:59.370> types<00:03:59.640> they<00:03:59.820> should<00:04:00.000> say<00:04:00.150> version<00:04:00.570> 1.1

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
game types they should say version 1.1

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.680 
game types they should say version 1.1
they're<00:04:01.830> all<00:04:02.130> on<00:04:02.400> my<00:04:02.520> file<00:04:02.730> share<00:04:03.030> as<00:04:03.270> is<00:04:03.660> a

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
they're all on my file share as is a

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.290 
they're all on my file share as is a
revised<00:04:04.200> version<00:04:04.709> of<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:05.070> original<00:04:05.190> map<00:04:05.700> so

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
revised version of the original map so

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.000 
revised version of the original map so
you<00:04:06.360> could<00:04:06.840> give<00:04:06.989> that<00:04:07.020> a<00:04:07.200> download<00:04:07.709> and

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
you could give that a download and

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.490 
you could give that a download and
you'll<00:04:08.489> be<00:04:08.610> up<00:04:08.880> to<00:04:09.090> date<00:04:09.239> with<00:04:09.450> everything<00:04:09.630> so

in the new starting room and you have a
choice<00:04:15.330> to<00:04:15.390> either<00:04:15.600> go<00:04:15.989> forward<00:04:16.590> which<00:04:16.770> will

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
can go over to the rocks and you'll drop

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.360 
can go over to the rocks and you'll drop

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
down into the into the main starting

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.060 
down into the into the main starting
room<00:04:23.550> so<00:04:24.360> you'll<00:04:25.260> also<00:04:25.410> see<00:04:25.710> that<00:04:25.860> there's<00:04:26.010> a

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
room so you'll also see that there's a

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.500 
room so you'll also see that there's a
teleporter<00:04:26.640> down<00:04:26.789> there

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
teleporter down there

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.570 
teleporter down there
and<00:04:27.600> that<00:04:28.110> teleporter<00:04:28.620> only<00:04:28.830> becomes<00:04:29.100> active

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
and that teleporter only becomes active

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.510 
and that teleporter only becomes active
after<00:04:30.710> after<00:04:31.710> a<00:04:31.740> minute<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:32.130> a<00:04:32.190> half<00:04:32.340> of

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
after after a minute and a half of

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.510 
after after a minute and a half of
gameplay<00:04:32.910> but<00:04:33.350> yeah<00:04:34.350> that's<00:04:34.860> pretty<00:04:35.040> much<00:04:35.310> the

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
gameplay but yeah that's pretty much the

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.910 
gameplay but yeah that's pretty much the
gist<00:04:35.640> of<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:35.910> map<00:04:36.170> gameplays<00:04:37.170> pretty<00:04:37.500> similar

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
gist of the map gameplays pretty similar

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.790 
gist of the map gameplays pretty similar
to<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:38.220> original<00:04:38.420> except<00:04:39.420> it<00:04:39.660> does<00:04:39.870> have<00:04:40.140> a

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
to the original except it does have a

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.150 
to the original except it does have a
different<00:04:41.160> feel<00:04:41.510> familiar<00:04:42.510> but<00:04:42.930> different

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
different feel familiar but different

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.960 
different feel familiar but different
alright<00:04:44.160> so<00:04:44.310> now<00:04:44.430> we're<00:04:44.550> gonna<00:04:44.640> take<00:04:44.790> a<00:04:44.850> look

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
alright so now we're gonna take a look

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.370 
alright so now we're gonna take a look
at<00:04:45.090> some<00:04:45.210> of<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.360> gameplay<00:04:45.750> from<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:46.020> map<00:04:46.170> now

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
at some of the gameplay from the map now

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.500 
at some of the gameplay from the map now
I<00:04:46.410> absolutely<00:04:47.160> love<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.760> way<00:04:47.790> this<00:04:48.030> map<00:04:48.210> plays

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
I absolutely love the way this map plays

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.050 
I absolutely love the way this map plays
and<00:04:48.780> I<00:04:49.290> got<00:04:49.650> some<00:04:49.950> great<00:04:50.280> gameplay<00:04:50.580> for<00:04:50.970> you

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
and I got some great gameplay for you

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.970 
and I got some great gameplay for you
guys<00:04:51.240> I<00:04:51.270> think<00:04:51.540> this<00:04:51.840> is<00:04:51.960> probably<00:04:52.200> one<00:04:52.860> of<00:04:52.890> the

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
guys I think this is probably one of the

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.150 
guys I think this is probably one of the
most<00:04:53.190> terrifying<00:04:54.380> terrifying<00:04:55.380> experiences

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
most terrifying terrifying experiences

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
start to go or I started to get really

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.480 
start to go or I started to get really
insane<00:05:28.350> so<00:05:28.560> we<00:05:28.680> wanted<00:05:28.890> to<00:05:28.950> hang<00:05:29.190> out<00:05:29.310> around

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
here these we felt that this was a

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.260 
here these we felt that this was a
pretty<00:05:31.350> good<00:05:31.500> hold<00:05:31.740> out<00:05:31.860> area<00:05:32.130> but<00:05:32.730> things

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
pretty good hold out area but things

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.450 
pretty good hold out area but things
kind<00:05:33.810> of<00:05:33.990> went<00:05:34.200> downhill<00:05:34.380> because<00:05:34.680> they're

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
kind of went downhill because they're

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.640 
kind of went downhill because they're
zombies<00:05:35.580> started<00:05:35.940> to<00:05:36.000> pile<00:05:36.180> up<00:05:36.390> in<00:05:36.510> the
