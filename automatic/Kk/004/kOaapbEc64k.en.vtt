00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.400
Hi! My name is Saya!

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.460
And on this channel, I'll tell you all about life in the most controversial and the most unusual country - Japan.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.460
But before we begin, let's look a little movie about the Japanese imagine Russia.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.920
Beautiful people. Strong habits. And cold.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.780
Steep country. Lovely girl and tasty drink. I really want to go to Russia.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:46.040
Oooh ... very beautiful girls. Oooh ... all good style.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.240
I have many Russian friends. Quite a bit of.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.580
Probably about five. More ... they have quite a difficult language.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.880
Not even a quite a difficult and very difficult.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:15.520
Cold. A huge country. Good physique. Cool. Bright skin.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:29.980
Excuse me, but I still think that there is in the USSR. I remember another song "Katyusha".

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.260
Flat nose. Bright skin. Beautiful people. High. All.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.240
Russia ... I have an idea that there is very cold.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.540
Beautiful.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:52.480
Oooh ... straight nose at all. Very beautiful. Very bright.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:00.389
Yet it seems because of the cold, they go like this all wrapped up.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.220
Everything seems to be very resistant to alcohol. And drink cold vodka.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.160
So, suppose you have made an important step in my life and decided to come to Japan.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.560
Someone has to be found here and a little Japanese to marry him.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.180
Someone has to go to university and get a Japanese education.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.650
And someone just loves festivals eyed cartoons and flowering trees.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.800
As if there was not, the first question that many are asking themselves: "Where exactly can you go?"

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.680
Despite its small size, Japan can be very diverse.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.280
The first thing that comes to mind many - Tokyo.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.180
But I must warn you that Tokyo - a city not for the faint of heart.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:51.460
If you present it as a huge beehive, which is absolutely not similar to each other people

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.340
run without stopping for 24 hours a day, you represent everything right.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.060
The pace of this city are incredible. Here you can find everything.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.980
To fulfill your every desire! Even the most bizarre ...

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:15.100
With one big "but." If you are afraid of large crowds or high prices and thus a very small space, Tokyo is definitely not for you.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.620
If you're a misanthrope with mild claustrophobia,

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.600
I suggest you find another city to live, and Tokyo to leave "tough nut to crack."

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.060
However, if you want to live close to the capital, but the fear of its enormous speed and high prices,

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.800
I advise you to visit cities such as Yokogama, Chiba and Saitama.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.180
In the first, by the way, it is the largest port in Japan.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.080
nd Chiba is famous for the fact that it is there is such a welcome to all Disneyland.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.040
Kyoto. Kyoto - it is a choice for aesthetes with a subtle soul.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.100
If you like big party night, this city is likely to will seem boring.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.790
But for fans of the samurai, geisha with a bleached face

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.260
and authentic Japanese architecture, culture and ancient language, this city exactly fit.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.760
In addition, living in Kyoto, you are a few hours away from the big cities in Japan such as Nara and Osaka.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.400
Osaka is suitable for those who want to build your business or glorified.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.900
Many Japanese pop stars and film are from Osaka.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.039
It is also a fairly well-known fact that people at the Osaka much more kind and friendly than in Tokyo.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.320
In addition, there is higher and crime. Almost home.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.600
Nara. 
Nara - is one of the oldest cities in Japan.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:39.200
owever, he is known for rather than that, but that is only there in the park, you can touch the deer that there really is more than people.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:47.520
Ginowan, Ishigaki, Nago and a lot of bad to utter the names of towns, is in just one word of Okinawa.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.060
Okinawa - an island that is located in the south of Japan, and is a local Hawaii.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.159
The resort climate is very cheap food, pleasant surroundings make it practically paradise.

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:05.199
With one big "but." A ticket to Okinawa is much more expensive than a ticket for the same Hawaii.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.760
Sapporo. It's more of a choice for those who are far away from Russia and does not want to be, but is not going to live there.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.139
The climate is most similar to the climate in Russia.

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.659
Take for example several meters of snow that falls there annually.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.140
True enterprising Japanese make of them huge

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.950
snow sculptures, which annually attracts several million tourists.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.000
Also, the food at Hokkaido is even the recognition of Japanese, perhaps the most delicious.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.140
Therefore, if you like snow and like to eat, then this city is clearly for you.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.640
Plus a small tip for the guys. The most beautiful girl in Japan, living in the prefecture of Akita.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.780
That was my brief overview of the cities that are worth visiting or in which, perhaps, you can stay and live.

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:59.169
