how<00:02:06.910> those<00:02:08.070> yes<00:02:09.070> this<00:02:09.340> is<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.550> bundles<00:02:10.180> this

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
how those yes this is the bundles this

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.570 
how those yes this is the bundles this
is<00:02:10.570> the<00:02:10.750> fullness<00:02:11.380> of<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.860> bundles<00:02:12.280> which<00:02:12.430> are

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
is the fullness of the bundles which are

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.700 
is the fullness of the bundles which are
pretty<00:02:12.760> cool<00:02:13.120> again<00:02:13.960> these<00:02:14.110> are<00:02:14.170> shorter

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
pretty cool again these are shorter

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.470 
pretty cool again these are shorter
length<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.280> know<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.730> West<00:02:15.970> are<00:02:16.150> going<00:02:16.390> to

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
length so you know the West are going to

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.270 
length so you know the West are going to
be<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:17.170> bomas<00:02:17.530> are<00:02:17.680> going<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:17.920> be<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.010> lot

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
be the bomas are going to be a lot

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.340 
be the bomas are going to be a lot
cooler<00:02:18.550> than<00:02:19.000> your<00:02:19.690> longer<00:02:20.110> list<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:22.350> yes

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350
