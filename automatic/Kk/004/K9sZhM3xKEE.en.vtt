00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hi to all friends of computer friends 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.890
 today I show you a smartphone 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.590
 samsung s dance to those who recommend it 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.990
 recommend to those who do not want to spend 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.929
 too much to buy a s ii or an s3 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.990
 so to lovers of the s series this 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.330
 let 's say the middle way between sls 2 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.180
 its feature we immediately see is 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.189
 I don't know if I have a slightly curved screen 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.050
 it looks good 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.929
 from the preview however it tends to make one 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.550
 slight curvature so a design too 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.329
 very particular this is the version 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.809
 white you see and we begin immediately then 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.800
 the height of 100 20 32 mm width of 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.309
 63 mm the thickness of 9.7 mm with 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.829
 weight of 120 g the android 2.3 version 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:56.610
 basic we go immediately to see in the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:58.129
 info in this month January 15th 2013 will be 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.699
 You can update the Android version 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:05.100
 of being dance hall 4 then the last ones 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.680
 android versions here is the code 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.680
 model all 90 70 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.710
 we continue immediately with the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.200
 features the processor is a thousand 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.170
 megas then gigahertz dual core arm 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.540
 cortex a9 so really good 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.200
 power for a smartphone 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.479
 the internal memory is 8 gb so not 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.409
 there should be problems 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.840
 especially because obviously like everyone 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.619
 android mobiles is supported by 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.070
 micro sd up to 32 gigabytes then for 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.960
 who wants more space can buy the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.259
 memory card and put what 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.909
 want the battery is from 1500 mh 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:52.860
 obviously lithium is present the gprs and the 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:55.020
 hsdp function to the one that goes to 14.4 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.119
 megabit per second very important if 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.120
 you want to make the most of 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.580
 mobile internet speed is present 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:08.780
 the gps obviously the bluetooth gps 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:11.550
 version 3.0 with a2dp and wifi ab gn 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.790
 micro usb we told you the look of 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.940
 4-inch super amoled display with 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.720
 a resolution of 480 pixels x 800 pixels 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.250
 16 million touchscreen colors 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.930
 capacitive and multitouch 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.820
 there is no second display antenna 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.850
 obviously integrated we pass immediately 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.140
 to the camera then we see a bit of 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.280
 playing around to see the 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.020
 fluidity 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.590
 the camera is present both in front and 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.680
 behind it is 5 megapixels while that 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.830
 secondary from 1.3 there is no zoom ie 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.780
 the autofocus the flash thing not present 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.840
 on so many phones there is the 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.810
 flash that we can see here the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.160
 maximum resolution of the photos then a 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:03:02.190
 2592 x 1944 pixels while that for i 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:05.340
 hd video 1280 720 30 fps so they come 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.870
 even some nice videos then the camera 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.800
 secondary could be useful for 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.450
 some live for video calls and so on 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.640
 let's see immediately how it looks I don't have 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.100
 tests found problems of fluidity 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.170
 also because a thousand meyers dual core are 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.000
 great for a cell phone you know very well 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.959
 that we find in tablets 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.970
 these processors therefore no problem 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.130
 even that internet speed 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:36.140
 let's see how this looks like 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:36.140
 camera or preview 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.200
 and here is a very good cell phone 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.600
 medium-high end we say higher 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.870
 that on average the price is around 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.500
 to 320 euros but in my opinion it is possible 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.120
 find it even around 315 careful 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.010
 before buying, look for the offer 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.040
 more convenient we'll see you at 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.040
 next
