00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
the big challenges we face it's

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.930 
the big challenges we face it's
fantastic<00:00:48.129> to<00:00:48.160> be<00:00:48.430> here

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.830 

I<00:00:54.309> think<00:00:55.309> everyone<00:00:55.699> learnt<00:00:55.969> a<00:00:56.149> lot<00:00:56.300> was<00:00:56.809> a

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
I think everyone learnt a lot was a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.040 
I think everyone learnt a lot was a
really<00:00:57.260> nice<00:00:57.410> diversity<00:00:58.250> of<00:00:58.280> talks<00:00:58.699> and

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
really nice diversity of talks and

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.079 
really nice diversity of talks and
dealing<00:01:00.050> with<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.260> economics<00:01:00.859> as<00:01:01.640> well<00:01:01.910> as

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
dealing with the economics as well as

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.980 
dealing with the economics as well as
the<00:01:02.390> breeding<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:04.030> nutrition<00:01:05.030> of<00:01:05.119> props<00:01:05.449> we'd

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
the breeding the nutrition of props we'd

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.670 
the breeding the nutrition of props we'd
aspect<00:01:06.650> so<00:01:06.920> overall<00:01:07.700> I'd<00:01:07.850> say<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.720> bleeding

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
aspect so overall I'd say the bleeding

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.460 
aspect so overall I'd say the bleeding
is<00:01:09.770> getting<00:01:10.330> covering<00:01:11.330> a<00:01:11.390> pretty<00:01:11.690> broad<00:01:12.110> and

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
is getting covering a pretty broad and

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.249 
is getting covering a pretty broad and
relevant<00:01:13.159> scope<00:01:13.490> for<00:01:13.729> cereals<00:01:16.899> we<00:01:17.899> already

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
relevant scope for cereals we already

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.320 
relevant scope for cereals we already
have<00:01:18.500> a<00:01:18.890> very<00:01:19.310> important<00:01:19.789> business<00:01:19.909> in<00:01:20.240> the

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
have a very important business in the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.139 
have a very important business in the
crop<00:01:20.509> protection<00:01:20.690> business<00:01:21.320> and<00:01:21.500> serious<00:01:22.149> but

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
crop protection business and serious but

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.999 
crop protection business and serious but
if<00:01:23.240> we<00:01:23.360> look<00:01:23.570> at<00:01:23.659> the<00:01:23.810> future<00:01:24.110> challenges<00:01:24.590> in

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
if we look at the future challenges in

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.320 
if we look at the future challenges in
cereals<00:01:25.520> to<00:01:26.500> enable<00:01:27.500> growers<00:01:27.950> to<00:01:28.190> supply<00:01:28.640> the

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
cereals to enable growers to supply the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.809 
cereals to enable growers to supply the
growing<00:01:29.899> demand<00:01:30.350> from<00:01:30.740> population<00:01:31.580> growth

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
growing demand from population growth

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:33.940 
growing demand from population growth
over<00:01:32.149> time<00:01:32.179> then<00:01:33.170> we<00:01:33.500> need<00:01:33.619> to<00:01:33.679> make<00:01:33.920> a

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
over time then we need to make a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.460 
over time then we need to make a
significant<00:01:34.670> change<00:01:34.729> to<00:01:35.330> the<00:01:35.960> yield<00:01:36.229> levels

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
significant change to the yield levels

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.410 
significant change to the yield levels
in<00:01:36.800> wheat<00:01:37.069> in<00:01:37.310> particular<00:01:37.610> that<00:01:38.000> we<00:01:38.179> can

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
in wheat in particular that we can

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.440 
in wheat in particular that we can
deliver<00:01:39.729> certainly<00:01:40.729> I<00:01:40.759> think<00:01:40.819> we<00:01:41.090> need<00:01:41.270> more

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
deliver certainly I think we need more

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.249 
deliver certainly I think we need more
investment<00:01:41.720> than<00:01:42.289> again<00:01:42.800> I'm<00:01:42.979> pleased<00:01:43.250> to<00:01:43.460> see

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
investment than again I'm pleased to see

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.109 
investment than again I'm pleased to see
companies<00:01:45.259> like<00:01:45.440> Bayer<00:01:45.649> CropScience<00:01:45.970> step<00:01:46.970> to

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
companies like Bayer CropScience step to

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.310 
companies like Bayer CropScience step to
the<00:01:47.240> table<00:01:47.479> in<00:01:47.780> Canada<00:01:48.289> and<00:01:48.909> look<00:01:49.909> to<00:01:50.090> invest

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
the table in Canada and look to invest

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.170 
the table in Canada and look to invest
so<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.620> key<00:01:53.800> message<00:01:54.190> from<00:01:54.370> my<00:01:54.520> presentation

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
so the key message from my presentation

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.010 
so the key message from my presentation
was<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:56.260> carefully<00:01:56.800> look<00:01:56.830> at<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.430> competition

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
was to carefully look at the competition

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.530 
was to carefully look at the competition
between<00:01:59.020> wheat<00:01:59.440> and<00:01:59.620> other<00:01:59.740> crops<00:02:00.190> because<00:02:01.030> I

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
between wheat and other crops because I

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.510 
between wheat and other crops because I
found<00:02:02.080> for<00:02:02.440> instance<00:02:02.710> in<00:02:02.860> regions<00:02:03.490> like

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
found for instance in regions like

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.810 
found for instance in regions like
Russia<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.300> Ukraine<00:02:05.010> it's<00:02:06.010> very<00:02:06.250> likely<00:02:06.610> that

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
Russia and Ukraine it's very likely that

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.490 
Russia and Ukraine it's very likely that
the<00:02:07.180> long<00:02:07.450> run<00:02:07.630> we<00:02:07.810> will<00:02:07.960> see<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.200> transition

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
the long run we will see a transition

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.210 
the long run we will see a transition
from<00:02:09.009> wheat<00:02:09.820> producing<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:11.050> corn<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:11.800> soybean

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
from wheat producing to corn and soybean

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.220 
from wheat producing to corn and soybean
is<00:02:12.459> a<00:02:12.490> very<00:02:13.030> attractive<00:02:13.270> option<00:02:13.870> for<00:02:14.050> many

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
is a very attractive option for many

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.560 
is a very attractive option for many
growers<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:16.440> find<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.800> information<00:02:18.459> here<00:02:19.240> very

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
growers I find the information here very

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.320 
growers I find the information here very
informative<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.770> I<00:02:21.550> think<00:02:21.820> part<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.240> the

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
informative and I think part of the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.449 
informative and I think part of the
value<00:02:22.810> or<00:02:22.959> main<00:02:23.170> part<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.650> value<00:02:24.070> is<00:02:24.280> the

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
value or main part of the value is the

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.120 
value or main part of the value is the
number<00:02:24.850> of<00:02:24.970> companies<00:02:25.440> represented<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.620> the
