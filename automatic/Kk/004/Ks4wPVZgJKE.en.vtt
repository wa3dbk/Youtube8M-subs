00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.220 

the<00:00:05.580> world<00:00:05.850> is<00:00:06.060> straight<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.600> whole<00:00:06.720> universe

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
the world is straight the whole universe

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.200 
the world is straight the whole universe
is<00:00:07.259> very<00:00:07.620> strange<00:00:07.950> but<00:00:08.220> see<00:00:08.460> when<00:00:08.639> you<00:00:08.790> look<00:00:08.970> at

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
is very strange but see when you look at

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.180 
is very strange but see when you look at
the<00:00:09.330> details<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.320> find<00:00:10.590> out<00:00:10.769> that<00:00:11.010> the

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
the details and to find out that the

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.120 
the details and to find out that the
rules<00:00:11.460> are<00:00:11.910> very<00:00:12.120> simple<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.559> game<00:00:13.769> the

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
rules are very simple of the game the

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.770 
rules are very simple of the game the
mechanical<00:00:14.730> rules<00:00:14.849> by<00:00:15.120> which<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.420> can<00:00:15.450> figure

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
mechanical rules by which you can figure

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.390 
mechanical rules by which you can figure
out<00:00:15.870> exactly<00:00:16.440> what's<00:00:16.680> going<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.039> happen<00:00:17.279> when

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
out exactly what's going to happen when

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.250 
out exactly what's going to happen when
the<00:00:17.520> situation's<00:00:18.119> simples<00:00:18.510> again<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:18.960> chess

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
the situation's simples again this chess

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.650 
the situation's simples again this chess
game<00:00:19.609> if<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.789> were<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.029> just<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.330> corner

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
game if you were in just the corner

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.450 
game if you were in just the corner
where<00:00:21.750> only<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.050> few<00:00:22.289> pieces<00:00:22.560> are<00:00:22.890> involved<00:00:23.400> you

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
where only a few pieces are involved you

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.980 
where only a few pieces are involved you
can<00:00:23.580> work<00:00:23.730> out<00:00:23.850> exactly<00:00:24.060> what<00:00:24.600> should<00:00:24.810> happen

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
can work out exactly what should happen

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.560 
can work out exactly what should happen
and<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.609> could<00:00:26.760> always<00:00:26.939> do<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.420> where

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
and you could always do that where

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.820 
and you could always do that where
there's<00:00:27.720> only<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.960> few<00:00:28.170> pieces<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:28.769> you

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
there's only a few pieces and so you

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.569 
there's only a few pieces and so you
know<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.070> understand<00:00:30.140> and<00:00:31.140> yet<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.399> real

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
know you understand and yet in the real

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.610 
know you understand and yet in the real
gay<00:00:32.910> that's<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.390> it's<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.020> many<00:00:34.200> pieces<00:00:34.469> you

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
gay that's so it's so many pieces you

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.530 
gay that's so it's so many pieces you
can't<00:00:34.920> figure<00:00:35.130> out<00:00:35.280> what's<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.820> so

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
can't figure out what's going on so

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.600 
can't figure out what's going on so
there<00:00:36.690> was<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> kind<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.260> hierarchy<00:00:38.100> of

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
there was a kind of hierarchy of

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.670 
there was a kind of hierarchy of
different<00:00:39.090> complexities<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.170> hard<00:00:40.410> to

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
different complexities it's hard to

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.639 
different complexities it's hard to
believe<00:00:41.070> it's<00:00:41.760> incredible<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.629> fact<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.110> most

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
believe it's incredible in fact the most

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.160 
believe it's incredible in fact the most
people<00:00:44.040> don't<00:00:44.250> believe<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:46.020> behavior

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
people don't believe that the behavior

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.700 
people don't believe that the behavior
upside<00:00:47.160> me<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:47.820> yak<00:00:48.480> yak<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.170> naughty

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
upside me one yak yak and you naughty

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.150 
upside me one yak yak and you naughty
and<00:00:50.039> all<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.280> stuff<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.149> result<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:52.160> lots

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
and all this stuff is a result of lots

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.549 
and all this stuff is a result of lots
and<00:00:53.370> lots<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.670> atoms<00:00:54.090> all<00:00:54.329> being<00:00:54.690> very<00:00:54.809> simple

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
and lots of atoms all being very simple

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.910 
and lots of atoms all being very simple
rules<00:00:55.940> come<00:00:56.940> out<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.719> evolves<00:00:58.440> into<00:00:58.590> such

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
rules come out that it evolves into such

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.799 
rules come out that it evolves into such
a<00:00:58.949> creature<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.640> have<00:00:59.789> been<00:00:59.940> billion<00:01:00.539> years

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
a creature that have been billion years

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.139 
a creature that have been billion years
of<00:01:00.960> life<00:01:01.530> with<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.250> experiences<00:01:03.000> has

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
of life with this experiences has

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.880 
of life with this experiences has
produced<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.750> thing<00:01:03.960> with<00:01:04.140> problems<00:01:04.710> that

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
produced the thing with problems that

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.230 
produced the thing with problems that
stick<00:01:05.129> out<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:07.920> real

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
stick out like this and so on the real

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.300 
stick out like this and so on the real
is<00:01:09.240> such<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> lot<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.590> world<00:01:10.799> there's<00:01:11.130> so

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
is such a lot in the world there's so

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.550 
is such a lot in the world there's so
much<00:01:11.490> distance<00:01:12.390> between<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.930> fundamental

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
much distance between the fundamental

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.289 
much distance between the fundamental
rules<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.189> final<00:01:14.549> phenomena<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.119> it's

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
rules and the final phenomena that it's

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.990 
rules and the final phenomena that it's
almost<00:01:15.600> unbelievable<00:01:16.400> that<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.580> final

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
almost unbelievable that the final

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.630 
almost unbelievable that the final
variety<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:18.990> phenomena<00:01:19.619> can<00:01:19.799> come<00:01:20.100> from<00:01:20.369> such

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
variety of phenomena can come from such

00:01:20.640 --> 00:03:06.280 
variety of phenomena can come from such
a<00:01:20.670> steady<00:01:21.180> operation<00:01:22.080> of

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:04:21.729 

you
