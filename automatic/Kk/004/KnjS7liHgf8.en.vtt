there isn't such a large range between
them<00:03:33.170> or<00:03:33.680> you<00:03:33.980> won't<00:03:34.340> have<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:35.660> proper

I get asked all the time can i enamel on

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.450 
I get asked all the time can i enamel on
a<00:03:46.000> lot<00:03:46.270> of<00:03:46.390> different<00:03:46.690> metals<00:03:46.960> and<00:03:47.400> yeah<00:03:48.400> you

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
a lot of different metals and yeah you

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.090 
a lot of different metals and yeah you
can<00:03:48.970> but<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:50.020> most<00:03:50.230> important<00:03:50.770> thing<00:03:50.950> to

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
can but the most important thing to

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.310 
can but the most important thing to
remember<00:03:51.220> is<00:03:51.730> that<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.390> enamels<00:03:52.990> that<00:03:53.230> you

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
remember is that the enamels that you

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.550 
remember is that the enamels that you
purchase<00:03:54.120> actually<00:03:55.120> match<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.690> metal<00:03:56.410> that

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
purchase actually match the metal that

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.910 
purchase actually match the metal that
you're<00:03:56.710> working<00:03:57.100> with<00:03:57.280> in<00:03:57.940> my<00:03:58.540> classes<00:03:59.230> we

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
you're working with in my classes we

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.230 
you're working with in my classes we
often<00:04:00.580> only<00:04:00.850> enamel<00:04:01.480> on<00:04:01.710> copper<00:04:02.710> because<00:04:03.640> I'm

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
often only enamel on copper because I'm

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.570 
often only enamel on copper because I'm
working<00:04:04.720> with<00:04:04.870> medium<00:04:05.470> expansion<00:04:06.130> enamels

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
working with medium expansion enamels

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.380 
working with medium expansion enamels
for<00:04:07.180> copper<00:04:07.660> as<00:04:07.870> well<00:04:08.590> as<00:04:08.800> fine<00:04:09.100> silver<00:04:09.490> i'm

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
for copper as well as fine silver i'm

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.020 
for copper as well as fine silver i'm
inevitably<00:04:11.380> asked<00:04:12.040> what<00:04:12.520> about<00:04:12.730> sterling

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
inevitably asked what about sterling

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.650 
inevitably asked what about sterling
silver<00:04:13.570> and<00:04:13.930> i<00:04:14.860> would<00:04:15.700> say<00:04:15.940> this<00:04:16.209> to<00:04:16.269> someone

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
silver and i would say this to someone

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.460 
silver and i would say this to someone
that<00:04:16.989> wants<00:04:17.290> to<00:04:17.320> enamel<00:04:17.980> on<00:04:18.130> sterling<00:04:18.670> silver

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
that wants to enamel on sterling silver

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.710 
that wants to enamel on sterling silver
it's<00:04:20.470> probably<00:04:21.010> a<00:04:21.040> better<00:04:21.250> idea<00:04:21.400> to<00:04:21.790> enamel<00:04:22.600> on

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
it's probably a better idea to enamel on

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.700 
it's probably a better idea to enamel on
fine<00:04:23.230> silver<00:04:24.060> when<00:04:25.060> you<00:04:25.300> heat<00:04:25.840> sterling

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
fine silver when you heat sterling

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.550 
fine silver when you heat sterling
silver<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.550> copper<00:04:28.150> that<00:04:28.180> is<00:04:28.480> part<00:04:29.320> of

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
silver the copper that is part of

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.130 
silver the copper that is part of
sterling<00:04:30.010> silver<00:04:30.040> comes<00:04:31.000> to<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.330> surface<00:04:31.570> and

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
sterling silver comes to the surface and

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.940 
sterling silver comes to the surface and
so<00:04:32.800> you<00:04:32.860> will<00:04:33.370> start<00:04:33.940> to<00:04:34.150> actually<00:04:34.950> discolor

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
so you will start to actually discolor

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.550 
so you will start to actually discolor
your<00:04:36.070> sterling<00:04:36.490> silver<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.300> I<00:04:38.080> would<00:04:38.380> think

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
your sterling silver and I would think

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.340 
your sterling silver and I would think
that<00:04:38.680> that<00:04:38.950> would<00:04:39.370> actually<00:04:40.050> compete<00:04:41.050> with

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
that that would actually compete with

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.720 
that that would actually compete with
the<00:04:41.500> beauty<00:04:41.950> and<00:04:41.980> the<00:04:42.280> color<00:04:42.580> of<00:04:42.880> enamel<00:04:43.510> I

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
the beauty and the color of enamel I

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.370 
the beauty and the color of enamel I
strongly<00:04:45.730> recommend<00:04:46.200> anyone<00:04:47.200> that's

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
strongly recommend anyone that's

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.159 
strongly recommend anyone that's
interested<00:04:47.620> in<00:04:48.160> enameling<00:04:49.030> on<00:04:49.180> silver<00:04:49.750> to

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
interested in enameling on silver to

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.830 
interested in enameling on silver to
actually<00:04:50.710> work<00:04:50.919> with<00:04:50.950> fine<00:04:51.490> silver<00:04:51.850> the

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
actually work with fine silver the

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.520 
actually work with fine silver the
pairing<00:04:53.830> of<00:04:54.180> transparent<00:04:55.180> enamels<00:04:55.690> and<00:04:55.810> fine

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
pairing of transparent enamels and fine

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.909 
pairing of transparent enamels and fine
silver<00:04:57.040> are<00:04:57.220> beautiful<00:04:58.090> so<00:04:58.690> that<00:04:59.440> would<00:04:59.650> be<00:04:59.770> my

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
silver are beautiful so that would be my

silver are beautiful so that would be my
recommendation<00:05:00.100> and<00:05:01.030> I<00:05:01.480> think<00:05:01.720> you'll<00:05:01.870> be

recommendation and I think you'll be
pleased<00:05:02.500> with<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:02.860> results<00:05:08.370> the<00:05:09.370> size<00:05:09.610> is

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
pleased with the results the size is

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.550 
pleased with the results the size is
very<00:05:09.940> important<00:05:10.600> for<00:05:10.750> a<00:05:10.780> lot<00:05:10.900> of<00:05:11.050> people<00:05:11.380> when

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
very important for a lot of people when

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.140 
very important for a lot of people when
they're<00:05:11.680> enameling<00:05:12.310> and<00:05:12.490> the<00:05:12.640> size<00:05:12.880> of<00:05:13.030> your

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
they're enameling and the size of your

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.690 
they're enameling and the size of your
piece<00:05:13.620> should<00:05:14.620> match<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:15.160> size<00:05:15.370> of<00:05:15.550> your

piece should match the size of your

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.409 
piece should match the size of your
torch<00:05:16.060> in<00:05:16.500> class<00:05:17.500> I<00:05:17.890> inevitably<00:05:18.430> have<00:05:19.150> that

torch in class I inevitably have that

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.630 
torch in class I inevitably have that
one<00:05:19.840> student<00:05:20.169> that<00:05:20.410> wants<00:05:20.950> to<00:05:21.070> make<00:05:21.250> something

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
one student that wants to make something

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.480 
one student that wants to make something
just<00:05:22.000> a<00:05:22.180> little<00:05:22.210> bit<00:05:22.540> bigger<00:05:22.840> the<00:05:23.710> max<00:05:24.040> flame

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
just a little bit bigger the max flame

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.780 
just a little bit bigger the max flame
torch<00:05:24.940> is<00:05:25.419> most<00:05:26.140> appropriate<00:05:26.560> for<00:05:26.919> pieces

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
torch is most appropriate for pieces

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.290 
torch is most appropriate for pieces
that<00:05:28.000> are<00:05:28.300> smaller<00:05:28.990> than<00:05:29.290> a<00:05:29.350> quarter<00:05:29.740> if<00:05:30.300> you

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
that are smaller than a quarter if you

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.450 
that are smaller than a quarter if you
want<00:05:31.660> to<00:05:31.780> tackle<00:05:31.990> a<00:05:32.380> much<00:05:32.620> bigger<00:05:33.100> project

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
want to tackle a much bigger project

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.760 
want to tackle a much bigger project
well<00:05:33.940> you're<00:05:34.360> gonna<00:05:34.450> need<00:05:34.660> a<00:05:34.690> bigger<00:05:35.140> torch<00:05:35.530> in

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
well you're gonna need a bigger torch in

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.470 
well you're gonna need a bigger torch in
order<00:05:36.010> to<00:05:36.130> do<00:05:36.310> it<00:05:36.460> and<00:05:36.580> these<00:05:37.150> are<00:05:37.330> two

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
order to do it and these are two

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.570 
order to do it and these are two
examples<00:05:37.600> of<00:05:38.169> torches<00:05:38.560> that<00:05:38.770> I<00:05:38.800> like<00:05:39.310> to<00:05:39.460> use

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
examples of torches that I like to use

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.060
