00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.429 
EA will possibly do and so i know that
his<00:01:49.770> his<00:01:50.130> pace<00:01:50.399> will<00:01:50.670> be<00:01:50.780> decreased<00:01:51.780> probably

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
his his pace will be decreased probably

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.499 
his his pace will be decreased probably
biggest<00:01:53.130> at<00:01:53.310> which<00:01:53.520> will<00:01:53.729> have<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.390> know

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
biggest at which will have the you know

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.910 
biggest at which will have the you know
the<00:01:54.630> biggest<00:01:54.810> decrease<00:01:55.320> i<00:01:55.439> think<00:01:55.649> you'll<00:01:55.799> be

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
the biggest decrease i think you'll be

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.760 
the biggest decrease i think you'll be
around<00:01:56.130> 83<00:01:56.729> or<00:01:56.759> 84<00:01:57.000> pace<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.899> which<00:01:58.500> would<00:01:58.680> be

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
around 83 or 84 pace and which would be

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.190 
around 83 or 84 pace and which would be
a<00:01:58.799> lot<00:01:59.070> more<00:01:59.100> easy<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.579> handle<00:02:00.090> for<00:02:00.360> for<00:02:01.079> those

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
a lot more easy to handle for for those

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.399 
a lot more easy to handle for for those
defenders<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:01.799> fifa<00:02:02.219> 14<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:03.140> other<00:02:04.140> than<00:02:04.350> that

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
defenders in fifa 14 and other than that

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.289 
defenders in fifa 14 and other than that
we<00:02:04.680> won't<00:02:04.860> see<00:02:04.950> too<00:02:05.280> much<00:02:05.460> difference<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.090> his

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
we won't see too much difference in his

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.119 
we won't see too much difference in his
other<00:02:06.479> stats<00:02:06.899> but<00:02:07.409> he'll<00:02:07.590> probably<00:02:07.799> dropped

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
other stats but he'll probably dropped

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.580 
other stats but he'll probably dropped
to<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.280> 79<00:02:08.849> or<00:02:08.879> an<00:02:09.119> 80<00:02:09.300> rated<00:02:09.750> player<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.170> my

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
to a 79 or an 80 rated player in my

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.680 
to a 79 or an 80 rated player in my
opinion<00:02:10.950> but<00:02:11.220> he<00:02:11.879> could<00:02:12.060> still<00:02:12.090> be<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.420> pretty

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
opinion but he could still be a pretty

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.730 
opinion but he could still be a pretty
decent<00:02:13.050> player<00:02:13.260> obviously

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
decent player obviously

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.340 
decent player obviously
he<00:02:13.860> has<00:02:14.250> transferred<00:02:14.850> zhu-fan<00:02:15.450> Abacha<00:02:16.110> and

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
he has transferred zhu-fan Abacha and

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.620 
he has transferred zhu-fan Abacha and
from<00:02:17.070> all<00:02:17.220> accounts<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:18.240> Turkish

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
from all accounts that the Turkish

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.800 
from all accounts that the Turkish
league<00:02:18.840> will<00:02:19.170> be<00:02:19.320> on<00:02:19.500> fifa<00:02:19.860> 14<00:02:20.070> so<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.880> i<00:02:21.480> think

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
league will be on fifa 14 so and i think

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.990 
league will be on fifa 14 so and i think
we<00:02:21.900> will<00:02:22.080> still<00:02:22.410> see<00:02:22.440> him<00:02:22.800> next<00:02:22.950> year<00:02:23.280> but<00:02:23.940> it

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
we will still see him next year but it

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.640 
we will still see him next year but it
will<00:02:24.090> depend<00:02:24.240> on<00:02:24.660> that<00:02:24.870> let<00:02:25.110> me<00:02:25.140> know<00:02:25.230> for<00:02:25.500> sure

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
will depend on that let me know for sure

will depend on that let me know for sure
if<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.920> know<00:02:26.100> whether<00:02:26.310> or<00:02:26.430> not<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:26.790> league

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
if you know whether or not that league

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.730 
if you know whether or not that league
is<00:02:27.210> going<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.510> be<00:02:27.600> on<00:02:27.720> all<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:27.990> team<00:02:28.380> next<00:02:28.590> year

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.060 
is going to be on all the team next year

Lukaku<00:02:32.450> who<00:02:33.450> has<00:02:33.630> had<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.840> very<00:02:33.930> very<00:02:34.740> good

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
Lukaku who has had a very very good

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.070 
Lukaku who has had a very very good
season<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.460> be<00:02:35.550> fair<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:36.000> played<00:02:36.210> online<00:02:36.510> at

season to be fair you played online at
West<00:02:37.260> Brom<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:38.490> did<00:02:38.850> some<00:02:39.060> work<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.600> be

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
West Brom and it did some work to be

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.510 
West Brom and it did some work to be
fair<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:39.960> i<00:02:40.050> think<00:02:40.260> he<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.440> deserving<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:41.280> a

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
fair and i think he is deserving of a

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.810 
fair and i think he is deserving of a
plus<00:02:41.880> for<00:02:42.120> overall<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.230> 78<00:02:44.070> rated<00:02:44.550> gold

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
plus for overall to a 78 rated gold

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.900 
plus for overall to a 78 rated gold
striker<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:46.430> this<00:02:47.430> could<00:02:47.640> be<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.820> very

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
striker and this could be a very

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.090 
striker and this could be a very
interesting<00:02:48.600> card<00:02:49.020> he<00:02:49.170> did<00:02:49.350> have<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.530> gold<00:02:49.830> card

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
interesting card he did have a gold card

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.940 
interesting card he did have a gold card
in<00:02:50.280> FIFA<00:02:50.760> 12<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:52.050> that<00:02:52.200> was<00:02:52.380> known<00:02:52.590> as<00:02:52.770> one<00:02:52.920> of

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
in FIFA 12 and that was known as one of

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.740 
in FIFA 12 and that was known as one of
the<00:02:53.070> most<00:02:53.130> overpowered<00:02:54.030> strike<00:02:54.300> as<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.570> could

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
the most overpowered strike as you could

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.500 
the most overpowered strike as you could
get<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.890> think<00:02:56.220> you'll<00:02:56.490> go<00:02:56.640> up<00:02:56.760> in<00:02:56.940> pace<00:02:57.180> by

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
get and I think you'll go up in pace by

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.060 
get and I think you'll go up in pace by
a<00:02:57.540> couple<00:02:57.930> he'll<00:02:58.080> probably<00:02:58.230> have<00:02:58.380> around<00:02:58.500> 83

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
a couple he'll probably have around 83

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.360 
a couple he'll probably have around 83
pace<00:02:59.480> dribbling<00:03:00.480> will<00:03:01.470> go<00:03:01.590> up<00:03:01.680> by<00:03:01.830> around<00:03:02.040> six

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
pace dribbling will go up by around six

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
to 72 that's not that's not bad he's

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.020

still<00:03:04.560> going<00:03:04.710> to<00:03:04.770> be<00:03:04.890> fairly<00:03:05.130> sluggish<00:03:05.580> 72

around<00:03:16.080> noon<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.380> 427<00:03:17.190> based<00:03:17.700> on<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.030> fact<00:03:18.240> that

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
around noon I 427 based on the fact that

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.640 
around noon I 427 based on the fact that
he's<00:03:18.510> going<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.720> be<00:03:18.840> going<00:03:19.080> up<00:03:19.200> some<00:03:19.410> ratings

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
he's going to be going up some ratings

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.220 
he's going to be going up some ratings
in<00:03:19.920> my<00:03:20.070> opinion<00:03:20.450> that<00:03:21.450> looks<00:03:21.690> like<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.870> really

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
in my opinion that looks like a really

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.130 
in my opinion that looks like a really
solid<00:03:22.590> card<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.550> I<00:03:24.270> think<00:03:24.630> this<00:03:24.780> year<00:03:25.020> he's

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
solid card and I think this year he's

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.870 
solid card and I think this year he's
got<00:03:25.260> three<00:03:25.500> star<00:03:25.770> skills<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.190> four<00:03:26.430> star<00:03:26.700> weak

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
got three star skills and four star weak

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
that is incredible shows you the sort of

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.340 
that is incredible shows you the sort of
season<00:03:54.270> he<00:03:54.330> had<00:03:54.480> in<00:03:54.600> his<00:03:54.720> first<00:03:54.960> league<00:03:55.140> in<00:03:55.290> the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
season he had in his first league in the

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.720 
season he had in his first league in the
Premier<00:03:55.710> League<00:03:55.740> and<00:03:56.010> this<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.460> what<00:03:56.610> I've

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
Premier League and this is what I've

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.090 
Premier League and this is what I've
gone<00:03:56.910> with<00:03:57.150> I've<00:03:57.360> gone<00:03:57.570> with<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.750> 79<00:03:58.590> overall<00:03:59.040> I

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
gone with I've gone with a 79 overall I

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.440 
gone with I've gone with a 79 overall I
think<00:03:59.160> his<00:03:59.460> season<00:03:59.790> was<00:03:59.880> probably<00:04:00.180> better

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
think his season was probably better

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.150 
think his season was probably better
than<00:04:00.630> Lucas<00:04:02.210> for<00:04:03.210> Villa<00:04:03.420> so<00:04:03.720> I<00:04:03.960> think<00:04:04.560> I<00:04:04.800> think

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
than Lucas for Villa so I think I think

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.740 
than Lucas for Villa so I think I think
he'll<00:04:05.310> be<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.460> 79<00:04:05.940> rated<00:04:06.270> I<00:04:06.330> think<00:04:06.510> there<00:04:06.630> will

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
he'll be a 79 rated I think there will

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.200 
he'll be a 79 rated I think there will
be<00:04:06.810> that<00:04:07.020> one<00:04:07.230> difference<00:04:07.710> between<00:04:08.210> Lukaku

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
be that one difference between Lukaku

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.199 
be that one difference between Lukaku
and<00:04:09.420> benteke<00:04:09.990> but<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.430> stats<00:04:11.730> on<00:04:11.880> this<00:04:12.030> guy

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
and benteke but the stats on this guy

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.060 
and benteke but the stats on this guy
have<00:04:12.330> gone<00:04:12.510> up<00:04:12.630> incredibly<00:04:13.230> plus<00:04:13.680> 3<00:04:13.950> on<00:04:14.040> the

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
have gone up incredibly plus 3 on the

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.800 
have gone up incredibly plus 3 on the
peso<00:04:14.370> is<00:04:14.610> now<00:04:14.730> going<00:04:14.850> to<00:04:14.970> be<00:04:15.060> about<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.660> same

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
peso is now going to be about the same

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.500 
peso is now going to be about the same
pace<00:04:16.049> as<00:04:16.080> Lukaku<00:04:17.010> in<00:04:17.130> my<00:04:17.250> opinion<00:04:17.549> dribbling

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
pace as Lukaku in my opinion dribbling

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.170 
pace as Lukaku in my opinion dribbling
will<00:04:18.780> be<00:04:18.930> 76<00:04:19.770> plus<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.430> plus<00:04:20.640> 7<00:04:21.120> shooting<00:04:21.450> plus<00:04:22.410> 6

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
will be 76 plus a plus 7 shooting plus 6

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.999 
will be 76 plus a plus 7 shooting plus 6
he<00:04:23.840> obviously<00:04:23.960> wasn't<00:04:24.289> rated<00:04:24.530> very<00:04:24.740> highly

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:25.009 
he obviously wasn't rated very highly

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.129 
he obviously wasn't rated very highly
last<00:04:25.340> year<00:04:25.639> but<00:04:25.789> now<00:04:25.940> I've<00:04:26.240> given<00:04:26.539> him<00:04:26.600> an<00:04:26.720> 81

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
last year but now I've given him an 81

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.770 
last year but now I've given him an 81
shot<00:04:27.440> probably<00:04:27.949> most<00:04:28.370> of<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.699> the<00:04:28.970> plus<00:04:29.180> 16<00:04:29.630> on

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
shot probably most of the the plus 16 on

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.379 
shot probably most of the the plus 16 on
that<00:04:29.960> one<00:04:30.110> will<00:04:30.289> probably<00:04:30.650> become<00:04:31.030> it<00:04:32.030> be<00:04:32.210> down

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
that one will probably become it be down

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.029 
that one will probably become it be down
to<00:04:32.630> sort<00:04:32.840> of<00:04:32.930> like<00:04:33.050> finishing<00:04:33.470> and<00:04:33.740> stuff<00:04:33.919> he

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
to sort of like finishing and stuff he

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:35.680 
to sort of like finishing and stuff he
did<00:04:34.190> score<00:04:34.340> a<00:04:34.520> lot<00:04:34.759> of<00:04:34.880> goals<00:04:35.060> last<00:04:35.240> year<00:04:35.570> and

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
did score a lot of goals last year and

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.230 
did score a lot of goals last year and
stuff<00:04:35.900> so<00:04:36.169> I<00:04:36.380> think<00:04:37.070> it<00:04:37.400> will<00:04:37.460> be<00:04:37.520> more<00:04:37.850> down<00:04:38.060> to

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
stuff so I think it will be more down to

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.820 
stuff so I think it will be more down to
finishing<00:04:38.600> rather<00:04:38.960> than<00:04:39.169> like<00:04:39.350> long<00:04:39.590> shots

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
finishing rather than like long shots

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.070 
finishing rather than like long shots
and<00:04:40.070> stuff<00:04:40.250> because<00:04:41.210> just<00:04:41.600> shows<00:04:41.780> you<00:04:41.930> what

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
and stuff because just shows you what

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.800 
and stuff because just shows you what
what<00:04:42.620> a<00:04:42.650> good<00:04:42.860> goal<00:04:43.070> scorer<00:04:43.370> he<00:04:43.610> is<00:04:43.729> then<00:04:44.419> again

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
what a good goal scorer he is then again

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.659 
what a good goal scorer he is then again
plus<00:04:45.050> 5<00:04:45.350> on<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.650> pass<00:04:45.949> in<00:04:46.220> plus<00:04:46.400> 4<00:04:46.430> and

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
plus 5 on the pass in plus 4 and

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.850 
plus 5 on the pass in plus 4 and
defending<00:04:47.660> and<00:04:47.810> then<00:04:47.900> plus<00:04:48.110> 7<00:04:48.530> on<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.710> heading

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
defending and then plus 7 on the heading

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.610 
defending and then plus 7 on the heading
he's<00:04:49.039> a<00:04:49.070> big<00:04:49.340> guy<00:04:49.370> so<00:04:50.000> I<00:04:50.030> think<00:04:50.120> 84<00:04:50.810> heading<00:04:51.500> is

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
he's a big guy so I think 84 heading is

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.770 
he's a big guy so I think 84 heading is
deserving<00:04:52.190> you<00:04:52.370> know<00:04:52.490> based<00:04:52.850> on<00:04:53.030> some<00:04:53.270> steps

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
deserving you know based on some steps

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.010 
deserving you know based on some steps

he hasn't been on fifa 13 because he

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.969

played<00:05:10.130> in<00:05:10.310> China<00:05:10.580> and<00:05:10.880> then<00:05:11.360> moved<00:05:11.570> over<00:05:11.780> to

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
played in China and then moved over to

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.920 
played in China and then moved over to
Galatasaray<00:05:13.550> but<00:05:13.729> his<00:05:13.849> card<00:05:14.090> was<00:05:14.180> not<00:05:14.509> on<00:05:14.660> the

Galatasaray but his card was not on the

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.870 
Galatasaray but his card was not on the
database<00:05:15.500> so<00:05:15.680> he<00:05:15.770> couldn't<00:05:16.009> be<00:05:16.130> on<00:05:16.310> fifa<00:05:16.639> 12

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
database so he couldn't be on fifa 12

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.790 
database so he couldn't be on fifa 12
but<00:05:17.509> this<00:05:17.599> is<00:05:17.750> what<00:05:17.870> I've<00:05:17.990> gone<00:05:18.229> for<00:05:18.560> with

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
but this is what I've gone for with

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.640 
but this is what I've gone for with
Didier<00:05:19.130> Drogba<00:05:19.400> an<00:05:19.669> 84<00:05:20.270> rated<00:05:20.570> striker<00:05:20.870> the

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
Didier Drogba an 84 rated striker the

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.110 
Didier Drogba an 84 rated striker the
fact<00:05:21.860> that<00:05:21.889> he's<00:05:22.039> aged<00:05:22.280> a<00:05:22.550> couple<00:05:22.789> of<00:05:22.880> years

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
fact that he's aged a couple of years

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.480 
fact that he's aged a couple of years
and<00:05:23.539> you<00:05:23.840> know<00:05:23.990> not<00:05:24.560> playing<00:05:24.860> for<00:05:25.039> such<00:05:25.190> a<00:05:25.220> big

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
and you know not playing for such a big

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.700 
and you know not playing for such a big
club<00:05:25.639> like<00:05:25.910> Chelsea<00:05:26.479> means<00:05:27.199> I<00:05:27.349> reckon<00:05:27.620> he'll

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
club like Chelsea means I reckon he'll

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.950 
club like Chelsea means I reckon he'll
drop<00:05:27.919> a<00:05:27.979> couple<00:05:28.190> ratings<00:05:28.699> I'm<00:05:29.000> hoping<00:05:29.539> he'll

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
drop a couple ratings I'm hoping he'll

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.629 
drop a couple ratings I'm hoping he'll
keep<00:05:30.110> roughly<00:05:30.530> the<00:05:30.650> same<00:05:30.800> plate<00:05:31.099> at<00:05:31.340> the<00:05:31.430> same

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
keep roughly the same plate at the same

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:33.790 
keep roughly the same plate at the same
pace<00:05:31.880> so<00:05:32.090> he's<00:05:32.270> usable<00:05:32.810> if<00:05:32.990> he's<00:05:33.349> too<00:05:33.560> slow

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
pace so he's usable if he's too slow

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.469 
pace so he's usable if he's too slow
then<00:05:33.919> I<00:05:34.190> don't<00:05:34.460> know<00:05:34.639> how<00:05:34.880> many<00:05:34.909> sort<00:05:35.449> of

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
then I don't know how many sort of

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.120 
then I don't know how many sort of
people<00:05:35.780> would<00:05:35.870> really<00:05:36.110> use<00:05:36.139> him<00:05:36.500> but<00:05:36.979> no

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
people would really use him but no

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.680 
people would really use him but no
matter<00:05:37.280> what<00:05:37.550> he's<00:05:37.820> going<00:05:38.000> to<00:05:38.060> be<00:05:38.180> strong<00:05:38.479> he's

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
matter what he's going to be strong he's

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.930 
matter what he's going to be strong he's
gonna<00:05:38.810> have<00:05:39.050> an<00:05:39.139> incredible<00:05:39.979> shot<00:05:40.280> and<00:05:40.520> gonna

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
gonna have an incredible shot and gonna

gonna have an incredible shot and gonna
be<00:05:41.090> very<00:05:41.419> very<00:05:41.780> good<00:05:42.110> and<00:05:42.349> strong<00:05:42.620> in<00:05:42.830> the<00:05:42.949> air

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
be very very good and strong in the air

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.399 
be very very good and strong in the air
so<00:05:43.520> we<00:05:44.000> can<00:05:44.030> really<00:05:44.570> look<00:05:44.690> forward<00:05:44.990> to<00:05:45.110> Didier

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
Drogba this is one of the players which

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.120 
Drogba this is one of the players which
I'm<00:05:47.720> most<00:05:48.050> looking<00:05:48.260> forward<00:05:48.470> to<00:05:48.770> hopefully

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
I'm most looking forward to hopefully

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.070 
I'm most looking forward to hopefully
has<00:05:49.550> something<00:05:49.909> like<00:05:50.060> four<00:05:50.330> star<00:05:50.599> skill<00:05:50.870> moves

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080

as<00:05:51.260> well<00:05:51.500> and<00:05:51.740> which<00:05:52.220> would<00:05:52.400> just<00:05:52.550> add<00:05:52.729> to<00:05:52.759> him

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
as well and which would just add to him

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.969 
as well and which would just add to him
because<00:05:53.449> someone<00:05:53.750> like<00:05:53.930> that<00:05:53.960> partnered<00:05:54.889> up

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
because someone like that partnered up

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.700 
because someone like that partnered up
front<00:05:55.280> with<00:05:55.430> someone<00:05:55.789> small<00:05:56.780> and<00:05:56.960> quick<00:05:57.229> that

00:05:59.439 --> 00:05:59.449 
could be a very very dangerous

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:02.110 
could be a very very dangerous
partnership<00:06:00.380> to<00:06:00.530> have<00:06:00.740> up<00:06:00.889> front<00:06:01.130> and<00:06:01.430> and

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
very very deadly that would be awesome

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.249 
very very deadly that would be awesome
so<00:06:04.550> those<00:06:04.789> are<00:06:05.120> the<00:06:05.180> four<00:06:05.570> cards<00:06:06.080> I've

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 
hopefully they up him to something

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:31.420 
hopefully they up him to something
usable<00:06:29.240> like<00:06:29.389> three<00:06:29.659> star<00:06:29.870> skill<00:06:30.139> moves<00:06:30.380> I<00:06:30.590> had

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
usable like three star skill moves I had

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.980 
usable like three star skill moves I had
I<00:06:31.460> believed<00:06:31.880> to<00:06:32.120> star<00:06:32.389> skills<00:06:32.719> and<00:06:32.930> a

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
I believed to star skills and a

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.600 
I believed to star skills and a
four-star<00:06:33.469> weak<00:06:33.620> foot<00:06:33.830> last<00:06:34.010> year

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
four-star weak foot last year

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.369 
four-star weak foot last year
so<00:06:34.729> be<00:06:34.849> good<00:06:35.000> if<00:06:35.150> he<00:06:35.270> was<00:06:35.419> feared<00:06:35.990> slightly

00:06:36.369 --> 00:06:36.379 
so be good if he was feared slightly

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:38.050 
so be good if he was feared slightly
more<00:06:36.530> skill<00:06:36.800> moves<00:06:37.039> add<00:06:37.310> to<00:06:37.550> go<00:06:37.699> with<00:06:37.879> that

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
more skill moves add to go with that

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.939 
more skill moves add to go with that
Emenike<00:06:38.960> I<00:06:38.990> think<00:06:39.289> we'll<00:06:39.379> probably<00:06:39.439> stay<00:06:39.800> the

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:39.949 
Emenike I think we'll probably stay the

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:42.610 
Emenike I think we'll probably stay the
same<00:06:40.159> on<00:06:40.400> his<00:06:40.610> skills<00:06:40.909> and<00:06:41.120> weak<00:06:41.330> foot<00:06:41.629> Lukaku

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
same on his skills and weak foot Lukaku

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.839 
same on his skills and weak foot Lukaku
again<00:06:42.919> I<00:06:42.949> think<00:06:43.250> we'll<00:06:43.340> probably<00:06:43.400> stay<00:06:43.729> the

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:43.849 
again I think we'll probably stay the

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:45.399 
again I think we'll probably stay the
same<00:06:44.000> three-star<00:06:44.509> skills<00:06:44.780> in<00:06:44.900> a<00:06:44.990> four-star

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:45.409 
same three-star skills in a four-star

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:47.559 
same three-star skills in a four-star
weak<00:06:45.590> foot<00:06:45.830> and<00:06:46.219> I'm<00:06:46.370> really<00:06:46.669> hoping<00:06:47.090> for<00:06:47.150> four

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:47.569 
weak foot and I'm really hoping for four

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:49.300 
weak foot and I'm really hoping for four
star<00:06:47.810> skills<00:06:48.080> and<00:06:48.289> a<00:06:48.319> four-star<00:06:48.770> weak<00:06:48.979> foot<00:06:49.189> on

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.310 
star skills and a four-star weak foot on

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.209 
star skills and a four-star weak foot on
Didier<00:06:49.639> drug<00:06:49.939> but<00:06:50.150> that<00:06:50.389> would<00:06:50.569> be<00:06:50.599> impressive

00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:51.219 
Didier drug but that would be impressive

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:54.700 
Didier drug but that would be impressive
really<00:06:52.219> really<00:06:53.120> making<00:06:53.479> usable<00:06:53.960> because<00:06:54.259> the

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
really really making usable because the

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.350 
really really making usable because the
one<00:06:54.889> thing<00:06:54.919> about<00:06:55.189> altima<00:06:55.580> team<00:06:55.789> is<00:06:56.000> we<00:06:56.180> all

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 
one thing about altima team is we all

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.619 
one thing about altima team is we all
know<00:06:56.509> it's<00:06:56.689> it's<00:06:57.520> it's<00:06:58.520> dictated<00:06:58.819> by<00:06:59.060> pace<00:06:59.270> all

00:06:59.619 --> 00:06:59.629 
know it's it's it's dictated by pace all

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:02.890 
know it's it's it's dictated by pace all
the<00:06:59.960> time<00:07:00.169> and<00:07:01.159> pace<00:07:01.610> is<00:07:01.879> the<00:07:02.030> key<00:07:02.210> factor<00:07:02.449> and

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900 
the time and pace is the key factor and

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.409 
the time and pace is the key factor and
74<00:07:03.740> pays<00:07:03.949> for<00:07:04.219> a<00:07:04.280> striker<00:07:04.520> is<00:07:04.699> probably<00:07:05.180> not

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:05.419 
74 pays for a striker is probably not

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:07.179 
74 pays for a striker is probably not
the<00:07:05.479> best<00:07:05.599> thing<00:07:05.870> to<00:07:06.020> have<00:07:06.349> so<00:07:06.860> that<00:07:06.979> is<00:07:07.069> the

00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:07.189 
the best thing to have so that is the

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:09.010
