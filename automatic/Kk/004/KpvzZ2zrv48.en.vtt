00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.510
 hello to all guys and welcome back up 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.010
 practical and welcome to this new one 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.200
 video in which we talk about one 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.570
 certain range of devices yes 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.730
 go on to talk about gehrig for today but 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.760
 let's talk about multimedia 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.310
 in fact of the htpc that are not other 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.590
 which today has three personal computers and 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.400
 particularly this type of end-user PC 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.080
 let's say a medium-low or anyway 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.570
 customizable it serves to make use of 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.579
 your multimedia content such as movies 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.070
 TV series or anything 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.290
 want to comfortably on your own 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.360
 sofa in the living room because many of you do it 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.550
 so you split the card watching game 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.870
 of thrones on the front wooden seats 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.149
 to your pc 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.530
 we know we understand you then we do 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.120
 this video to solve ours 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.370
 back problems but the thing 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.250
 particular of this video is that a 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.600
 unlike all the other times 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.460
 we are practically recommending 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.649
 spend a boatload of money for 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.449
 make you htpc exact because many of you 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.339
 that surely they have already given 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.900
 at the pc they had an old pc wandering 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.820
 compartment from the venere where in any case a 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.430
 pc that a sufficient processor e 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.780
 a few gb of ram but they would know from rin 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.540
 usually these computers already have one 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.460
 artex friend style a suitable kit throw us 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.530
 in everything if I 'm the minimum 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.840
 indispensable and stick it with your own 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.850
 stay on your red shelf 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.030
 young I propose rapier then as you are 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.520
 obviously arranged remaining on a PC 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.170
 low to medium low range or otherwise 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.030
 recycling an old computer 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.610
 you have the possibility to put a 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.640
 operating system that varies from windows 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.820
 7 windows 8 to ubuntu also linus e 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.159
 own computer just so decadent there 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.600
 they are very light and made luxe versions 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.040
 to be installed on these 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.729
 devices to be part of the gallery 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.770
 always 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.360
 also there are programs like xbmc which 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.520
 really via palumbo 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.630
 world and multi-news bring it to a 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.550
 other level 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.980
 in fact this computer just needs to do 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.840
 this therefore does not pretend who knows 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.490
 what power in this computer yes 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.600
 he only wants me to see the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.920
 your movies and TV series 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.030
 exact the background and let's see 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.890
 the images of what we have 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.440
 assembled us that we recycled 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.390
 pretty much everything except the card 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.420
 mother and we had to because precisely not 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.930
 we have well itx fish shops in fact 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.820
 we have included in this mini computer 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.800
 old ram old hard drives re e 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.440
 however also an old video card 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.780
 that has advanced us from a rc asset in the 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.700
 own basic configuration maybe above 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.100
 launch some fear games on steam 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.830
 that we are at home this summer but nothing 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.260
 more excessive in practice the 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.440
 expenditure on this realization is 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.690
 state 100 euros route risked 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.880
 through everything already new and you too 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.910
 more or less suspend the same for the 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.410
 cash and the rest do not need another small one 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.020
 precisely what can be done on this type 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.570
 of pc is that as we have already said in i 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.910
 previous videos optimizing it with 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.860
 the purchase of a nas rather than of the 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.010
 well made network facilities that can 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.350
 allow a well done streaming 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.200
 of your multimedia content 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.310
 attach hard disk to your router 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.080
 superpower all this will go to 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.670
 optimize the purchase even more 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.420
 however the realization of this type 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.730
 of pc 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.030
 accurate because as I am born of all 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.220
 feedback kv from 2000 jig the scream 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.140
 downloaded because they download come to 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.330
 search for 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.130
 exhausted on the data passing from the 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.480
 power that I attached behind that go 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.890
 down the living room where the other one is 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.319
 powerline connected to the PC 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.450
 in practice it presses a key for everyone 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.610
 b film directly on the sofa 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.950
 also as a last thing these PCs 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.870
 you can very well manage them by doing a 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.390
 small purchase of 20 30 euros for 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.190
 take a keypad with an annex 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.720
 trackpad to control them 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.280
 quietly to your exact Book 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.110
 because by the law of the maximum 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.930
 laziness weapons you bring the cable from 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.209
 sticking to vote no keypad with 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.400
 trackpad that you can miss 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.500
 use wireless from the sofa then the 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.870
 configuration will be TV 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.489
 exact popcorn keypad and fries 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.670
 precarious has cheated because age for the 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.350
 birthday see that in six boys 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.540
 go know if you care if he has you 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.430
 interested this kind of exact video 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.500
 and let us know especially if you have them 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.080
 you too if you use a bear 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.419
 use them or don't hesitate at 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.549
 write us on maybe some 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.650
 they would help to build 1 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.350
 we leave you with images and video 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.950
 in the background and let us know guys at 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.950
 next video
