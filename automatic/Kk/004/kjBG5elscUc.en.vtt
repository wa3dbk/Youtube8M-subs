which is a bit nicer than their 4c I
must<00:00:15.269> add<00:00:15.509> straightaway<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> much<00:00:18.060> nicer

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
Drive and it does feel a lot lighter

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.400

than<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.580> Ferrari<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.449> feels<00:00:24.810> like<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.080> Aldi

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
again it's kind of it looks and drives

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.849 
again it's kind of it looks and drives
heavy<00:00:29.460> but<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.760> drifts<00:00:30.240> really<00:00:30.810> lightly<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.800> I

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
heavy but it drifts really lightly and I

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:32.840 
heavy but it drifts really lightly and I
don't<00:00:31.920> know<00:00:32.099> what<00:00:32.340> happened<00:00:32.579> there<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.759> was

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850

don't know what happened there that was
some<00:00:33.000> weird<00:00:33.239> kind<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.230> drifted<00:00:34.829> glitch<00:00:35.130> there

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
some weird kind of drifted glitch there

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.910 
some weird kind of drifted glitch there
books<00:00:35.760> there<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.600> does<00:00:36.930> sound<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.469> some<00:00:37.829> of

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
books there it does sound like some of

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.040 
books there it does sound like some of
the<00:00:37.980> other<00:00:38.100> Ferraris<00:00:38.520> put<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.090> tin<00:00:39.390> can<00:00:39.719> and

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
the other Ferraris put in a tin can and

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.380 
the other Ferraris put in a tin can and
burnt<00:00:40.440> my<00:00:40.800> friends<00:00:41.370> also<00:00:42.360> take<00:00:42.570> down<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:44.390> slope

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
burnt my friends also take down a slope

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.729 
burnt my friends also take down a slope
we<00:00:45.480> can<00:00:45.510> actually<00:00:45.690> get<00:00:45.899> first<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.500> event

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
we can actually get first in this event

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.160 
we can actually get first in this event
so<00:00:47.070> once<00:00:48.030> again<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.450> not<00:00:48.660> upgraded<00:00:49.079> in

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
so once again this is not upgraded in

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.979 
so once again this is not upgraded in
any<00:00:49.379> way<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.190> only<00:00:50.489> using<00:00:51.270> Pursuit<00:00:51.690> tech

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
any way it is only using Pursuit tech

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.410 
any way it is only using Pursuit tech
and<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:53.129> car<00:00:53.370> was<00:00:53.640> almost<00:00:53.940> my<00:00:54.570> death<00:00:56.420> let's

and that car was almost my death let's
actually<00:00:57.570> make<00:00:57.809> use<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.079> some<00:00:58.320> turbos<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.739> this

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
actually make use of some turbos in this

actually make use of some turbos in this
one<00:01:01.399> that<00:01:02.399> was<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> bit<00:01:02.730> weird<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.000> get<00:01:03.270> out<00:01:03.420> of

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
one that was a bit weird to get out of

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.500 
one that was a bit weird to get out of
that<00:01:03.600> turbo<00:01:04.019> there<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.949> he<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.850> looking<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.330> to

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
crates l1 to race them because I want to

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.789 
crates l1 to race them because I want to
race<00:01:29.360> this<00:01:29.720> guy<00:01:29.899> because<00:01:30.170> he's<00:01:30.290> going<00:01:30.470> away<00:01:30.649> I

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
race this guy because he's going away I

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.420 
race this guy because he's going away I
want<00:01:31.220> to<00:01:31.369> go<00:01:31.580> to<00:01:32.409> so<00:01:33.409> without<00:01:33.799> drifting<00:01:34.070> once

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
want to go to so without drifting once

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.310 
want to go to so without drifting once
again<00:01:34.700> it<00:01:34.820> does<00:01:34.939> feel<00:01:35.119> very<00:01:35.390> weird<00:01:35.630> is<00:01:36.080> that<00:01:36.140> a

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
again it does feel very weird is that a

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.760 
again it does feel very weird is that a
thing<00:01:36.619> with<00:01:36.770> all<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.070> cars<00:01:37.280> I<00:01:37.460> think<00:01:37.759> it<00:01:37.909> is<00:01:38.770> it

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
thing with all the cars I think it is it

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.660 
thing with all the cars I think it is it
only<00:01:39.950> turns<00:01:40.490> if<00:01:40.759> you<00:01:40.880> drift<00:01:42.159> it<00:01:43.159> struggles

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
only turns if you drift it struggles

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.149 
only turns if you drift it struggles
unless<00:01:44.090> you<00:01:44.270> do<00:01:44.479> drift<00:01:45.039> unless<00:01:46.039> that's

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
unless you do drift unless that's

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.380 
unless you do drift unless that's
probably<00:01:46.429> just<00:01:46.549> a<00:01:46.670> thing<00:01:46.850> with<00:01:46.939> rivals

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
probably just a thing with rivals

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.550 
probably just a thing with rivals
probably<00:01:48.080> is<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:48.350> be<00:01:48.439> honest<00:01:48.619> but<00:01:50.530> hopefully<00:01:51.530> I

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
probably is to be honest but hopefully I

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.630 
probably is to be honest but hopefully I
can<00:01:51.649> win<00:01:51.920> this<00:01:52.159> head-to-head<00:01:54.490> he's<00:01:55.490> gonna

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
can win this head-to-head he's gonna

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.109 
can win this head-to-head he's gonna
crash

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
able to use that and get a shockwave

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.470 
able to use that and get a shockwave
and<00:02:12.440> blast<00:02:12.799> him<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.190> my<00:02:13.430> damage<00:02:13.819> is<00:02:13.940> critical

and blast him and my damage is critical

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.990

because he is foolish driver oh how
would<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.360> second<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:21.290> think<00:02:22.069> that's<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.459> bit

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
would I second I think that's a bit

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.610 
would I second I think that's a bit
obvious<00:02:22.819> that<00:02:23.239> I<00:02:23.269> was<00:02:23.600> first<00:02:23.870> in<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.320> race

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
obvious that I was first in that race

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.910 
obvious that I was first in that race
only<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.340> game<00:02:25.549> saw<00:02:25.940> that<00:02:26.120> wasn't

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.520 

I'm<00:02:30.819> not<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.090> fan<00:02:31.420> for<00:02:31.660> convertibles<00:02:32.319> very

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
I'm not a fan for convertibles very

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.080 
I'm not a fan for convertibles very
often<00:02:32.800> but<00:02:32.950> this<00:02:33.069> doesn't<00:02:33.250> look<00:02:33.400> too<00:02:33.670> bad<00:02:33.700> as

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
often but this doesn't look too bad as

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.920 
often but this doesn't look too bad as
convertible

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
convertible

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.050 
convertible
I<00:02:36.300> much<00:02:37.300> prefer<00:02:37.380> solid<00:02:38.380> roof<00:02:38.650> cars<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.880> if

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
I much prefer solid roof cars and if

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.820 
I much prefer solid roof cars and if
they<00:02:40.180> do<00:02:40.239> convert<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.840> has<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:41.110> be<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.260> hardtop

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
they do convert it has to be a hardtop

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.610 
they do convert it has to be a hardtop
roof<00:02:42.130> that<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.640> can<00:02:42.970> choose<00:02:43.270> to<00:02:43.480> put<00:02:43.660> up<00:02:43.840> when<00:02:44.590> I

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
roof that I can choose to put up when I

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.990 
roof that I can choose to put up when I
want<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.220> most<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.520> time<00:02:45.640> it's<00:02:45.790> going<00:02:45.819> to<00:02:45.940> be

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
want and most of time it's going to be

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.240 
want and most of time it's going to be
up<00:02:46.239> like<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.600> carbon<00:02:46.870> is<00:02:47.200> there<00:02:47.410> from<00:02:47.770> GTA

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.370 

once<00:02:51.250> again<00:02:51.580> it's<00:02:52.480> in<00:02:52.720> one<00:02:52.870> of<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.020> higher-end

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
once again it's in one of the higher-end

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.030 
once again it's in one of the higher-end
classes<00:02:54.630> yeah<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.810> doesn't<00:02:56.080> feel<00:02:56.319> like<00:02:56.800> it<00:02:56.950> at

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
classes yeah it doesn't feel like it at

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.400 
classes yeah it doesn't feel like it at
all<00:02:57.180> we're<00:02:58.180> getting<00:02:58.269> put<00:02:58.660> up<00:02:58.750> against<00:02:59.170> what<00:02:59.380> a

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
all we're getting put up against what a

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.199 
all we're getting put up against what a
bit<00:02:59.650> slower<00:02:59.980> cars<00:03:00.280> than<00:03:00.489> we<00:03:00.580> were<00:03:00.730> in<00:03:00.970> the

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
bit slower cars than we were in the

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.380 
bit slower cars than we were in the
would<00:03:01.690> be<00:03:01.840> Foyle<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.530> so<00:03:02.800> it'd<00:03:02.890> be<00:03:02.920> a<00:03:03.040> 40<00:03:03.670> but

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
would be Foyle and so it'd be a 40 but

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.809 
would be Foyle and so it'd be a 40 but
still<00:03:04.780> if<00:03:05.019> they're<00:03:05.920> putting<00:03:06.250> us<00:03:06.370> up<00:03:06.489> against

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
still if they're putting us up against

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.710 
still if they're putting us up against
quite<00:03:07.150> quick<00:03:07.480> cars<00:03:07.750> if<00:03:07.989> you<00:03:08.080> think<00:03:08.290> about<00:03:08.500> it

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
quite quick cars if you think about it

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.690 
quite quick cars if you think about it
which<00:03:10.720> is<00:03:10.870> interesting<00:03:11.019> I<00:03:11.590> mean<00:03:11.920> all<00:03:12.160> cars<00:03:12.459> go

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
which is interesting I mean all cars go

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.210 
which is interesting I mean all cars go
about<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.060> team<00:03:13.269> top<00:03:13.569> speed<00:03:13.959> but<00:03:14.709> it's<00:03:14.950> about

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
about the team top speed but it's about

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.340 
about the team top speed but it's about
mainly<00:03:15.700> when<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.269> turn<00:03:16.510> how<00:03:16.780> much<00:03:17.019> speed<00:03:17.319> you

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
mainly when you turn how much speed you

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.490 
mainly when you turn how much speed you
lose<00:03:17.860> and<00:03:18.280> he<00:03:18.880> for<00:03:19.060> example<00:03:19.360> we're<00:03:19.480> at<00:03:19.569> 222

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
lose and he for example we're at 222

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.600 
lose and he for example we're at 222
when<00:03:20.680> some<00:03:20.799> of<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:20.920> high-end<00:03:21.160> cars<00:03:21.370> go<00:03:21.549> to

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
when some of the high-end cars go to

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.360 
when some of the high-end cars go to
about<00:03:21.910> two<00:03:22.209> hundred<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:22.660> thirtysomething

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
about two hundred and thirtysomething

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.470 
about two hundred and thirtysomething
Masek<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.459> has<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.819> mean<00:03:24.970> where<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.239> can<00:03:25.360> tell

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
Masek it has to mean where you can tell

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.340 
Masek it has to mean where you can tell
the<00:03:25.510> difference<00:03:25.840> which<00:03:25.959> is<00:03:26.110> kind<00:03:26.319> of

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
the difference which is kind of

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.820 
the difference which is kind of
depressing<00:03:26.620> but<00:03:27.870> that's<00:03:28.870> that<00:03:29.110> what<00:03:29.709> I<00:03:29.739> do

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
depressing but that's that what I do

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.740 
depressing but that's that what I do
like<00:03:30.069> about<00:03:30.130> this<00:03:30.459> is<00:03:30.640> it's<00:03:30.760> got<00:03:30.940> more<00:03:31.180> details

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
like about this is it's got more details

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.349 
like about this is it's got more details
on<00:03:31.989> it<00:03:32.019> like<00:03:32.560> you<00:03:32.709> can<00:03:32.860> actually<00:03:32.980> see<00:03:33.880> this<00:03:34.030> the

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
on it like you can actually see this the

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.990 
on it like you can actually see this the
vents<00:03:34.989> and<00:03:35.109> stuff<00:03:35.380> on<00:03:35.530> it<00:03:35.680> like<00:03:35.890> that's<00:03:36.760> cool

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
vents and stuff on it like that's cool

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.289 
vents and stuff on it like that's cool
right<00:03:37.410> that's<00:03:38.410> that's<00:03:38.680> cool<00:03:39.060> because<00:03:40.060> usually

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
right that's that's cool because usually

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.289 
right that's that's cool because usually
they<00:03:40.600> don't<00:03:40.720> have<00:03:41.019> them<00:03:41.350> and<00:03:41.560> stuff<00:03:42.310> you<00:03:43.209> know

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
they don't have them and stuff you know

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.979 
they don't have them and stuff you know
what<00:03:43.420> I<00:03:43.450> mean<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:45.040> kind<00:03:45.280> of<00:03:45.310> makes<00:03:45.519> sense<00:03:45.989> to

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
what I mean it kind of makes sense to

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.750 
what I mean it kind of makes sense to
most<00:03:47.170> people<00:03:47.680> but<00:03:47.799> there<00:03:47.950> you<00:03:48.010> go<00:03:48.130> that<00:03:48.340> is<00:03:48.370> the
