00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.610
 or the city pop song this is the most one 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.840
 programmatic thing we do between 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.340
 four things and another to leave you 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.290
 and also leave the channel 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.780
 busy today let's talk a theme 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.310
 Quite patriotic, let's be Brazilian. 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.740
 with much pride with much love aquino 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.810
 one more thing our top 4 is about 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.519
 Brazilian characters in our top 4 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.480
 of Brazilian characters is very 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.789
 important that they know the following 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.470
 it's not worth a created character from Brazil nor 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.870
 Brazilian he's funny 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.010
 You have to be careful with the grid and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.450
 We can see how the gringo 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.190
 sighted in countries where the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.780
 people of characters will also any 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.940
 that the room on our list is 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.840
 he I spoke in four Aldebaran things 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.329
 of bull 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.329
 I only found fruit 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.410
 but who is not 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:03.380
 it's very good, it 's too good, it takes a horn 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.390
 of the woman 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.370
 maria victor is a character 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.370
 interesting because they understand nothing 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.320
 and he does not have anything here that 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.430
 you look personal space guy that only 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.030
 can be brazilian 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.800
 I do not know, he's big and he's dark and lonely. 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.420
 seems to want to create the knights of 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.640
 zodiac so make nationality for 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.560
 each of the characters but I think it has 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.780
 very criterion not I had to stay there 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.060
 played to that fifth will say that I 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.770
 What game from the Brazilian area and people 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.780
 know that they guarantee a letter from a 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.990
 very strong Brazilian that he only 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.300
 can he lost right there for chip seia it 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.970
 dies and returns a billion times 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.490
 then that must be what makes him a 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.930
 Our Brazilian list is perfect, but it's 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.990
 more a homeless Brazilian because 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.060
 he does not samba and does not like pagoda in 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.610
 bull house has no iron table 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.900
 iron chair then flag on 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.270
 wall thing that Brazilian likes 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.500
 so it's very difficult for you to know that he 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.780
 is Brazil really our third 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.340
 placed our top 4 it's roberto 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.340
 The coast is the solar junk 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.270
 to love like a pec knows American loves 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.950
 but Brazilian with the name of the 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.400
 coast and then the coast has more in 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.230
 list 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.560
 will it be that some great tour of Aldebaran 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.150
 coast and a story that has though 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.610
 be his father's industrial father 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.210
 paulo when preparing for various minorities 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.360
 and by the Brazilian he is black and mutants 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.490
 ie has another clichÃ© well 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.290
 here is worthy of note from the 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.520
 roberto da Costa who discovered the 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.440
 powers of him who was playing football 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.060
 he was a free player 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.050
 who were almost 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.580
 jokes 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.290
 I do not know I was not coming to the kitchen. 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.970
 other funny things aquino roberto 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.070
 of the solar ivory coast is that it 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.320
 It appears several times the Spanish speaking 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.820
 comic books despite being Brazilian and 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.160
 also said that the school they study 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.790
 in brazil a villar school that proves 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.960
 what for Brazil, latin america 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.120
 Spanish had something that until today 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:09.250
 is there doing the Brazilians for 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.840
 marvel world our top 2 the top 4 of 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.280
 Brazilian characters 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:19.240
 It is the fire that now is 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.970
 ora show of the powerful that descend is ball 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.459
 are so sensual photos of adc that 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.370
 she is a flame 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.310
 green should be because the clichÃ© is the 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.290
 Amazon and she is also from the coast and 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.310
 written with the countries of the 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.340
 spanish language 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.140
 but the vast majority of the coast of 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.569
 Brazilian comics also have the 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.040
 beatriz of the coast that is the pogo and so much 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.680
 interesting thing that she came to 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.650
 be president of the company in wayne 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.290
 Brazilian subsidiary and it also reached 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.560
 working with the snr face that organ of 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.920
 spy investigation of dictatorship 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.970
 Chiara speaks today of Abin is very 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.650
 weird 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.660
 the fire has several characteristics as well 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.470
 Brazilian clichÃ© for example shown is 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.970
 sexy is almost sex and the 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.890
 Do you know that Brazil is in the eyes of 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.560
 gringos is practically a place where you have 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.510
 monkey forest a capital buenos aires 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.519
 and fucking sex 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.410
 another mention we can do here and 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.479
 that they are a mutant of the 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.370
 marvel that she is also Brazilian and she 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.740
 came from the reef it comes from the beach of boa 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.669
 travel is a shark woman but it's better 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:31.210
 let history go there on my shoulder only 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:34.590
 for him the only fearless the brave the 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.590
 monstrous banking 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.720
 We know very little about banking. 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.520
 People know he was kind of yellow. 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.740
 because the collegiate with time the people 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.320
 also knows that his name decreases 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.870
 according to the end of the game game but not 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.419
 love triangle lima carlos carlos 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.470
 score but the name is strange next to me 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:01.300
 I think it's Jimmy from the coast and the bench he is 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.700
 the Brazilian stereotype elevated to 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.500
 maximum is all I think the 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.120
 Brazilian is the maximum exaggeration in the bank 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.910
 so wild lives in the forest 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.010
 Amazonian giant snake rolled nanÃ¡ 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.890
 April on the scene of him passing people 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.590
 hunger and such that the stilts and edit the 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:20.860
 also poor of the ripped 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.940
 and hair is not fallen and married 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.640
 with a ray that wants 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.690
 electric or man or an electric guide 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.970
 I think that's it 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.350
 and Africa's there and who found themselves in turtledoves 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.690
 Brazilian is always turning 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.290
 We're doing that ball there. 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.810
 he stays 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:39.020
 it is then running in all 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:42.590
