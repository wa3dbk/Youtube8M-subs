00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.490
 good this exercise give us the courage 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.010
 delta of g in standard conditions 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.860
 in balance and they also give us the 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.499
 concentrations of glucose and 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.720
 phosphate then does not raise the reaction 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:18.190
 which is glucose non-phosphate that 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.080
 converts into glucose and phosphate as 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.620
 it's a reaction in equilibrium we have 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.420
 to place the double arrows now as 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.610
 we already have this value is the cohesion 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.860
 that we have generally used 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.300
 then this value we already know this 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.030
 value is also a known value the 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.800
 temperature is a known value and 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.890
 we simply have is to try to 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.239
 clear with the constant balance here 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.210
 so that once this value is known 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.819
 we can come to this equation and from here 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.160
 clear the glucose concentration 1 

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:49.730
 phosphate 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.820
 What are you asking us? 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.350
 then remember that this is the 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.829
 data so for the constant for the 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.829
 delta f 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.560
 then how would the clearance be for 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.850
 this equation 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.670
 then we say that delta de g 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.040
 it's the same as we have a negative sign 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.750
 here then that sign we're going to how 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.750
 will multiply by minus 1 both sides 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.100
 you will be less here rt is 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.360
 multiplying then it will happen to 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.340
 divide 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.330
 and finally we have only the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.330
 natural logarithm decays 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.710
 well now 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.600
 the way to eliminate that constant of 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.930
 balance this this logarithm function 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.300
 natural is using we can observe 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.560
 that the calculator that function 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.600
 Natural logarithm has a function 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.150
 opposite that the one that appears here is to the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.430
 x 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.570
 then that's not what it does is to do that 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.570
 operation apply 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.450
 on both sides always almost the same 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.409
 operation on both sides so that it does not 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.170
 lose equality 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.370
 then in this case as are functions 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.110
 opposite are going to cancel 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.300
 then it will not fall has expressed the 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.260
 next way the constant balance 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.260
 It will be the same 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.880
 elevated everything to this value then it would be 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.180
 less delta than g 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.799
 about rt 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.180
 finally the only thing that needs to be done is 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.180
 write the values 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.250
 then from the tae hee we knew it was 20 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.250
 9 kilos jules 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:33.349
 then we passed it to jules that would be 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.349
 twenty thousand nine hundred jules per mole 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.099
 we divide this by the value of r that 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:43.400
 already known to be 83 15 jules per mole 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.200
 because the wine 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.450
 and we multiply this by the 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.280
 temperature that if they are 25 degrees 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.689
 centigrade its equivalent in that the 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.689
 wine is 298 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.110
 then we show that you can 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.040
 cancel the factors lunge with k your 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.590
 lung cancels with iun mol and simply 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.020
 we do the operation in the calculator 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.890
 then the equilibrium constant goes to 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.540
 be alike 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.430
 then in these calculators that are 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.430
 the most commonly used 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.069
 we simply do this with a function 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.930
 exponential was illuminated yellow 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.879
 then one with the shift key 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.980
 enables all functions in yellow 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.180
 then we say shift we melt this 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.670
 button 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.370
 open parentheses and started 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:37.120
 involve the values ​​then up 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.920
 we say it's minus 20 1900 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.780
 and this is going to be dividing a 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:47.150
 multiplication that is 8.3 15 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.150
 by 298 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:55.170
 we will be parentheses we were the other and we 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:57.890
 we did execute that gives us 2 17 for 10 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.290
 at least 4 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:05.020
 then that is the value of the constant 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:08.090
 balance in 217 by 10 at least 4 and 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.250
 well now how this value we just 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.650
 to calculate then this value is already 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.709
 known the glucose concentration not 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.030
 they gave it that is 4.8 thousand and mule and the 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.400
 phosphate concentration also what 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.310
 we know then here we have to 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.530
 clear glucose 1 phosphate 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.120
 before taking off we have to convert 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.090
 these milli molar concentrations 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.820
 cancel then these are equivalent to 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.400
 0 00 48 molar 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.199
 and here it will be the same 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.610
 how this is calculated is simply 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:42.699
 dividing by month 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.889
 then clearing we have to the 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.160
 glucose concentration 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.760
 1 phosphate 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.880
 It does not matter 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.820
 to the concentration of glucose by 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.530
 phosphate concentration and how is the 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.290
 we go through this constant that is 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.310
 multiplying then to divide on the 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.310
 equilibrium constant 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.200
 let's continue with the data then 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.449
 we already know what 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:13.199
 the glucose concentration 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:13.199
 1 phosphate 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.660
 will be equal to 0 0 0 48 as 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.479
 we have to multiply twice as 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.800
 if you throw it squared and this 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.100
 we said it for the value that we calculate 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.100
 here 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:33.240
 217 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.240
 by 10 at least 4 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.000
 then in the calculator we do the 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.000
 operation 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:49.729
 that gives us point 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.980
 107 molar 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.080
 but if we want to express this in 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.120
 the original or initial units that 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.630
 they were 1000 and just mule 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.630
 multiply 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:12.390
 we do is the conversion factor 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:14.760
 we know that 1 molar equals 1000 thousand 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:18.020
 and molar then multiply by a thousand 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:22.520
 then this will be the same 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:25.220
 to 107,000 and then molar 107,000 and 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.650
 molar glucose concentration 1 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.250
 phosphate to the conditions that we 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.250
 they were giving
