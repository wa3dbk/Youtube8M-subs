I<00:00:24.080> just<00:00:25.080> got<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.350> show<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:27.230> how<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.380> works<00:00:28.529> here

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
I just got to show you how it works here

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.970 
I just got to show you how it works here
this<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.029> top<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.779> filter<00:00:31.349> dryer<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
this is the top of the filter dryer the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.709 
this is the top of the filter dryer the
refrigerant<00:00:32.430> comes<00:00:32.730> out<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.239> pipe<00:00:33.480> here

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
refrigerant comes out of this pipe here

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.729 
refrigerant comes out of this pipe here
goes<00:00:34.320> into<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:35.989> cap<00:00:36.989> there<00:00:37.290> here's<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
goes into this cap there here's the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.639 
goes into this cap there here's the
remainder<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.390> down<00:00:40.170> inside<00:00:40.530> of

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
remainder of it and so down inside of

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.569 
remainder of it and so down inside of
here<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.690> a<00:00:42.690> bunch<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.739> little<00:00:44.010> balls<00:00:44.280> this

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
here is a bunch of little balls this

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.770 
here is a bunch of little balls this
thing<00:00:44.730> was<00:00:44.850> actually<00:00:44.969> originally<00:00:45.510> all<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
thing was actually originally all the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.340 
thing was actually originally all the
way<00:00:45.870> full<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.469> these<00:00:47.070> little<00:00:48.020> little<00:00:49.020> balls

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
way full of these little little balls

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.860 
way full of these little little balls
and<00:00:49.710> they<00:00:49.860> absorb<00:00:50.629> the<00:00:53.480> moisture<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
and they absorb the moisture in the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.110 
and they absorb the moisture in the
system<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.440> other<00:00:55.559> continent<00:00:56.340> contaminants

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
system and other continent contaminants

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.760 
system and other continent contaminants
so<00:00:57.239> now<00:00:57.390> I'm<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:57.960> going<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.140> show<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.440> here

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
that the public broke out of compressor

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.020 
that the public broke out of compressor
when<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.320> compressor<00:01:25.619> failed<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:29.030> caused

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
when the compressor failed and caused

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.109 
when the compressor failed and caused
this<00:01:30.990> dryer<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.650> plug<00:01:31.890> up<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.729> can<00:01:32.850> see

recommend doing this
i-i've<00:01:53.260> already<00:01:54.030> clipped<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:55.210> off<00:01:55.360> and<00:01:55.570> the

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
i-i've already clipped it off and the

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.830 
i-i've already clipped it off and the
cap<00:01:55.840> tube<00:01:56.080> is<00:01:56.230> clear<00:01:56.560> on<00:01:56.800> this<00:01:56.950> end<00:01:57.220> but<00:01:58.180> if<00:01:58.750> I

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
cap tube is clear on this end but if I

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.340 
cap tube is clear on this end but if I
go<00:01:59.200> like<00:01:59.380> this<00:01:59.710> and<00:02:00.520> I<00:02:00.550> blow<00:02:00.730> through<00:02:00.940> this<00:02:04.350> you

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
go like this and I blow through this you

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.380 
go like this and I blow through this you
don't<00:02:05.500> have<00:02:05.680> to<00:02:05.830> get<00:02:06.280> any<00:02:06.460> air<00:02:06.700> coming<00:02:07.060> through

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
don't have to get any air coming through

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.109 
don't have to get any air coming through
there<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.590> anyway<00:02:08.860> this<00:02:09.520> has<00:02:09.700> been<00:02:09.880> why<00:02:10.060> you

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.850 
there so anyway this has been why you
always<00:02:10.450> need<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.840> replace<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.260> filter<00:02:11.440> drier

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
always need to replace the filter drier

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
always need to replace the filter drier
on<00:02:12.160> a<00:02:12.220> piece<00:02:13.090> of<00:02:13.240> refrigeration<00:02:13.870> equipment

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
on a piece of refrigeration equipment

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.180 
on a piece of refrigeration equipment
type<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:16.030> later
