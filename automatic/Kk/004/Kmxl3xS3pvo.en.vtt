 I left him on the couch, he does not have his senses. 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.440
 What am I gonna do, my God? 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.140
 Do you know him, too? From where; 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.140
 Was he at Mitsikostas? 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.600
 - Where are you; - Say hello first. 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.540
 Are you kidding me; I never. 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.900
 What's the paw? 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.000
 Is waiting for you. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.380
 Oh, shame we blame because we say not to come. 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.860
 What; Put me in an open listening. 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.760
 Why; 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.820
 Put me in, you will regret it. 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.740
 Zoumboulia I am, you listen to me? --Yes. 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.020
 Are you listening to me? - Yeah. 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.980
 - What are they doing; 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.780
 Listen to another one now. 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.640
 Andrea. 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.820
 Nick. 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.160
 Who is Nikos? 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.880
 The fool. 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.020
 - Did you catch you? 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.120
 Haha, you did not understand well. We caught him. 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.500
 You do not know how relentless Spyros and Zoumboulia are. 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.220
 If she realized she was afraid we were painting it. 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.840
 Where will it be? 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.740
 Do not think, it seems. 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.820
 [Go] 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.720
 BOU 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.320
 If you do it again, you will not eat at all, okay? 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.620
 I can not, what can I do?
