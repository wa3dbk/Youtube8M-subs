00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.620
 a few weeks ago Apple launched the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.929
 most anticipated smartphones of the year will 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.250
 was finally quest on the low cost screen 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.010
 the 50 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.410
 we and 4d team decided to make a 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.750
 comparison between the two iphones for 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.240
 find out the differences between 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.640
 smartphones and if it really pays off 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.630
 put so you were also curious 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.810
 to discover 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.640
 then compare now one of the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.399
 questions that four of the world do not let 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.010
 sideways and can be easily seen is 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.110
 a judge who dictated a tie between the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.780
 two phones they practically have the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.180
 same characteristics or without the famous 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.160
 retina and give a higher quality in the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.010
 screen resolution have screen 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.940
 widescreen multi touch 4 inch 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.440
 with resolution of 1,136 by 640 pixels 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.230
 the two smartphones have 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.359
 resistant to fingerprint and 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.579
 grease on the front 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.799
 Let's now go to another very important point. 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.409
 important and what to leave on the cell phone 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.540
 now the design in this question evaluated a 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.140
 care series as a finishing 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.650
 cell phone 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.710
 if psd appears the big difference in 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.689
 iphone finishes iPhone 5 c 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.400
 has a plastic finish 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.500
 but it does not have a 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.799
 fragility that everyone may have in mind 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.170
 together with plastic is a steel frame 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.030
 enhanced by nice comfort touch 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.500
 front of some other phones with 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.159
 this type of finish 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.320
 in addition 5 c in five color versions 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.320
 blue yellow red green or gray 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.280
 colorful 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.180
 already the iphone 5 is if the most important moment 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.479
 indicated 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.850
 combining aluminum metal and glass other 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.159
 interesting iphone 5 s point 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.899
 is the fingerprint reader more 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.189
 apple new news 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.280
 with it it is possible to unlock a 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.890
 1 with the digital apparatus is 5s 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.590
 available in three colors silver and 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.460
 space and the one that draws most attention 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.530
 golden 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.050
 in this case if you are looking for a smartphone 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.140
 with stronger and safer finish 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.700
 the iphone 5 is if that choice 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.220
 if you are looking for solar finished 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.490
 plastic but with color customization 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.500
 iphone 5 c is your best choice 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.870
 still in design we can not fail to 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.650
 out the weight and thickness of the two 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.020
 cell phones 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.560
 when evaluating the directions that the iphone 5 s leaves 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.840
 gaining a weight of 112 grams blend 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.900
 of seven for you mirim 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.940
 already the iphone 5 if it stays behind a kiss 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.890
 centric two frames in broadcasters of 8.97 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.440
 mm camera 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.620
 In this regard let's say that the iphone 5 s 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.450
 ends up winning by few details 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.970
 the two planes have rear camera 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.459
 8-megapixel retro sensor 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.459
 auto focus autofocus detection 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.530
 of faces voice panoramic photos with 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.230
 geographical location which differs 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.450
 only the iphone 5 is if it was one was to 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.090
 with turton technology dropping 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.340
 trees more accurate in the images of a 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.590
 continuous mode that captures up to ten photos 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.239
 per second allowing you to achieve 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.299
 hundreds of images 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.730
 but despite all this the iphone 5 is 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.720
 the lens of the camera in 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.640
 2.4 versus 2.085 s 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.799
 this makes the 5 c camera 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.780
 increased sensitivity to light 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.690
 already the front camera of the two cellphones 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.850
 which is known as fez time has the 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.940
 same features take pictures of 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.790
 1.2 megapixels and features a 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.010
 retro nation as a whole modern cell phone 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.630
 besides owning the camera also has the 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.760
 video recording 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.700
 in this case we can say that the iphone 5 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.720
 s winning but by very few 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.820
 Details 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.030
 both video recording cameras in 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:00.180
 hd 1080 pixels has a rate of 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.519
 frames 30 fps video stabilization 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.680
 generated strong while recording a video on the 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.360
 their way of tratorar faces and Zoom 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.670
 up to three times 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.549
 the only details are 5s in the 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.829
 front are flashes and tony's camera mode 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.440
 that can play any part 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:19.579
 the video and up to a quarter of your 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.470
 processor speed 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.919
 this is undoubtedly one of the most 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.860
 Important analysis and here again 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:31.759
 the iphone 5 s comes out in front of the computer 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.340
 to 7 of a 64-bit architecture that 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:36.319
 Until then I 've never been a virgin smartphone 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.180
 with the new chip comes to be twice 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:41.090
 faster than the predecessor 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.680
 the conchite 7 is able to rotate as 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.050
 for example games with more than 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.039
 textures also from the most 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.719
 realist 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:51.050
 along with him he also comes with the teacher 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:53.569
 m 7 is a kind of helper 27 in 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:57.110
 certain tasks both cellular faster 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:58.520
 and powerful 15 hp with the teacher a 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.039
 little more cry 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.530
 the a6 but it is still possible to rotate 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.610
 programs and games with high performance and 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.979
 velocity 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.690
 in this case if you want a cell phone with 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:13.219
 eggs at speed 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:18.919
 your choice is the 5s memory storage 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:22.279
 the iphone5 cs has three versions of 16 32 and 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:25.069
 64 gb internal iphone storage 

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:27.800
 You seem only two versions of 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:30.139
 16 and 32 gb storage 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.139
 in this case if you want a cell phone with 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:36.589
 large memory capacity without doubt 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:38.180
 the 5s the best choice in this case the 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:40.159
 drums 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.680
 in this issue the tie between the top ten 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:44.930
 earphones as much as 5s while saints and 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.300
 endured 10 hours of battery call 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.719
 eight hours of battery life using 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.509
 internet in 3g mode can be felt 10 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:55.550
 hours if you use wifi in playback 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:57.529
 of videos of the users come to bear 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.919
 about 10 hours 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:02.990
 our last question is the price of the new 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.949
 apple iphones did not arrive in brazil 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.770
 still 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:08.719
 this should occur in December this year 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.330
 it is not possible to give an official value in 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:15.560
 real but in united states iphone 5 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:19.580
 is costing about $ 649 and 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:22.099
 converted into reais of the value of 1,460 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.039
 UFAM simple low cost and without surrounding 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:28.909
 of $ 549 in reais gives an amount 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:32.670
 of 1,235, again recalling that these 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:36.720
 two values ​​in reais are not official 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:39.450
 We analyze use of smartphones and can 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.770
 saying it was difficult to choose a champion already 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.470
 that the two iphones have 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:46.770
 almost identical characteristics 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.760
 but so is the champion of today is the iphone 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.470
 5 sec 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.660
 since it has a processor 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:54.180
 faster the tougher stuff 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.230
 have a higher capacity 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.990
 of memory 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:00.000
 capture images in high resolution and 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.490
 despite the iphone 5 c 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.920
 called low cost we think that the 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.710
 value is a little above the 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.600
 knees call the 5s is a good choice already 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.500
 that the price difference of only in 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.410
 dollars 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.300
 and you agree with our opinion do not 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.290
