into later but primarily let's let's

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.150 
into later but primarily let's let's
work<00:01:20.760> on<00:01:20.940> that<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:22.170> start<00:01:22.410> with<00:01:23.540> this<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:25.160> new

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
work on that to start with this is a new

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.450 
work on that to start with this is a new
orleans<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.670> standard<00:01:27.000> tuning<00:01:27.030> it's

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
orleans in standard tuning it's

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.370 
orleans in standard tuning it's
challenging<00:01:29.460> i<00:01:29.580> commend<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.600> for<00:01:30.990> drawing<00:01:31.230> if

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
so that's in standard tuning with a

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.029 
so that's in standard tuning with a
caper<00:01:49.700> with<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:49.880> second<00:01:50.210> fret<00:01:50.890> but<00:01:51.890> I'm<00:01:51.950> going

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
caper with the second fret but I'm going

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.099

and<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:03.380> tuning<00:02:03.770> I'm<00:02:03.890> using<00:02:04.100> for<00:02:04.399> this<00:02:04.490> song

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
and the tuning I'm using for this song

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.639 
and the tuning I'm using for this song
is<00:02:05.350> da<00:02:06.350> dee<00:02:06.950> da<00:02:07.250> dee<00:02:08.019> so<00:02:09.019> there's<00:02:09.200> just<00:02:09.379> roots

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
is da dee da dee so there's just roots

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.080 
is da dee da dee so there's just roots
and<00:02:09.890> fifths<00:02:11.200> makes<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.319> big<00:02:12.470> d<00:02:12.680> chord<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.849> the

crappy<00:02:26.209> microphonic<00:02:26.690> pickups<00:02:27.170> which<00:02:27.890> i

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
crappy microphonic pickups which i

crappy microphonic pickups which i
happen<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.340> be<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.459> big<00:02:28.610> fan<00:02:28.790> of<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.379> run<00:02:30.530> them

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
happen to be a big fan of is to run them

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.900 
happen to be a big fan of is to run them
through<00:02:30.680> an<00:02:30.860> amplifier<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.430> get<00:02:31.579> a<00:02:31.610> bit<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.790> the

through an amplifier to get a bit of the
amplifier<00:02:32.030> tone<00:02:32.569> and<00:02:32.840> then<00:02:33.019> to<00:02:33.140> use<00:02:33.260> a

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
amplifier tone and then to use a

degree although he was more of a flat
picker<00:03:12.160> use<00:03:13.160> this<00:03:13.400> technique<00:03:13.790> where<00:03:14.000> the

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
picker use this technique where the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.480 
picker use this technique where the
thumb<00:03:14.330> would<00:03:14.510> move<00:03:14.690> back<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.140> forth<00:03:15.490> between

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
thumb would move back and forth between

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.870 
thumb would move back and forth between
two<00:03:16.910> strings<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:19.250> I'm<00:03:19.340> going<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.490> focus<00:03:19.670> on

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
two strings so I'm going to focus on

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.430 
two strings so I'm going to focus on
four<00:03:20.180> strings<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.630> start<00:03:20.870> with<00:03:21.050> just<00:03:21.140> to<00:03:21.290> show

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
four strings to start with just to show

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.720 
four strings to start with just to show
you<00:03:21.470> where<00:03:21.710> I'm<00:03:21.830> coming<00:03:22.100> from<00:03:22.130> on<00:03:22.370> this<00:03:22.400> song

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
you where I'm coming from on this song

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.190 
you where I'm coming from on this song
so<00:03:23.330> we're<00:03:23.420> going<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.600> focus<00:03:23.750> on<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.020> right

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
so we're going to focus on the right

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.860 
so we're going to focus on the right
hand<00:03:24.440> first<00:03:24.710> of<00:03:24.890> all<00:03:25.010> and<00:03:25.910> here's<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.750> basic

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
hand first of all and here's the basic

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:44.250 
hand first of all and here's the basic
pattern

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.630 

so<00:03:45.260> first<00:03:45.500> of<00:03:45.620> all<00:03:45.710> you<00:03:45.830> grab<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.130> two<00:03:46.310> outside

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
so first of all you grab the two outside

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.240 
so first of all you grab the two outside
strings<00:03:47.030> out<00:03:47.210> of<00:03:47.300> your<00:03:47.420> four<00:03:51.010> so<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.100> two

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
strings out of your four so the two

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.250 
strings out of your four so the two
outside<00:03:52.640> strings<00:03:53.090> followed<00:03:53.930> by<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.170> first

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
outside strings followed by the first

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.710 
outside strings followed by the first
finger<00:03:54.770> on<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:55.070> B<00:03:55.190> string<00:03:55.250> and<00:03:55.760> then<00:03:56.600> the

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
finger on the B string and then the

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:06.630 
finger on the B string and then the
thumb<00:03:56.960> on<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.230> g<00:03:57.410> string

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.920 

you

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.770 

Oh

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.710 

when<00:04:16.780> I<00:04:16.810> add<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.230> left<00:04:17.440> hand<00:04:17.680> in<00:04:17.859> the<00:04:18.070> melody

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
when I add the left hand in the melody

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.180 
when I add the left hand in the melody
with<00:04:19.720> a<00:04:19.750> few<00:04:20.049> minor<00:04:20.230> changes<00:04:20.410> because<00:04:21.070> it

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
with a few minor changes because it

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.770 
with a few minor changes because it
never<00:04:21.340> remains<00:04:21.730> completely<00:04:22.030> consistent<00:04:22.510> this

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
never remains completely consistent this

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:34.760 
never remains completely consistent this
