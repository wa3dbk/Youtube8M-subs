those<00:00:14.119> impulse<00:00:14.449> buys<00:00:14.690> walked<00:00:15.020> into<00:00:15.289> the<00:00:15.350> hobby

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
those impulse buys walked into the hobby

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.279 
those impulse buys walked into the hobby
shop<00:00:15.709> and<00:00:16.160> it<00:00:16.430> was<00:00:16.520> a<00:00:16.550> counter<00:00:17.480> for<00:00:17.960> the<00:00:18.020> price

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
shop and it was a counter for the price

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.640 
shop and it was a counter for the price
usually<00:00:18.740> what<00:00:19.010> 45<00:00:19.490> bucks<00:00:20.230> figure<00:00:21.230> to<00:00:21.320> be<00:00:21.380> well

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
usually what 45 bucks figure to be well

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.400 
usually what 45 bucks figure to be well
where's<00:00:21.860> it<00:00:25.330> this<00:00:26.330> guy<00:00:26.510> open<00:00:26.840> I<00:00:26.930> wasn't<00:00:27.230> really

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
where's it this guy open I wasn't really

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.240 
where's it this guy open I wasn't really
sure<00:00:27.620> what<00:00:27.800> to<00:00:27.830> expect<00:00:27.950> it<00:00:28.370> here<00:00:28.550> either<00:00:30.250> all

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
sure what to expect it here either all

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.560 
sure what to expect it here either all
right<00:00:31.400> so<00:00:31.789> we've<00:00:32.239> got<00:00:32.270> three<00:00:33.430> four<00:00:34.430> fins<00:00:37.570> two

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
right so we've got three four fins two

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.410 
right so we've got three four fins two
side<00:00:38.900> ones<00:00:39.110> one<00:00:39.890> dorsal<00:00:40.430> fin<00:00:40.670> and<00:00:40.970> then<00:00:41.180> one

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
side ones one dorsal fin and then one

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.389 
side ones one dorsal fin and then one
smaller<00:00:41.780> one<00:00:42.079> closer<00:00:42.320> to<00:00:42.470> the<00:00:42.620> tail<00:00:45.340> this<00:00:46.340> is

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
smaller one closer to the tail this is

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.180 
smaller one closer to the tail this is
the<00:00:46.850> rail<00:00:47.090> system<00:00:47.800> tracks<00:00:48.800> are<00:00:48.980> in<00:00:49.070> their

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
the rail system tracks are in their

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.740 
the rail system tracks are in their
batteries<00:00:49.550> in<00:00:49.700> their<00:00:49.850> slides<00:00:50.239> forward<00:00:50.570> and

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
batteries in their slides forward and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.430 
batteries in their slides forward and
back<00:00:50.960> to<00:00:51.260> pitch<00:00:51.559> your<00:00:52.370> fish<00:00:52.640> up<00:00:53.120> or<00:00:53.390> down<00:00:56.440> this

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
back to pitch your fish up or down this

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.100 
back to pitch your fish up or down this
is<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:57.770> tail<00:00:58.370> piece<00:01:00.190> which<00:01:01.190> makes<00:01:01.489> it<00:01:01.640> flap<00:01:02.110> or

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
is the tail piece which makes it flap or

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.660 
is the tail piece which makes it flap or
swim<00:01:03.440> should<00:01:03.649> I<00:01:03.710> say<00:01:06.130> here<00:01:07.130> we<00:01:07.310> have<00:01:07.490> the

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
swim should I say here we have the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.550 
swim should I say here we have the
remote<00:01:09.280> watch<00:01:10.280> to<00:01:10.520> it<00:01:10.719> just<00:01:11.719> an<00:01:11.929> IR<00:01:12.259> remote

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
remote watch to it just an IR remote

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.679 
remote watch to it just an IR remote
little<00:01:13.459> compartment<00:01:13.969> on<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.119> side<00:01:14.329> you<00:01:14.479> put

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
little compartment on the side you put

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.340 
little compartment on the side you put
some<00:01:14.899> clay<00:01:15.109> weights<00:01:15.350> in<00:01:16.840> string<00:01:17.840> to<00:01:17.990> tie<00:01:18.020> it<00:01:18.229> up

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
some clay weights in string to tie it up

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:26.349 
some clay weights in string to tie it up
with<00:01:20.829> and<00:01:21.829> that<00:01:22.189> there's<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.759> tail<00:01:25.359> sticky

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:26.359 
with and that there's the tail sticky

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:34.440 
with and that there's the tail sticky
pads<00:01:28.149> and<00:01:29.149> there<00:01:29.749> is<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.469> fish<00:01:30.709> itself

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.450 

so<00:01:35.450> this<00:01:36.200> here<00:01:36.500> probably<00:01:36.979> doesn't<00:01:37.250> do<00:01:37.340> it

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
so this here probably doesn't do it

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.110 
so this here probably doesn't do it
justice<00:01:37.960> but<00:01:38.960> it<00:01:39.170> is<00:01:39.320> big<00:01:42.280> seen<00:01:43.280> it<00:01:43.460> played<00:01:43.970> it

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
justice but it is big seen it played it

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.910 
justice but it is big seen it played it
