medium clumps I start with the shorter

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.239 
medium clumps I start with the shorter
length<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.049> start<00:01:10.290> with<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.439> medium<00:01:10.680> clumps

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:11.249 
length so I start with the medium clumps

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:15.200 
length so I start with the medium clumps
and<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:12.299> pull<00:01:12.539> them<00:01:12.719> off<00:01:12.899> of<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.380> tray<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.210> then

can see that that glue is pretty tacky

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.419 
can see that that glue is pretty tacky
already<00:01:21.619> you<00:01:22.619> don't<00:01:22.799> want<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.039> running<00:01:23.249> all

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429

already you don't want it running all
over<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.639> place<00:01:23.729> they'll<00:01:24.179> make<00:01:24.329> it<00:01:24.359> harder<00:01:24.719> to

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:24.749 
over the place they'll make it harder to

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:27.169 
over the place they'll make it harder to
get<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.619> then<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.520> take<00:01:26.939> off<00:01:27.149> the

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
work too much glue and I know that it's

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.399 
work too much glue and I know that it's
hard<00:01:32.789> to<00:01:32.850> see<00:01:33.179> but<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.840> wanted<00:01:34.109> to<00:01:34.200> show<00:01:34.380> you

very outside of my iris and I start with

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:42.410 
very outside of my iris and I start with
the<00:01:40.200> medium<00:01:40.529> so<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.219> start<00:01:41.639> on<00:01:41.819> the<00:01:41.850> outside<00:01:42.329> of

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
the medium so I start on the outside of

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.080 
the medium so I start on the outside of
the<00:01:42.479> iris<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.229> then<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.950> placed<00:01:44.219> them<00:01:44.459> all<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
the iris and then it placed them all the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.980 
the iris and then it placed them all the
way<00:01:45.270> toward<00:01:46.139> the<00:01:46.289> inner<00:01:46.560> corner<00:01:47.069> of<00:01:47.100> my<00:01:47.429> eye

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.600 
and then I use my pinky to kind of get
it<00:02:01.970> into<00:02:02.119> place<00:02:02.509> if<00:02:03.140> it's<00:02:03.680> not<00:02:03.830> in<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.220> perfect

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
it into place if it's not in the perfect

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.260 
it into place if it's not in the perfect
place<00:02:04.820> what<00:02:05.390> I<00:02:05.420> when<00:02:06.229> I<00:02:06.259> first<00:02:06.619> put<00:02:06.830> it<00:02:06.920> on<00:02:07.239> so<00:02:08.239> I

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
place what I when I first put it on so I

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.410 
place what I when I first put it on so I
alternate<00:02:09.229> alternate<00:02:10.009> between<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.819> eyes<00:02:10.940> and

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
alternate alternate between the eyes and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.330 
alternate alternate between the eyes and
that<00:02:11.810> gives<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.260> lash<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.470> little<00:02:12.950> bit<00:02:13.100> more

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
that gives the lash a little bit more

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.320 
that gives the lash a little bit more
time<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:14.569> dry<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:15.170> also<00:02:16.010> realize<00:02:16.819> that<00:02:16.850> I<00:02:17.090> look

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
time to dry I also realize that I look

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.940 
time to dry I also realize that I look
funny<00:02:17.540> because<00:02:17.959> I'm<00:02:18.200> trying<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.530> keep<00:02:18.590> my<00:02:18.800> eyes

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
funny because I'm trying to keep my eyes

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.690 
funny because I'm trying to keep my eyes
open

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
open

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.509 
open
because<00:02:20.150> it's<00:02:20.480> happened<00:02:20.900> before<00:02:20.959> where<00:02:21.380> I've

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
because it's happened before where I've

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.680 
because it's happened before where I've
blinked<00:02:22.519> too<00:02:22.730> much<00:02:22.910> or<00:02:23.180> I've<00:02:23.269> shut<00:02:23.540> my<00:02:23.660> eyes

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
blinked too much or I've shut my eyes

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.710 
blinked too much or I've shut my eyes
too<00:02:24.200> much<00:02:24.380> and<00:02:24.680> then<00:02:24.769> the<00:02:24.890> lashes<00:02:25.510> adhere<00:02:26.510> to

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
too much and then the lashes adhere to

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.699 
too much and then the lashes adhere to
the<00:02:26.959> bottom<00:02:27.290> lashes<00:02:28.540> so<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.570> have<00:02:30.200> left<00:02:30.470> the

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
the bottom lashes so I have left the

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.860 
the bottom lashes so I have left the
outer<00:02:30.920> corners<00:02:31.489> bare<00:02:31.850> because<00:02:32.300> I<00:02:32.330> like<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:32.840> use

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
outer corners bare because I like to use

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.229 
outer corners bare because I like to use
the<00:02:33.260> longer<00:02:33.709> lashes<00:02:33.920> on<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.459> outer<00:02:34.760> corners

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
the longer lashes on the outer corners

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.509 
the longer lashes on the outer corners
it<00:02:35.450> kind<00:02:35.660> of<00:02:35.750> gives<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:36.050> a<00:02:36.080> flirty<00:02:36.650> look<00:02:36.920> to

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
it kind of gives you a flirty look to

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.690 
it kind of gives you a flirty look to
have<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.880> long<00:02:38.120> ones<00:02:38.420> on<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.870> outside<00:02:39.670> so<00:02:40.670> you

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
have the long ones on the outside so you

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.699 
have the long ones on the outside so you
fill<00:02:41.060> them<00:02:41.180> in<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:41.720> can<00:02:41.750> see<00:02:42.200> though<00:02:42.440> that

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
fill them in and you can see though that

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.680 
fill them in and you can see though that
there<00:02:42.980> are<00:02:43.070> spaces<00:02:43.430> in<00:02:43.850> between<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.209> Flair's

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
there are spaces in between the Flair's

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.220 
there are spaces in between the Flair's
on<00:02:45.230> both<00:02:46.010> eyes<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:46.670> what<00:02:46.880> you<00:02:47.150> use<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:48.019> fill

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
on both eyes so what you use to fill

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.110 
on both eyes so what you use to fill
those<00:02:48.350> spaces<00:02:48.769> in<00:02:49.160> are<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.489> individual

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
those spaces in are the individual

those spaces in are the individual
lashes<00:02:50.360> you<00:02:51.260> can<00:02:51.290> use<00:02:51.620> whatever<00:02:51.920> length<00:02:52.310> you

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
lashes you can use whatever length you

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.180 
lashes you can use whatever length you
