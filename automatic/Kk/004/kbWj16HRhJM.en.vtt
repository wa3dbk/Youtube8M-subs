00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
for dig the copper plant if there's

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.809 
for dig the copper plant if there's
something<00:03:13.500> Myles<00:03:14.040> works<00:03:14.310> in<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.520> warehouse

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
something Myles works in the warehouse

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.640 
something Myles works in the warehouse
when<00:03:14.970> we're<00:03:15.150> Arabs<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:15.870> run<00:03:16.260> one<00:03:16.410> of<00:03:16.560> the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
when we're Arabs and I run one of the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.550 
when we're Arabs and I run one of the
harvesters<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.569> so<00:03:18.569> just<00:03:18.840> gonna<00:03:19.020> evolve

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
harvesters and so just gonna evolve

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.920 
harvesters and so just gonna evolve
mouths<00:03:19.980> looks<00:03:20.220> totally<00:03:20.790> after<00:03:21.090> them<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.750> milk

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
mouths looks totally after them the milk

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.470 
mouths looks totally after them the milk
business<00:03:23.780> so<00:03:24.780> it's<00:03:25.560> equal<00:03:26.160> shared<00:03:26.670> but<00:03:27.000> just

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
business so it's equal shared but just

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.699 
business so it's equal shared but just
kind<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.690> evolved<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.290> guess<00:03:32.810> for<00:03:33.810> tilty<00:03:34.200> on<00:03:34.319> all

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
kind of evolved I guess for tilty on all

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.680 
kind of evolved I guess for tilty on all
the<00:03:34.890> varieties<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.370> we<00:03:35.610> grow<00:03:35.819> we<00:03:36.360> hope<00:03:36.510> to

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
the varieties that we grow we hope to

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.080 
the varieties that we grow we hope to
have<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.019> field<00:03:37.260> in<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.620> soil<00:03:37.860> as<00:03:38.610> good<00:03:38.910> when

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
have the field in the soil as good when

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.970 
have the field in the soil as good when
we're<00:03:39.269> done<00:03:39.420> of<00:03:39.600> it<00:03:39.720> as<00:03:40.380> it<00:03:40.560> was<00:03:40.680> when<00:03:40.950> we

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
we're done of it as it was when we

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.000 
we're done of it as it was when we
started<00:03:41.100> sure<00:03:41.880> that's<00:03:42.239> my<00:03:43.049> goal<00:03:43.290> anyways<00:03:43.739> or

started sure that's my goal anyways or
better<00:03:44.250> or<00:03:45.060> better<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.420> can<00:03:45.569> either<00:03:45.720> build

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
better or better you can either build

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.860 
better or better you can either build
mine<00:03:46.410> or<00:03:46.709> maintain<00:03:47.220> your<00:03:48.000> field<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.569> we<00:03:48.690> hope

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
mine or maintain your field and we hope

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.720 
mine or maintain your field and we hope
to<00:03:48.900> we<00:03:49.739> hope<00:03:49.860> to<00:03:50.069> build<00:03:50.220> it<00:03:50.430> or<00:03:50.580> at<00:03:50.670> least

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
to we hope to build it or at least

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.070 
to we hope to build it or at least
maintain<00:03:51.090> it<00:03:51.540> for<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.290> next<00:03:52.440> generation

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.620 

as<00:03:56.140> Boyd<00:03:56.920> and<00:03:57.100> I<00:03:57.190> head<00:03:57.430> out<00:03:57.610> into<00:03:57.820> the<00:03:58.060> field<00:03:58.360> it

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
as Boyd and I head out into the field it

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.450 
as Boyd and I head out into the field it
occurs<00:03:58.930> to<00:03:58.960> me<00:03:59.170> that<00:03:59.290> one<00:03:59.830> of<00:03:59.860> the<00:04:00.070> defining

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
occurs to me that one of the defining

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.760 
occurs to me that one of the defining
features<00:04:00.610> of<00:04:01.060> this<00:04:01.360> farm<00:04:01.720> is<00:04:02.020> not<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.560> land

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
features of this farm is not the land

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.160 
features of this farm is not the land
itself<00:04:03.340> but<00:04:04.090> that<00:04:04.240> Boyd's<00:04:04.510> kids<00:04:04.900> actually

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
itself but that Boyd's kids actually

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.070 
itself but that Boyd's kids actually
want<00:04:05.560> to<00:04:05.680> stay<00:04:06.160> on<00:04:06.190> this<00:04:06.580> land<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:07.540> I<00:04:07.690> can<00:04:07.870> see

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
want to stay on this land and I can see

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.400 
want to stay on this land and I can see
why<00:04:09.300> so<00:04:10.300> you're<00:04:10.450> growing<00:04:10.570> three<00:04:11.050> different

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
why so you're growing three different

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.830 
why so you're growing three different
types<00:04:11.620> of<00:04:11.830> potatoes<00:04:11.970> yes<00:04:12.970> yeah<00:04:13.360> we<00:04:13.690> actually

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
types of potatoes yes yeah we actually

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.390 
types of potatoes yes yeah we actually
have<00:04:14.140> a<00:04:14.200> fourth<00:04:14.500> but<00:04:14.740> we<00:04:14.830> don't<00:04:15.010> have<00:04:15.130> it<00:04:15.190> here

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
have a fourth but we don't have it here

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.690 
have a fourth but we don't have it here
with<00:04:15.550> us<00:04:16.230> and<00:04:17.230> is<00:04:17.560> it<00:04:17.739> basic<00:04:18.160> it's<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.489> same

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
with us and is it basic it's the same

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.030 
with us and is it basic it's the same
process<00:04:18.940> really<00:04:19.570> it's<00:04:20.230> pretty<00:04:20.470> much<00:04:20.620> same

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
process really it's pretty much same

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.010 
process really it's pretty much same
process<00:04:21.670> fertility<00:04:21.970> is<00:04:22.480> different<00:04:22.870> on<00:04:22.990> some

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
process fertility is different on some

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.240 
process fertility is different on some
than<00:04:23.440> others<00:04:23.530> they<00:04:23.890> need<00:04:23.920> different

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
than others they need different

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.310 
than others they need different
nutrients<00:04:24.850> to<00:04:24.970> grow<00:04:25.060> and<00:04:25.450> some<00:04:25.750> are<00:04:25.870> longer

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
nutrients to grow and some are longer

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.620 
nutrients to grow and some are longer
season<00:04:26.530> and<00:04:26.800> shorter<00:04:27.100> season<00:04:27.460> but<00:04:27.640> but<00:04:28.390> the

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
season and shorter season but but the

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.540 
season and shorter season but but the
process<00:04:29.500> is<00:04:29.620> pretty<00:04:29.650> much<00:04:29.890> the<00:04:30.040> same<00:04:30.340> you

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
process is pretty much the same you

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.950 
process is pretty much the same you
plant<00:04:30.820> seed<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.300> you<00:04:31.360> attend<00:04:31.630> to<00:04:31.750> them<00:04:31.930> and

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
plant seed and you attend to them and

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.260 
plant seed and you attend to them and
