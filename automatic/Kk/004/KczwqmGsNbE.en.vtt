00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 but 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:17.460
 and hello everyone , tony today we are 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.170
 keep on browsing interesting fashions 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.320
 whom we will meet with a unique 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.650
 modification which will allow us 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:30.310
 change the time yes we can slow down 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.760
 or accelerate ours in general, that's all 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.739
 pretty epic looks cool 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:39.940
 pretty laid out so neatly chest 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:44.950
 in general, this is our standard remote is 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:48.940
 we have servants so this is our own from 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.550
 this slowdown and the slowdown is stronger 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.840
 memory serves of course yes it is 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:01:06.329
 slowing it down with us speeding it up with us 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:09.119
 matrix yes in general we cut down our and mod 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:12.670
 repeat this idiot 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.450
 trying to dodge like that 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.970
 way and our task is to not have us 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.970
 hit 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.970
 we will approach 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.570
 kill 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:43.500
 Misha so here it is 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.390
 and from this standard of these 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:52.770
 standard hours of beauty the rest everything 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:56.220
 Watches have been here such here there 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.380
 overall it doesn't matter that the next one is declining 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:06.960
 saved yes it gives numerical huge 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:11.239
 here's the speed we can push 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.239
 just with the speed of light all absolutely 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.820
 Dana comes to us which gives us 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.780
 Here, too, the slowdown of this but it is not 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.330
 dinner matrix 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:41.330
 pokes pretty too slow and 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:47.100
 slowing down is something like a matrix and 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:52.800
 everything looks very cool in general yes 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:56.000
