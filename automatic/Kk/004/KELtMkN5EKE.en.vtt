00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.490
 box of sardines all that is more 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:19.590
 basic in survival condition will be able to 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.590
 turn into an oil lamp 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.140
 good well then I broke the crust 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.400
 I will eat my little sardines and 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:33.040
 now i'm going to use my opinel 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.790
 first prize special garden more 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.730
 is that the blade 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.339
 this block very important for what is going 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.129
 to follow 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:42.790
 we will try to make a hole here for 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.870
 pass the wick 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.870
 if it works 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:07.140
 that's with an ordinary cotton cloth 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.240
 preference makes a wick 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.400
 I take the scissors now that can 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.580
 to make with a knife his tax of 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.580
 things are enough 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.579
 but we're going back to the box 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.100
 sardines will need him but qd and 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.710
 oil to the end otherwise it lights up 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:40.369
 Rappaz needs a cloth to wipe 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:43.819
 but obviously after then it's not 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:47.869
 very easy to fit healthy but it gets 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:50.299
 done I'm not going to make a movie of a 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:58.689
 half an hour on it can shoot 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:58.689
 after on the other side trotting 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.060
 so the wick soaks well in the oil 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.930
 and she stands out on the other side 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.760
 now it's time for truth 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:21.170
 does it work is that 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:26.590
 not walk and a little cute step this 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.590
 little loupiote pas cher 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.040
 and you noticed that there is even a 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.540
 small handle at the top inside this 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.230
 risk of feeling the frying for sure 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.610
 but outside in a tent and in 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.170
 difficult conditions we are well 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.770
 happy to find a little loupiote 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:53.100
 which can also warm up a little bit 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.660
 and at least enlightened in any case it can 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.489
 even maybe heat some 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.840
 thing to see 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:03.140
 do not be in a hurry maybe that's it 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.140
 will be everything 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.470
 and that's the risk of burning during 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.400
 a lot of hours do not forget to go see 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.460
 our website 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.630
 the foxes glass is full of ideas 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.870
 like that in a lot of things actually 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.870
 see you soon 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:39.500
 a small bonus 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:40.970
 he improvised a small stove then 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.300
 it's not to cook a kilo of 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.000
 pasta 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:48.770
 but good for a little coffee it was boiling 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.540
 just now that you finally have its 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.520
 limits to boil with a lid 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.090
 but it takes a little time but you 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.739
 let's say for a little coffee it's okay 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.510
 make 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.880
 nothing but oil from a box of 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.430
 sardines with fruits and vegetables I am 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.340
 past I'm not encouraged by 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:12.170
 Constable I perceived royalties 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:15.380
 now if flying I refuse good now 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:20.329
 improvised ray show with them nothing of the 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:23.270
 all finally it's been twenty minutes 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.169
 that it turns and I am very far 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.900
 to have finished 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.490
 the oil of the box look how much 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.760
 hours it can work but in my opinion 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:40.940
 at least four hours I will try 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:44.060
 to go all the way is funny and 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:48.560
 Well, it's been 3 hours since that 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:51.100
 runs continuously of course and he 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.479
 I still have a lot of oil 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.610
 I remember that I did not add 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.830
 oil is the oil of my box 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.690
 original sardines 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.370
 and for information it does not smell like 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.350
 frying it does not smell sardine 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:07.039
 I thought it was going well but 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:12.039
 no it does not smell so it's perfect 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:14.720
 we will wait until the end my 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:17.870
 4:39 4:40 we will say 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.419
 and the flame and starts a little to 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.890
 decrease so it's going to be difficult 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:26.389
 to reach the 5 hours 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:29.139
 but it's already a lot to follow for 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:29.139
 another experience
