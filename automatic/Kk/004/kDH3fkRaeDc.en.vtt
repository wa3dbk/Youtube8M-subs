00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 ladies and gentlemen of this world and not 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.049
 of the other welcome to another dossier of 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.269
 art survival and board is about 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.280
 spinosaurus the only one capable of 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.500
 face the tyrant of the species 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.320
 spinosaurus to which your period links 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.199
 cretaceous carnivore and territorial 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.330
 temperament its modus operandi and its mode 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.160
 which it puts wild among the few 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.130
 carnivores on the island that can 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.760
 match the tyrannosaurus in size 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.279
 the spinosaurus does not fit exactly 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.230
 with its ferocity of the spinosaurus with its 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.570
 four legs and the big candle that has 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.660
 his back is pretty fast on the ground 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.879
 and incredibly fast in the water this 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.950
 from here I will explain to my 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.500
 way changing a bit what is 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.239
 written so that you understand insuring 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.640
 the fact that the spine is more 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.770
 homely in the water than in any 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.680
 another place while the creature is 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.170
 sociable is to say territorial near the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.559
 water begins to be more docile 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.440
 when I'm further from the eye in a 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.350
 I could only escape from him 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.130
 for getting enough 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.860
 away from your lake home to make it 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.080
 simply so that you simply lose 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.760
 interest in me summarizing that as 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.210
 you within your territory are going to 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:25.230
 pursue yes or yes until such is the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.930
 what is your home or affection zones is 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.210
 territorially you are in my place 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.610
 I do not like you bust is that so 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.640
 it sounds neighborhood 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.250
 it is a apex apex carnivore is the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.470
 incredibly rounded crest more 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.690
 fast than a tyrannosaurus in the water and 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.790
 able to travel by land unlike 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.010
 of a megalodon is to say that as best 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.160
 gift but on land and bigger than a 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.010
 carnotaurus on it is an all-rounder 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.780
 being versatile without equal for the 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.650
 hunters who wish to have a mount 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:02.729
 well rounded that can be this can 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:06.119
 be a great option in an ideal option 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.800
 if you can acquire it clearly, this is not 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.170
 everything if you have any comments something that 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.420
 add something to offer something to contribute 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.280
 leave it down in comments is like a 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.410
 forum also invited you to come into my 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.150
 channel you know me is that you humor 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.560
 and nothing we see in the next video 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.560
 even the boys and girls
