00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
know like about a year now and I

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.790 
know like about a year now and I
absolutely<00:00:43.000> love<00:00:43.510> it<00:00:43.540> as<00:00:43.900> more<00:00:44.110> of<00:00:44.170> a<00:00:44.410> gel

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
absolutely love it as more of a gel

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.090 
absolutely love it as more of a gel
first<00:00:45.610> as<00:00:45.879> the<00:00:46.120> NARS<00:00:46.570> is<00:00:46.989> definitely<00:00:47.589> more<00:00:47.890> up

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
first as the NARS is definitely more up

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.250 
first as the NARS is definitely more up
a<00:00:48.309> lotion<00:00:48.790> based<00:00:49.269> which<00:00:49.660> I<00:00:49.809> think<00:00:50.019> I<00:00:50.110> like

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
a lotion based which I think I like

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.170 
a lotion based which I think I like
better<00:00:50.470> than<00:00:50.620> the<00:00:51.010> gel<00:00:51.220> feeling<00:00:51.699> when<00:00:51.940> I<00:00:51.970> get<00:00:52.150> a

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
better than the gel feeling when I get a

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.880 
better than the gel feeling when I get a
shower<00:00:52.540> i'll<00:00:52.869> go<00:00:53.049> ahead<00:00:53.080> and<00:00:53.229> put<00:00:53.409> on<00:00:53.470> a<00:00:53.559> primer

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
shower i'll go ahead and put on a primer

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.399 
shower i'll go ahead and put on a primer
and<00:00:54.540> the<00:00:55.540> only<00:00:55.659> thing<00:00:55.720> with<00:00:55.900> this<00:00:56.019> one<00:00:56.260> is

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
and the only thing with this one is

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:59.700 
and the only thing with this one is
setting<00:00:56.799> I<00:00:56.979> just<00:00:57.580> feel<00:00:57.760> kind<00:00:58.180> of<00:00:58.589> it's<00:00:59.589> a

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
setting I just feel kind of it's a

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.930 
setting I just feel kind of it's a
little<00:00:59.799> uncomfortable<00:01:00.190> at<00:01:00.519> first<00:01:00.610> because

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
little uncomfortable at first because

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.939 
little uncomfortable at first because
you<00:01:01.119> have<00:01:01.239> to<00:01:01.360> wait<00:01:01.510> about<00:01:01.690> five<00:01:02.140> to<00:01:02.739> ten

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
you have to wait about five to ten

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.560 
you have to wait about five to ten
minutes<00:01:02.979> for<00:01:03.430> it<00:01:03.489> to<00:01:03.580> really<00:01:03.760> like<00:01:04.059> absorb

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
minutes for it to really like absorb

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.859 
minutes for it to really like absorb
into<00:01:04.809> your<00:01:04.989> skin<00:01:05.610> versus<00:01:06.610> with<00:01:06.939> the<00:01:07.090> Stars<00:01:07.510> one

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
into your skin versus with the Stars one

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.039 
into your skin versus with the Stars one
it's<00:01:08.500> more<00:01:08.860> of<00:01:09.040> a<00:01:09.189> lotion<00:01:09.460> base<00:01:09.880> so<00:01:10.570> it<00:01:10.869> absorbs

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
it's more of a lotion base so it absorbs

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.010 
it's more of a lotion base so it absorbs
probably<00:01:11.740> like<00:01:11.890> in<00:01:12.159> two<00:01:12.939> minutes<00:01:13.270> versus<00:01:13.780> you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
probably like in two minutes versus you

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.719 
probably like in two minutes versus you
having<00:01:14.290> to<00:01:14.350> wait<00:01:14.500> like<00:01:14.619> five<00:01:14.830> to<00:01:15.010> ten<00:01:15.220> so<00:01:15.520> it's

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
having to wait like five to ten so it's

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.179 
having to wait like five to ten so it's
definitely<00:01:16.090> have<00:01:16.930> a<00:01:16.960> better<00:01:17.530> feeling<00:01:17.770> with<00:01:18.040> it

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
definitely have a better feeling with it

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.130 
definitely have a better feeling with it
as<00:01:18.369> far<00:01:18.430> as<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.759> lasting<00:01:19.240> power<00:01:19.270> between

went with the NARS this time I have
never<00:02:04.720> tried<00:02:05.049> this<00:02:05.200> I<00:02:05.350> have<00:02:05.530> actually<00:02:06.250> never

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
never tried this I have actually never

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.669 
never tried this I have actually never
heard<00:02:06.640> anything<00:02:06.940> about<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.540> NARS<00:02:07.720> before<00:02:08.170> but

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
heard anything about the NARS before but

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:09.809 
heard anything about the NARS before but
I<00:02:08.709> really<00:02:09.159> wanted<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.489> try<00:02:09.789> something

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
I really wanted to try something

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.390 
I really wanted to try something
different<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.690> break<00:02:11.319> outside<00:02:11.650> my<00:02:11.799> box<00:02:12.010> and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
different and break outside my box and

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.309 
different and break outside my box and
so<00:02:12.849> I<00:02:12.879> can<00:02:13.269> see<00:02:13.540> what<00:02:13.659> else<00:02:13.780> is<00:02:13.930> out<00:02:14.049> there<00:02:14.110> and

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
so I can see what else is out there and

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.140 
so I can see what else is out there and
have<00:02:14.860> something<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.220> compare<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.879> I'm<00:02:15.970> so

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
have something to compare it and I'm so

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.550 
have something to compare it and I'm so
glad<00:02:16.269> that<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.510> did<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:17.019> was<00:02:17.409> all<00:02:17.530> nervous

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
glad that I did I was all nervous

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.500 
glad that I did I was all nervous
because<00:02:18.099> it's<00:02:18.459> expensive<00:02:18.549> to<00:02:19.060> try<00:02:19.299> something

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
because it's expensive to try something

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.080 
because it's expensive to try something
new<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.170> what<00:02:20.650> if<00:02:20.739> you<00:02:20.769> hate<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.159> I'm<00:02:21.430> so<00:02:21.849> far

another good thing which you have to

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.309 
another good thing which you have to
think<00:02:26.739> about<00:02:26.860> is<00:02:27.359> which<00:02:28.359> one<00:02:28.569> gives<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:28.959> more
