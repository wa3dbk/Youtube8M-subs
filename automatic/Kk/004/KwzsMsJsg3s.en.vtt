00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.410 
are a great thing to add to your menus I
took<00:01:41.250> me<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> second<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.820> get<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.119> out<00:01:42.240> there

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
took me a second to get that out there

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.359 
took me a second to get that out there
and<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:43.049> also<00:01:43.229> ink<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.619> I've<00:01:43.740> been<00:01:43.890> black<00:01:44.070> ink

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
and I also ink that I've been black ink

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.950 
and I also ink that I've been black ink
and<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.700> added<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> menu<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
and I added that to the menu in the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.090 
and I added that to the menu in the
corner<00:01:46.259> because<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.619> thought<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> corner

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
corner because I thought the corner

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.480 
corner because I thought the corner
looked<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.430> little<00:01:47.670> bit<00:01:47.820> blank<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.079> empty<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.460> I

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
looked a little bit blank and empty so I

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.649 
looked a little bit blank and empty so I
thought<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.820> would<00:01:50.939> be<00:01:50.970> an<00:01:51.149> excellent<00:01:51.420> touch

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
thought that would be an excellent touch

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.530 
thought that would be an excellent touch
I<00:01:52.250> cleaned<00:01:53.250> off<00:01:53.369> my<00:01:53.490> stamp<00:01:53.759> using<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.119> baby<00:01:54.270> wipe

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
I cleaned off my stamp using a baby wipe

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.740 
I cleaned off my stamp using a baby wipe
and<00:01:54.780> then<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.740> attached<00:01:56.369> some<00:01:56.759> cardstock<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.509> in

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
and then I attached some cardstock so in

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.420 
and then I attached some cardstock so in
for<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.320> wedding<00:01:58.530> invitations<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.070> had<00:01:59.219> used

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
for the wedding invitations I had used

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.550 
for the wedding invitations I had used
this<00:01:59.549> orange<00:01:59.909> color<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.390> gray<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.840> course<00:02:01.380> you

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
this orange color and gray of course you

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.749 
this orange color and gray of course you
can<00:02:01.680> customize<00:02:01.860> these<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.340> your<00:02:02.640> wedding

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
can customize these to your wedding

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.550 
can customize these to your wedding
colors<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.509> use<00:02:03.659> really<00:02:03.840> any<00:02:03.899> color<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.439> want

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
colors and use really any color you want

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.469 
colors and use really any color you want
so<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.219> did<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> double<00:02:05.610> backing<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.390> it

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
so I did a double backing so that it

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.819 
so I did a double backing so that it
would<00:02:06.570> be<00:02:06.659> extra<00:02:06.960> thick<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.469> could<00:02:07.590> stand

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
would be extra thick and it could stand

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.710 
would be extra thick and it could stand
up<00:02:07.950> on<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.160> table<00:02:08.429> by<00:02:08.550> itself<00:02:08.819> leaning<00:02:09.599> up

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
up on the table by itself leaning up

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.660 
up on the table by itself leaning up
against<00:02:10.050> obviously<00:02:10.440> something<00:02:10.770> or<00:02:11.220> laying<00:02:11.520> on

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
against obviously something or laying on

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.400 
against obviously something or laying on
the<00:02:11.760> table<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.239> if<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.629> got<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.780> little<00:02:13.110> bit

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
the table and if it got a little bit

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.570 
the table and if it got a little bit
or<00:02:13.500> anything<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.890> wouldn't<00:02:14.100> really<00:02:14.220> ruin

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
or anything it wouldn't really ruin

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.420 
or anything it wouldn't really ruin
because<00:02:14.910> it's<00:02:15.090> quite<00:02:15.270> thick<00:02:16.160> so<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.220> just

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
because it's quite thick so I just

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.340 
because it's quite thick so I just
trimmed<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.790> out<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.150> left<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.930> little<00:02:19.020> bit<00:02:19.200> of

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
trimmed it out and left a little bit of

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.530 
trimmed it out and left a little bit of
spice<00:02:19.590> on<00:02:19.830> each<00:02:19.980> side<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.430> mounted<00:02:21.210> that<00:02:21.270> again

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
spice on each side I mounted that again

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.050 
spice on each side I mounted that again
onto<00:02:21.840> some<00:02:21.960> great<00:02:22.170> cardstock<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.880> then<00:02:23.880> did

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
onto some great cardstock and then did

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.400 
onto some great cardstock and then did
this<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.390> same<00:02:24.600> thing<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:25.020> give<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.260> nice

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
this the same thing to give it a nice

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.670 
this the same thing to give it a nice
frame<00:02:29.600> you<00:02:30.600> can<00:02:30.720> create<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.020> boat<00:02:31.230> depending<00:02:31.590> on

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
frame you can create a boat depending on
