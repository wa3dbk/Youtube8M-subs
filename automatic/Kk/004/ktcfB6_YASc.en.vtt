00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
all around it I really like the way this

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.150 
all around it I really like the way this
one<00:00:22.080> turned<00:00:22.380> out<00:00:22.699> um<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:24.019> used<00:00:25.019> pretty<00:00:25.560> much<00:00:25.650> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
one turned out um I used pretty much the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.939 
one turned out um I used pretty much the
same<00:00:26.430> send<00:00:26.849> handles<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.449> I've<00:00:28.199> used<00:00:28.590> quite<00:00:28.859> a

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
same send handles that I've used quite a

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.780 
same send handles that I've used quite a
bit<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.689> didn't<00:00:30.689> really<00:00:30.990> spend<00:00:31.289> too<00:00:31.529> much<00:00:31.710> time

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
me I am NOT a fan of science and I

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.729 
me I am NOT a fan of science and I
dropped<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.180> my<00:01:00.270> junior<00:01:01.170> year<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.559> high

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.830 
dropped it in my junior year of high
school<00:01:01.859> cuz<00:01:02.760> we<00:01:02.910> didn't<00:01:03.149> have<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.420> take<00:01:03.660> it

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
school cuz we didn't have to take it

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.509 
school cuz we didn't have to take it
anymore<00:01:04.080> if<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.379> didn't<00:01:04.769> want<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.369> I

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
so I got a new tripod if you can tell

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.230 
so I got a new tripod if you can tell
the<00:01:39.930> angle<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> little<00:01:40.829> bit<00:01:41.159> different<00:01:41.579> on

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
the angle is a little bit different on

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.810 
the angle is a little bit different on
the<00:01:42.479> last<00:01:42.720> two<00:01:43.020> videos<00:01:43.399> then<00:01:44.399> they<00:01:44.759> were

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
the last two videos then they were

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.630 
the last two videos then they were
before<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.329> disappeared<00:01:46.290> for<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.590> month<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:47.460> is

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
before I disappeared for a month that is

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.300 
before I disappeared for a month that is
because<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:48.030> got<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.210> taller<00:01:48.509> tripod

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
because I got a taller tripod

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.530 
because I got a taller tripod
unfortunately<00:01:50.310> I'm<00:01:50.490> not<00:01:50.520> really<00:01:50.939> used<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.450> it

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
unfortunately I'm not really used to it

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.010 
unfortunately I'm not really used to it
yet

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
yet

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.010 
yet
so<00:01:52.200> I'm<00:01:53.119> noticing<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.689> video

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
so I'm noticing in this video

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.740 
so I'm noticing in this video
particularly<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.189> my<00:01:56.969> hand<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.390> getting<00:01:57.540> in

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
particularly that my hand is getting in

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.630 
particularly that my hand is getting in
the<00:01:57.869> way<00:01:57.899> quite<00:01:58.350> often<00:01:58.560> when<00:01:58.979> I'm<00:01:59.100> drawing<00:01:59.399> I'm

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
the way quite often when I'm drawing I'm

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.560 
the way quite often when I'm drawing I'm
sorry<00:01:59.880> about<00:02:00.030> that

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
sorry about that

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.709 
sorry about that
but<00:02:01.079> now<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.469> am<00:02:01.649> aware<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.399> will<00:02:02.719> be

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
but now that I am aware of it I will be

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.109 
but now that I am aware of it I will be
conscious<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.560> my<00:02:05.009> next<00:02:05.399> drawing<00:02:05.729> video

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
conscious of it in my next drawing video

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.650 
conscious of it in my next drawing video
I<00:02:06.619> also<00:02:07.619> got<00:02:07.920> some<00:02:08.190> brighter<00:02:08.759> lights<00:02:09.149> for

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
I also got some brighter lights for

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.350 
I also got some brighter lights for
above<00:02:10.140> me<00:02:10.440> which<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.920> think<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.400> quality<00:02:12.090> of

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
above me which I think the quality of

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.840 
above me which I think the quality of
the<00:02:12.540> draw

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
the draw

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.340 
the draw
is<00:02:13.090> coming<00:02:13.360> out<00:02:13.540> much<00:02:13.720> better<00:02:13.930> on<00:02:14.230> these

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
is coming out much better on these

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.490 
is coming out much better on these

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
like that I think that's what it was

like that I think that's what it was
called<00:02:56.740> and<00:02:57.270> she<00:02:58.270> was<00:02:58.420> disappointed<00:02:59.110> with<00:02:59.260> the

size of the Hope Diamond which I was too
it's<00:03:01.900> kind<00:03:02.110> of<00:03:02.170> funny<00:03:02.380> that<00:03:02.470> she<00:03:02.830> was

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
it's kind of funny that she was
