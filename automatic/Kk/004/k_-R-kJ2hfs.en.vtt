00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.890
 another video 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.509
 I recently wanted to install windows 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.849
 but quickly I was on the floor of the 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.950
 facts brought back for that 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.160
 existing drive was typically broken 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.780
 what now extra to buy a new drive 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.670
 just for a simple windows 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.720
 installation and basically i need 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.609
 never afterwards 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.769
 or maybe there are others 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.449
 possibilities to install windows 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.949
 yes, of course , why not? 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.949
 such as the installation 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.689
 by means of usb-stick how does one work 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.610
 installation using usb-stick and 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.680
 which prerequisites are fulfilled 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.190
 I have to show you that in this 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.790
 Video 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.790
 let's go 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.570
 there are for the windows installation 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.030
 firstly, about the possibilities 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.220
 second, classic dvd drive over 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.410
 thirdly, insert a usb stick over it 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.489
 Network option is number one 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.380
 as long as feasible 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.540
 if the drive is present and 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.610
 option number two works 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.350
 requires a few basics and is in 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.729
 the best way around windows 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.950
 to install and that with the 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.110
 least effort possible number 3 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.670
 once needed a network as well 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.470
 a file server on which the 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.850
 Installation medium is located and 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.950
 requires a certain amount of 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.660
 Knowledge number three is so for the 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.790
 classic user of just windows 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.560
 want to install rather suboptimal 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.270
 the windows installation via usb 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.550
 stick always works 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.590
 if the pc is not too old 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.840
 the oldest pc ever on this kind and 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.530
 wisely equipped with windows 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.670
 an acer finished pc from 2009 with 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.110
 intel core 2 duo e7400 said that at 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.360
 we must offer the possibility of 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.490
 then to boot external media an even 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.869
 important note all content such as 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.479
 for example, the installation media 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.060
 programs or the usb stick are 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.920
 the link below in the infobox would be 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.750
 So also clarified but what will happen now 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.770
 the provision of the 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.610
 Installation medium on a usb stick 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.130
 needed 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.860
 first, logically, a usb stick with 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.569
 at least 4 gb of storage capacity i 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.990
 recommend here with the trans jetflash 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:07.700
 700 usb 3.0 stick this one guarantees 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.310
 high transfer rate and is real 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.890
 cheap second, a windows iso and 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.599
 Third, a pack is 1 windows iso 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.790
 basically nothing more than one 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.980
 Install dvd just that these too 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.720
 a container was summarized the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.480
 corresponding iso for example for 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.580
 windows 7 81 or even 10 you can 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.560
 free and legal from the manufacturer in 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.599
 Download microsoft for this case 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.840
 the iso thus contains a full version 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.550
 without license or activation code 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.319
 means the code you have to separately 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.240
 acquire a link for the 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.220
 download of windows 7 is in the video 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.550
 description same applies to windows 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.050
 10 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.940
 but here is the hint that it is 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.380
 doing the technical preview as soon as possible 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.730
 the final version of windows 10 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.830
 There is also available for this 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.560
 of course, links in below 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.540
 the infobox windows 8 1 asus were up 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.860
 recently in a legal way hardly 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.880
 not to find 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.470
 Microsoft only has 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.020
 a tool provided with the man 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.790
 can download his own 81 isos 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.430
 For this you will be the first language 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.560
 the version and architecture loads 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.270
 then the option iso file and the 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.950
 location and then the 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.330
 downloaded iso file 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.040
 as already mentioned you need 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.180
 additionally a course such 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.320
 example in Rome 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.300
 this program you have to 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.530
 download and of course install 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.050
 do you have the mentioned requirements 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.820
 created it can start first 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.010
 you connect the usb stick with yours 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.110
 computer and formatted this the stick 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.360
 must be formatted in the ntfs file system 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.160
 Be careful of all the files 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.060
 erased on the usb-stick 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.460
 then you can do the 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.050
 downloaded iso file with the swing 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.000
 Era open for example with a 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.770
 Double-click or open the functions 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.390
 sometimes winrar you see this now 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.130
 folder structure this would have to now 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.720
 unpack with the unpack function 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.670
 After I recommend you at this point 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.020
 as a hard drive to choose here 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.030
 take this step as fast as possible 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.560
 finish is the iso file unpacked 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.990
 you open the folder where you the whole 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.300
 have unpacked the complete contents with 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.670
 Control and copy everything in the trunk 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.350
 directory of the usb stick parallel to it 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.940
 Of course you can also get the latest ones 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.710
 drivers for their hardware on the 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.540
 usb-stick preferably copy 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.830
 of course in a subfolder of in 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.210
 None in any way 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.920
 connection stands to the windows 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.350
 installation then you can already 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.390
 take the usb stick to your pc 's you 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.670
 then wanted to set up the wifi 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.020
 or call us as the first boat 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.000
 medium the stick sake 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.739
 save settings and last but not 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.570
 Least restart the pc afterwards 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.220
 already starts the windows installer 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.440
 a detailed guide for the 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.150
 optimal setup of a pcs is now
