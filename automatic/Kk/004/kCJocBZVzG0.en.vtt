actually kind of the highlight tone I'm
going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.930> put<00:01:10.080> shadows<00:01:10.530> within<00:01:10.740> that

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
going to put shadows within that

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.580 
going to put shadows within that
sometimes<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> more<00:01:12.750> overcast<00:01:13.080> day

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.260 
sometimes you have a more overcast day
where<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.860> have<00:01:14.040> more<00:01:14.250> shadows<00:01:14.760> than<00:01:15.000> white

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
where you have more shadows than white

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.609 
where you have more shadows than white
and<00:01:15.509> that's<00:01:15.600> what<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:15.900> represents<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.560> is

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
and that's what this represents this is

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.109 
and that's what this represents this is
going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.009> more<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.369> shadows<00:01:17.909> I'm

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
going to be more of the shadows I'm

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.460 
going to be more of the shadows I'm
going<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.330> put<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.570> white<00:01:18.750> highlights<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.320> so

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
going to put the white highlights on so

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.100 
going to put the white highlights on so
I'm<00:01:19.530> doing<00:01:19.650> direct<00:01:20.189> opposite<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.869> light

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
I'm doing direct opposite this is light

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.749 
I'm doing direct opposite this is light
I'm<00:01:22.350> going<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.619> add<00:01:22.740> shadows<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
I'm going to add shadows this is the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.370 
I'm going to add shadows this is the
shadows<00:01:24.180> I'm<00:01:24.360> going<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.570> add<00:01:24.750> light<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.259> it's

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
shadows I'm going to add light so it's

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.690 
shadows I'm going to add light so it's
two<00:01:25.530> different<00:01:25.799> ways<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.040> doing<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.369> depending

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
two different ways of doing it depending

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.609 
two different ways of doing it depending
on<00:01:26.759> what<00:01:26.820> look<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.270> want<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.869> I'm<00:01:28.439> going<00:01:28.590> to

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
on what look you want and I'm going to

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.060 
on what look you want and I'm going to
take<00:01:28.770> ultramarine<00:01:29.430> blue<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.729> white<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
take ultramarine blue and white and

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.289 
take ultramarine blue and white and
again<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.189> could<00:01:32.310> flavor<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.210> a

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
again you could flavor that with just a

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.390 
again you could flavor that with just a
speck<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.810> red<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> lot<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.350> times<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.799> snow

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
speck of the red a lot of times the snow

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.219 
speck of the red a lot of times the snow
shadows<00:01:35.790> are<00:01:35.939> kind<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.240> almost<00:01:36.780> leaning<00:01:37.020> out<00:01:37.200> a

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229

the<00:01:39.840> brush<00:01:40.020> together<00:01:40.409> quite<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> bit<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.100> paint

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the brush together quite a bit of paint

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.289 
the brush together quite a bit of paint
chiseling<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.030> brush<00:01:42.270> right<00:01:42.479> up<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:44.299> be

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
chiseling that brush right up and be

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.389 
chiseling that brush right up and be
aware<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.570> snow<00:01:46.200> will<00:01:46.530> follow<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.130> lay<00:01:47.280> of

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
aware that snow will follow the lay of

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.800 
aware that snow will follow the lay of
the<00:01:47.460> land<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.000> can't<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.450> come<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.659> and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
the land so you can't just come in and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.389 
the land so you can't just come in and
put<00:01:48.990> shapes<00:01:49.350> randomly<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.250> to

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
put shapes randomly you have to

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.880 
put shapes randomly you have to
visualize<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.390> land<00:01:51.630> underneath<00:01:53.060> so<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.890> kind

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
visualize the land underneath so I kind

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.980 
visualize the land underneath so I kind
of<00:01:55.950> run<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> shadows<00:01:56.640> accordingly<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
of run the shadows accordingly with the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.770 
of run the shadows accordingly with the
shape<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.439> land<00:01:58.820> so<00:01:59.820> in<00:02:00.180> my<00:02:00.360> mind<00:02:00.630> right

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
shape of the land so in my mind right

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.030 
shape of the land so in my mind right
now<00:02:00.840> I'm<00:02:01.110> thinking<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.469> I've<00:02:01.649> got<00:02:01.799> some

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
now I'm thinking that I've got some

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.190 
now I'm thinking that I've got some
dished<00:02:02.250> out<00:02:02.369> land<00:02:02.670> like<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.060> meadow<00:02:03.299> kind<00:02:04.110> of

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
dished out land like in a meadow kind of

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.450 
dished out land like in a meadow kind of
scooped<00:02:04.469> out<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.799> middle<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.130> little<00:02:05.369> bit

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
scooped out in the middle a little bit

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.150 
scooped out in the middle a little bit
of<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.610> low<00:02:05.759> spot<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.619> I'm<00:02:07.619> just<00:02:07.890> trying<00:02:08.129> to

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
of a low spot and I'm just trying to

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.390 
of a low spot and I'm just trying to
indicate<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:09.170> undulating<00:02:10.170> snow<00:02:10.800> pattern<00:02:11.250> or

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
indicate the undulating snow pattern or

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.610 
indicate the undulating snow pattern or
shadow<00:02:11.700> patterns<00:02:12.150> little<00:02:12.900> Hills<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.319> gullies

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
shadow patterns little Hills and gullies

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.880 
shadow patterns little Hills and gullies
with

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
with

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.070 
with
in<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.100> snow<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:15.450> I'm<00:02:15.540> leaving<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.900> lot<00:02:16.020> of

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
in that snow so I'm leaving a lot of

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.800 
in that snow so I'm leaving a lot of
white<00:02:16.380> behind<00:02:17.300> now<00:02:18.300> what's<00:02:18.510> going<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.720> happen

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
white behind now what's going to happen

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.030 
white behind now what's going to happen
is<00:02:19.140> I'm<00:02:19.260> going<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.440> come<00:02:19.590> back<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.860> I'm<00:02:19.950> going

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
is I'm going to come back and I'm going

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.090 
is I'm going to come back and I'm going
to<00:02:20.100> soften<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.760> little<00:02:21.000> bit<00:02:24.860> so<00:02:25.860> I'm<00:02:25.980> going

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
to soften this a little bit so I'm going

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.620 
to soften this a little bit so I'm going
to<00:02:26.160> take<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:27.500> different<00:02:28.500> brush<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.630> could

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
to take a different brush I could

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.120 
to take a different brush I could
actually<00:02:30.900> wipe<00:02:31.200> this<00:02:31.380> one<00:02:31.530> I'll<00:02:31.650> just<00:02:31.770> take<00:02:32.100> a

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
actually wipe this one I'll just take a

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
actually wipe this one I'll just take a
clean<00:02:32.400> one<00:02:32.550> clean<00:02:33.420> fan<00:02:33.660> brush<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.850> idea

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
clean one clean fan brush and the idea

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.730 
clean one clean fan brush and the idea
is<00:02:36.270> I<00:02:36.420> just<00:02:36.480> want<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.840> soften<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.350> out<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.560> little

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
is I just want to soften it out a little

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.740 
is I just want to soften it out a little
bit<00:02:37.950> now<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.730> doesn't<00:02:39.120> look<00:02:39.270> like<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> whole

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
bit now that doesn't look like a whole

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.080 
bit now that doesn't look like a whole
lot<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:40.290> looks<00:02:40.470> like<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.620> lot<00:02:40.830> of<00:02:40.860> white<00:02:41.760> snow

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
lot that looks like a lot of white snow

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.790 
lot that looks like a lot of white snow
where<00:02:42.270> you've<00:02:42.390> had<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.570> really<00:02:43.050> bright<00:02:43.230> day<00:02:43.530> not

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
where you've had a really bright day not

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.449 
where you've had a really bright day not
a<00:02:43.830> lot<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.069> more<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.819> smoother<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:46.370> blanket<00:02:47.370> of

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
a lot of more of a smoother a blanket of

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.030 
a lot of more of a smoother a blanket of
snow<00:02:47.489> not<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.180> many<00:02:48.330> of<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.540> pockets<00:02:49.380> see<00:02:49.980> I

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
snow not so many of the pockets see I

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.800 
snow not so many of the pockets see I
can<00:02:50.220> actually<00:02:50.400> emphasize<00:02:50.730> that<00:02:51.239> make<00:02:51.510> some<00:02:51.690> of

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
can actually emphasize that make some of

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.229 
can actually emphasize that make some of
those<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.930> little<00:02:52.080> bigger<00:02:52.440> what<00:02:53.340> really<00:02:53.700> helps

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
those a little bigger what really helps

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.970 
those a little bigger what really helps
it<00:02:54.420> look<00:02:54.870> more<00:02:55.080> like<00:02:55.260> snow<00:02:55.470> now<00:02:55.620> you've<00:02:55.769> got<00:02:55.890> to

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
it look more like snow now you've got to

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.290 
it look more like snow now you've got to
put<00:02:56.100> this<00:02:56.190> within<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.610> context<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.239> a

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
put this within the context of a

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.000 
put this within the context of a
painting<00:02:57.630> too<00:02:57.810> obviously<00:02:58.230> you'd<00:02:58.410> have<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.620> tree

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
painting too obviously you'd have a tree

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.380 
painting too obviously you'd have a tree
line<00:02:59.190> or<00:02:59.370> something<00:02:59.670> out<00:02:59.790> here<00:02:59.910> beyond<00:03:00.269> the

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
line or something out here beyond the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.479 
line or something out here beyond the
metal<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:01.380> doesn't<00:03:01.680> make<00:03:01.800> much<00:03:01.980> sense<00:03:02.010> there

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
metal it doesn't make much sense there

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.970 
metal it doesn't make much sense there
right<00:03:02.670> now<00:03:02.850> at<00:03:02.970> this<00:03:03.150> point<00:03:03.480> but<00:03:04.170> once<00:03:04.860> you

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
right now at this point but once you

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.350 
right now at this point but once you
come<00:03:05.220> back<00:03:05.280> I'm<00:03:05.580> going<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.760> take<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:05.880> little<00:03:06.180> bit

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
come back I'm going to take a little bit

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.660 
come back I'm going to take a little bit
of<00:03:06.450> Van<00:03:06.600> Dyck<00:03:06.810> Brown<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:08.040> I'm<00:03:08.130> going<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.310> spike

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
of Van Dyck Brown and I'm going to spike

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.020 
of Van Dyck Brown and I'm going to spike
up<00:03:08.880> this<00:03:09.030> fan<00:03:09.330> brush<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:10.700> just<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.880> give<00:03:12.000> you

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
up this fan brush and just to give you

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.759 
up this fan brush and just to give you
the<00:03:12.209> idea<00:03:12.330> if<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.110> put<00:03:13.290> some<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:13.530> this<00:03:15.769> grass

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
the idea if you put some of this grass

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.350 
the idea if you put some of this grass
it's<00:03:17.100> peaking<00:03:17.430> up<00:03:17.550> through<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:17.970> snow<00:03:18.030> and

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
it's peaking up through the snow and

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.759 
it's peaking up through the snow and
obviously<00:03:18.780> if<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:18.989> snow<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.260> deep<00:03:19.470> enough<00:03:19.590> you

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
obviously if the snow is deep enough you

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.310 
obviously if the snow is deep enough you
won't<00:03:19.950> see<00:03:20.220> that<00:03:20.630> but<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:21.720> put<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.900> few<00:03:22.110> little

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
won't see that but you put a few little

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.979 
won't see that but you put a few little
touches<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:23.329> snow<00:03:24.329> in<00:03:24.510> there<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.750> like<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:24.930> said

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
touches of snow in there and like I said

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.600 
touches of snow in there and like I said
if<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.350> get<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.620> within<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.980> context<00:03:26.459> of<00:03:26.519> a

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
if you get it within the context of a

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.650 
if you get it within the context of a
painting<00:03:26.820> and<00:03:27.000> realize<00:03:27.299> that<00:03:27.480> you're<00:03:27.570> going

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
painting and realize that you're going

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.960 
painting and realize that you're going
to<00:03:27.720> have<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.870> tree<00:03:28.110> line<00:03:28.459> out<00:03:29.459> here<00:03:29.790> in<00:03:29.880> the

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
to have a tree line out here in the

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.210 
to have a tree line out here in the
distance<00:03:30.299> like<00:03:30.680> you're<00:03:31.680> looking<00:03:31.890> across<00:03:32.190> a

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
distance like you're looking across a

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.800 
distance like you're looking across a
snowy<00:03:32.640> meadow<00:03:32.910> so<00:03:33.120> yeah<00:03:33.209> that<00:03:33.480> makes<00:03:33.630> more

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
snowy meadow so yeah that makes more

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.390 
snowy meadow so yeah that makes more
sense<00:03:34.079> to<00:03:34.200> you<00:03:34.350> now<00:03:34.380> now<00:03:34.709> that<00:03:34.860> I<00:03:34.890> put<00:03:35.100> that<00:03:35.130> in

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
sense to you now now that I put that in

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.750 
sense to you now now that I put that in
there<00:03:36.320> but<00:03:37.320> that's<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.739> real<00:03:37.980> easy<00:03:38.250> way<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.549> do

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
there but that's a real easy way to do

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.430 
there but that's a real easy way to do
snow<00:03:39.090> if<00:03:39.239> you<00:03:39.329> want<00:03:39.540> predominantly<00:03:40.170> white

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
of a highlight day I guess I would say

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.240 
of a highlight day I guess I would say
now<00:03:48.180> down<00:03:48.870> on<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.140> bottom<00:03:49.620> I've<00:03:49.920> got<00:03:50.130> the

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
shadows already set in place so it's

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.900 
shadows already set in place so it's
going<00:03:52.709> to<00:03:52.769> give<00:03:52.920> you<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.040> totally<00:03:53.549> different

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
look you're going to have more shadows

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.830 
look you're going to have more shadows

lovely paint to work with I'm going to
take<00:04:10.530> this<00:04:10.739> and<00:04:11.690> chisel<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.780> brush<00:04:12.959> up<00:04:13.109> with<00:04:13.230> a

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
take this and chisel the brush up with a

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.460 
take this and chisel the brush up with a
lot<00:04:13.470> of<00:04:13.500> white<00:04:13.769> it's<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.579> same<00:04:14.820> idea<00:04:15.470> let's

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
lot of white it's the same idea let's

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.199 
lot of white it's the same idea let's
see<00:04:16.590> how<00:04:16.739> I'm<00:04:16.829> kind<00:04:17.130> of<00:04:17.579> scuffing<00:04:18.120> and

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
see how I'm kind of scuffing and

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.810 
see how I'm kind of scuffing and
depositing<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.260> highlights<00:04:19.680> but<00:04:20.549> it<00:04:20.640> gives

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
depositing the highlights but it gives

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.510 
depositing the highlights but it gives
you<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.000> totally<00:04:21.510> different<00:04:21.989> feel<00:04:22.620> now

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
you a totally different feel now

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.279 
you a totally different feel now
obviously<00:04:24.000> if<00:04:24.150> I<00:04:24.240> just<00:04:24.419> come<00:04:24.599> in<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:24.840> just<00:04:25.050> put

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
obviously if I just come in and just put

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.080 
obviously if I just come in and just put
white<00:04:25.560> lines<00:04:25.979> there<00:04:26.370> too<00:04:26.520> straight<00:04:26.849> too

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
white lines there too straight too

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.650 
white lines there too straight too
predictable

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
predictable

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.500 
predictable
actually<00:04:28.110> might<00:04:28.260> even<00:04:28.440> look<00:04:28.590> more<00:04:28.830> like<00:04:29.010> water

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
actually might even look more like water

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.030 
actually might even look more like water
so<00:04:30.510> I'm<00:04:30.900> kind<00:04:31.260> of<00:04:31.320> scuffing<00:04:31.860> it<00:04:32.750> and<00:04:33.860> again<00:04:34.860> all

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
so I'm kind of scuffing it and again all

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.920 
so I'm kind of scuffing it and again all
the<00:04:35.220> same<00:04:35.250> rules<00:04:35.670> apply<00:04:35.850> that<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.360> talked<00:04:36.690> about

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
the same rules apply that I talked about

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.690 
the same rules apply that I talked about
make<00:04:37.140> sure<00:04:37.170> you<00:04:37.560> kind<00:04:38.130> of<00:04:38.250> put<00:04:38.430> these<00:04:38.550> in

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
make sure you kind of put these in

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.660 
make sure you kind of put these in
randomly<00:04:39.680> no<00:04:40.680> rhyme<00:04:40.920> or<00:04:40.950> reason<00:04:41.130> to<00:04:41.550> them

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
randomly no rhyme or reason to them

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.970 
randomly no rhyme or reason to them
they're<00:04:41.820> just<00:04:41.850> snow<00:04:42.270> shadows<00:04:42.780> let's<00:04:43.740> see<00:04:43.890> I'm

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
they're just snow shadows let's see I'm

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.620 
they're just snow shadows let's see I'm
actually<00:04:44.190> putting<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.910> white<00:04:45.120> highlights<00:04:45.360> if

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
actually putting the white highlights if

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.120 
actually putting the white highlights if
you<00:04:45.720> want<00:04:45.900> to<00:04:45.990> say<00:04:46.350> that<00:04:46.500> you've<00:04:46.620> got<00:04:46.770> a<00:04:46.800> bigger

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
you want to say that you've got a bigger

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.540 
you want to say that you've got a bigger
hill<00:04:48.350> you<00:04:49.350> can<00:04:49.470> actually<00:04:49.680> outline<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.400> hill

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
hill you can actually outline the hill

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.910 
hill you can actually outline the hill
like<00:04:50.700> this<00:04:50.940> and<00:04:51.450> just<00:04:51.780> put<00:04:51.960> it<00:04:52.080> in<00:04:52.230> bigger<00:04:52.440> fade

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
like this and just put it in bigger fade

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.560 
like this and just put it in bigger fade
the<00:04:53.070> bottom<00:04:53.370> way<00:04:53.520> down<00:04:53.730> into<00:04:53.940> the<00:04:54.090> shadow<00:04:54.330> so

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
the bottom way down into the shadow so

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.230 
the bottom way down into the shadow so
you<00:04:54.630> get<00:04:54.750> that<00:04:54.870> a<00:04:54.930> little<00:04:55.020> bit<00:04:55.200> of<00:04:55.290> a<00:04:55.380> null

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
you get that a little bit of a null

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.300 
you get that a little bit of a null
setting<00:04:57.240> right<00:04:57.390> there<00:04:57.450> and<00:04:57.870> then<00:04:58.800> maybe

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
setting right there and then maybe

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.880 
setting right there and then maybe
perchance<00:04:59.970> if<00:05:00.300> there's<00:05:00.540> grass<00:05:01.500> or<00:05:01.800> whatever

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
perchance if there's grass or whatever
