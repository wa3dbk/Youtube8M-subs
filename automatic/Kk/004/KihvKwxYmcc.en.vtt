soft touch battery cover I certainly
don't<00:03:02.450> blame<00:03:02.569> you<00:03:02.900> as<00:03:03.049> it<00:03:03.650> is<00:03:03.799> unconventional

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
don't blame you as it is unconventional

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.180 
don't blame you as it is unconventional
and<00:03:05.150> it<00:03:05.420> looks<00:03:05.599> rather<00:03:05.810> odd<00:03:06.049> at<00:03:06.200> first<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.709> will

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
and it looks rather odd at first I will

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.130 
and it looks rather odd at first I will
say<00:03:07.370> this<00:03:07.549> though<00:03:07.790> during<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:08.750> last<00:03:08.870> couple

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
say this though during the last couple

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.410 
say this though during the last couple
of<00:03:09.290> days<00:03:09.530> I've<00:03:09.829> actually<00:03:10.519> found<00:03:10.970> that<00:03:11.209> it's

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
of days I've actually found that it's

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.449 
of days I've actually found that it's
starting<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.900> grow<00:03:12.109> on<00:03:12.140> me<00:03:12.319> there's<00:03:13.160> nothing

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
starting to grow on me there's nothing

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.190 
starting to grow on me there's nothing
out<00:03:13.549> there<00:03:13.579> that<00:03:13.730> looks<00:03:14.060> like<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.450> so<00:03:14.930> it's

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
out there that looks like it so it's

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.159 
out there that looks like it so it's
kind<00:03:15.440> of<00:03:15.560> an<00:03:15.680> eye<00:03:15.829> catcher<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:17.540> layer<00:03:17.750> design

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:18.169 
kind of an eye catcher the layer design

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.770 
kind of an eye catcher the layer design
helps<00:03:18.530> improve<00:03:18.889> grip<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.489> I<00:03:20.239> just<00:03:20.450> think<00:03:20.660> the

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
helps improve grip and I just think the

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.199 
helps improve grip and I just think the
look<00:03:20.989> of<00:03:21.200> it<00:03:21.319> fits<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.919> droid<00:03:22.250> title<00:03:22.760> nicely

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
look of it fits the droid title nicely

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.479 
look of it fits the droid title nicely
another<00:03:24.049> thing<00:03:24.260> I<00:03:24.349> noticed<00:03:24.739> is<00:03:24.829> that<00:03:24.919> it<00:03:25.310> gives

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
another thing I noticed is that it gives

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.900 
another thing I noticed is that it gives
the<00:03:25.639> speaker<00:03:26.150> some<00:03:26.359> room<00:03:26.569> to<00:03:26.599> breathe<00:03:27.579> so<00:03:28.579> when

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
the speaker some room to breathe so when

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.659 
the speaker some room to breathe so when
it's<00:03:29.060> laying<00:03:29.540> flat<00:03:29.900> on<00:03:29.959> a<00:03:30.169> surface<00:03:30.459> it's<00:03:31.459> not

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
it's laying flat on a surface it's not

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.270 
it's laying flat on a surface it's not
going<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:31.849> sound<00:03:32.060> as<00:03:32.239> muffled<00:03:32.780> as<00:03:32.959> it<00:03:33.889> probably

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
going to sound as muffled as it probably

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.140 
going to sound as muffled as it probably
would<00:03:34.459> otherwise<00:03:35.919> so<00:03:36.919> while<00:03:37.549> you<00:03:37.669> might<00:03:37.880> may

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
would otherwise so while you might may

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.780 
would otherwise so while you might may
not<00:03:38.329> like<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.660> design<00:03:39.019> right<00:03:39.319> now<00:03:39.790> perhaps

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
not like the design right now perhaps

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.940 
not like the design right now perhaps
after<00:03:40.970> some<00:03:41.299> time<00:03:41.510> passes<00:03:42.019> you'll<00:03:42.470> find<00:03:42.769> that

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
after some time passes you'll find that

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.479 
after some time passes you'll find that
it<00:03:43.099> starts<00:03:43.519> to<00:03:43.639> grow<00:03:44.359> on<00:03:44.510> you<00:03:45.310> one<00:03:46.310> thing<00:03:46.459> that

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
it starts to grow on you one thing that

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.309 
it starts to grow on you one thing that
does<00:03:46.790> concern<00:03:46.880> me<00:03:47.239> is<00:03:47.389> the<00:03:47.660> quality<00:03:47.930> of<00:03:48.169> the

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
does concern me is the quality of the

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.400 
does concern me is the quality of the
cover<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:49.190> feels<00:03:49.459> solid<00:03:49.940> while<00:03:50.200> attached<00:03:51.200> to

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
cover the feels solid while attached to

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.930 
cover the feels solid while attached to
the<00:03:51.530> rest<00:03:51.739> of<00:03:51.859> the<00:03:51.950> phone<00:03:52.160> as<00:03:52.370> it<00:03:52.790> doesn't

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
the rest of the phone as it doesn't

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.080 
the rest of the phone as it doesn't
really<00:03:53.150> Creek<00:03:53.540> or<00:03:53.810> bend<00:03:54.620> in<00:03:54.859> words<00:03:55.099> but<00:03:55.849> when

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
really Creek or bend in words but when

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.789 
really Creek or bend in words but when
you<00:03:56.180> remove<00:03:56.540> it<00:03:57.879> you<00:03:58.879> can<00:03:59.030> see<00:03:59.239> that<00:03:59.419> it's

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
you remove it you can see that it's

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:05.890 
you remove it you can see that it's
super<00:04:00.799> flimsy<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:04.030> extremely<00:04:05.030> bendable<00:04:05.480> I

super flimsy and extremely bendable I

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.199 
super flimsy and extremely bendable I
actually<00:04:06.859> feel<00:04:07.129> like<00:04:07.190> it's<00:04:07.459> going<00:04:07.609> to<00:04:07.669> snap<00:04:07.970> in

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
actually feel like it's going to snap in

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.960 
actually feel like it's going to snap in
half<00:04:08.359> right<00:04:08.599> now<00:04:08.780> of<00:04:08.989> course<00:04:09.709> battery<00:04:10.609> covers

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
half right now of course battery covers

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.789 
half right now of course battery covers
are<00:04:11.180> meant<00:04:11.480> to<00:04:11.660> stay<00:04:11.840> on<00:04:11.989> most<00:04:12.319> of<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.590> time

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
are meant to stay on most of the time

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.789 
are meant to stay on most of the time
and<00:04:13.099> most<00:04:13.970> of<00:04:14.150> you<00:04:14.239> aren't<00:04:14.480> going<00:04:14.780> to<00:04:14.900> twist

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
and most of you aren't going to twist

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.289 
and most of you aren't going to twist
and<00:04:16.039> torture<00:04:16.789> it<00:04:16.910> like<00:04:17.060> I'm<00:04:17.239> doing<00:04:17.479> right<00:04:17.510> now

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
and torture it like I'm doing right now

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.940 
and torture it like I'm doing right now
but<00:04:20.299> hopefully<00:04:20.599> still<00:04:21.140> stays<00:04:21.409> on<00:04:21.590> tightly

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
but hopefully still stays on tightly

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.690 
but hopefully still stays on tightly
over<00:04:22.099> time

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
over time

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.880 
over time
as<00:04:24.890> we<00:04:25.890> saw<00:04:26.070> during<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.670> unboxing<00:04:27.530> the<00:04:28.530> inside

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
as we saw during the unboxing the inside

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.070 
as we saw during the unboxing the inside
of<00:04:28.920> the<00:04:29.070> device<00:04:29.340> is<00:04:29.580> completely<00:04:30.120> red<00:04:30.300> it<00:04:30.870> kind

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
of the device is completely red it kind

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.930 
of the device is completely red it kind
of<00:04:31.140> reminds<00:04:31.380> me<00:04:31.500> of<00:04:31.590> an<00:04:31.770> expensive<00:04:32.130> sports<00:04:32.610> car

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
of reminds me of an expensive sports car

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.560 
of reminds me of an expensive sports car
and<00:04:33.350> I<00:04:34.350> can't<00:04:34.590> say<00:04:34.770> this<00:04:34.920> enough<00:04:34.980> but<00:04:35.250> I<00:04:35.790> really

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
and I can't say this enough but I really

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.150 
and I can't say this enough but I really
like<00:04:36.750> what<00:04:36.930> HTC<00:04:37.380> is<00:04:37.440> doing<00:04:37.740> with<00:04:37.890> some<00:04:38.070> of

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.870 
these devices I think it's a good thing
that<00:04:40.470> they're<00:04:40.740> adding<00:04:41.040> these<00:04:41.160> custom<00:04:41.580> colors

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880
