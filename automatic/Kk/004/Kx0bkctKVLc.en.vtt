so<00:00:07.720> everything<00:00:08.470> which<00:00:08.650> comes<00:00:08.920> into<00:00:09.340> our<00:00:09.370> mind

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:09.520 
so everything which comes into our mind

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.410 
so everything which comes into our mind
if<00:00:10.420> we<00:00:11.080> recognize<00:00:11.530> it<00:00:12.280> in<00:00:12.460> the<00:00:12.580> moment<00:00:13.059> that<00:00:13.270> it

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.420 
if we recognize it in the moment that it

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.830 
if we recognize it in the moment that it
arises<00:00:13.840> if<00:00:14.379> we<00:00:14.860> accept<00:00:15.520> it<00:00:15.820> we<00:00:16.480> can<00:00:16.660> then<00:00:16.810> just

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
arises if we accept it we can then just

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.849 
arises if we accept it we can then just
let<00:00:17.260> it<00:00:17.380> go<00:00:18.390> we<00:00:19.390> don't<00:00:19.600> have<00:00:19.750> to<00:00:20.020> hold<00:00:20.260> on<00:00:20.470> to<00:00:20.740> it

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:20.859 
let it go we don't have to hold on to it

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.849 
let it go we don't have to hold on to it
we<00:00:21.010> don't<00:00:21.160> have<00:00:21.279> to<00:00:21.400> give<00:00:21.640> it<00:00:21.760> energy<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:23.650> don't

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:23.859 
we don't have to give it energy we don't

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.660 
we don't have to give it energy we don't
have<00:00:24.009> to<00:00:24.130> be<00:00:24.250> swept<00:00:24.670> away<00:00:26.130> we<00:00:27.130> are<00:00:27.279> on<00:00:27.490> the

riverbank looking at the river flowing

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.800 
riverbank looking at the river flowing
we<00:00:30.490> are<00:00:30.609> not<00:00:30.820> right<00:00:31.119> in<00:00:31.150> the<00:00:31.419> middle<00:00:31.599> of<00:00:31.720> the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
we are not right in the middle of the

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:39.600 
we are not right in the middle of the
river<00:00:31.990> being<00:00:32.290> swept<00:00:32.619> along<00:00:38.070> we<00:00:39.070> can<00:00:39.100> all<00:00:39.399> do

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
river being swept along we can all do

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:46.369 
river being swept along we can all do
this<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.750> nature<00:00:44.079> of<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:44.559> mind<00:00:44.829> is<00:00:45.250> is

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
this the nature of the mind is is

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.510 
this the nature of the mind is is
naturally<00:00:47.379> knowing<00:00:49.469> without<00:00:50.469> that<00:00:50.890> we<00:00:51.280> would

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
naturally knowing without that we would

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:58.139 
naturally knowing without that we would
be<00:00:51.670> dead<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:56.260> all<00:00:56.559> we<00:00:56.769> have<00:00:56.980> to<00:00:57.010> do<00:00:57.370> is<00:00:57.850> go<00:00:58.120> back

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
be dead so all we have to do is go back

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.349 
be dead so all we have to do is go back
to<00:00:58.780> what<00:00:59.379> we<00:00:59.649> really<00:01:00.160> are<00:01:00.190> and<00:01:00.850> stop

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
to what we really are and stop

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.220 
to what we really are and stop
identifying<00:01:01.539> with<00:01:02.410> the<00:01:02.530> wrong<00:01:02.710> thing<00:01:04.230> there

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
identifying with the wrong thing there

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.730 
identifying with the wrong thing there
was<00:01:05.379> a<00:01:05.410> very<00:01:05.710> great<00:01:06.150> ty<00:01:07.150> forest<00:01:08.140> master<00:01:08.530> code

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
was a very great ty forest master code

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.770 
was a very great ty forest master code

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
the forest training under several

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.480 
the forest training under several
masters<00:01:24.990> at<00:01:25.990> some<00:01:26.560> point<00:01:26.860> she<00:01:27.130> came<00:01:27.340> to

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
masters at some point she came to

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.969 
masters at some point she came to
exactly<00:01:28.119> this<00:01:28.360> he<00:01:28.990> realized<00:01:29.439> that<00:01:29.680> basically

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
exactly this he realized that basically

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.399 
exactly this he realized that basically
the<00:01:30.909> mind<00:01:31.150> I<00:01:31.360> wish<00:01:31.570> I<00:01:31.750> had<00:01:31.990> I<00:01:32.140> should<00:01:32.320> have

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
the mind I wish I had I should have

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:33.990 
the mind I wish I had I should have
brought<00:01:32.560> it<00:01:32.710> with<00:01:32.740> me<00:01:32.890> he<00:01:33.579> puts<00:01:33.790> it<00:01:33.939> very

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
brought it with me he puts it very

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.840 
brought it with me he puts it very
succinctly<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:35.740> that<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.189> mind<00:01:36.460> basically

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
succinctly but that the mind basically

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.120 
succinctly but that the mind basically
is<00:01:37.450> that<00:01:37.659> which<00:01:37.869> is<00:01:38.049> known<00:01:38.290> and<00:01:38.619> that<00:01:38.890> which

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
is that which is known and that which

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.539 
is that which is known and that which
knows<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:39.939> the<00:01:40.810> whole<00:01:41.049> point<00:01:41.350> is<00:01:41.590> simply<00:01:42.100> to

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
knows and the whole point is simply to

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:49.050 
knows and the whole point is simply to
dwell<00:01:42.909> with<00:01:43.420> that<00:01:43.689> which<00:01:43.930> knows<00:01:48.060> start

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
dwell with that which knows start

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.090 
dwell with that which knows start
identifying<00:01:49.899> with<00:01:50.140> that<00:01:50.350> which<00:01:50.530> knows<00:01:50.860> and

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
identifying with that which knows and

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.319 
identifying with that which knows and
stop<00:01:51.759> identifying<00:01:51.939> with<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.869> known<00:01:54.329> that's

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
stop identifying with the known that's

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:01.170 
stop identifying with the known that's
all<00:01:55.570> it's<00:01:55.930> so<00:01:56.079> easy<00:02:00.000> really

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
all it's so easy really

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.300 
all it's so easy really

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
problems are solved if not 100 just by

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.550 
problems are solved if not 100 just by
doing<00:02:05.829> that

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.970 

but<00:02:11.560> we<00:02:11.709> don't<00:02:11.920> do<00:02:12.069> it<00:02:13.200> it's<00:02:14.200> interesting<00:02:14.650> that

not you know rainbow lights and trumpets
it's<00:03:06.819> very<00:03:07.180> simple<00:03:07.659> but<00:03:07.870> in<00:03:08.200> that<00:03:08.829> moment<00:03:09.219> just

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
it's very simple but in that moment just

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.170 
it's very simple but in that moment just
for<00:03:09.819> a<00:03:09.969> moment<00:03:10.359> everything<00:03:10.750> falls<00:03:11.169> apart<00:03:11.530> and

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
for a moment everything falls apart and

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.259 
for a moment everything falls apart and
there<00:03:13.180> is<00:03:13.329> just<00:03:13.510> that<00:03:13.750> moment<00:03:14.049> of<00:03:14.349> total<00:03:15.310> naked

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
awareness it's extremely simple it's so

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:21.990 
awareness it's extremely simple it's so
simple<00:03:20.049> that<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:20.709> can<00:03:20.859> miss<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.459> very<00:03:21.729> easily

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
simple that you can miss it very easily
