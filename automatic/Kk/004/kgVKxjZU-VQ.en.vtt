of emotion day to day but I'll get
pretty<00:02:42.660> pumped<00:02:42.960> you<00:02:43.440> know<00:02:43.560> when<00:02:43.770> I<00:02:43.800> win<00:02:44.070> a<00:02:44.370> lot

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
pretty pumped you know when I win a lot

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.510 
pretty pumped you know when I win a lot
of<00:02:44.790> people<00:02:45.150> say<00:02:45.510> how<00:02:45.770> they<00:02:46.770> can't<00:02:47.040> believe<00:02:47.280> how

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
of people say how they can't believe how

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.110 
of people say how they can't believe how
you<00:02:47.910> know<00:02:48.030> celebrate<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.930> win<00:02:49.170> or<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:50.730> know<00:02:50.850> no

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
you know celebrate a win or you know no

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.050 
you know celebrate a win or you know no
no<00:02:51.270> that's<00:02:51.570> I<00:02:51.990> guess<00:02:52.410> it's<00:02:52.590> just<00:02:53.060> adrenaline

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
no that's I guess it's just adrenaline

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.240 
no that's I guess it's just adrenaline
takes<00:02:54.570> over<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.350> sometimes<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.920> get<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.100> bit

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
takes over and I sometimes I get a bit

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.710 
takes over and I sometimes I get a bit
embarrassed<00:02:56.700> about<00:02:56.820> it<00:02:57.000> afterwards<00:02:57.570> it's

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
embarrassed about it afterwards it's

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.650 
embarrassed about it afterwards it's
like<00:02:58.430> people<00:02:59.430> must<00:02:59.730> think<00:02:59.820> I'm<00:03:00.090> an<00:03:00.210> idiot<00:03:00.270> you

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
like people must think I'm an idiot you

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.680 
like people must think I'm an idiot you
know<00:03:01.550> because<00:03:02.550> it's<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.150> bit<00:03:03.360> unlike

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
know because it's it is a bit unlike

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.020 
know because it's it is a bit unlike
maybe<00:03:03.900> but<00:03:04.080> it's<00:03:04.200> purely<00:03:04.950> just<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.550> know<00:03:05.670> just

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
maybe but it's purely just you know just

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.900 
maybe but it's purely just you know just
raw<00:03:06.209> emotion<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.010> maybe<00:03:08.010> it's<00:03:08.250> scary<00:03:08.550> to<00:03:08.730> some

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
raw emotion and maybe it's scary to some

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.870 
raw emotion and maybe it's scary to some
as<00:03:09.120> well<00:03:09.360> not<00:03:10.110> sure<00:03:10.380> but<00:03:10.430> it's<00:03:11.430> certainly<00:03:11.730> not

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
as well not sure but it's certainly not

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.940 
as well not sure but it's certainly not
my<00:03:12.120> um

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
my um

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:36.250 
my um
but<00:03:15.260> maybe<00:03:16.260> maybe<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:17.010> works

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.080 

everything<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.440> me<00:03:37.650> prior<00:03:38.490> to<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:38.700> race<00:03:38.850> was<00:03:39.030> a

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
everything to me prior to the race was a

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.520 
everything to me prior to the race was a
little<00:03:39.300> bit<00:03:39.420> confusing<00:03:39.870> as<00:03:40.110> far<00:03:40.320> as<00:03:40.440> the

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
little bit confusing as far as the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.940 
little bit confusing as far as the
course<00:03:40.770> went<00:03:41.070> I'd<00:03:41.820> assumed<00:03:42.320> that<00:03:43.320> it<00:03:43.560> was<00:03:43.710> the

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
course went I'd assumed that it was the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.940 
course went I'd assumed that it was the
first<00:03:44.250> some<00:03:45.150> can<00:03:45.420> once<00:03:45.900> one<00:03:46.140> can<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.680> board

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
first some can once one can to board

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
first some can once one can to board
cans<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.490> three<00:03:47.730> ski<00:03:48.540> cans<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.970> always

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
cans and three ski cans and always

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.760 
cans and three ski cans and always
thinking<00:03:51.270> that<00:03:51.330> that<00:03:51.570> read<00:03:51.810> middle<00:03:52.110> apex<00:03:52.530> was

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
thinking that that read middle apex was

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.280 
thinking that that read middle apex was
the<00:03:53.250> first<00:03:53.550> turning<00:03:54.000> marker<00:03:54.330> at<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.780> board<00:03:55.140> of

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
the first turning marker at the board of

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.980 
the first turning marker at the board of
a<00:03:55.380> ski<00:03:55.620> if<00:03:55.950> that<00:03:56.580> Lake<00:03:57.000> that<00:03:57.360> discipline<00:03:57.840> was

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
a ski if that Lake that discipline was

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.380 
a ski if that Lake that discipline was
first<00:03:59.030> unfortunately<00:04:00.030> I<00:04:00.060> didn't<00:04:00.240> go<00:04:00.300> around

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
first unfortunately I didn't go around

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.110 
first unfortunately I didn't go around
that<00:04:00.690> apex<00:04:01.110> and<00:04:02.010> it<00:04:02.130> was<00:04:02.220> literally<00:04:02.760> five

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
that apex and it was literally five

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.330 
that apex and it was literally five
meters<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.600> left<00:04:03.690> of<00:04:04.020> me<00:04:04.140> and

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
meters to the left of me and

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.490 
meters to the left of me and
it's<00:04:05.849> it's<00:04:06.450> quite<00:04:06.720> upsetting<00:04:06.870> but<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:07.379> know

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
it's it's quite upsetting but you know

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.869 
it's it's quite upsetting but you know
what<00:04:07.680> rules<00:04:07.890> are<00:04:08.069> rules

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
what rules are rules

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.880 
what rules are rules
I<00:04:08.910> completely<00:04:09.720> understand<00:04:10.290> their<00:04:10.440> decision

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
I completely understand their decision

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.890 
I completely understand their decision
and<00:04:11.099> and<00:04:11.819> I<00:04:11.940> just<00:04:12.209> gotta<00:04:12.360> weigh<00:04:12.480> this<00:04:12.599> one<00:04:12.780> on

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
and and I just gotta weigh this one on

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:48.559 
and and I just gotta weigh this one on
the<00:04:12.989> chin

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.879 

a<00:04:49.849> bit<00:04:50.849> of<00:04:50.939> a<00:04:50.969> wave<00:04:51.179> and<00:04:51.449> then<00:04:52.409> I<00:04:52.529> went<00:04:52.649> to<00:04:52.710> grab

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
a bit of a wave and then I went to grab
