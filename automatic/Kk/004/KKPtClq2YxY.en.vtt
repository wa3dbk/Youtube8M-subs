00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.840
 Very good techno ts are here again 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:07.750
 again with a video of photography 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.969
 but not of the photography course but a 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.249
 tutorial a help for you to 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.049
 that you can handle the camera from 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:16.119
 your smartphone in a simple way and 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.130
 useful with a couple of applications that 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.109
 we will teach and here we have everything 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.839
 willing we have as you see the camera 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:27.640
 our canon eos of 1100 and we have 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:29.439
 our smartphone a galaxy s3 the 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.219
 phone that everyone has and wants 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:35.649
 we have a cable on-the-go otg and we have 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.410
 a microusb cable so to connect with 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.820
 the on the go the camera and the smartphone 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.410
 let's go with it with our partner 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.649
 david that is that the controls like 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.649
 want 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.390
 but we're going to show you two 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.340
 applications as well david said 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.680
 in our mobile we will bring by 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.450
 here if you go best two application 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.829
 they are free and we are going to leave you 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.829
 description the name of them 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.980
 one is called the remote icon and the other 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.810
 it's called dsl dashboard so I'm going to 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.640
 zoom in so you can see it well 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.660
 and so you will see how I would handle your 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.660
 reflex from our smartphone 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.630
 and we started the first application 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.210
 as you can see and recognize them 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.460
 camera 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.100
 and we would be seeing the image that is 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.630
 focusing on the camera that are those two 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.970
 androids a little box we have 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.040
 here at the end 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.840
 As you can see a lot of health is seen 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.950
 we have to go doing controls the 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.950
 camera settings here 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.970
 and we are adjusting the image 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.350
 and we have it mainly the good thing about 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.210
 This application 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.159
 good apart from being able to adjust everything as 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.159
 you see here the opening is smooth 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.000
 speed 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.000
 we would add to make the photo 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.530
 have to see the preview of more 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.110
 but good that it has is that we have for 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.550
 do what is the approach 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.410
 so as not to have to walk between making a 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.640
 more precise manual focus we can 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.230
 do behind the application 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.230
 to know how you are focusing there 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.490
 if you have now looks better is 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.610
 android than the other 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.200
 we could mark the point of focus to 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.350
 we go to the last point that would be the 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.350
 picture 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.040
 we can adjust it little by little more 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.510
 or less let's not see if we could see 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.480
 and we would give 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.950
 to be 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.409
 automatically what will we do 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.379
 this is a series of photographs with 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.670
 different approaches so that you see all 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.200
 the image from back to front 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.160
 clear you would see the whole picture 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.160
 let's stop it 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.620
 has also to mark for example in 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.620
 the viu 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.750
 the focus areas 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.350
 where you would see more saturation of the 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.350
 light image 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.030
 the part that is focused on the image 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.030
 we have it there 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.450
 to make a time lapse 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.250
 to record video 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.250
 and calculate the focal length 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.019
 and more or less good here we would have 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.040
 how many photographs do you want to make and 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.600
 others is going to make us a series of 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.970
 Photographs 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.790
 let's make the other application that 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.940
 has many more adjustments here we have the 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.880
 next application is called slr the 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.160
 guard air more or less the same 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.120
 functions you can see here we have 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.579
 we turn off the image 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.010
 has pos to scare has even 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.449
 to see a graphic with sound like 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.449
 you can see either the waves down there 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.410
 well here we have the button we would give the 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.430
 photography is doing 6 because what 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.430
 we have marked this option 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.190
 the function is basically to make a 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.680
 hr 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.030
 we remove it 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.560
 good has the same as the other 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.580
 application that we try to teach for 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.580
 go controlling the approach 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.740
 as you can see it is changing and the 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.740
 Focus will be better android 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.600
 we have here to preview and so on 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:04.480
 the photos that we are doing 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.520
 to record video to adjust the 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.290
 camera parameters what kind of 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.610
 format you want the same thing we're going to do 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.750
 basically everything we have in 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.880
 our camera but from the 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.390
 mobile here you see the photos we can 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.820
 do in the battery the exposure the 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.200
 opening we can change it as 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.760
 you can see as we change it and 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.250
 it automatically changes us the 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.760
 image this is a good way to know 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.410
 If we are going to look good or not 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.840
 we also say that this type of 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.610
 applications is more compatible with cano 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.640
 that with nico in fact this application 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.340
 works anywhere but do not see what 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.480
 it would be the image of the camera that 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.480
 It really is what we are interested in 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.850
 as you can see all of here for 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.190
 change the type of approach and so on to 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.990
 the flash 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.880
 let's teach then look at block for 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.980
 make a time lapse how often you want 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.110
 to take the pictures how much do you think 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.210
 hard and you would give the button 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.200
 automatically that of the mobile itself 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.200
 store the photographs 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.499
 there is highlighting the following 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.030
 that we will use in the future 

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:10.120
 next chapters of photography then 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.409
 so you can see 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.060
 how do you do a try sides how is it done 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:16.460
 one hdr 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.770
 let's stop it 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.050
 and so we would be the ones with directly as 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.919
 are the adjustments here you see what kind of 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.919
 exhibition you want 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.940
 the chain of rules and so on and 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.830
 basically, what we want 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.810
 teach them these two applications for 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.780
 that you see the adjustments from our 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.850
 own smartphone as if instead of 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.800
 buy us a manual trigger that 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.900
 sells out there because we do it through 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.290
 from our cable or tg 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.490
 and our smartphone with android so 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.169
 we hope you like this video 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.490
 Any doubt know leave us a 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:52.350
 comment and see you in the next 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:59.300
 photography chapters a greeting 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:59.300
 well the truth pretty well 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.159
 Well, the truth is that it has 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:08.560
 undoubtedly not bad as all the 

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:10.150
 videos we have a new plus a video
