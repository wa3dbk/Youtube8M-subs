to check the cal per cell there's two

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.849 
to check the cal per cell there's two
places<00:00:17.119> where<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.240> bolts<00:00:18.390> on<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.900> those<00:00:19.680> are

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
places where it bolts on to those are

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.560 
places where it bolts on to those are
the<00:00:19.920> two<00:00:20.039> caliper<00:00:20.520> mounting<00:00:20.850> bracket<00:00:21.270> spots

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
the two caliper mounting bracket spots

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.480 
the two caliper mounting bracket spots
you'll<00:00:22.170> want<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.350> take<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.619> wire<00:00:22.859> brush<00:00:23.189> and

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
you'll want to take that wire brush and

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.279 
you'll want to take that wire brush and
this<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.119> just<00:00:24.150> dry<00:00:24.510> just<00:00:24.750> honor<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.109> just

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
the bracket that could cause the caliper

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.770 
the bracket that could cause the caliper
not<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.130> sit<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.460> your<00:00:35.640> absolutely<00:00:36.450> perfectly

binding or other deficiencies in a
braking<00:00:41.489> system<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.270> those<00:00:42.480> two<00:00:42.690> spots<00:00:42.840> we

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
braking system so those two spots we

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.990 
braking system so those two spots we
want<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.530> just<00:00:43.649> take<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.399> wire<00:00:44.579> brush<00:00:44.820> and

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
want to just take the the wire brush and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.490 
want to just take the the wire brush and
quickly<00:00:45.300> brush<00:00:45.510> them<00:00:45.690> off<00:00:45.719> make<00:00:46.110> sure<00:00:46.260> they're

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
quickly brush them off make sure they're

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.670 
quickly brush them off make sure they're
clean<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.039> removed<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.850> any<00:00:48.030> debris<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.680> it's

clean and removed in any debris and it's

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.619 
clean and removed in any debris and it's
a<00:00:49.800> little<00:00:50.010> bit<00:00:50.100> more<00:00:50.250> difficult<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.030> give<00:00:51.510> this

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
a little bit more difficult to give this

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.360 
a little bit more difficult to give this
bigger<00:00:51.899> brush<00:00:52.140> back<00:00:52.350> into<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.710> application

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
bigger brush back into this application

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.549 
bigger brush back into this application
if<00:00:53.550> you've<00:00:54.059> got<00:00:54.239> with<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> small<00:00:54.780> wire<00:00:55.110> brushes

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
if you've got with a small wire brushes

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.760 
if you've got with a small wire brushes
that's<00:00:56.010> kind<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.640> toothbrush<00:00:57.270> sighs

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
that's kind of like a toothbrush sighs

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.290 
that's kind of like a toothbrush sighs
those<00:00:58.770> work<00:00:58.980> real<00:00:59.219> well<00:00:59.250> they're<00:00:59.910> cheap<00:01:00.180> and

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
those work real well they're cheap and

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.150 
those work real well they're cheap and
inexpensive<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:01.140> available<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.620> all<00:01:01.739> parts

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
inexpensive and available on all parts

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.119 
inexpensive and available on all parts
distributors<00:01:03.439> but<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:04.979> with<00:01:05.070> a

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
distributors but you can do it with a

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.440 
distributors but you can do it with a
big<00:01:05.280> brush<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:05.729> just<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.970> little<00:01:06.210> bit<00:01:06.299> more

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
big brush it's just a little bit more

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.789 
big brush it's just a little bit more
inconvenient<00:01:08.750> as<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.960> said<00:01:10.200> before<00:01:10.229> there's<00:01:10.710> a

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
inconvenient as I said before there's a

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.219 
inconvenient as I said before there's a
lot<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.070> tools<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:12.030> can<00:01:12.659> be<00:01:12.780> bought<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.140> it

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
lot of tools that can be bought in it

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.550 
lot of tools that can be bought in it
makes<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> job<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.010> lot<00:01:14.400> easier<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:15.560> faster

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
makes the job a lot easier and faster

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.310 
makes the job a lot easier and faster
for<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.310> do<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.570> just<00:01:18.689> kind<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:18.960> kind

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
for you to do and you just kind of kind

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.999 
for you to do and you just kind of kind
of<00:01:19.439> way<00:01:19.710> out<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.970> cost<00:01:21.930> versus<00:01:22.439> return

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
of way out the the cost versus return

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.179 
of way out the the cost versus return
and<00:01:23.310> how<00:01:23.430> important<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:25.009> for<00:01:26.009> you

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
and how important it is and for you

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.010 
and how important it is and for you
sometimes<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.790> aggravation<00:01:27.450> factor<00:01:27.630> alone

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
sometimes the aggravation factor alone

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
sometimes the aggravation factor alone
is<00:01:28.259> worth<00:01:28.409> every<00:01:28.740> dollar<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.250> some<00:01:29.460> people

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
is worth every dollar to some people

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.200 
is worth every dollar to some people
later<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.310> another<00:01:32.430> segment<00:01:32.759> we're<00:01:33.060> going<00:01:33.090> to

later in another segment we're going to

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.810 
later in another segment we're going to
cover<00:01:33.270> compressing<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.409> caliper<00:01:35.100> self<00:01:35.430> but

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
cover compressing the caliper self but

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.130 
cover compressing the caliper self but
we<00:01:35.970> just<00:01:36.090> want<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.360> look<00:01:36.450> around<00:01:36.630> there<00:01:36.930> make

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
we just want to look around there make

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.719 
we just want to look around there make
sure<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:37.710> don't<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:37.979> any<00:01:38.159> large

of caliper and then this outer portion
of<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.960> caliper<00:01:46.350> here<00:01:46.530> where<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> caliper

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
of the caliper here where the caliper

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.859 
of the caliper here where the caliper
makes<00:01:47.369> contact<00:01:47.820> with<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.060> brake<00:01:48.270> pad<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.659> holds

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
makes contact with a brake pad and holds

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.450 
makes contact with a brake pad and holds
it<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.079> what<00:01:49.680> we're<00:01:49.860> going<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.040> twist<00:01:50.250> that

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
it in what we're going to twist that

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.800 
it in what we're going to twist that
around<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.850> get<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> good<00:01:51.149> look<00:01:51.299> at<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:51.689> we

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
around and get a good look at it but we

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.660 
around and get a good look at it but we
want<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.020> brush<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.409> area<00:01:52.770> out<00:01:52.979> right<00:01:53.520> in

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
want to brush that area out right in

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.030 
want to brush that area out right in
through<00:01:53.909> there<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.630> hard<00:01:54.930> for<00:01:55.020> me<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.860> get

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
through there it's hard for me to to get

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.850 
through there it's hard for me to to get
a<00:01:56.070> good<00:01:56.250> angle<00:01:56.430> for<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:58.290> camera<00:01:58.710> there

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
a good angle for you on the camera there

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.520 
a good angle for you on the camera there
because<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.399> the<00:02:00.060> limitation<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.140> movement

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
because of the limitation of movement

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.749 
because of the limitation of movement
that<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.860> with<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.130> brake<00:02:02.310> cable<00:02:02.670> and

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
that I have with the brake cable and

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.459 
that I have with the brake cable and
brake<00:02:02.880> hose<00:02:03.119> adjustment<00:02:04.049> but<00:02:04.140> basically<00:02:04.380> I

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
brake hose adjustment but basically I

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.899 
brake hose adjustment but basically I
just<00:02:04.649> want<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.829> make<00:02:04.920> sure<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.340> environment

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
just want to make sure this environment

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.300 
just want to make sure this environment
up<00:02:06.030> here<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.719> clean<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.409> free<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.799> any<00:02:07.979> dirt

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
up here is clean and free of any dirt

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.430 
up here is clean and free of any dirt
that<00:02:08.940> could<00:02:09.119> sit<00:02:09.300> between<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.200> pad

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
that could sit between that and the pad

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.710 
that could sit between that and the pad
and<00:02:10.739> also<00:02:11.009> cause<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.370> caliper<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.910> be<00:02:12.030> it

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
and also cause the caliper to be it

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.470 
and also cause the caliper to be it
werd<00:02:12.870> angle<00:02:13.290> or<00:02:13.410> cause<00:02:13.790> pad<00:02:14.790> or<00:02:15.000> caliper

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
werd angle or cause pad or caliper

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.630 
werd angle or cause pad or caliper
movement<00:02:15.930> binding<00:02:16.350> so<00:02:17.070> now<00:02:17.190> we've<00:02:17.340> concluded

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
movement binding so now we've concluded

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.580 
movement binding so now we've concluded
