00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.760
 Hello everyone! 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.420
 With the launch of "Sailor Moon Crystal" last year 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.000
 Recently, there are a lot of Sailor Moon's peripheral products listed. 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.800
 So these months I have been looking for interesting surroundings and want to make special editions for everyone. 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.410
 I didn't expect it to be so difficult! 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.010
 There is now a soft candy 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.540
 I really want to try this kind of jelly, but I can't find it... 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.200
 But I collected all the taste of the potato chips! 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.360
 Is the package super cute? 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.580
 It took me a long time to find it. 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.600
 The result was found in the 100-yuan store XD 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.469
 I can't think of it 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.160
 I bought all three flavors, each of which has a different character. 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.780
 Sauce roast pork tastes Sailor Moon, Sailor Mercury, all characters have 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.980
 So you can choose your favorite character. 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.860
 In addition to the Sailor Moon, let’s take a look at what this is a great piece of artichoke. 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.040
 Here is a small gift..... 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.220
 Hope is a sticker, but I don’t think it will be sent 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.480
 "A tablecloth with a smart phone attached to each package" 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.420
 Oh~ so the little gift is the mobile phone tablecloth. 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.400
 The tablecloth pattern and the character on the package are the same 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.320
 So this bag is the Tuxedo Masked Man. 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.830
 This bag is the sailor moon 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.960
 There are also sailors Mercury! Ok, I am starving to death, open to eat! 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.110
 Every bag looks super delicious~ there is avocado cheese nachos 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.660
 Garlic cod nachos 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.380
 And grilled pork tortilla chips 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.440
 I guess it is a combination of Barsami vinegar and roast pork? 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.440
 I guess. 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.140
 I have to eat avocado flavor first! 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.080
 Everyone knows how much I love avocados ^^ 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.140
 Good toon~ 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.580
 Super small, so cute ^^ 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.000
 And so green! I have to start:) 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.200
 Um~ delicious 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.120
 Is a Mexican cornflake 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.360
 This is delicious 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.420
 With salsa sauce should be super delicious 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.220
 I like that it doesn't have a super strong taste, it tastes faint. 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.200
 I really like this taste. 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.660
 good to eat! I predict this will be the first place in my heart. 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.720
 Avocado cheese ~ 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.980
 Sailor Moon! 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.980
 Let’s try the roast pork with sauce. 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.519
 Um... it smells like 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.720
 Like the beef taste of Mr. Noodle 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.080
 It seems like eating 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.140
 a little soy sauce 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.900
 This package is salty 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.900
 It is an enhanced version of Mr. Noodle beef taste. 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.840
 The saltiness of a bowl of noodles and two sauces 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.360
 It’s delicious, but I don’t think I can eat the whole package because it’s too salty. 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.400
 But full of delicious 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.180
 If you are a salty taster, choose this one. 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.670
 Finally, the taste of pesto squid! I am not sure if I am right. 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.560
 Actually, I have never heard of this taste before I came to Japan. 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.480
 Japan is read as "drawing birds to fight" 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.380
 Is a vegetable dish topped with squid sauce 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.800
 Can't find other foods can be compared to this taste 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.640
 Um~~~ Garlic is so delicious~^ 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.220
 Too delicious~ I love garlic: 3 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.300
 Have a touch of fish 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.940
 Only one Mimi, not that terrible fishy smell 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.320
 This is delicious! Same as avocado 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.800
 Found a little Luna in the corner 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.380
 This is super delicious! I can't choose it~ 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.540
 And a pack is only a dollar, all packed. 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.520
 At first I was a bit skeptical that it would be delicious? I want to say that this is just a super cute Sailor Moon. 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.800
 To lure us to buy it 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.740
 But it’s really delicious. 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.240
 Even if it is not good, I will buy XD. 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.380
 But it’s delicious~ 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.980
 I want to choose avocado 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.980
 Avocado is the first place 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.240
 Pesto squid immediately after 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.500
 Sauce roast pork is too salty for me. 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.640
 Delicious, but very salty 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.900
 Ladies and gentlemen, I still have the same perimeter to show you. 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.220
 Will be! 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.630
 Sailor Moon Sanitary Cotton! XD 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.920
 I don't know where this is related to the Sailor Moon. XD 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:28.620
 I hope that I will only print the super cute Sailor Moon pattern. 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.320
 Look at this package, it's so cute! 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.040
 If you don't know Japanese sanitary napkins...big one! 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.340
 Super large ~ I never used it, so I brought it back from Canada. 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.200
 Because I feel super uncomfortable 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.340
 That's right! The Sailor Moon is printed on it! 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.660
 Can you see how big it is? 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.200
 Giant level, almost as big as my face! 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.380
 But the Sailor Moon pattern above is so cute. 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.640
 Too cute~ 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.060
 I want to open it to you to see how much this is. 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.280
 You will definitely be scared by this size XD 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.220
 Look! Look! 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.120
 Too exaggerated~ and still very thick 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.440
 I feel that Japan is doing its best, the thicker the better. 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.240
 But Canada is doing as thin as possible, I like thin 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.180
 Hey~ this can still be opened, I didn’t just start it all. 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.480
 My God~ 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.180
 If you know the perimeter of any Sailor Moon 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.300
 All kinds of pipeline news will do, please leave a message and tell me! 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.680
 I will definitely continue to find fondant 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.180
 English is actually reading "嘎米" 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.780
 Japanese read "咕米", if you are curious 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.540
 If there are other neighbors, I will definitely look for it. 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.660
 Because I love to buy the Sailor Moon, so be sure to tell me! 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.940
