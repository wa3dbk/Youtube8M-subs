00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.730

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.400
 social club that's because here we go to 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.990
 start doing this trick with this 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.690
 trick I'll show you how we can place 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.150
 in our crew the secret color of the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.250
 sect kiflon that sect that you already know 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.840
 if you have played the normal mode is a 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.699
 Pretty pretty blue and that 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.609
 it looks good on cars on clothes is 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.260
 quite attractive to the eye well as 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.940
 we do this because we get into our 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.040
 social club and needless to say that 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.660
 we're going to have to be the managers of the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.730
 tribe the creators of the crew for 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.550
 can modify it to be able to modify 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.050
 this color well how are we going to put this 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.140
 color thus modifying the html code 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.030
 we are going to go to crews and in our 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.010
 cross let's give it to manage once 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.590
 let's give it to manage we'll get the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.480
 mouse over the color is valid and clicking with 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.340
 the right button you will see that we get 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.809
 inspect the item this only comes out 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.629
 in browsers like google chrome 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.309
 mozilla firefox well once we give it to 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.439
 inspection to the element we will see that we 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.120
 this little screen comes with the html code 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.470
 of the page 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.960
 what we have to modify first 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.060
 about these three digits here that 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.890
 we have parentheses as the first 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.370
 digit we will erase what there is and we will put 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.860
 the 135 as second digit we're also going 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.790
 to eliminate what he puts and we are going to put 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.850
 the 197 we put it 197 in the third 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.670
 digit what we are going to put is 245 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.860
 we erase what is there we put 2 45 well 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.380
 once we have done this we are going to 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.360
 go down here a little bit more and here where 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.910
 puts right down three or four more rows 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.610
 down puts and the crew color then here 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.560
 ton evaluate worth so where it puts value 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.450
 let's think to press forgiveness with the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.700
 double left click button and let's 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.870
 change this code we have this 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.170
 color code that we have here 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:56.790
 we erase everything except the pad and 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.420
 we place the 8 the number 7 the house faith 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.940
 the number 5 the streetlamp fd and the number 5 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.040
 once we have these already done then 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.350
 we just close this screen and 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.840
 as you have seen here we will be placed 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.110
 this color that is the secret color this 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.030
 the color of the kiflon sect 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.010
 you will know if you have played the mode 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.200
 normal and that looks pretty good in 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.490
 vehicles etcetera etcetera now what 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.650
 The only thing we have to do is save 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.420
 this think as you put it here 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.280
 we give to save and save this crew already 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.570
 is in about five minutes we can 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.990
 make our changes in our 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.540
 cars 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.130
 let's see how a car is now 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.170
 with this color it goes without saying that 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.210
 we can also place here if we know 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.400
 the codes the color that the real one gives us 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.510
 win making this same method already 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.830
 you know that if we click here too 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.840
 we can put the colors that we want 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.900
 here but it's very difficult to agree on the 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.000
 Exact point for the desired color 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.860
 in this way with the code there is no failure 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.440
 I will place jce the color that gives you the real 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.660
 Earn well once we have saved this 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.220
 Well, we 're out of here and now we're going to 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.290
 see how they are in our vehicles 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.090
 this color and it comes here we are already 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.010
 we went to online mode and as you can see how 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.200
 You are going to observe forgiveness, because here we are going to 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.540
 change it and put this color on 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.520
 color of the sect keep long then al in 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.470
 marmoset for example we put you 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.600
 here color of the cross and here you have it 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.950
 it's worth it here you have the only thing you have 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.720
 what to do is confirm it so that is 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.820
 change the color and you're ready and you know 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.920
 we have this color so nothing 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.990
 basically the ones that you know 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.610

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.500

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.020
 belong afterwards in case the owners of 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.099
