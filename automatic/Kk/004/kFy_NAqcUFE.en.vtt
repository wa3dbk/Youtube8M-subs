00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.080
 online studios I'm going to do a makeup 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.750
 in green what I'm going to need it to be 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.580
 the first normal black color that yes 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.410
 we have green and we want to use it 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.230
 well, it can also look good 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.150
 a green pencil 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.699
 a black pencil that we're going to 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.800
 use to delineate inside and 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.000
 then we're going to need shadows of 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.779
 colors 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.800
 I'm going to use these for the base 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.020
 because in these courses that are like that 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.089
 blue greens ghiso I think that if 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.860
 here we also put two colors 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.410
 to be too flashy and it's not going 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.780
 to look good then a background 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.269
 normalito and then I will use a 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.180
 light green that is going to be one more tone or 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.650
 less like that and then a normal one is worth a 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.860
 well a little bit darker that is going to be 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.740
 this 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.680
 and that's what I'm going to use then 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:56.660
 to start seeing what I'm going to do 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.070
 is to put the base here in the color 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.210
 that I have told you in this color that is 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.280
 as earth and blur the good so that 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.130
 I do not notice much the idea is the best 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.620
 of a little bit of brightness a little bit of light but 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.690
 do not paint and you notice the marks 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:16.120
 neither here nor here is to blur it 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.120
 well so that those marks do not remain 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.640
 and now what I'm going to do is delineate 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.960
 me the bottom part inside and it's 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.120
 for what I'm going to use the black 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.330
 I use black because green being 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.060
 so clear I may not get the effect 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.630
 I want to delineate inside 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.630
 then nothing 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.580
 in black pencil that delineates well 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.900
 then inside then if it's true that 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.960
 I will use outside the green color 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.600
 to delineate on the outside from below but 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.380
 outside and then it's her if it's going to 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.380
 see a little better 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.630
 so black color 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.960
 and good now what I'm going to do is 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.420
 put the colors on the mobile eyelid 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.030
 and I'm going to put the greens that I had 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.460
 said before then what I'm going to do 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.830
 is green clarito I'll put on 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.540
 all the eyelid mobile first and 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.420
 then put some touches with him with the 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.670
 green darker then nothing to green 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.140
 clarito and I put it 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.140
 all over the eyelid 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.730
 so for our eyes that is staying 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.730
 same 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.960
 and well, it's not a matter of 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.630
 look like I know 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.110
 so that you put what you notice but 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.350
 neither 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.460
 let's look like that 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.460
 more or less like that 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.380
 we look good and if you want you can 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:12.210
 blur a little bit up 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.680
 in the crease a little bit up 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.210
 as long as it does not stay in the cut line 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.120
 but so that it goes joining the two 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:22.690
 nice colors when we are going to give the 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.680
 retouch with dark green and we're going to 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.010
 give 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.620
 over here I always do the same and in 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.909
 the 'pit and that is out let's say and I 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.120
 I've done what I was going to do with a green 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:36.120
 it got a little more normal a little bit more 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.120
 Dark 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.360
 then I start here 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.849
 and then the piquito that it is not me 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.350
 cut that is as blurred with a 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.310
 degraded 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.310
 And here 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.690
 well blurred 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.690
 and the same thing other 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.750
 the line where they fold 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.400
 and the peak 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.579
 and good 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.579
 always blurring 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.120
 Well now would be the time to give 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.830
 touch them with the pencil which is what 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.860
 better is going to be left with what the 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.280
 touch that green 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:41.300
 so what I always do is for 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.300
 up first 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.710
 we had good with green 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.550
 well and the same of the other 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.600
 with green so dark clarito I elected 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.020
 this green because it 's like that 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.760
 spring greener than not dark and 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.980
 now what I'm going to do next I 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.420
 I give a few touches here but not much 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.240
 just to transfer a little 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.360
 of color and that area is not so dull 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.320
 and then from avoiding the eye to there 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.420
 indicates from the eye to the tip below 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.900
 delineated also below the 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.090
 tabs 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.160
 and if I see that I have gone to know a 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.960
 so little by being able to remove quantity and 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.550
 rectifying what is something that we 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.550
 We are wrong, someone is fine 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.409
 and this is going to enlarge the eye 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.360
 quite 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:51.689
 or will it give us that feeling 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:55.879
 and well, it looks like that 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:55.879
 with the finished below and all 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.140
 this is how it is now simply 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.820
 we had to take mascara myself 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.850
 personally I do not like crime in 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.480
 the bottom part, I just 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.480
 I put up 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.630
 but I do not like it below, but I do 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.380
 that there are people who put it on 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.380
 the lashes of 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.390
 under 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.630
 and well, with mascara that is pretty 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.630
 best 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:39.219
 Well the case is that the eyes in green 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.810
 because we already have and it is very easy not 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:42.909
 it's not very professional either, it's nothing 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.330
 the style and good because this is and I hope 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:45.330
 what you liked
