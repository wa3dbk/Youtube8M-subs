00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
excited we got a new kick meter so I

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.219 
excited we got a new kick meter so I
don't<00:01:06.240> know<00:01:06.360> if<00:01:06.479> we're<00:01:06.630> gonna<00:01:06.689> be<00:01:06.810> able<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.140> do

route<00:01:36.060> slant<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.320> slant<00:01:37.890> out<00:01:38.130> like<00:01:38.640> you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
route slant to the slant out like you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.370 
route slant to the slant out like you
can't<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.119> like<00:01:39.299> an<00:01:39.450> angle<00:01:39.780> out<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.170> these

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
can't do like an angle out but these

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.260 
can't do like an angle out but these
right<00:01:40.710> here<00:01:40.740> these<00:01:40.950> sideline<00:01:41.640> catchers<00:01:42.119> are

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
right here these sideline catchers are

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.999 
right here these sideline catchers are
really<00:01:42.570> going<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.750> work<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.110> year<00:01:43.170> I've<00:01:43.829> been

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
really going to work this year I've been

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.740 
really going to work this year I've been
noticing<00:01:44.310> those<00:01:44.640> things<00:01:44.909> really<00:01:45.119> work<00:01:45.420> as<00:01:45.600> you

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
noticing those things really work as you

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.780 
noticing those things really work as you
can<00:01:45.869> see<00:01:46.140> Matt<00:01:46.649> Flynn<00:01:46.979> tore<00:01:47.250> me<00:01:47.399> up<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.640> little

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
can see Matt Flynn tore me up a little

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.880 
can see Matt Flynn tore me up a little
bit<00:01:47.970> when<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.119> played<00:01:48.360> as<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> Redskins<00:01:48.890> with

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
bit when I played as the Redskins with

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.530 
bit when I played as the Redskins with
these<00:01:50.070> sideline<00:01:50.490> catches<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.060> usually<00:01:51.509> I

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
these sideline catches so usually I

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.940 
these sideline catches so usually I
never<00:01:51.810> really<00:01:52.049> throw<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> sideline<00:01:52.770> too

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
never really throw to the sideline too

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.410 
never really throw to the sideline too
much<00:01:53.130> because<00:01:53.369> usually<00:01:53.700> goes<00:01:54.000> out<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.180> bounds

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
much because usually goes out of bounds

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.020 
much because usually goes out of bounds
but<00:01:55.140> even<00:01:55.350> right<00:01:55.530> now<00:01:55.710> as<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.189> tell<00:01:56.250> when

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
but even right now as you can tell when

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.760 
but even right now as you can tell when
you<00:01:57.149> look<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.780> see<00:01:58.079> all<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.380> body

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
you look and you can see all the body

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.039 
you look and you can see all the body
parts<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.430> moving<00:01:59.909> oh<00:02:00.030> my<00:02:00.240> gosh<00:02:00.479> Marshawn

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
parts just moving oh my gosh Marshawn

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.380 
parts just moving oh my gosh Marshawn
just<00:02:01.290> got<00:02:01.409> like<00:02:01.619> his<00:02:02.100> back<00:02:02.460> broken<00:02:02.820> right

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
just got like his back broken right

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.020 
just got like his back broken right
there<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.960> it's<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:04.979> really<00:02:05.040> cool<00:02:05.430> watching

the<00:02:06.210> replays<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.840> different<00:02:07.229> things<00:02:07.560> with<00:02:07.770> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
the replays of different things with the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.150 
the replays of different things with the
game<00:02:08.069> oh<00:02:08.360> it<00:02:09.360> looks<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:09.720> they've<00:02:10.160> they've

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
game oh it looks like they've they've

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.030 
game oh it looks like they've they've
added<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.730> this<00:02:11.940> audible<00:02:12.510> where<00:02:12.810> you

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
added in this audible where you

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.970 
added in this audible where you
I'm<00:02:13.489> sorry<00:02:13.760> they've<00:02:14.239> added<00:02:14.569> in<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.900> fake<00:02:15.349> throw

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
I'm sorry they've added in a fake throw

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.440 
I'm sorry they've added in a fake throw
where<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.370> can<00:02:16.519> actually<00:02:16.670> fake<00:02:17.030> throw<00:02:17.239> to<00:02:17.299> the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
where you can actually fake throw to the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.360 
where you can actually fake throw to the
right<00:02:17.689> person<00:02:17.900> look<00:02:18.200> at<00:02:18.290> this<00:02:18.439> oh<00:02:18.620> my<00:02:19.069> gosh

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.910 
right person look at this oh my gosh
that<00:02:20.150> was<00:02:20.299> such<00:02:20.569> a<00:02:20.599> fail<00:02:20.930> block<00:02:21.349> did<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:21.739> see

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
that was such a fail block did you see

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.039 
that was such a fail block did you see
that<00:02:22.069> block<00:02:22.370> oh<00:02:22.609> my<00:02:22.790> gosh<00:02:23.060> oh<00:02:23.329> yeah<00:02:23.659> he<00:02:23.750> trips

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
that block oh my gosh oh yeah he trips

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.170 
that block oh my gosh oh yeah he trips
over<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.439> guy<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:24.859> he<00:02:24.920> goes<00:02:25.129> but<00:02:25.730> basically

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
over that guy and he goes but basically

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.020 
over that guy and he goes but basically
the<00:02:26.420> this<00:02:27.319> physics<00:02:28.219> engine<00:02:28.549> can<00:02:28.700> actually

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
the this physics engine can actually

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.309 
the this physics engine can actually
cause<00:02:29.209> some<00:02:29.450> problems<00:02:29.569> like<00:02:29.900> I've<00:02:30.049> shown<00:02:30.290> you

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
cause some problems like I've shown you

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.080 
cause some problems like I've shown you
I<00:02:30.620> mean<00:02:30.890> this<00:02:31.010> is<00:02:31.069> Major<00:02:31.340> proper<00:02:31.730> now<00:02:31.879> those

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
I mean this is Major proper now those

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.640 
I mean this is Major proper now those
people<00:02:32.420> are<00:02:32.540> gone<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:32.959> they're<00:02:33.079> missing<00:02:33.470> I

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
people are gone and they're missing I

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.349 
people are gone and they're missing I
mean<00:02:33.980> where<00:02:34.129> did<00:02:34.280> they<00:02:34.459> go<00:02:34.640> did<00:02:35.209> they<00:02:35.329> just

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
mean where did they go did they just

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.210 
mean where did they go did they just
evaporate<00:02:36.049> do<00:02:36.170> they<00:02:36.290> go<00:02:36.409> to<00:02:36.439> heaven<00:02:36.650> are<00:02:37.099> they

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
evaporate do they go to heaven are they

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.619 
evaporate do they go to heaven are they
hanging<00:02:37.400> out<00:02:37.609> with<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.790> Lord<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.209> don't<00:02:38.510> know

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
hanging out with the Lord I don't know

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.020 
hanging out with the Lord I don't know
but<00:02:39.049> look<00:02:39.170> at<00:02:39.290> this<00:02:39.379> rg3<00:02:40.069> run<00:02:40.280> awesome<00:02:40.819> things

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
but look at this rg3 run awesome things

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.809 
but look at this rg3 run awesome things
going<00:02:41.359> and<00:02:41.510> he<00:02:41.959> hits<00:02:42.200> me<00:02:42.349> out<00:02:42.680> of<00:02:43.069> bounds<00:02:43.700> and

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
going and he hits me out of bounds and

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.490 
going and he hits me out of bounds and
they<00:02:43.939> call<00:02:44.239> a<00:02:44.269> flight<00:02:44.689> on<00:02:44.719> him<00:02:45.019> isn't<00:02:45.170> it<00:02:45.260> so

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
they call a flight on him isn't it so

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.099 
they call a flight on him isn't it so
freaking<00:02:46.040> awesome<00:02:46.220> ah<00:02:46.730> that's<00:02:47.629> kind<00:02:47.840> of<00:02:47.900> cold

freaking awesome ah that's kind of cold
some<00:02:48.920> new<00:02:49.069> things<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:49.459> found<00:02:49.730> out<00:02:49.879> too<00:02:50.180> is<00:02:50.420> that

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
some new things I found out too is that

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.580 
some new things I found out too is that
music<00:02:51.799> is<00:02:51.950> actually<00:02:52.430> like<00:02:52.609> from<00:02:53.180> NCAA<00:02:53.510> how<00:02:54.409> did

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
music is actually like from NCAA how did

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.649 
music is actually like from NCAA how did
they<00:02:54.680> do<00:02:54.739> that<00:02:54.889> look<00:02:55.609> at<00:02:55.700> that<00:02:55.819> he<00:02:56.150> breaks<00:02:56.450> the

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
they do that look at that he breaks the

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.330 
they do that look at that he breaks the
tackle<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.290> trips<00:02:57.590> over<00:02:57.859> a<00:02:57.889> guy<00:02:58.069> on<00:02:58.220> the

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
tackle the trips over a guy on the

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
play with it's been the Giants probably

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.430 
play with it's been the Giants probably
cuz<00:03:23.269> Eli<00:03:23.510> Manning<00:03:23.870> is<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.079> better<00:03:24.260> of<00:03:24.319> the

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
the limbo it's just crazy stuff and I

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.020 
the limbo it's just crazy stuff and I
shown<00:05:07.009> you<00:05:07.039> a<00:05:07.190> little<00:05:07.400> bit<00:05:07.520> of<00:05:07.580> that<00:05:07.639> earlier

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
shown you a little bit of that earlier

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.869 
shown you a little bit of that earlier
but<00:05:08.300> the<00:05:08.620> captain<00:05:09.620> cards<00:05:10.099> to<00:05:10.310> I<00:05:10.340> believe<00:05:10.759> are

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:10.879 
but the captain cards to I believe are

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:12.670 
but the captain cards to I believe are
the<00:05:10.909> ones<00:05:11.180> that<00:05:11.330> change<00:05:11.509> their<00:05:12.229> ratings

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
the ones that change their ratings

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.709 
the ones that change their ratings
throughout<00:05:13.009> the<00:05:13.190> year<00:05:13.430> next<00:05:13.639> year<00:05:13.849> which<00:05:14.569> is

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:14.719 
throughout the year next year which is

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:16.089 
throughout the year next year which is
kind<00:05:14.900> of<00:05:14.960> cool<00:05:15.020> and<00:05:15.379> then<00:05:15.680> they're<00:05:15.800> gonna<00:05:15.860> make

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
kind of cool and then they're gonna make

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.469 
kind of cool and then they're gonna make
cards<00:05:16.370> that<00:05:16.520> don't<00:05:16.550> do<00:05:16.789> that<00:05:16.819> now<00:05:17.090> this<00:05:17.270> guy's

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:18.909 
cards that don't do that now this guy's
really<00:05:17.690> confused<00:05:18.139> look<00:05:18.259> at<00:05:18.349> this<00:05:18.469> physics

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
really confused look at this physics

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:20.890 
really confused look at this physics
injury<00:05:19.159> he's<00:05:19.460> like<00:05:19.639> really<00:05:19.940> really<00:05:20.330> like<00:05:20.479> it's

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
injury he's like really really like it's

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.899 
injury he's like really really like it's
like<00:05:21.020> he's<00:05:21.169> watching<00:05:21.530> traffic<00:05:21.770> that<00:05:22.370> is<00:05:22.430> just

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
the punt isn't a punt blocking so much

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.459 
the punt isn't a punt blocking so much
better<00:06:25.610> this<00:06:25.849> year<00:06:25.909> with<00:06:26.270> that<00:06:26.389> that<00:06:26.900> last<00:06:27.199> guy
