00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.469
 greetings boys and girls alone 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.820
 this is a fantasy makeup 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:20.310
 simple and attractive we will use the bones 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.960
 of the face as a guide with a white pencil 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.720
 we draw the scheme of our 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.700
 makeup we mark an oval in perfect 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.980
 around the face and just above 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.140
 of the eyebrow we draw what would be the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.420
 hollow part that would remain in a nose 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.699
 without cartilage the remaining holes 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.930
 under the cheeks and teeth 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.570
 over the lip 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.220
 in this case we will use water colors or what 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.780
 which is the same water colors 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.879
 we start with the clearest areas 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.519
 we make our faces white 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.409
 reserving the marked areas 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.390
 teeth we will leave for later 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.670
 following the drawing we have made 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.309
 previously we apply water color black 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.010
 in the eyes nose and under the cheekbone 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.049
 trying to cover the surface well and 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.729
 being polished with the edges there are 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:04.860
 join the darkness of the mouth with the 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.990
 bone below the cheekbone we went to 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.630
 delineate the teeth with black I have 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.220
 put 5 on each side but it will depend on 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.409
 each person 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.570
 then we fill them with white 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.369
 and the basic forms of makeup we 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.360
 we will realize how we can improve 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.640
 some 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.860
 we can brush the teeth with a pencil 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.990
 black we add the last details to 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.060
 our makeup that will be the ones that 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.130
 They will make a difference a little 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.590
 volume in the brow bone about 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.530
 details on the temple and on the cleft 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.170
 under the cheekbone a little bit blurred 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.030
 we go over the water line with black and 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.030
 the woman the skeleton 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.750
 and goodbye or something 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.460
