okay<00:07:12.840> if<00:07:13.140> it's<00:07:13.500> not<00:07:13.680> it<00:07:13.890> will<00:07:14.010> never<00:07:14.220> connect

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.080 
okay if it's not it will never connect

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.570 
okay if it's not it will never connect
so<00:07:16.080> once<00:07:16.260> you<00:07:16.380> do<00:07:16.500> that<00:07:16.560> we<00:07:16.830> are<00:07:16.950> connected<00:07:17.400> now

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 
so once you do that we are connected now

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.570 
so once you do that we are connected now
so<00:07:18.090> we<00:07:18.180> need<00:07:18.330> to<00:07:18.450> go<00:07:18.630> into<00:07:18.930> the<00:07:19.410> install<00:07:19.800> apk

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:20.580 
so we need to go into the install apk

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.030 
so we need to go into the install apk
file<00:07:20.880> so<00:07:21.120> we<00:07:21.240> need<00:07:21.390> to<00:07:21.510> push<00:07:21.720> an<00:07:21.930> apk<00:07:22.470> file<00:07:22.740> into

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:23.040 
file so we need to push an apk file into

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.530 
file so we need to push an apk file into
it<00:07:23.160> which<00:07:23.340> I<00:07:23.490> already<00:07:23.580> downloaded<00:07:23.880> on<00:07:24.480> my
