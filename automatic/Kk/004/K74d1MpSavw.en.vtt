00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
and if I had to pick a sleeper in this

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.170 
and if I had to pick a sleeper in this
conference<00:04:10.860> there's<00:04:11.340> a<00:04:11.430> bunch<00:04:11.760> of<00:04:11.880> teams<00:04:12.090> that

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
conference there's a bunch of teams that

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.850 
conference there's a bunch of teams that
could<00:04:12.450> potentially<00:04:12.690> see<00:04:13.110> as<00:04:13.200> a<00:04:13.230> sleeper<00:04:13.680> i

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
could potentially see as a sleeper i

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.830 
could potentially see as a sleeper i
would<00:04:14.550> say<00:04:14.730> kent<00:04:14.970> state<00:04:15.209> but<00:04:15.420> i<00:04:15.480> think<00:04:15.720> they're

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
would say kent state but i think they're

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.270 
would say kent state but i think they're
too<00:04:15.989> far<00:04:16.169> for<00:04:16.380> people's<00:04:16.620> radar<00:04:16.950> so<00:04:17.100> i<00:04:17.160> think

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
too far for people's radar so i think

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.259 
too far for people's radar so i think
they're<00:04:17.489> they're<00:04:17.730> going<00:04:17.850> to<00:04:17.910> be<00:04:18.000> low<00:04:18.239> enough

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
they're they're going to be low enough

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.950 
they're they're going to be low enough
on<00:04:18.810> people's<00:04:19.109> radar<00:04:19.169> to<00:04:19.560> be<00:04:19.859> a<00:04:19.890> sleeper<00:04:20.700> team

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:20.960 
on people's radar to be a sleeper team

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.210 
on people's radar to be a sleeper team
even<00:04:21.960> though<00:04:22.020> the<00:04:22.140> lost<00:04:22.320> Darrell<00:04:22.590> Hazell<00:04:22.740> head

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
even though the lost Darrell Hazell head

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.730 
even though the lost Darrell Hazell head
coach<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.610> Purdue<00:04:24.260> but<00:04:25.260> if<00:04:25.350> I<00:04:25.380> had<00:04:25.470> to<00:04:25.530> pick<00:04:25.590> a

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
coach to Purdue but if I had to pick a

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.590 
coach to Purdue but if I had to pick a
sleeper<00:04:26.280> it<00:04:26.669> would<00:04:26.880> probably<00:04:27.180> be

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
sleeper it would probably be

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.960 
sleeper it would probably be

Belt<00:05:42.720> is<00:05:43.070> louisiana-monroe<00:05:44.070> because<00:05:44.790> it's

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
Belt is louisiana-monroe because it's

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.950 
Belt is louisiana-monroe because it's
something<00:05:45.120> obviously<00:05:45.570> I<00:05:45.630> have<00:05:45.930> a

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
something obviously I have a

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.360 
something obviously I have a
championship<00:05:46.440> game<00:05:46.650> of<00:05:46.680> the<00:05:46.800> league<00:05:46.890> teams

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
championship game of the league teams

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.100 
championship game of the league teams
and<00:05:48.230> it's<00:05:49.230> hard<00:05:49.740> to<00:05:49.980> pick<00:05:50.160> a<00:05:50.190> sleeper<00:05:50.670> in<00:05:51.110> this

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
and it's hard to pick a sleeper in this

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.250 
and it's hard to pick a sleeper in this
conference<00:05:52.770> definitely<00:05:53.750> the<00:05:54.750> bottom<00:05:55.020> four

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
conference definitely the bottom four

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.860 
conference definitely the bottom four
teams<00:05:55.290> don't<00:05:55.740> see<00:05:55.950> having<00:05:56.280> a<00:05:56.340> chance<00:05:56.660> at<00:05:57.660> all

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
teams don't see having a chance at all

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.180 
teams don't see having a chance at all
so<00:05:58.800> I<00:05:59.250> would<00:05:59.580> have<00:05:59.610> to<00:06:00.000> say<00:06:00.030> Western<00:06:00.570> Kentucky

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
so I would have to say Western Kentucky

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.410 
so I would have to say Western Kentucky
they<00:06:02.190> do<00:06:02.250> have<00:06:02.580> some<00:06:02.820> pretty<00:06:02.970> good<00:06:03.120> talent

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
they do have some pretty good talent

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.940 
they do have some pretty good talent
coming<00:06:03.540> back<00:06:03.690> I<00:06:04.050> forget<00:06:04.530> their<00:06:04.740> linebackers

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
coming back I forget their linebackers

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.720 
coming back I forget their linebackers
name<00:06:05.550> but<00:06:05.790> he<00:06:06.470> he<00:06:07.470> probably<00:06:07.860> could<00:06:08.160> start<00:06:08.490> for

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:08.730 
name but he he probably could start for

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.520 
name but he he probably could start for
half<00:06:08.910> the<00:06:09.120> teams<00:06:09.360> if<00:06:09.570> not<00:06:09.780> more<00:06:10.020> than<00:06:10.200> half<00:06:10.260> the

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
half the teams if not more than half the

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.520 
half the teams if not more than half the
VCS<00:06:10.980> teams<00:06:11.220> in<00:06:11.490> football<00:06:12.230> so<00:06:13.230> they<00:06:13.380> do<00:06:13.440> have

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
VCS teams in football so they do have

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.440 
VCS teams in football so they do have
some<00:06:13.860> talent<00:06:14.310> they<00:06:14.670> really<00:06:14.880> do<00:06:15.150> they've
