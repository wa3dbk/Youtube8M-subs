00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.030 

sometimes<00:00:04.810> when<00:00:05.050> you<00:00:05.170> set<00:00:05.439> up<00:00:05.470> the<00:00:05.649> search

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:06.040 
sometimes when you set up the search

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.949 
sometimes when you set up the search
loop<00:00:06.430> balance<00:00:07.050> you<00:00:08.050> hear<00:00:08.590> a<00:00:08.620> continuous<00:00:09.400> tone

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:09.959 
loop balance you hear a continuous tone

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:13.919 
loop balance you hear a continuous tone
which<00:00:10.959> can<00:00:11.410> be<00:00:11.559> confusing<00:00:12.150> on<00:00:13.150> this<00:00:13.509> video

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:13.929 
which can be confusing on this video

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.920 
which can be confusing on this video
I'll<00:00:14.230> just<00:00:14.469> show<00:00:14.679> you<00:00:14.879> what<00:00:15.879> to<00:00:16.059> do<00:00:16.240> when<00:00:16.480> that

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
I'll just show you what to do when that

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.730 
I'll just show you what to do when that
happens<00:00:18.000> okay<00:00:19.000> as<00:00:19.060> you<00:00:19.240> can<00:00:19.300> see<00:00:19.390> the<00:00:20.020> RNC

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
happens okay as you can see the RNC

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.050 
happens okay as you can see the RNC
controls<00:00:21.540> are<00:00:22.540> set<00:00:22.990> to<00:00:23.410> a<00:00:23.520> starting<00:00:24.520> central

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
controls are set to a starting central

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.180 
controls are set to a starting central
position<00:00:25.540> typically<00:00:26.320> when<00:00:26.590> you<00:00:26.710> put<00:00:26.890> a<00:00:26.920> new

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.190 
position typically when you put a new

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:38.099 
position typically when you put a new
coil<00:00:27.900> right<00:00:28.900> let's<00:00:29.230> switch<00:00:29.530> on<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:34.050> just<00:00:37.109> the

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:38.109 
coil right let's switch on so just the

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:41.700 
coil right let's switch on so just the
thing<00:00:38.350> appears<00:00:38.710> quite<00:00:39.399> okay<00:00:40.030> now<00:00:40.719> we<00:00:41.440> go<00:00:41.649> to

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
thing appears quite okay now we go to

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:50.549 
thing appears quite okay now we go to
set<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.309> search<00:00:42.550> loop<00:00:42.909> balance<00:00:46.199> on<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:50.379> can

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
set the search loop balance on you can

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.500 
set the search loop balance on you can
hear<00:00:50.769> there's<00:00:51.100> a<00:00:51.159> continuous<00:00:51.879> tone<00:00:52.559> threshold

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
hear there's a continuous tone threshold

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.250 
hear there's a continuous tone threshold
is<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> right<00:00:55.170> position

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
is that the right position

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.800 
is that the right position
when<00:00:57.770> this<00:00:58.040> happens<00:00:58.670> you'll<00:00:59.210> have<00:00:59.420> to<00:00:59.600> move

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
when this happens you'll have to move

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:09.140 
when this happens you'll have to move
the<00:01:00.260> RNC<00:01:01.010> controls<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:02.660> stop<00:01:02.960> that

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.350 

there<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.920> stopped<00:01:12.400> and<00:01:12.910> from<00:01:13.150> that

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
there that stopped and from that

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.700 
there that stopped and from that
position<00:01:13.600> we<00:01:14.320> can<00:01:14.440> carry<00:01:14.800> on<00:01:15.040> and<00:01:16.560> set<00:01:17.560> the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
position we can carry on and set the

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.680 
position we can carry on and set the
search<00:01:17.920> lose<00:01:18.280> balance<00:01:18.550> let's<00:01:19.360> do<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:22.540> is

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
search lose balance let's do this is

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.490 
search lose balance let's do this is
with<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:22.930> auto<00:01:23.110> tune<00:01:23.590> on<00:01:23.830> so<00:01:24.250> it'll<00:01:24.910> be<00:01:25.060> a<00:01:25.090> bit

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
with the auto tune on so it'll be a bit

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.800 
with the auto tune on so it'll be a bit
quicker<00:01:26.500> but<00:01:26.710> normally<00:01:27.310> you'd<00:01:27.490> precisely<00:01:28.420> do

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
quicker but normally you'd precisely do

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:52.950 
quicker but normally you'd precisely do
it<00:01:28.900> with<00:01:29.050> the<00:01:29.170> auto<00:01:29.290> tune<00:01:29.800> off<00:01:51.960> just

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
it with the auto tune off just

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:27.990 
it with the auto tune off just
double-check<00:01:53.590> that<00:01:53.619> with<00:01:53.920> autotune<00:01:54.310> off

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.500 

I'm<00:02:28.630> upset<00:02:29.580> double-check<00:02:30.580> see

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.740 

that's<00:02:38.510> okay<00:02:38.930> as<00:02:38.989> well<00:02:39.290> all<00:02:40.190> done<00:02:40.459> now<00:02:41.450> just

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
that's okay as well all done now just

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:52.820 
that's okay as well all done now just
switch<00:02:41.989> search<00:02:42.290> loop<00:02:42.620> balance<00:02:43.010> off<00:02:47.800> and<00:02:49.180> reach

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.720 

you

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730
