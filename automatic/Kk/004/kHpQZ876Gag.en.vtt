00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 In this video clip we deal 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.779
 us with the highway entrance in the 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.309
 instantly where to find the main roadway 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:17.210
 Highway looks left flashing and the 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:19.920
 Turn third gear on full throttle 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:23.400
 and on the mirror the vehicle traffic 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.199
 Please watch the shoulder first 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.570
 then do it if you are in the left 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.060
 outside mirror a suitable gap for 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.809
 changed the lane 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.320
 but then more fully full throttle 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.079
 give 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:42.620
 At about 80 km / h on the main carriageway 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.620
 drive up the fourth gear turn on 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:50.360
 Engage in peace and give gas again 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:59.120
 for the sake of the environment and a purse 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.120
 switch to fifth gear now 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.840
 on the highway please to the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.850
 think safety distance 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.619
 in theoretical instruction we have 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.229
 learned that the distance is always the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.260
 half of the tarot is worth 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:17.540
 that is , 100 km h are the 50 meters 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.189
 at 120 km h 60 meters and so on 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.340
 for orientation one uses the 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.229
 Guard post on the right side of the road 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.600
 these are usually 50 meters 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.579
 apart 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.880
 that is, if the preceding one 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.020
 vehicle at this post is one must 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.970
 yourself here 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.610
 or better still a little further back 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.610
 and here are some important tips 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.220
 First, even if the shoulder 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.190
 very important is he serves on the 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.250
 highway not to check whether 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.229
 is free or not 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.180
 From theory we know that 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:01.740
 vehicle at 80 km / h in one second approx 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.090
 24 meters back if you are now 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.910
 for example, only two seconds 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.800
 try over the shoulder 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.430
 follow traffic 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.120
 then you would not go down almost 50 meters 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.300
 look ahead 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.860
 a rear-end collision or acquaintance 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.170
 with the guardrail is thus 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.360
 preprogrammed 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.970
 So please the successor traffic over 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.550
 observe the mirrors and when it is free 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.750
 to the safety left next to the vehicle 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.700
 So look at the shoulder 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.500
 and here's a second tip if it is 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.690
 always goes with the third gear on the 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.450
 drive up the freeway 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.830
 that has two reasons first, one has with 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.120
 the third gear a better one 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.780
 acceleration capability than with the 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.870
 fourth gear 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.760
 and secondly, if you really do not 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.860
 is left over then one goes 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.230
 just short of the gas and the engine 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.420
 slows down the vehicle if then one 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.820
 gap exists then you give again 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.450
 gas and you have enough power again 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.680
 accelerate the vehicle quickly 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.090
 I wish you much fun with the 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.090
 Special hours on the highway
