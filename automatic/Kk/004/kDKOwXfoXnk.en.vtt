I<00:00:02.360> have<00:00:03.360> always<00:00:03.659> been<00:00:03.929> interested<00:00:04.140> in<00:00:04.380> science

00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:04.439 
I have always been interested in science

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:06.980 
I have always been interested in science
since<00:00:05.100> I<00:00:05.580> was<00:00:05.850> very<00:00:06.089> young<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:06.779> in<00:00:06.870> that

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
since I was very young and in that

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.080 
since I was very young and in that
curiosity<00:00:07.649> carried<00:00:08.280> with<00:00:08.430> me<00:00:08.460> as<00:00:08.820> I've<00:00:08.969> done

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
curiosity carried with me as I've done

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.730 
curiosity carried with me as I've done
science<00:00:09.389> research<00:00:09.840> in<00:00:10.110> middle<00:00:10.349> school<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.590> in

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
science research in middle school and in

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.900 
science research in middle school and in
high<00:00:10.800> school<00:00:12.349> my<00:00:13.349> research<00:00:13.799> focuses<00:00:14.400> on<00:00:14.610> how

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
high school my research focuses on how

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.420 
high school my research focuses on how
indoor<00:00:15.480> air<00:00:15.660> pollutants<00:00:16.020> impact<00:00:17.009> the<00:00:17.220> lung

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
indoor air pollutants impact the lung

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.970 
indoor air pollutants impact the lung
health<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.939> asthmatic<00:00:18.060> patients<00:00:18.930> or<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.739> big

health of asthmatic patients or the big
picture<00:00:20.430> behind<00:00:20.849> the<00:00:20.970> model<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.630> how<00:00:21.960> can<00:00:22.200> we

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.290 
picture behind the model is how can we

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.929 
picture behind the model is how can we
make<00:00:22.470> more<00:00:22.710> accurate<00:00:22.890> predictions<00:00:23.610> of<00:00:23.730> lung

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
make more accurate predictions of lung

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.479 
make more accurate predictions of lung
health<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.809> that<00:00:25.050> when<00:00:25.529> we<00:00:25.649> go<00:00:25.829> in<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.009> treat

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:26.489 
health so that when we go in to treat

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.030 
health so that when we go in to treat
we're<00:00:26.730> not<00:00:26.849> just<00:00:27.180> treating<00:00:27.540> the<00:00:28.290> symptoms<00:00:28.890> of

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.040 
we're not just treating the symptoms of

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.409 
we're not just treating the symptoms of
the<00:00:29.160> disorder<00:00:29.279> but<00:00:30.000> rather<00:00:30.149> we're

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
the disorder but rather we're

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.240 
the disorder but rather we're
eradicating<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.259> disorder<00:00:31.619> from<00:00:31.770> the<00:00:31.950> root

going<00:00:34.940> to<00:00:35.030> Intel<00:00:35.420> ICF<00:00:35.840> was<00:00:36.140> an<00:00:36.260> opportunity

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
going to Intel ICF was an opportunity

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.860 
going to Intel ICF was an opportunity
for<00:00:36.890> us<00:00:37.130> to<00:00:37.160> share<00:00:37.520> our<00:00:37.700> research<00:00:38.060> and<00:00:38.300> receive

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
feedback at a young age for people who

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.060 
feedback at a young age for people who
are<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:41.510> well<00:00:41.720> established<00:00:41.900> in<00:00:42.380> their<00:00:42.590> fields

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
are so well established in their fields

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.860 
are so well established in their fields
every<00:00:43.580> year<00:00:43.820> that<00:00:43.970> I<00:00:44.000> went<00:00:44.150> to<00:00:44.270> AI<00:00:44.330> SEF<00:00:44.690> I

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
every year that I went to AI SEF I

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.530 
every year that I went to AI SEF I
looked<00:00:45.140> forward<00:00:45.440> to<00:00:45.559> it<00:00:45.710> it<00:00:46.040> was<00:00:46.550> just<00:00:46.730> kind<00:00:47.480> of

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
looked forward to it it was just kind of

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.500 
looked forward to it it was just kind of
a<00:00:47.630> continuation<00:00:48.050> of<00:00:48.350> my<00:00:48.410> research

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.530 

until<00:00:53.290> STS<00:00:53.829> was<00:00:54.160> a<00:00:54.190> completely<00:00:54.850> different<00:00:55.090> but

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
until STS was a completely different but

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.020 
until STS was a completely different but
also<00:00:56.020> incredibly<00:00:56.860> life-changing<00:00:57.460> experience

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
also incredibly life-changing experience

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.479 
also incredibly life-changing experience
we<00:00:58.450> were<00:00:58.570> with<00:00:58.750> 40<00:00:59.170> other<00:00:59.350> students<00:00:59.920> who<00:01:00.100> had

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
we were with 40 other students who had

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.340 
we were with 40 other students who had
incredible<00:01:01.120> research<00:01:01.360> projects<00:01:01.809> as<00:01:01.930> well<00:01:02.079> so

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
incredible research projects as well so

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.140 
incredible research projects as well so
it<00:01:02.470> was<00:01:02.620> very<00:01:02.800> much<00:01:02.920> like<00:01:03.250> we<00:01:03.640> wanted<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:03.970> learn

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
it was very much like we wanted to learn

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.430 
it was very much like we wanted to learn
from<00:01:04.390> each<00:01:04.510> other<00:01:04.750> and<00:01:04.900> share<00:01:04.960> what<00:01:05.320> we've

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
from each other and share what we've

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.440 
from each other and share what we've
done

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
on a project that dealt with big data

on a project that dealt with big data
statistically<00:01:16.250> analyzing<00:01:16.969> air<00:01:17.149> pollution

that<00:01:22.130> this<00:01:22.280> is<00:01:22.399> really<00:01:22.579> important<00:01:23.179> and<00:01:23.299> it's

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
that this is really important and it's

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.270 
that this is really important and it's

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
really start the conversation for how we

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.760 
really start the conversation for how we
can<00:01:43.399> improve<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:44.509> ratio<00:01:44.990> of<00:01:45.200> girls<00:01:45.409> to<00:01:45.619> boys

intel has been a huge part of my love

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.480 
intel has been a huge part of my love
for<00:01:53.020> science<00:01:53.200> and<00:01:53.620> they've<00:01:53.830> definitely<00:01:54.130> been

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
for science and they've definitely been

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.880 
for science and they've definitely been
a<00:01:54.760> catalyst<00:01:55.390> in<00:01:55.600> my<00:01:55.780> education<00:01:56.410> because<00:01:56.770> this

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
a catalyst in my education because this

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.800 
a catalyst in my education because this
has<00:01:57.040> really<00:01:57.550> helped<00:01:57.880> me<00:01:58.090> realize<00:01:58.480> that

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
has really helped me realize that

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.240
