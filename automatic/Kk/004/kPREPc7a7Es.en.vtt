00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:26.279 
double-a batteries anyway read this

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:30.219 
double-a batteries anyway read this
maybe<00:05:26.789> changes<00:05:27.479> of<00:05:27.599> emergency<00:05:28.199> but

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
maybe changes of emergency but

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:43.929
