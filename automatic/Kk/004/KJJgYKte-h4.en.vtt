here

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
here

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.370 
here
and<00:00:18.180> there<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:18.750> can<00:00:18.869> see<00:00:18.990> they're<00:00:19.140> properly

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
and there you can see they're properly

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.970 
and there you can see they're properly
aligned<00:00:20.510> there<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.869> top<00:00:22.080> dead<00:00:22.320> center<00:00:22.740> here

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
aligned there is a top dead center here

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.620 
aligned there is a top dead center here
so<00:00:26.060> we've<00:00:27.060> got<00:00:27.560> got<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> thing<00:00:28.890> going<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.220> here

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
so we've got got a thing going on here

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.700 
so we've got got a thing going on here
when<00:00:30.630> we<00:00:30.750> crank<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.140> over<00:00:34.640> the<00:00:35.640> exhaust<00:00:35.940> cam

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
when we crank it over the exhaust cam

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.560 
when we crank it over the exhaust cam
it's<00:00:37.710> slightly<00:00:38.040> ahead<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.700> intake<00:00:39.239> cam

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
it's slightly ahead of the intake cam

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.729 
it's slightly ahead of the intake cam
and<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.079> changes<00:00:41.840> twice<00:00:42.840> per<00:00:43.079> revolution<00:00:43.320> of

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
and the changes twice per revolution of

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.170 
and the changes twice per revolution of
crank<00:00:44.040> four<00:00:44.399> times<00:00:44.640> for<00:00:44.940> every<00:00:45.360> your<00:00:45.840> cams<00:00:47.270> and

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
crank four times for every your cams and

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.490 
crank four times for every your cams and
tensioner<00:00:51.180> seems<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.050> be<00:00:52.170> having<00:00:52.410> trouble

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
tensioner seems to be having trouble

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.779 
tensioner seems to be having trouble
keeping<00:00:52.829> up<00:00:54.649> you<00:00:55.649> can<00:00:55.860> see<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.100> goes<00:00:56.430> slack

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
keeping up you can see it goes slack

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.569 
keeping up you can see it goes slack
there<00:00:57.120> that's<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.870> used<00:00:58.109> tension<00:00:58.559> up<00:00:58.710> because

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
there that's a used tension up because

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.660 
there that's a used tension up because
our<00:00:59.789> local<00:01:00.149> auto<00:01:00.300> parts<00:01:00.420> store<00:01:01.520> doesn't<00:01:02.520> have

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
our local auto parts store doesn't have

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:12.219 
our local auto parts store doesn't have
the<00:01:02.879> first-generation<00:01:03.650> parts<00:01:06.799> so

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:20.520 

and<00:01:13.009> kind<00:01:13.250> of<00:01:13.310> catch<00:01:13.520> it<00:01:13.700> here<00:01:13.880> slack<00:01:14.240> it<00:01:14.420> up

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:33.560 

see<00:01:21.530> some<00:01:21.680> catch<00:01:21.920> it<00:01:22.100> here

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.380 

you<00:01:34.570> see<00:01:34.780> here<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.079> chain<00:01:35.320> gets<00:01:35.500> slack

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.669 

because<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.659> springs<00:01:40.960> are<00:01:41.110> unloaded<00:01:41.500> back

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
because the springs are unloaded back

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:44.959 
because the springs are unloaded back
here<00:01:42.039> and<00:01:42.250> then<00:01:42.939> just<00:01:43.240> a<00:01:43.329> little<00:01:43.360> turn<00:01:43.899> more

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
here and then just a little turn more

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.059 
here and then just a little turn more
and<00:01:45.969> you<00:01:46.750> slap<00:01:47.079> into<00:01:47.319> the<00:01:47.470> cover<00:01:47.679> they're<00:01:47.890> nice

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
and you slap into the cover they're nice

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:55.590 
and you slap into the cover they're nice
and<00:01:48.100> tight<00:01:48.460> now<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:52.090> that's<00:01:52.630> a<00:01:52.869> situation
