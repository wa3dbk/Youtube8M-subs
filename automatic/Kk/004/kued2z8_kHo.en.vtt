22nd 2013 and it is Earth Day so I
thought<00:00:06.660> I'd<00:00:06.779> make<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:06.990> quick<00:00:07.200> video<00:00:07.639> stating

a positive effect on this earth so that

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.740 
a positive effect on this earth so that
we<00:01:10.260> leave<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.710> better<00:01:11.549> world<00:01:11.729> for<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.510> future

facts about our planet for you to ponder

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.440 
facts about our planet for you to ponder
you<00:01:18.330> have<00:01:18.450> 23<00:01:18.869> hours<00:01:19.020> 56<00:01:19.650> seconds<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.330> 23<00:01:21.330> hours

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
you have 23 hours 56 seconds of 23 hours

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.929 
you have 23 hours 56 seconds of 23 hours
56<00:01:21.869> minutes<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.380> 4.0<00:01:22.950> 91<00:01:23.280> seconds<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.820> it

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
56 minutes and 4.0 91 seconds of it

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.620 
56 minutes and 4.0 91 seconds of it
every<00:01:24.750> day<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:26.460> number<00:01:26.640> one<00:01:26.850> there<00:01:27.210> are<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> lot

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
every day so number one there are a lot

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.910 
every day so number one there are a lot
of<00:01:27.659> different<00:01:27.750> ways<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.110> measure<00:01:28.380> how<00:01:28.650> long<00:01:28.710> it

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
of different ways to measure how long it

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.530 
of different ways to measure how long it
takes<00:01:29.280> for<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.579> earth<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.700> go<00:01:30.030> around<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.360> Sun

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
takes for the earth to go around the Sun

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.770 
takes for the earth to go around the Sun
but<00:01:31.229> if<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.560> were<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.829> say<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.549> takes<00:01:32.850> pi<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
but if you were to say it takes pi the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.310 
but if you were to say it takes pi the
number<00:01:34.020> pi<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:35.070> constant<00:01:35.460> pi<00:01:35.630> x<00:01:36.630> 10<00:01:36.990> million

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
number pi the constant pi x 10 million

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.130 
number pi the constant pi x 10 million
seconds<00:01:37.799> you'll<00:01:38.369> only<00:01:38.579> be<00:01:38.850> about<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.450> half<00:01:39.960> a

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
seconds you'll only be about a half a

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.340 
seconds you'll only be about a half a
person<00:01:40.439> off<00:01:40.729> so<00:01:41.729> that's<00:01:41.820> again<00:01:42.060> pie<00:01:42.390> time<00:01:43.170> by

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
person off so that's again pie time by

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.399 
person off so that's again pie time by
10<00:01:43.560> million<00:01:44.030> seconds<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:46.020> earth<00:01:46.170> has<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
10 million seconds the earth has a

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.560 
10 million seconds the earth has a
volume<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.950> about<00:01:46.979> one<00:01:47.670> trillion<00:01:48.000> cubic

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
volume of about one trillion cubic

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.350 
volume of about one trillion cubic
kilometers<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.640> kind<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.970> picture<00:01:51.329> a

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
kilometers so can you kind of picture a

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.569 
kilometers so can you kind of picture a
cube<00:01:51.780> with<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:52.590> thousand<00:01:53.159> meters<00:01:53.369> high

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
kinda weird but let me just explain it

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.709 
kinda weird but let me just explain it

of the earth through the poles is 7880
2.4<00:02:44.340> miles<00:02:44.989> but<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.230> is<00:02:46.620> seven<00:02:47.129> thousand<00:02:47.549> nine

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730

hundred and eight point eight miles
through<00:02:50.129> the<00:02:50.189> equator<00:02:50.669> that's<00:02:51.569> a<00:02:51.629> difference

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
through the equator that's a difference

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.440 
through the equator that's a difference
of<00:02:51.989> about<00:02:52.139> forty<00:02:52.650> three<00:02:52.769> kilometers<00:02:53.370> so<00:02:54.090> that

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
of about forty three kilometers so that

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.240 
of about forty three kilometers so that
works<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.900> become<00:02:55.139> a<00:02:55.169> point<00:02:55.470> three<00:02:55.739> percent

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
works to become a point three percent

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.490 
works to become a point three percent
difference<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:57.540> you're<00:02:57.689> really<00:02:57.870> pretty<00:02:58.169> close

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
difference so you're really pretty close

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.379 
difference so you're really pretty close

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
not only is it flattened at the poles

not only is it flattened at the poles
