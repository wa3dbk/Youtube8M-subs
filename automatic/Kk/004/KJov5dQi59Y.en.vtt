00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 the captain's pat before the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.350
 press conference has a reason to 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.780
 lead the competition artillery 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.840
 it is not for everyone not position that the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.880
 léo swears that there is no pressure 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.810
 I do not even want to be a top scorer. 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.880
 Why would I be lying? 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.880
 Of course, every player would like this with 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.300
 sure but it's good it's not my focus 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.099
 main part of the alvirrubro side if they 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.529
 guess what you're not going to do in the game 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.120
 at least I would have asked him to take a 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.130
 relieved almost everything they 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.290
 proposed it worked out and we all that we 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.000
 we tried defensively went wrong 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.890
 the second encounter between drugs and 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.570
 tricolor in this Pernambuco 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.450
 better for the holy cross the technical vica 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.059
 who tested and hit the offensive power to 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.980
 stateroom made two goals but this 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.530
 it's just a detail 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.989
 so let's go to the starting story soon 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.000
 three minutes into the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:02.579
 santa or nautical out front 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.840
 a hard blow a silly move and it ends 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.280
 taking aim and this is logical that it stayed there 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.610
 You start to play a movie because 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.010
 there is a way for the team to play with a 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.540
 posture and you take a goal 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.759
 everything you think imagines the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.770
 game and the draw 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.770
 and added another detail 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.140
 the classic is always decided in detail 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.620
 huh 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.470
 the beginning of the game and we take the 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.090
 staff behaved well comes into play 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.640
 head lighthouse 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.100
 léo wins cross wins and has 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.280
 run over to celebrate the 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.280
 turning 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.010
 and for the most suspicious fan of the 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.350
 tricolor that was still with taste 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.900
 bitter of defeats for sport 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.230
 he had already sung here in the replay of 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:02.390
 victory has flavor of honey is when flávio 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.390
 mouse hunt crosses the ball reaches him 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.900
 in the second stage had more goalscoring 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.500
 shows that it is risky with it 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.960
 same 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.840
 light bush it may even have saved 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:23.610
 arsa book chiba what the che but to be 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.640
 the top scorer of Pernambuco with eight 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:31.800
 goals leo out in front wins dwe goal 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.090
 the cheer then touch the 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.430
 track editing 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.910
 in fact my proof was mine. 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.180
 called image the victory today you have 12 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.180
 huh 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.920
 There are still Carlos Alberto dribbling and 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:58.850
 scoring left- back rookie zé 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.700
 carlos barter or nautical, decreasing with 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.160
 two goals in two minutes but in order to 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.290
 santa's first win game in 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.790
 classic this season the second 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.310
 thrashing the arena 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.900
 cheerleading happiness party 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.480
 top scorer 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.150
 The ball arrived and sometimes it came with 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.460
 sure we are sure that from the 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.920
 From this moment things will fit together. 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.290
 better and details how it explains 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.820
 with the same lightness that pat to 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.770
 greeting the léo gamalho 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.210
 are the details that make the difference in this 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.030
 big game 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.070
 so I saw it in the game today in a game 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.050
 equal in tactical part and positioning 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.820
 of the two teams 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.440
 only we are happier in the 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.730
 finalizations we created some chances 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.730
 come on we did
