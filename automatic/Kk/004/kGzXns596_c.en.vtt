00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Found an interesting channel where you can 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.189
 look at petting kinders and others 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.809
 persons with toys and also assembly lego 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:13.080
 developing children's games and various 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.210
 contests with prizes recommend salute 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.020
 guys you watch the channel to five shows 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.690
 plus or minus 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.970
 we continue the marathon of game genres and 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:26.130
 your next vote 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.980
 action game is probably an action game is 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.810
 most popular genre and to appreciate 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.120
 him we will build on the most 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.059
 let his famous representatives 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.180
 try to consider the pros and cons 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.530
 action games 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.480
 cons 1 minus linearity yes i am aware 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.760
 what are the exceptions 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.640
 but most of the action games aren't 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.160
 suggest no variation and 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.500
 before friends can not boast what 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.320
 an unusual way you chose such 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.300
 the rides unfortunately do not give 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.109
 roam our fantasies 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.840
 2 minus plot half-life for another 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.720
 They say that the action story can be 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.119
 only strong games of this kind 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.430
 like summer blockbusters action and 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.189
 try not to clog players 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.400
 complex story and give us stories 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.439
 like alien invasion 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.100
 alternate worlds or military successes 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.560
 in the usa the main thing is to entertain player 3 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.860
 minus the duration of the game in the genre 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.070
 action most often have very short it 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.540
 of course trying to compensate 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.060
 saturation but mostly side 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.790
 enough only on the shock trailer 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.400
 duration of course a little trouble but 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.240
 at equal cost among other genres 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.659
 6 o'clock 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.920
 action gameplay vs. 60 wpg or 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:53.670
 strategies are quite a big difference 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.320
 Pros 1 plus the dynamics of the action game is not in vain 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.780
 so called 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.659
 This and the main trump for them not 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.119
 you get bored on the screen almost constantly 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.610
 something happens events replace each other 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.330
 friend and u don't you sit in place 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.820
 second plus perhaps no fun 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.910
 another genre can not boast such 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.580
 charge of fun as an action and developers 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.610
 try to do everything so that the player does not 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.980
 bored with tv or monitor 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.270
 move go features gameplay submission 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.980
 humor and music and this is not to mention 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.150
 a cooperative game that increases 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.260
 fan at times 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.200
 3 + entertainment is the trump card 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.810
 action games that drags them to the top 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.050
 sales last ten years that way 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.200
 excellent visual presentation because it is 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.590
 cool action games push graphics forward 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.330
 it is they who praise the developers on 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.120
 presentations and want to experience 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.030
 power of your pc or console 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:02.430
 action games are definitely the most beautiful and 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.590
 spectacular genre of the pros and cons leave 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.170

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.810
 It shows how action games popular with

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.930
 voting action and do not like only 14 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.420
