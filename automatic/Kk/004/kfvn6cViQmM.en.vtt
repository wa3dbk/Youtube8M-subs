00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.540
 dedication to you so I think you

 well we're here today for a 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.550
 any new video second episode of 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.140
 theories or truth so in this episode 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.769
 we will talk about one piece a good guy 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.320
 that I love 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.629
 we will talk about a character on 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.190
 character of leroux shanks so we go 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.480
 start right now I want before 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.700
 everything to clarify that this theory is 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.200
 not me I found on the internet and 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.289
 I will put you the link in descriptions 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.559
 so here is to start I think 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.300
 that all fans know that shanks 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.780
 leroux when he was younger he 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.930
 is part of the crew of goldie 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.210
 rogers dont cup 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.950
 so why is not he where is 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.410
 hidden the one piece since he was there 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.300
 when gold rogers to hide it then 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.979
 why did not he get but if 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.560
 precisely did he know it but he 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.899
 could not just access the treasure 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.060
 so I will explain to you as I 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.849
 go state their gold said the rodgers the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.740
 famous 10 are actually those are the 

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:30.780
 so said my little he made world leaves 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.399
 wrist strap psg all this are part 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.709
 of a line of fighters really 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.830
 very powerful way even when we see 

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:40.740
 the manga school animated rodant are 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.819
 very powerful fighters and gold rogers 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.530
 was part of this lineage 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:44.880
 and if precisely it was necessary to be part 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.429
 of this lineage to access the treasure 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.569
 so chanclu can not go there can not 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.459
 not access it and precisely there 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:53.789
 would look for someone with the famous 10 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:57.780
 to access it so I 'll take a 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:00.509
 example when black beard betrayed beard 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.789
 white so black beard it is and 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.720
 marshall says itx so that's a guy 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.959
 who is part of this lineage 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.399
 so when he betrayed white beard she 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.709
 went after the beard 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.910
 black and in an episode we see that 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.200
 shanks will see white beard and tell him 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.590
 stop and stop for them to stop 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.480
 continue for that to pursue 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.100
 black beard but what does it have to 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.480
 fuck france 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.520
 devices like that but what is it 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.170
 that he does not care that bach that the 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.250
 market is that yes that marshall's 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.200
 unemployed titles so benoÃ®t bar 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.360
 notice what what is 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.480
 that can make him just because 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.440
 that he wants to lose none said and 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.810
 now i will explain to you 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.990
 how he got this scar 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.390
 which ties so simply that she has 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.550
 tried to enlist black beard he has 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.700
 asked to take him to the slopes 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.820
 black beard refused they fought 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.920
 he got this scar so is 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.220
 now let's talk about a second 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.690
 in the second I see how we can 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.080
 call that but true end a second 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.650
 argument 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.470
 yeah that's an argument made shanks 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.900
 on is blue field it was a worse 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.690
 is really very powerful that's what he 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.970
 is limit as strong as white beard 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.470
 as long as it does cherry blue one of 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.390
 the most rotten mothers this is 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.820
 really the beginning this is where the son 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.060
 will get everybody in that 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.740
 does it there so 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.240
 and why did he save luffy 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.990
 why was he taking the risk of losing 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.850
 his arm for for a kid who knows 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.920
 barely and why are you giving and his 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.240
 hat by no why did you become his 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.030
 hat to the net while he says he 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.880
 even his hat is his treasure 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.770
 just to have the confidence of 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.760
 levie so here you will tell me why is 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.740
 what they are not directly the 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.140
 son when he is small because shanks 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.670
 knows the dangers of the new world 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.680
 he knows very well that the son succeed 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.690
 is not so he waits a few years 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.920
 that the son harden and then 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.060
 as will be bigger he will have the 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.100
 trust of our girls and so 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.700
 necessarily the fiba he will trust and 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.550
 and will be seen so me it's all 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.320
 than what I have to say that on this 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.640
 theory of which I put the link of 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.230
 sources in descriptions do not hesitate to 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.670
 to read is very very far to read 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.140
 but it's really very interesting 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.880
 I can not say everything so much 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.470
 it was long so go I hope that 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.480

 the next that the strength of the gamer be 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.090
