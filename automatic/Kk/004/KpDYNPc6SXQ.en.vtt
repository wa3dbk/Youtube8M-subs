I just unwrap them and pop them in that

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.610 
I just unwrap them and pop them in that
way<00:03:00.970> but<00:03:01.030> you<00:03:01.329> can<00:03:01.480> also<00:03:01.659> keep<00:03:01.959> them<00:03:02.170> packaged

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
way but you can also keep them packaged

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.009 
way but you can also keep them packaged
up<00:03:02.889> as<00:03:03.189> well<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:04.030> then<00:03:04.209> you're<00:03:04.359> going<00:03:04.510> to<00:03:04.629> seal

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
up as well and then you're going to seal

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:11.520 
up as well and then you're going to seal
them<00:03:05.290> into<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:06.189> jar<00:03:09.450> next<00:03:10.450> onto<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.900> label<00:03:11.139> so

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
them into the jar next onto the label so

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.190 
them into the jar next onto the label so
as<00:03:11.650> I<00:03:11.829> said<00:03:12.069> I<00:03:12.099> use<00:03:12.489> PicMonkey<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.720> make<00:03:13.900> the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
as I said I use PicMonkey to make the

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.990 
as I said I use PicMonkey to make the
label<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:15.909> just<00:03:16.239> popped<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:17.109> down<00:03:17.379> to<00:03:17.620> size

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
label and I just popped it down to size

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.640 
label and I just popped it down to size
and<00:03:19.000> just<00:03:19.150> kept<00:03:19.359> printing<00:03:19.569> it<00:03:19.959> until<00:03:20.319> I<00:03:20.349> got

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
and just kept printing it until I got

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.610 
and just kept printing it until I got
the<00:03:20.889> right<00:03:20.919> sort<00:03:21.730> of<00:03:21.910> size<00:03:22.269> and<00:03:22.750> then<00:03:23.319> you<00:03:23.440> can

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
the right sort of size and then you can

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.220 
the right sort of size and then you can
either<00:03:23.769> print<00:03:24.129> this<00:03:24.400> onto<00:03:24.970> a<00:03:25.269> sheet<00:03:25.569> of<00:03:25.750> sticky

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
either print this onto a sheet of sticky

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.539 
either print this onto a sheet of sticky
labels<00:03:26.829> or<00:03:27.459> you<00:03:27.819> can<00:03:28.030> use<00:03:28.269> spray<00:03:28.690> mount<00:03:29.049> to

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
labels or you can use spray mount to

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.270 
labels or you can use spray mount to
spray<00:03:30.549> onto<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.239> paper<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.620> glue<00:03:32.859> this<00:03:33.040> on

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
spray onto the paper to glue this on

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.899 
spray onto the paper to glue this on
this<00:03:33.760> way<00:03:34.829> then<00:03:35.829> you're<00:03:36.069> gonna<00:03:36.220> finish<00:03:36.549> off

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909 
this way then you're gonna finish off

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.210 
this way then you're gonna finish off
with<00:03:37.209> your<00:03:37.629> chase<00:03:38.139> and<00:03:38.409> color<00:03:38.680> ribbon

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
with your chase and color ribbon

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.089 
with your chase and color ribbon
depending<00:03:39.879> on<00:03:40.000> your<00:03:40.120> theme<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:40.900> I<00:03:41.349> just<00:03:41.620> put<00:03:41.859> a

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.009 
depending on your theme and I just put a
little<00:03:42.370> bit<00:03:42.579> of<00:03:42.699> double-sided<00:03:43.269> tape<00:03:43.720> on<00:03:43.930> one

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
little bit of double-sided tape on one

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.110 
little bit of double-sided tape on one
of<00:03:44.319> the<00:03:44.590> ends<00:03:44.829> of<00:03:44.919> the<00:03:45.010> ribbon<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.549> just

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
of the ends of the ribbon and just

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.050 
of the ends of the ribbon and just
threaded<00:03:46.659> it<00:03:46.810> through<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:47.620> fold<00:03:48.430> it<00:03:48.639> over<00:03:48.790> the

ends<00:03:49.750> of<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:49.959> ribbon<00:03:50.139> so<00:03:50.709> it<00:03:51.040> just<00:03:51.370> looks<00:03:51.970> neat

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
ends of the ribbon so it just looks neat

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:56.039 
ends of the ribbon so it just looks neat
and<00:03:52.780> tidy<00:03:53.609> so<00:03:54.609> last<00:03:54.879> but<00:03:55.120> not<00:03:55.239> least<00:03:55.479> on<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:55.930> the

mint<00:03:56.319> to<00:03:56.560> be<00:03:56.739> tic-tac<00:03:57.519> so<00:03:57.909> you<00:03:58.060> will<00:03:58.239> need<00:03:58.449> some

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
mint to be tic-tac so you will need some

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.930 
mint to be tic-tac so you will need some
washi<00:03:59.049> tape<00:03:59.970> some<00:04:00.970> scissors

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.450 
some spray mounts and PicMonkey again
and<00:04:08.990> I'll<00:04:09.990> see<00:04:10.260> some<00:04:10.500> tic-tacs<00:04:10.740> in<00:04:11.310> you're

and I'll see some tic-tacs in you're
chasing<00:04:11.970> color<00:04:12.440> so<00:04:13.440> first<00:04:13.770> off<00:04:13.980> you're<00:04:14.220> gonna

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
chasing color so first off you're gonna

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.970 
chasing color so first off you're gonna
create<00:04:14.670> your<00:04:14.820> label<00:04:15.390> again<00:04:15.810> using<00:04:16.230> PicMonkey

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
create your label again using PicMonkey

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.160 
create your label again using PicMonkey
and<00:04:17.400> you're<00:04:17.610> gonna<00:04:17.790> bring<00:04:18.060> this<00:04:18.269> down<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.840> size

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
and you're gonna bring this down to size

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.170 
and you're gonna bring this down to size
so<00:04:19.650> it<00:04:20.130> covers<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:21.030> top<00:04:21.660> of<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.110> tic<00:04:22.350> tac<00:04:22.620> box

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
so it covers the top of the tic tac box

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.880 
so it covers the top of the tic tac box
then<00:04:24.180> you're<00:04:24.390> gonna<00:04:24.540> cut<00:04:24.870> this<00:04:25.020> out<00:04:25.320> and

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
then you're gonna cut this out and

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.490 
then you're gonna cut this out and
either<00:04:26.100> print<00:04:26.490> it<00:04:26.670> on<00:04:26.910> sticky<00:04:27.540> label<00:04:27.900> again<00:04:28.170> or

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
either print it on sticky label again or

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.910 
either print it on sticky label again or
spray<00:04:29.250> it<00:04:29.280> with<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.640> spray<00:04:30.090> mount<00:04:30.300> glue<00:04:30.920> and

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
spray it with the spray mount glue and

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.500 
spray it with the spray mount glue and
then<00:04:32.130> you're<00:04:32.280> just<00:04:32.430> gonna<00:04:32.610> check<00:04:33.060> that<00:04:33.330> this

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
then you're just gonna check that this

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.610 
then you're just gonna check that this
all<00:04:33.750> folds<00:04:34.320> over<00:04:34.530> nicely<00:04:35.720> then<00:04:36.720> spray<00:04:37.260> it<00:04:37.290> with

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
all folds over nicely then spray it with

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.070 
all folds over nicely then spray it with
the<00:04:37.680> spray<00:04:37.860> mount<00:04:38.340> glue<00:04:38.790> and<00:04:39.090> then<00:04:39.660> you<00:04:39.840> can

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
the spray mount glue and then you can

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.870 
the spray mount glue and then you can
just<00:04:40.380> stick<00:04:40.800> it<00:04:40.950> into<00:04:41.130> place

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
just stick it into place

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.470 
just stick it into place
or<00:04:41.940> like<00:04:42.510> I<00:04:42.750> said<00:04:42.810> you<00:04:43.050> use<00:04:43.500> a<00:04:43.830> sticky<00:04:44.760> label<00:04:45.240> to

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
or like I said you use a sticky label to

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.830 
or like I said you use a sticky label to
stick<00:04:45.750> that<00:04:45.990> on<00:04:46.670> so<00:04:47.670> just<00:04:47.910> to<00:04:48.120> finish<00:04:48.330> this<00:04:48.600> off

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
stick that on so just to finish this off

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.470 
stick that on so just to finish this off

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
tape around the edge and this just

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.510 
tape around the edge and this just
really<00:04:54.150> finishes<00:04:54.930> off<00:04:55.320> this<00:04:55.680> little<00:04:56.100> tic<00:04:56.280> tac

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520
