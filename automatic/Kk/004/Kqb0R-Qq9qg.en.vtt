00:00:00.045 --> 00:00:01.370
hello

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.595
today we are going to make beef pastries. 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.659
The ingredients are:

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.300
300 grams minced beef

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.970
4 chopped onions

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.400
4 diced tomatoes

00:00:13.306 --> 00:00:15.735
1 1/2 tablespoon molasses

00:00:15.856 --> 00:00:17.800
Egg - Cinnamon - Mixed spices

00:00:17.823 --> 00:00:19.100
Black pepper

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.008
1/3 cup tahini

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.800
Lemon squeezed

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:27.200
is added in a small amount because there are a lot of ingredients. 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:35.300
Mix everything together. 

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.800
Before adding the tahini, 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.000
we mix it with the lemon 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.300
and stir very well 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.800
then add tomatoes. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.413
Brush a little bit of oil on the tray 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.118
so as the dough will not become crunchy. 

00:02:20.804 --> 00:02:25.283
Take a piece of the dough
and knead it in your hands.

00:02:30.771 --> 00:02:37.458
Make a ball between your thumb 
and fore finger and cut off with a spoon.

00:02:58.831 --> 00:03:04.365
After we are done with the dough leave it to relax for about 10 minutes.

00:03:04.365 --> 00:03:05.365
Knead it and start putting 

00:03:05.365 --> 00:03:18.249
the meat in the middle and we press in.
