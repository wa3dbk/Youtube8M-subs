 deterioration 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.540

 bump don't crash him like that 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.500
 briefly bypass the path that's important and not 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.350
 bump so that the waste does not carry 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.320
 exploded along the way so let's get here 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.229
