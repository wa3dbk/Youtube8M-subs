 to Israel from her to her sinners so 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.680
 which the stars of the heavens and their 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.079
 stars will not give their light and the sun will 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.110
 will darken at birth and the moon will not give its 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:24.960
 shine and I will punish the world for its 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.610

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.500
 heavens and the earth will move from its place 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.810

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.020
 armies and on the day of the ardor of his 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.360
 anger and as a persecuted gazelle and as 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.750
 sheep without a shepherd each will look towards 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.250
 his people and everyone will hear his land 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.500
 whoever is found will be 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.530
 balanced and whatever that is why 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.869

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.390
