00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
headsculpt although I would say the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.670 
headsculpt although I would say the
flesh<00:02:39.610> colour<00:02:39.910> of<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.270> skin<00:02:40.570> of<00:02:40.810> Nightwing<00:02:41.230> is

kind<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.160> pale<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:43.090> think<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:43.690> should<00:02:43.840> be<00:02:43.930> a

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
kind of pale I think you should be a

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.810 
kind of pale I think you should be a
little<00:02:44.050> bit<00:02:44.230> dark<00:02:44.410> whole<00:02:44.590> lil<00:02:45.250> bit<00:02:45.370> darker<00:02:45.700> and

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
little bit dark whole lil bit darker and

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.400 
little bit dark whole lil bit darker and
have<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.000> bit<00:02:46.270> shading<00:02:46.690> in<00:02:46.780> there<00:02:46.960> because

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
have a bit shading in there because

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.170 
have a bit shading in there because
really<00:02:47.650> is<00:02:47.830> no<00:02:48.010> shading<00:02:48.400> in<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:48.700> head<00:02:48.880> scope

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
really is no shading in the head scope

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.110 
really is no shading in the head scope

knees a swivel at the top of the boot so
pretty<00:05:24.400> good<00:05:24.580> circulation<00:05:24.789> not<00:05:25.180> the<00:05:25.300> best

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
pretty good circulation not the best

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:26.700 
pretty good circulation not the best
obviously<00:05:25.810> because<00:05:26.050> it's<00:05:26.169> still<00:05:26.319> with<00:05:26.409> DC

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
obviously because it's still with DC

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.399 
obviously because it's still with DC
collectibles<00:05:27.300> but<00:05:28.300> I<00:05:28.599> mean<00:05:28.930> it's<00:05:29.050> alright<00:05:29.349> I

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:29.409 
collectibles but I mean it's alright I

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:31.890 
collectibles but I mean it's alright I
suppose<00:05:29.789> you<00:05:30.789> can<00:05:31.000> get<00:05:31.120> my<00:05:31.300> wing<00:05:31.479> to<00:05:31.630> stand

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
suppose you can get my wing to stand

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.839 
suppose you can get my wing to stand
pretty<00:05:32.469> easily<00:05:32.770> actually<00:05:33.310> so<00:05:33.550> there's<00:05:33.699> no

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 
pretty easily actually so there's no

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:36.930 
pretty easily actually so there's no
trouble<00:05:34.150> there<00:05:34.449> really<00:05:35.699> now<00:05:36.699> I'm<00:05:36.819> having

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
trouble there really now I'm having

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.459 
trouble there really now I'm having
trouble<00:05:37.300> though<00:05:37.419> bit<00:05:37.630> I<00:05:37.840> mean<00:05:38.020> he<00:05:38.169> is<00:05:38.229> pretty

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:38.469 
trouble though bit I mean he is pretty

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:40.499 
trouble though bit I mean he is pretty
easy<00:05:39.039> to<00:05:39.190> stand<00:05:39.490> up<00:05:39.639> so<00:05:39.759> it's<00:05:39.909> not<00:05:40.060> a<00:05:40.240> big

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:40.509 
easy to stand up so it's not a big

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:42.779 
easy to stand up so it's not a big
problem<00:05:40.690> there<00:05:41.250> let's<00:05:42.250> do<00:05:42.370> a<00:05:42.400> quick<00:05:42.610> size

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
problem there let's do a quick size

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.040 
problem there let's do a quick size
comparison<00:05:42.930> with<00:05:43.930> Batman<00:05:45.719> so<00:05:46.719> this<00:05:46.840> is<00:05:46.990> the

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
comparison with Batman so this is the

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.930 
comparison with Batman so this is the
Arkham<00:05:47.349> Asylum<00:05:47.409> Batman<00:05:48.009> and<00:05:48.460> as<00:05:48.550> you<00:05:48.699> can<00:05:48.759> see

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
Arkham Asylum Batman and as you can see

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.439 
Arkham Asylum Batman and as you can see
pretty<00:05:49.409> Burma<00:05:50.409> is<00:05:50.650> pretty<00:05:50.919> much<00:05:51.240> Batman<00:05:52.240> is

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
pretty Burma is pretty much Batman is

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:53.700 
pretty Burma is pretty much Batman is
taller<00:05:52.750> than<00:05:53.020> that<00:05:53.050> way<00:05:53.289> now<00:05:53.440> as<00:05:53.500> you<00:05:53.620> could

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
taller than that way now as you could

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.640 
taller than that way now as you could
see<00:05:53.919> clearly<00:05:54.219> which<00:05:55.060> is<00:05:55.210> I<00:05:55.419> think<00:05:55.810> in<00:05:56.349> scale<00:05:56.620> so

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
see clearly which is I think in scale so

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.980 
see clearly which is I think in scale so
that's<00:05:56.919> pretty<00:05:57.130> cool

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
that's pretty cool

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.140 
that's pretty cool
so<00:05:58.990> yes<00:05:59.139> of<00:05:59.349> the<00:05:59.440> equation<00:05:59.949> on<00:06:00.130> my<00:06:00.310> wing<00:06:00.490> always

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
so yes of the equation on my wing always

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.089 
so yes of the equation on my wing always
say<00:06:01.300> is<00:06:01.360> pretty<00:06:01.539> decent<00:06:02.020> as<00:06:02.199> I<00:06:02.259> said<00:06:02.650> I<00:06:02.860> don't

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:03.099 
say is pretty decent as I said I don't

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:04.620 
say is pretty decent as I said I don't
want<00:06:03.340> repeat<00:06:03.610> myself<00:06:03.729> there<00:06:04.090> but<00:06:04.539> the

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
want repeat myself there but the

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.110 
want repeat myself there but the
integration<00:06:05.050> I<00:06:05.469> mean<00:06:06.340> the<00:06:06.460> paint<00:06:06.699> job<00:06:06.880> is<00:06:07.060> very

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
integration I mean the paint job is very

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.529 
integration I mean the paint job is very
very<00:06:07.659> nice<00:06:07.779> very<00:06:08.710> well<00:06:08.949> done<00:06:09.190> looks<00:06:09.400> very<00:06:09.819> nice

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
but oily so probably because the the

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.300 
but oily so probably because the the
person<00:06:37.990> who<00:06:38.050> painted<00:06:38.380> the<00:06:38.589> fingerprint<00:06:39.099> oil

right<00:06:40.049> and<00:06:40.409> it<00:06:40.529> was<00:06:40.619> still<00:06:40.830> wet<00:06:41.069> so<00:06:41.129> that's

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:41.519 
right and it was still wet so that's

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:43.429 
right and it was still wet so that's
kind<00:06:41.909> of<00:06:41.969> unfortunate<00:06:42.269> but<00:06:42.989> after<00:06:43.349> a<00:06:43.379> while

kind of unfortunate but after a while
hopefully<00:06:43.889> it<00:06:44.099> does<00:06:44.219> wear<00:06:44.429> off<00:06:44.719> but<00:06:45.719> that's

00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:45.779 
hopefully it does wear off but that's

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:48.019 
hopefully it does wear off but that's
nothing<00:06:46.080> really<00:06:46.319> wrong<00:06:46.499> with<00:06:46.649> that<00:06:46.849> saying<00:06:47.849> so
