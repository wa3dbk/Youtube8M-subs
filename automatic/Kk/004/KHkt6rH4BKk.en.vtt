00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.799
 ah 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.470
 hello guys and very good guess who 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.970
 the micro has been forgotten again at home 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.829
 that's why I record with the recorder yes 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.270
 good today I bring you a review of 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:28.149
 ssangyong 85 millimeters 1.5 one pass 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:33.600
 of purpose precisely designed for 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:36.460
 video comes already with rings 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.950
 focus and diaphragm prepared for 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.379
 video and for fall of fall of focus that 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.329
 It's super comfortable for all of you use 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.790
 SLR cameras for video but not 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.700
 only SLRs because these goals 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:53.210
 they can also work in a camera 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.340
 of canon video or also on a black 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.640
 magic for example they work the same 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.300
 Threaded lenses for each of 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.230
 they 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.940
 efe fs also to send to speak 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.360
 with yes but not 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.770
 and it's a goal that is very targeted 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.780
 clear as everything we can expect 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.660
 from zhanjiang I have spoken to you in others 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.940
 videos of this mine I think that what is 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.430
 they dedicate themselves to the construction of 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.460
 goals I always believe that always 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.380
 true crisis always do manuals 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.170
 always manual but that's why it has a 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.119
 very good incidence and that's why they are so 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.720
 focused on the video because in video 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.250
 Well, what is most used is the approach 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.800
 manual and good then I was testing 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.040
 and he is testing it and what I 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.960
 impresses is and apart from this that is 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.400
 for the lighthouse spotlights that I in this case 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.110
 I have not used it 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.130
 but the diaphragm of this goal is 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.800
 totally manual and at the same time 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.050
 clicked or do not click the typical click 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.300
 click between each step that goes between each 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.790
 diaphragm that is changing but that is 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.280
 totally fluid and is super comfortable 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.300
 what I just put in the camera and 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.820
 I had an idea of â€‹â€‹how to focus 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.030
 perfectly and then expose what 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.020
 did was directly put it open to 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.250
 15 the diaphragm increase the speed 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.040
 so that to get a good 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.350
 exposition and focus then he lowered the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.130
 shutter speed and closed the 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.290
 diaphragm that looked right for this 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.890
 this situation and I recorded I made some 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.650
 how many tests at different times and 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.130
 the only let's say inconvenience that 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.920
 encounter is that at 85 millimeters at no 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.569
 have a stabilizer is a tad 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.549
 complicated to get a stable video 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.389
 and maybe if we use a stabilizer 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:49.969
 shoulder or something similar could help us 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.829
 very much yes or if we like to stabilize 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:53.989
 the computer that I 'm not very fan but 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.870
 sometimes it is necessary because it could be 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.579
 pretty good but I am I am very 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.530
 supporter of recording all the best 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.409
 possible and then edit the same in the 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.019
 computer for which I would have liked 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.280
 that this objective had a 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.189
 stabilizer but clear with 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.980
 stabilizer and a-15 would already be complicated 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:15.879
 then this is what I want to tell you 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.250
 about this goal is its allowed 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:22.669
 logically with this sharpness with this 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:26.060
 with this opening of 15 yo I would 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:27.349
 I was expecting a lot of aberration 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.000
 chromatic 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.870
 but in reality they could hardly 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.959
 notice the bone is when we are in 14 and 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.519
 we approach very much we can see a 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.590
 little bit of chromatic aberration but it's 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.139
 much less than for example a 50 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.420
 1.4 millimeters of canon for which I 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:46.340
 he has loved 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.670
 they could not prove it in a situation 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.319
 let's say more challenging to record something 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.720
 more seriously made a few tests 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.220
 simply but I hope that these can 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.959
 serve if you have any idea or any 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.310
 question about this goal by the way 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.010
 comes with a parasol that I have removed 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.200
 for the video but the cover is also 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.420
 very well made and every time the brand is 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.920
 also that impresses with something simple 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.580
 is that just see it inside 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.830
 you see that it does not have many pieces and how much 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.680
 simpler is that you notice that you get 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.979
 more quality is very robust 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.500
 I think it's plastic with metal but 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:24.010
 done in a good way to 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.960
 good way and these are my impressions 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.400
 I'm going to put them in some 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.350
 more recordings I've made with this 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.389
 objective simply as as evidence 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.700
 in different diaphragms something else 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.520
 stabilized something more moved so that 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.740
 You will see different ways of working 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.000
 with him but is is all that sees you 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.800
 only effect that I see in the 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.710
 vibrations with 85 millimeters without 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.360
 stabilizer this has been for today 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.740
 tell me something about your experiences with 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.240
 sam yang 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.550
 and what do you think of his goal 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.419
 specifically the price I do not remember 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.220
 now about 300 then around 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.800
 of 300 euros again this goal 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.410
 then according to the same hand you can 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.620
 find for 200 euros out there or 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.389
 even less but I think that buying 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.639
 an objective like this one second-hand 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.080
 there is no problem because being so 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.000
 simple in terms of construction 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.550
 it is very unlikely that there is any 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.470
 good defect I do not android or more I hope 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.150
 that you liked it is a look at the 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.250
 sample videos that I should put now 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.950
 because you may like them and you can 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.660
 create a little more 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.460
 it can be a little bit more of an idea of â€‹â€‹how 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.350
 go this goal we see the following 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.210
 video and I expect the typical now from me 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.280
 I like one to know if it has 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.660
 liked this kind of video and if you want 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.280
 to continue with something similar in the future 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.330
 in agreement we see the following video 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.290
 guys and until next time 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.290
 bye
