00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.150
 according to the most 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.180
 two years after we buy the game 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.920
 company trust Julia Safarbakova 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.619
 provide them 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:14.339
 direct sequel in which destruction 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:15.839
 robbery and destruction 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.130
 civilizations no one else 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.130
 as the son of the sovereign from the first part 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.220
 Of course the chance the glacier cannot 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.800
 do without the help of my fussy shash 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.970
 bypassing the phone and unconditionally 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.439
 Million executives seem to her 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.079
 it is not so bad for goblin it is graham lazy 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.659
 these disgusting is full to exist 

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:38.300
 is not only the main ones 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.309
 humorous heroes of the game but 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:42.629
 door with colleagues ready for their 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.190
 master not only kill the enemies but also 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.860
 sacrifice yourself if you have to 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.110
 gameplay compared to the first 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.950
 the release slightly changed the player 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.050
 still speaking on behalf of the mighty 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.960
 overlord the person who leads 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.280
 a detachments minions target south 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.230
 kill him destroy though hero 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.489
 and he can fight back on Kostanay 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.039
 need to 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:07.059
 most often the most important task 

00:01:07.059 --> 00:01:09.410
 shifted onto the shoulders of assistants 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.960
 so for example on some 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.440
 opponents not easy to get so 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.759
 it makes sense to send them millions 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.679
 and if the door color existed together 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:21.020
 it is necessary to kill mere mortals or 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.939
 animals to send their souls to 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.619
 another world and call from there is ready for 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.100
 freak service 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.400
 There are four main types of ideas in the game. 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.340
 minions 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.580
 each is distinguished by its weak and 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.140
 strengths 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.210
 in fact it means that on 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.000
 each case has to choose 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.409
 minions with certain 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.729
 talents minions are capable 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.820
 perform any tasks from capture 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.510
 Egyptian ships before the massacre 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.420
 centurion his faithful wars 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.920
 in addition, they can also decide 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.270
 simple puzzles of course obeying 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.170
 indicating his master 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.590
 the order return system does not work 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.689
 always as the player wants 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.109
 therefore, even the most simple tasks 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:03.689
 let's say last place in any sometimes 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.660
 does not do without delays 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.370
 until the goblins take the banner afpaka take 

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.170
 his position is that 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.640
 they want the boss takes it all 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.980
 time and leaves the main character without 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.120
 protection in some cases if available 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.010
 nearby special altar 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.150
 lord may move to tula 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.980
 schools of one of their slaves to 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.100
 get into some kind of Kursk caves 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.179
 and tunnels 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:29.389
 in general, be controlled from a small armenia 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.049
 being the embodiment 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.089
 of universal evil with a huge ax in 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:36.319
 hands of one beselia however the researcher 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.439
 a friend would be even more interesting if 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.069
 the developers took care of 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.069
 What kind of diversity did 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.659
 would the world be more free and open 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.709
 for studying otherwise it turns out that by 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.689
 the player cannot move forward 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.090
 miss and absolutely nothing 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.420
 he will not find all the secret treasures 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.410
 that somewhere showed curiosity but because 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.200
 that they lie almost on the road and 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.269
 then written down one pattern 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.900
 diversions and battles with legionnaires not 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.879
 no variation hiding 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.110
 awards to all serve hilarious scenes 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.819
 but they will soon get bored 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.869
 however some part of the flaws 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:14.889
 first release fixed yet 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.079
 was and it really does 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.739
 the adventures of all Karelia are more 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.939
 fascinating and parochial 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:22.689
 entertainment in which you have to manage 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:23.749
 but ship 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:26.549
 what and then the ballista necessarily 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.649
 everyone will like 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:29.639
 like the game itself
