00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.150 
cool maybe at least on on Krypton but
then<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.899> didn't<00:02:10.200> happen<00:02:10.320> so<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.709> guess<00:02:10.979> it's

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
then it didn't happen so I guess it's

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.400 
then it didn't happen so I guess it's
still<00:02:11.610> something<00:02:11.760> pretty<00:02:12.000> cool<00:02:12.060> both<00:02:12.600> even<00:02:13.320> if

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
still something pretty cool both even if

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.890 
still something pretty cool both even if
it's<00:02:13.860> not<00:02:14.010> screen<00:02:14.459> accurate<00:02:14.850> although<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.480> kind

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
it's not screen accurate although I kind

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.880 
it's not screen accurate although I kind
of<00:02:15.930> wish<00:02:16.110> they<00:02:16.260> would<00:02:16.380> have<00:02:16.470> just<00:02:16.530> had<00:02:16.860> him

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890
