there<00:00:24.770> are<00:00:24.860> many<00:00:25.040> machines<00:00:25.460> out<00:00:25.670> there

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
there are many machines out there

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.769 
there are many machines out there
similar<00:00:27.020> but<00:00:27.500> not<00:00:27.650> evil<00:00:28.210> now<00:00:29.210> we<00:00:29.270> are<00:00:29.480> going<00:00:29.689> to

engrave this piece here I am going to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.479 
engrave this piece here I am going to
measure<00:00:31.790> the<00:00:32.060> work<00:00:32.239> surface<00:00:32.720> we<00:00:33.320> have<00:00:33.489> 25

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
measure the work surface we have 25

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.130 
measure the work surface we have 25
millimeters<00:00:35.110> by<00:00:36.110> 15<00:00:36.530> millimeters<00:00:37.040> now<00:00:37.960> we<00:00:38.960> are

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
millimeters by 15 millimeters now we are

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.229 
millimeters by 15 millimeters now we are
going<00:00:39.380> to<00:00:39.530> choose<00:00:39.770> a<00:00:39.829> shape<00:00:40.430> which<00:00:41.060> best

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
going to choose a shape which best

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.569

now I'm going to check the surface with

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.360 
now I'm going to check the surface with
the<00:02:16.599> laser<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.890> make<00:02:18.040> sure<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.520> Center<00:02:20.370> okay

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
the laser to make sure it is Center okay

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.339 
the laser to make sure it is Center okay
it<00:02:21.910> is<00:02:22.090> very<00:02:22.150> good<00:02:22.540> now<00:02:22.840> we're<00:02:23.050> going<00:02:23.200> to

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
it is very good now we're going to

00:02:23.349 --> 00:03:21.350 
it is very good now we're going to
engrave

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.690 

as<00:03:22.360> you<00:03:22.510> notice<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.440> machine<00:03:23.830> check<00:03:24.550> the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
as you notice the machine check the

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.100 
as you notice the machine check the
surface<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.300> make<00:03:25.450> sure<00:03:25.570> it<00:03:25.660> was<00:03:25.780> a<00:03:25.810> flat

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.500 
surface to make sure it was a flat
surface<00:03:26.620> then<00:03:27.580> it<00:03:27.610> highlighted<00:03:28.360> the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
surface then it highlighted the

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.470 
surface then it highlighted the
