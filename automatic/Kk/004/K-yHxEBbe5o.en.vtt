00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.750
 they call no type those of captain spark 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.600
 of course it will never happen how 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.600
 those of capital partners however I am 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.610
 I'm doing one of them my way 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.920
 however I wanted to tell you what it's called 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.230
 today I'm here with this video to make you 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.850
 to finally see why I say it 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.789
 finally for less because yesterday 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.410
 finally after a year I managed to 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:04.379
 download this minecraft it for xbox 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.600
 360 roman kraft xbox 360 edition why 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.850
 I don't know if other people at the same 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.950
 change mine but I change shit 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.600
 no i can practically read 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.220
 only the games burned then 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.810
 I needed to put it from the pen 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.060
 dick 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.659
 so today I did it yesterday I have it 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.240
 done and today I propose this video 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:27.330
 very simple then you download 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.100
 this file to which I leave the link in 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:36.020
 description la on this link 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:41.250
 oh well you do send the flai a bit of money 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.390
 a few very few steps ahead here 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.990
 download this file 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.450
 this makes you discharge east instead of 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.579
 will download this file here 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.350
 here are written all written 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.860
 all the essentials then the link of the 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.460
 I play this one that weighs more or less 8 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.500
 gb 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.200
 enters a record I assure you it enters 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.409
 a decent verbatim dvd plus r 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.160
 naturally dual layer 8.5gb 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.619
 the game weighs about 7 gb 9 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.550
 anyway he gets on a disk so not 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.890
 you worry 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.740
 I have downloaded the title of the veil 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.420
 advice because it is fast you download 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.510
 all the links simultaneously to me there 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.330
 I spent two hours downloading them every 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.490
 it was 800 kg beta per second constants 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.960
 there is not much of a line 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.320
 so who has even better TV 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.690
 can download even faster more 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.900
 fast then put again to put 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.670
 even less if we say so then emg 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.740
 board that we will need to burn the 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.800
 perfect record 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.100
 after downloading all this stuff 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.260
 naturally came out a smell like it 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.880
 he says is an option because you can 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.310
 also download directly from google 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.400
 from the internet from mozilla what you use 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.730
 or if you have another program 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.550
 you do 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.320
 the download is a mg bourne e option 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.150
 these here of course this is the 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.620
 essential game and image and bunny for 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.660
 burn unless you have a 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.140
 but another program I use this vi 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.730
 I show this as soon as you finish 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:18.540
 downloading wines will download these files 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.950
 here these eight rows here you 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.950
 of course you can the first one 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.420
 what we need will be this 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.670
 this card in this folder 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.849
 it is these two year files we will need 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.220
 these two rows we extract that is 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.989
 let's drag where we want to on a folder 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.129
 where we like 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:45.239
 I already have the excerpts here, here they are here and 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:49.060
 so now we have these two files 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.459
 these two files now very simple 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.790
 what we open the burner e 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:04:01.180
 we insert the cd after which we open ing 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:03.069
 perfect partner we go on burn 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.590
 an image here 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.750
 we put our burner almost 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.909
 Now I do not know a disk because otherwise 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.790
 I wanted to show but I don't have a record 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:15.790
 just then everyone will appear 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.269
 disk type data that size 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.349
 in which there will be 8 gb I am saying one 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.360
 crap 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:29.530
 here also a mess after which you do 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.599
 look for a file and open the dvd file if 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:37.470
 open the dvd file will transport you 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:37.470
 automatically also the image file 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:46.150
 perfect then remember speed of 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:48.310
 writing mind you 2.4 for why there 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.190
 are the disks like my era 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.650
 compatible up to 8 for only that 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.990
 I read a guide on arcade games 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:00.880
 that said that you have to play 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:04.949
 burned between 2.4 and 4x4 to stay 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:10.060
 sure i recommend you at most 24 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:12.510
 after that, check it out 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:17.229
 more important to go on tools 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:19.479
 settings write here if you don't have 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.889
 already modified you will have optimal calculates 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.840
 instead of optimal calculation you have to 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:26.650
 put specified by the user and 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.889
 copy the same code here as I can 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.539
 say that it is here in the dvd file that 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:36.280
 we can see by doing open with 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:39.130
 notepad you see here is that file 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.790
 that is, that this code here this 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:46.060
 code that you copy here perfect 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:49.389
 we ended up guys do ok 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.220
 after which you start burning but 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:55.870
 so what was important I was wrong 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:58.330
 so always listen to me when it's over 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.030
 burning will give you some kind of 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.500
 error message if you read it because 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.570
 I often didn't read it because 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.190
 I said yes life has ended so far 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.139
 to burn and remove the disc e 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:12.760
 then the game didn't work 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:14.590
 so it tells you kind then it depends on why 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.120
 some do it automatically I give you the 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.030
 my computer is the burner that 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:22.090
 it does not automatically close because it is 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:24.700
 a laptop and that is I believe that all 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.530
 laptops have this thing here and 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.360
 so he tells me to close the 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.729
 burner to complete the 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.100
 check if it also tells you 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:36.010
 read I recommend read and write 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.090
 in English but read and tell you 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.440
 practically closing the 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.560
 burner to complete the 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.150
 verifies when it is finally verified 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.750
 fully completed maximization 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:52.000
 he tells you something on bushes 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:55.150
 even a little music enough guys for 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.950
 this video is all I hope to be there 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.289
 state of help I finally managed to 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:02.800
 download it I'll let you know if you can 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:04.419
 well update because i don't know why 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.390
 with the change I honestly don't know if i 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:09.520
 games move to the newspaper from ex 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:12.479
 maribor if everything in a future video 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.479
 Hi everyone
