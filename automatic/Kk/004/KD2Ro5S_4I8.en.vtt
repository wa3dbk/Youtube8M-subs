and it's not going to get hung up this

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.300 
and it's not going to get hung up this
is<00:02:29.080> what<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.350> probably<00:02:29.680> look<00:02:29.830> like<00:02:30.010> right<00:02:30.190> out

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
is what to probably look like right out

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.370 
is what to probably look like right out
of<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.459> package<00:02:30.820> I<00:02:31.060> really<00:02:31.480> like<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.780> it's

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
of the package I really like the it's

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.230 
of the package I really like the it's
got<00:02:32.500> good<00:02:32.709> sharp<00:02:33.100> hooks<00:02:33.340> on<00:02:33.580> it<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:33.850> they're

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
got good sharp hooks on it and they're

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.540 
got good sharp hooks on it and they're
real<00:02:34.420> tight<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.930> body<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.350> you<00:02:35.440> can<00:02:35.590> move

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
real tight to the body so you can move

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.820 
real tight to the body so you can move
it<00:02:36.730> through<00:02:36.910> anything<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.990> one<00:02:38.110> modification

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
it through anything the one modification

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.830 
it through anything the one modification
I<00:02:38.890> like<00:02:39.070> to<00:02:39.190> make<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.520> it<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:40.150> I'll<00:02:40.420> take<00:02:40.600> that

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
I like to make to it is I'll take that

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.290 
I like to make to it is I'll take that
spike<00:02:41.200> it<00:02:41.410> marker<00:02:41.860> and<00:02:42.070> I'll<00:02:42.670> paint<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.090> lip

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
spike it marker and I'll paint the lip

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.620 
spike it marker and I'll paint the lip
of<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.600> area<00:02:44.200> red<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.860> then<00:02:45.130> I'll<00:02:45.220> run<00:02:45.430> the

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
of it area red and then I'll run the

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.030 
of it area red and then I'll run the
chartreuse<00:02:46.630> down<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.020> side<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.830> color

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
chartreuse down the side and that color

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.160 
chartreuse down the side and that color
pattern<00:02:48.400> really<00:02:48.640> works<00:02:48.820> out<00:02:48.970> good<00:02:49.180> for<00:02:49.330> me<00:02:49.510> and

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
pattern really works out good for me and

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.460 
pattern really works out good for me and
it'll<00:02:50.470> also<00:02:50.650> give<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.040> a<00:02:51.100> garlic<00:02:51.520> scent<00:02:51.820> and

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
it'll also give it a garlic scent and

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.750 
it'll also give it a garlic scent and
you<00:02:53.470> can<00:02:53.620> get<00:02:53.770> both<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:53.980> markers<00:02:54.459> and<00:02:54.640> the

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
you can get both the markers and the

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.300 
you can get both the markers and the
