00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
know how to set your anything I

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.400

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
hint of fire eNOS is it well and let's

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:08.719 
hint of fire eNOS is it well and let's
try<00:01:55.220> that<00:01:55.340> all<00:01:55.490> do<00:01:55.940> you<00:01:56.000> want<00:01:56.240> that

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:22.070 

well<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.660> smell<00:02:09.929> again<00:02:10.140> or<00:02:10.830> comment<00:02:11.160> on<00:02:11.250> it

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.199 

okay

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:34.270 

right<00:02:25.780> this<00:02:25.989> one

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.260 

so<00:02:34.790> nowadays<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.840> which<00:02:36.020> one<00:02:36.170> are<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.410> best

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
so nowadays that which one are the best

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.520 
so nowadays that which one are the best
having<00:02:38.270> a<00:02:38.450> taste

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
having a taste

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.660 
having a taste
initially<00:02:40.040> I<00:02:40.100> thought<00:02:40.250> it's<00:02:40.400> not<00:02:40.430> an<00:02:40.550> obvious

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
initially I thought it's not an obvious

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.160 
initially I thought it's not an obvious
one<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:40.940> best<00:02:41.210> but<00:02:41.390> after<00:02:41.630> having<00:02:41.750> two<00:02:41.990> sips

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
one the best but after having two sips

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.390 
one the best but after having two sips
of<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.440> one<00:02:42.560> didn't<00:02:42.860> particularly<00:02:43.220> like

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
of that one didn't particularly like

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.810 
of that one didn't particularly like
them<00:02:43.820> that<00:02:43.940> much<00:02:43.970> so<00:02:45.190> let's<00:02:46.190> try<00:02:46.400> again<00:02:46.640> let's

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
them that much so let's try again let's

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:57.699 
them that much so let's try again let's
go<00:02:47.000> this<00:02:47.180> one<00:02:47.360> first<00:02:50.500> why<00:02:51.500> my<00:02:51.709> mind<00:02:51.950> up<00:02:56.709> you

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
go this one first why my mind up you

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.260 
go this one first why my mind up you
know<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.100> can<00:02:58.280> Yan<00:02:58.430> evaluates<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.000> washing

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
know you can Yan evaluates the washing

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:12.820 
know you can Yan evaluates the washing
machine<00:03:00.340> unfortunately<00:03:01.340> left<00:03:01.520> on

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.840 

I<00:03:12.860> think<00:03:13.580> it's<00:03:13.670> very<00:03:13.760> close<00:03:14.980> not<00:03:15.980> too<00:03:16.370> much<00:03:16.580> in

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
I think it's very close not too much in

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.900 
I think it's very close not too much in
it<00:03:18.100> initially<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:19.160> didn't<00:03:19.400> on<00:03:19.460> that<00:03:19.610> one<00:03:19.730> but<00:03:19.880> I

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
it initially I didn't on that one but I
