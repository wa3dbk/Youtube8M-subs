 d 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.180
 ah 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.700
 ah 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.710
 what is flour 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.590
 Arginine is a supplement that helps 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.570
 to have more vigor and increase strength 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.579
 it's an essential amino acid that we get 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.320
 through food and has 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.220
 on our organism an effect 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.410
 vasodilator important 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.630
 many people looking to increase their mass 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.850
 muscle resorts to flour for 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.560
 achieve it and its effects are very 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.960
 highlighted since one of its main 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.580
 functions is to be a strong 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.830
 energizing our body 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.020
 through different mechanisms that 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.030
 unleash our body and in the 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.780
 answer that we are going to give at the time of 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.119
 to train 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.400
 the flour is an amino acid that when entering 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.590
 in contact with the oxide enzyme 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.840
 synthetase that is added to our 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.900
 organism becomes nitric oxide 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.909
 inside our body is therefore a 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.100
 direct generator of nitric oxide 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.960
 body that has various functions 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.240
 vasodilator thus improving the 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.950
 blood circulation and increasing the 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.790
 risk of all parts of our 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.680
 body 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.600
 this increase in blood flow is 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.420
 important since our muscle 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.640
 will receive more oxygen that will lead to 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.410
 a greater amount of energy because this one 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.350
 it is obtained through the burning of 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.390
 oxygen the fat of this process will endow 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.280
 of greater strength and vigor to our 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.380
 muscles that will be prepared for 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.050
 face any physical effort in 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.970
 perfect conditions 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.100
 but it is remarkable the importance that 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.050
 has in the secretion of several hormones 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.200
 important for body growth 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.810
 and muscle like glucagon insulin 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.850
 and the growth hormone all of them 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.860
 necessary if what we are looking for is 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.720
 get a muscle hypertrophy with 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.060
 the exercise we do 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.980
 for this reason in flour it can be a 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.500
 good complement for all those who 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.420
 we do exercises we want to grow and 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.400
 get muscle gain to have 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.290
 the body that we want 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.510
 if you want to know more about how 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.670
 get a body with muscles 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.190
 marked
