someone thinking they're dead and then

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.870 
someone thinking they're dead and then

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:24.709 
even when i get punched it's still kind

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:26.889 
even when i get punched it's still kind
of<00:01:24.770> cool<00:01:24.979> because<00:01:25.100> that<00:01:25.340> animation<00:01:25.789> is<00:01:26.600> so

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
of cool because that animation is so

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.370 
of cool because that animation is so
cool<00:01:27.520> but<00:01:28.520> i<00:01:28.759> am<00:01:29.060> i'm<00:01:29.630> definitely<00:01:30.080> struggling

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
cool but i am i'm definitely struggling

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.930 
cool but i am i'm definitely struggling
so<00:01:30.649> i<00:01:30.709> figured<00:01:30.950> i'd<00:01:31.009> try<00:01:31.220> some<00:01:31.490> free<00:01:31.670> for<00:01:31.819> all<00:01:31.909> a

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
so i figured i'd try some free for all a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.490 
so i figured i'd try some free for all a
lot<00:01:32.000> of<00:01:32.119> guys<00:01:32.270> and<00:01:32.390> asked<00:01:32.539> me<00:01:32.690> LP<00:01:33.049> how<00:01:33.350> does

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
lot of guys and asked me LP how does

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.889 
lot of guys and asked me LP how does
free-for-all<00:01:34.039> play<00:01:34.340> on<00:01:34.610> advanced<00:01:35.479> warfare

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
free-for-all play on advanced warfare

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.980 
free-for-all play on advanced warfare
and<00:01:36.220> i<00:01:37.220> think<00:01:38.119> if<00:01:38.270> you're<00:01:38.420> struggling<00:01:38.780> with

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
and i think if you're struggling with

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.649 
and i think if you're struggling with
your<00:01:39.229> gun<00:01:39.440> skills<00:01:39.709> you<00:01:39.950> need<00:01:40.100> some<00:01:40.280> one-on-one

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
your gun skills you need some one-on-one

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.520 
your gun skills you need some one-on-one
interactions<00:01:41.659> this<00:01:41.810> is<00:01:41.960> it<00:01:42.079> this<00:01:42.380> is

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
interactions this is it this is

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.289 
interactions this is it this is
definitely<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:43.009> way<00:01:43.039> to<00:01:43.189> go<00:01:43.369> now<00:01:44.000> some<00:01:44.210> of

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
definitely the way to go now some of

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:45.609 
definitely the way to go now some of
these<00:01:44.359> free<00:01:44.570> for<00:01:44.719> all<00:01:44.780> maps<00:01:45.020> are<00:01:45.200> just<00:01:45.380> they're

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
these free for all maps are just they're

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.630 
these free for all maps are just they're
just<00:01:45.649> too<00:01:46.009> big<00:01:46.869> this<00:01:47.869> is<00:01:48.020> probably<00:01:48.340> one<00:01:49.340> of<00:01:49.369> if

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
just too big this is probably one of if

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.240 
just too big this is probably one of if
not<00:01:49.670> my<00:01:49.880> favorite<00:01:50.450> free-for-all<00:01:50.899> map<00:01:51.140> so<00:01:51.950> far

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
and it just kind of allows you to have

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:56.410 
and it just kind of allows you to have
those<00:01:54.649> one-on-one<00:01:55.000> engagements<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.149> kind<00:01:56.329> of

this point I'm I'm job still just trying
to<00:02:04.130> figure<00:02:04.369> it<00:02:04.670> out<00:02:04.789> I<00:02:05.119> I<00:02:05.840> move<00:02:06.560> too<00:02:07.039> much<00:02:07.070> and

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
to figure it out I I move too much and

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.099 
to figure it out I I move too much and
not<00:02:07.640> only<00:02:08.060> because<00:02:08.269> I'm<00:02:08.570> showing<00:02:08.869> up<00:02:08.959> on<00:02:09.079> the

not only because I'm showing up on the
radar<00:02:09.200> when<00:02:09.530> I<00:02:09.590> boost<00:02:09.829> because<00:02:10.070> I<00:02:10.280> don't<00:02:10.459> use

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
radar when I boost because I don't use

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.300 
radar when I boost because I don't use
the<00:02:11.290> boost<00:02:12.290> one<00:02:12.590> and<00:02:12.769> I<00:02:12.799> mean<00:02:12.829> no<00:02:12.950> what<00:02:13.100> it<00:02:13.190> is

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
the boost one and I mean no what it is

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.650 
the boost one and I mean no what it is
where<00:02:13.910> you<00:02:14.000> don't<00:02:14.090> show<00:02:14.239> up<00:02:14.390> on<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.630> radar

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
where you don't show up on the radar

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.530 
where you don't show up on the radar
when<00:02:15.019> you<00:02:15.079> boost<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.640> don't<00:02:16.640> use<00:02:16.820> that<00:02:16.850> I<00:02:17.209> just

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
when you boost I don't use that I just

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.500 
when you boost I don't use that I just
started<00:02:17.900> using<00:02:18.079> that<00:02:18.230> last<00:02:18.560> night<00:02:19.299> it's<00:02:20.299> not

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
started using that last night it's not

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.500

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
would just rather it be good connections

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.690 
would just rather it be good connections
then<00:04:08.540> these<00:04:09.470> these<00:04:09.770> terrible<00:04:10.250> connections

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
then these these terrible connections

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.070 
then these these terrible connections
playing<00:04:10.940> against<00:04:11.120> people<00:04:11.420> I<00:04:11.600> don't<00:04:11.900> mind

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
because I may I made a bad decision

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.620 
because I may I made a bad decision
because<00:04:19.670> my<00:04:19.820> aim<00:04:20.000> was<00:04:20.030> off<00:04:20.299> a<00:04:20.359> little<00:04:20.510> bit

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
because my aim was off a little bit

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.930 
because my aim was off a little bit
which<00:04:20.810> happens<00:04:21.170> a<00:04:21.290> lot<00:04:21.440> but<00:04:21.739> I<00:04:21.770> also<00:04:22.280> die<00:04:22.700> a<00:04:22.730> lot

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
which happens a lot but I also die a lot

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.940 
which happens a lot but I also die a lot
because<00:04:23.210> of<00:04:23.270> connections<00:04:23.960> so<00:04:24.950> I<00:04:26.860> didn't<00:04:27.860> mean

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
because of connections so I didn't mean

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.290 
because of connections so I didn't mean
to<00:04:27.980> go<00:04:28.130> on<00:04:28.160> a<00:04:28.250> rant<00:04:28.430> about<00:04:28.550> connections<00:04:29.120> what

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
to go on a rant about connections what

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.020 
to go on a rant about connections what
had<00:04:29.390> happened<00:04:29.750> it<00:04:29.810> happened<00:04:30.490> but<00:04:31.490> free<00:04:31.790> for

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
had happened it happened but free for

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.140 
had happened it happened but free for
all<00:04:32.090> if<00:04:33.050> you<00:04:33.770> do<00:04:33.950> end<00:04:34.280> up<00:04:34.400> playing<00:04:34.610> free<00:04:34.910> from

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
all if you do end up playing free from

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.450 
all if you do end up playing free from
it's<00:04:35.570> a<00:04:36.020> lot<00:04:36.200> like<00:04:36.380> the<00:04:36.500> other<00:04:36.620> card<00:04:36.890> games<00:04:36.980> but

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
it's a lot like the other card games but

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.130 
it's a lot like the other card games but
it's<00:04:37.820> so<00:04:38.120> different<00:04:38.360> because<00:04:38.570> there<00:04:38.990> are<00:04:39.080> so

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
it's so different because there are so

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.740 
it's so different because there are so
many<00:04:39.560> different<00:04:39.680> places<00:04:40.190> that<00:04:41.090> people<00:04:41.270> can<00:04:41.570> be

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
many different places that people can be

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.150 
many different places that people can be
and<00:04:42.020> I<00:04:42.380> know<00:04:42.440> a<00:04:42.560> lot<00:04:42.650> of<00:04:42.710> people<00:04:42.800> are<00:04:43.010> playing

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
and I know a lot of people are playing

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.830 
and I know a lot of people are playing
complaining<00:04:43.850> about<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.090> spawns<00:04:44.390> I<00:04:44.600> can't

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
complaining about the spawns I can't

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.900 
complaining about the spawns I can't
imagine<00:04:44.930> how<00:04:45.320> difficult<00:04:45.830> it<00:04:46.220> is<00:04:46.310> to<00:04:46.520> get<00:04:46.730> these

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
imagine how difficult it is to get these

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.500 
imagine how difficult it is to get these
phones<00:04:47.240> right<00:04:47.560> because<00:04:48.910> when<00:04:49.910> you<00:04:50.000> spawn<00:04:50.300> in

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
phones right because when you spawn in

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.300 
phones right because when you spawn in
you<00:04:50.780> can<00:04:50.960> get<00:04:51.140> to<00:04:51.350> anywhere<00:04:51.890> on<00:04:52.010> the<00:04:52.130> map

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
you can get to anywhere on the map

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.590 
you can get to anywhere on the map
within<00:04:52.520> just<00:04:52.880> you<00:04:53.000> know<00:04:53.120> a<00:04:53.150> handful<00:04:53.510> of

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
within just you know a handful of

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.040 
within just you know a handful of
seconds<00:04:54.110> so<00:04:54.950> it<00:04:55.580> looks<00:04:55.880> like<00:04:55.970> oh<00:04:56.270> I<00:04:56.690> was<00:04:57.020> just

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
seconds so it looks like oh I was just

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.690 
seconds so it looks like oh I was just
there<00:04:57.440> now<00:04:57.710> there's<00:04:57.920> somebody<00:04:58.190> there<00:04:58.370> he<00:04:58.520> must

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
there now there's somebody there he must

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.280 
there now there's somebody there he must
have<00:04:58.790> spawned<00:04:59.060> there<00:04:59.300> it's<00:04:59.900> like<00:04:59.990> he<00:05:00.140> might

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
have spawned there it's like he might

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.780 
have spawned there it's like he might
have<00:05:00.380> jumped<00:05:00.590> from<00:05:00.680> two<00:05:00.950> buildings<00:05:01.340> away<00:05:01.460> and

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
have jumped from two buildings away and

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.040 
have jumped from two buildings away and
landed<00:05:02.240> right<00:05:02.390> there<00:05:02.660> so

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
landed right there so

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.230 
landed right there so
I<00:05:03.080> would<00:05:03.889> say<00:05:04.039> the<00:05:04.159> majority<00:05:04.280> of<00:05:04.759> my<00:05:04.970> deaths

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
I would say the majority of my deaths

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.969 
I would say the majority of my deaths
that<00:05:05.449> are<00:05:05.509> not<00:05:05.930> connection<00:05:06.500> based<00:05:06.710> or

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
that are not connection based or

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.689 
that are not connection based or
probably<00:05:07.430> from<00:05:07.699> behind<00:05:08.440> because<00:05:09.580> it's<00:05:10.580> just

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
probably from behind because it's just

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.510 
probably from behind because it's just
it's<00:05:11.030> so<00:05:11.270> crazy<00:05:11.569> people<00:05:12.050> can<00:05:12.229> be<00:05:12.440> anywhere<00:05:13.280> all

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
it's so crazy people can be anywhere all

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.740 
it's so crazy people can be anywhere all
the<00:05:13.699> time<00:05:13.849> and<00:05:13.970> I<00:05:14.030> would<00:05:14.120> prefer<00:05:14.240> that<00:05:14.419> I<00:05:14.599> would

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
the time and I would prefer that I would

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.110 
the time and I would prefer that I would
be<00:05:14.840> I<00:05:15.020> would<00:05:15.080> prefer<00:05:15.440> people<00:05:15.919> moving<00:05:16.580> the

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
be I would prefer people moving the

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.149 
be I would prefer people moving the
amount<00:05:17.330> of<00:05:17.389> corner<00:05:17.810> campers<00:05:18.259> in<00:05:18.440> this<00:05:18.560> game<00:05:18.740> is

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:19.159 
amount of corner campers in this game is

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:21.460 
amount of corner campers in this game is
a<00:05:19.520> Pauline<00:05:20.090> I<00:05:20.210> I<00:05:20.419> think<00:05:20.870> this<00:05:20.960> is<00:05:21.139> one<00:05:21.289> of<00:05:21.319> the

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
a Pauline I I think this is one of the

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.960 
a Pauline I I think this is one of the
better<00:05:21.620> games<00:05:21.770> but<00:05:22.639> I<00:05:22.669> would<00:05:22.849> definitely

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
better games but I would definitely

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.070 
better games but I would definitely
rather<00:05:23.360> have<00:05:23.720> people<00:05:24.400> moving<00:05:25.400> and<00:05:25.900> this<00:05:26.900> is

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
rather have people moving and this is

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.629 
rather have people moving and this is
