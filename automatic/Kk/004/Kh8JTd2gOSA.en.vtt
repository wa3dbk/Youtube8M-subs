they're<00:03:25.070> there<00:03:25.340> if<00:03:25.820> you<00:03:25.940> were<00:03:26.060> to<00:03:26.180> draw<00:03:26.390> them

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
they're there if you were to draw them

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.100 
they're there if you were to draw them
they<00:03:26.720> would<00:03:26.840> be<00:03:26.930> like<00:03:27.080> this<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:28.570> so<00:03:29.570> on<00:03:29.930> all

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
they would be like this and so on all

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
the way around them all but we don't

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.250 
the way around them all but we don't
draw<00:03:31.640> them<00:03:31.850> in<00:03:31.970> Bondi<00:03:32.330> location<00:03:32.840> they're

now let's decrease the ring size to

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.940 
now let's decrease the ring size to

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.520 
combinations that work because it would

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.030 
combinations that work because it would
just<00:04:16.700> it<00:04:17.060> would<00:04:17.090> just<00:04:17.360> mean<00:04:17.510> replacing<00:04:18.410> the

just it would just mean replacing the

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.590 
just it would just mean replacing the

same molecule so now we're going to move

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.440 
same molecule so now we're going to move
down<00:04:22.700> to<00:04:24.820> molecules<00:04:25.820> that<00:04:25.910> contain<00:04:26.060> double

and ii german word for a part how we

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
exhausted all our possibilities both

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.040 
exhausted all our possibilities both
groups<00:06:24.400> on<00:06:24.550> the<00:06:24.640> same<00:06:24.850> side<00:06:25.150> then<00:06:25.419> you<00:06:25.570> name<00:06:25.870> it

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
groups on the same side then you name it

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.130 
groups on the same side then you name it
as<00:06:26.140> a<00:06:26.169> propene<00:06:27.450> so<00:06:28.450> that<00:06:28.630> would<00:06:28.780> be<00:06:28.870> called

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
as a propene so that would be called

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:37.790 
as a propene so that would be called
what<00:06:29.410> you<00:06:29.620> starting<00:06:29.950> on<00:06:30.070> bring<00:06:30.280> it<00:06:30.310> from<00:06:30.610> here

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.980 

no<00:06:46.450> it's<00:06:46.630> not<00:06:46.750> extra<00:06:47.080> publicist<00:06:47.650> proteins<00:06:48.990> to

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:49.990 
no it's not extra publicist proteins to

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:58.860 
no it's not extra publicist proteins to
methyl<00:06:50.380> broken<00:06:54.690> and<00:06:55.690> I<00:06:55.870> think<00:06:56.230> that<00:06:57.870> exhausts

00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:58.870 
methyl broken and I think that exhausts

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.130 
methyl broken and I think that exhausts
all<00:06:59.020> the<00:06:59.170> possibilities<00:06:59.890> for<00:07:00.130> a<00:07:00.900> c4h8<00:07:01.900> there

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:02.140 
all the possibilities for a c4h8 there

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:06.300 
all the possibilities for a c4h8 there
are<00:07:02.200> only<00:07:02.790> six<00:07:03.790> isomers
