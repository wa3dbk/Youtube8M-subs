00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.319
 for the mobile satellite reception 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.029
 kathrein offers the package mobiset four 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:09.429
 cup 910 on 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:12.490
 The package consists of the rotary unit 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:16.660
 with antenna the cup 910 and the 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.580
 satellite receiver uss 940 with this 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.619
 receiver can be next to the previous one 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.410
 standard television also the new 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.000
 High definition television called HDTV 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.670
 receive 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.990
 in addition it is possible 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.840
 TV broadcasts on an external usb 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.700
 record hard disk or 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.200
 the service is delayed 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.900
 The rotary unit is fully automatic 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.300
 over the receiver of the here not in the picture 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.670
 you can see 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.960
 when turning on the receiver 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.629
 The antenna is parked 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.610
 and picks up the satellites for 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.560
 the set program 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.110
 for an accelerated search is a 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.940
 gps receiver used during the 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.980
 ride the gps data captured and 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.330
 evaluates 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.670
 Thus, when the receiver is turned on 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.040
 a faster position determination 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.140
 possible as soon as the rotating unit 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.870
 satellites found or at 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.210
 Listening to known position has stopped 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.880
 or see the currently selected 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.159
 program on your tv device 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.689
 when switching to a program that of 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.180
 another satellite broadcast 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.250
 The antenna will search automatically 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.100
 the position of the selected satellite 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.340
 an action radius of the rotary unit of 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.350
 over 360 degrees allows the reception of 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.420
 programs across the entire horizon 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.460
 through the use of a 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.679
 parabolic antenna becomes the reception area 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.159
 compared to previously used flat 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:40.140
 antennae enlarged 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.460
 you are with the plant in the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.130
 outlying areas of each 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.619
 the scu offers one 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.719
 additional optimization of the reception with 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.789
 the ski becomes a fully automatic 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:53.280
 polarization adjustment of the lnb 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.700
 In addition, you can do with 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.099
 the twin lnb in the cup 910 no longer 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.680
 only one but two receivers on her 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:04.200
 operate cup 910 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.300
 the receiver is turned off 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.789
 Antenna automatically in the parking position 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.070
 Parking will also be at one 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.020
 motor state hit and prevented 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.420
 so that any damage to the 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.330
 Extended antenna during the ride 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.060
 with the cup 910 you will find the advantages 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.470
 the old cup units with new ideas 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.470
 and technologies
