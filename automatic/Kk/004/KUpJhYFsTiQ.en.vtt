with a group of peer leaders eighth
graders<00:00:59.620> that<00:01:00.039> we<00:01:00.129> trained<00:01:00.489> with<00:01:00.760> leadership

graders that we trained with leadership

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.509 
graders that we trained with leadership
skills<00:01:01.570> and<00:01:01.899> then<00:01:02.469> we<00:01:02.620> took<00:01:02.800> those<00:01:03.070> young

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
skills and then we took those young

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.150 
skills and then we took those young
people<00:01:03.809> into<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:04.930> classroom<00:01:05.500> with<00:01:06.010> the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
people into the classroom with the

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.740 
people into the classroom with the
children<00:01:06.670> receiving<00:01:06.970> special<00:01:07.240> ed<00:01:07.570> services

children receiving special ed services

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.750 
children receiving special ed services
so<00:01:08.320> that<00:01:08.350> meant<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:08.860> cognitively<00:01:09.370> impaired

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
so that meant the cognitively impaired

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.250 
so that meant the cognitively impaired
students<00:01:10.180> and<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:10.540> emotionally<00:01:10.960> impaired

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
students and the emotionally impaired

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.230 
students and the emotionally impaired
students<00:01:14.100> what<00:01:15.100> else<00:01:15.250> that<00:01:15.460> call<00:01:15.640> it<00:01:15.730> but<00:01:16.180> I

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
students what else that call it but I

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.310 
students what else that call it but I
think<00:01:16.420> it's<00:01:16.510> important<00:01:16.870> for<00:01:16.960> students<00:01:17.260> to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
think it's important for students to

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.470 
think it's important for students to
understand<00:01:17.800> the<00:01:18.400> cyclical<00:01:18.820> role<00:01:19.180> of<00:01:19.330> our

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
understand the cyclical role of our

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.590 
understand the cyclical role of our
lives<00:01:19.750> and<00:01:20.080> our<00:01:20.200> life<00:01:20.440> cycle<00:01:20.950> I<00:01:21.570> don't<00:01:22.570> think

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
lives and our life cycle I don't think

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.230 
lives and our life cycle I don't think
we<00:01:22.930> really<00:01:23.320> sit<00:01:23.860> down<00:01:23.890> sometimes<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:24.910> think

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
we really sit down sometimes and think

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.290 
we really sit down sometimes and think
about<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.680> cyclical<00:01:27.430> nature<00:01:27.490> of<00:01:27.940> our<00:01:28.030> lives

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
about the cyclical nature of our lives

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.840 
about the cyclical nature of our lives
and<00:01:28.570> how<00:01:28.690> closely<00:01:29.080> related<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.430> dirt<00:01:30.670> in

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
and how closely related to the dirt in

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.960 
and how closely related to the dirt in
the<00:01:31.150> ground<00:01:33.090> they're<00:01:34.090> curious<00:01:35.760> they'll<00:01:36.760> come

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
the ground they're curious they'll come

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.640 
the ground they're curious they'll come
out<00:01:37.150> and<00:01:37.390> say<00:01:37.600> how<00:01:37.780> our<00:01:37.990> plants<00:01:38.380> doing<00:01:38.500> I'll

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
out and say how our plants doing I'll

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.530 
out and say how our plants doing I'll
say<00:01:38.770> let's<00:01:39.010> go<00:01:39.130> up<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.370> lab<00:01:39.550> and<00:01:39.760> look<00:01:39.970> when

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
say let's go up the lab and look when

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.240 
say let's go up the lab and look when
they<00:01:40.660> dealt<00:01:40.900> with<00:01:41.050> them<00:01:41.230> they<00:01:41.830> dealt<00:01:42.070> more

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
they dealt with them they dealt more

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.560 
they dealt with them they dealt more
tenderly<00:01:42.610> with<00:01:42.790> those<00:01:42.940> plants<00:01:43.330> than<00:01:43.420> they

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
tenderly with those plants than they

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.880 
tenderly with those plants than they
probably<00:01:43.810> deal<00:01:44.320> with<00:01:44.350> their<00:01:44.590> younger

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
probably deal with their younger

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.700 
probably deal with their younger
siblings<00:01:45.720> when<00:01:46.720> something's<00:01:47.260> cooking

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
siblings when something's cooking

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.340 
siblings when something's cooking
everyone's<00:01:48.550> noticing<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.120> pot<00:01:49.360> and<00:01:49.600> so<00:01:50.140> what

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
everyone's noticing the pot and so what

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.180 
everyone's noticing the pot and so what
you<00:01:50.470> see<00:01:50.800> our<00:01:51.580> students<00:01:52.090> who<00:01:52.770> they<00:01:53.770> didn't<00:01:54.040> bag

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
you see our students who they didn't bag

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.740 
you see our students who they didn't bag
but<00:01:54.460> they<00:01:54.610> said<00:01:54.820> Kurds<00:01:55.030> well<00:01:55.180> I<00:01:55.240> want<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.510> plant

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
but they said Kurds well I want to plant

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:04.630 
but they said Kurds well I want to plant
two

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.340 

and<00:02:05.640> they<00:02:06.090> were<00:02:06.149> pretty<00:02:06.479> excited<00:02:06.630> they<00:02:07.140> drew

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
and they were pretty excited they drew

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.380 
and they were pretty excited they drew
pictures<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:08.129> they<00:02:08.220> planted<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.000> seedlings

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
pictures and they planted the seedlings

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.630 
pictures and they planted the seedlings
and<00:02:09.509> we<00:02:09.629> actually<00:02:09.840> planted<00:02:10.619> something<00:02:11.370> like

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
and we actually planted something like

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.930 
and we actually planted something like
600<00:02:12.360> seeds<00:02:13.010> thinking<00:02:14.010> we<00:02:14.340> might<00:02:14.489> end<00:02:14.549> up<00:02:14.790> with

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
600 seeds thinking we might end up with

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.830 
600 seeds thinking we might end up with
half<00:02:15.180> in<00:02:15.720> terms<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.620> what<00:02:16.830> actually<00:02:17.250> grew<00:02:18.209> but

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
half in terms of what actually grew but

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.100 
half in terms of what actually grew but

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
we ended up with 600 plants because they

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.229 
we ended up with 600 plants because they
did<00:02:22.890> such<00:02:23.129> a<00:02:23.160> great<00:02:23.340> job<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.879> they<00:02:23.940> were<00:02:24.000> so

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
did such a great job and they were so

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.390 
did such a great job and they were so
gentle<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.959> so<00:02:25.049> diligent<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:25.980> what<00:02:26.220> they<00:02:26.340> were

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
gentle and so diligent in what they were

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.210

trying<00:02:26.879> to<00:02:27.000> get<00:02:27.180> done<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:32.599> think<00:02:33.599> young<00:02:33.840> people

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
trying to get done I think young people

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.240 
trying to get done I think young people
have<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.670> energy<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.810> innovation<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:38.099> be

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.170 
have the energy and the innovation to be
leaders<00:02:38.780> when<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.810> comes<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.819> their<00:02:41.819> health

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
leaders when it comes to their health

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.300 
leaders when it comes to their health
and<00:02:42.480> making<00:02:43.110> choices<00:02:43.290> for<00:02:43.650> themselves<00:02:43.769> I

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
and making choices for themselves I

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.920 
and making choices for themselves I
think<00:02:44.549> that<00:02:44.670> needs<00:02:44.849> to<00:02:45.030> be<00:02:45.120> organic<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.780> needs

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.250 
think that needs to be organic it needs
to<00:02:46.079> come<00:02:46.230> from<00:02:46.410> them<00:02:46.769> I<00:02:47.420> think<00:02:48.420> engaging<00:02:48.959> them

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
to come from them I think engaging them

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.500
