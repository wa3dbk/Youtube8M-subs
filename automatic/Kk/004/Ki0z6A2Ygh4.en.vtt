00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.650
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.190
 The name is a stick of ruins 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.310
 Work is photographer 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.920
 To 2001 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:52.000
 I 'm starting to work as a photographer 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:57.339
 I took photos from a little before also do 12 years 13-year-kan 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.280
 8 Neet first affected by that 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:05.049
 The photographer is 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:09.450
 Hirano Taro 39 I was allowed to debut in wheels magazine 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:14.860
 There are people who did the main photographer 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:18.869
 Woofer Itoi It's a great famous photographer, but to that person today 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.869
 I heard that a next 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:42.110
 I have a lot of buber but 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.070
 Lance Mountain had during this time that shot's a likely or else 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.490
 Ummm 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:50.530
 Eric Kosan or a 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.530
 Oh In it is after Japanese 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:08.460
 I'm just in front of the people who were watching booby and great videos 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:12.270
 Focus on this 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:15.750
 Yes the fifth wave 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:20.880
 Now second in the United States there is no off course 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:24.120
 Oh yes , the single-lens reflex camera that the shooting job used first 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.170
 Because it is now, it is unmarried already if it is after that 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.310
 So I 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.850
 Air and now also old lenses 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.440
 Because you can mound the latest camera 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:42.730
 So it is whether the cost performance is nice to not take the posterior 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:48.880
 Is Nikon originally I quite there that point because that glass manufacturers that 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.720
 It is my selfish imagination, but cad is likely to have many engineers with high job popularity 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.110
 More 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:59.670
 The camera itself is so clever because of the technology of copiers and cars 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:03.040
 Me a little too wise a little Somehow use tough 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:08.540
 But much more from four a fine point fool 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:13.690
 It also got a say I can not I want to do a little there when I wow difficult 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:19.180
 Well, that's a pro skater in Japan 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.470
 How can you say that people who can work on skateboards are better than in America 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.580
 Because it is very small 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.120
 Hmm 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:30.520
 Between that whoa cut guys still have to work 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:35.620
 All filming up until midnight with cheese cake at the end 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:38.060
 There are a lot of shootings, so it depends on the photos and videos. 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.780
 I think there will be more 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.560
 em 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.610
 Battered dishes also space 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.060
 It's amazing that especially in Tokyo because Sune and Tose are beautiful. 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.640
 Shibuya Shinjuku 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.910

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.140
 that 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:11.500
 After all it was decided that work would grow 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:13.260
 Since the minute masu often rely on that antenna 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.060

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.030
