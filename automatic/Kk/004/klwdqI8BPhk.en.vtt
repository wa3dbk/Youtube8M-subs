move from right to left you can go up

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.040 
move from right to left you can go up
and<00:04:52.730> down<00:04:53.200> escape<00:04:54.200> talk<00:04:55.540> you<00:04:56.540> have<00:04:56.720> all<00:04:56.900> those

features<00:04:57.350> just<00:04:57.890> like<00:04:58.100> you<00:04:58.250> would<00:04:58.400> in<00:04:58.550> the

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
features just like you would in the

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.400 
features just like you would in the
control<00:04:59.000> now<00:04:59.270> if<00:04:59.419> you<00:04:59.510> hit<00:04:59.600> this<00:04:59.780> tiny<00:05:00.050> square

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
control now if you hit this tiny square

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.590 
control now if you hit this tiny square
and<00:05:00.530> go<00:05:00.620> to<00:05:00.680> settings<00:05:01.040> you<00:05:02.030> can<00:05:02.060> change<00:05:02.360> how

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
and go to settings you can change how

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.980 
and go to settings you can change how
fast<00:05:02.960> you<00:05:03.380> move<00:05:03.710> around<00:05:04.180> your<00:05:05.180> analog<00:05:05.630> stick

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
fast you move around your analog stick

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.740 
fast you move around your analog stick
so<00:05:06.500> I<00:05:06.530> would<00:05:06.830> change<00:05:07.040> it<00:05:07.250> to<00:05:07.400> roughly<00:05:08.090> about<00:05:08.300> 80

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
so I would change it to roughly about 80

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.610 
so I would change it to roughly about 80
it's<00:05:09.710> just<00:05:09.950> the<00:05:10.070> right<00:05:10.190> speed<00:05:10.640> and<00:05:11.620> that's

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
it's just the right speed and that's

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.710 
it's just the right speed and that's
what<00:05:12.950> I<00:05:12.980> would<00:05:13.100> use<00:05:13.370> it<00:05:13.550> just<00:05:13.730> it<00:05:14.180> makes<00:05:14.419> saw

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
what I would use it just it makes saw

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.170 
what I would use it just it makes saw
your<00:05:15.320> Minecraft<00:05:16.130> experience<00:05:16.700> just<00:05:16.940> a<00:05:17.030> lot

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
your Minecraft experience just a lot

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.200 
your Minecraft experience just a lot
better<00:05:18.400> I'm<00:05:19.400> just<00:05:19.520> going<00:05:19.700> to<00:05:19.760> change<00:05:20.000> that<00:05:20.060> to

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
better I'm just going to change that to

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.830 
better I'm just going to change that to
a<00:05:20.330> tee<00:05:21.880> now<00:05:22.880> you're<00:05:23.060> going<00:05:23.240> to<00:05:23.330> want<00:05:23.479> to<00:05:23.600> do<00:05:23.690> the

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
a tee now you're going to want to do the

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.560 
a tee now you're going to want to do the
same<00:05:24.020> thing<00:05:24.350> till<00:05:24.950> lefty<00:05:25.520> to<00:05:25.970> the<00:05:26.090> left<00:05:26.360> analog

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
same thing till lefty to the left analog

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.480 
same thing till lefty to the left analog
stick<00:05:26.840> to<00:05:27.290> you<00:05:27.500> can't<00:05:27.740> just<00:05:27.890> do<00:05:28.040> to<00:05:28.220> the<00:05:28.310> one

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
stick to you can't just do to the one

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.300 
stick to you can't just do to the one
because<00:05:28.669> then<00:05:28.820> they'll<00:05:29.419> be<00:05:29.479> off<00:05:30.160> topic<00:05:31.160> and

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
because then they'll be off topic and

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.969 
because then they'll be off topic and
that<00:05:31.430> I<00:05:31.460> mean<00:05:31.760> off<00:05:31.910> the<00:05:32.410> motion<00:05:33.410> and<00:05:33.740> then<00:05:33.860> they

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
that I mean off the motion and then they

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.630 
that I mean off the motion and then they
won't<00:05:34.100> really<00:05:34.340> work<00:05:34.430> so<00:05:36.280> that's<00:05:37.280> pretty<00:05:37.550> much

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
won't really work so that's pretty much

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.050 
won't really work so that's pretty much
