00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:38.920 
the traps at the same time as your back
workout<00:02:37.970> there's<00:02:38.299> something<00:02:38.569> little<00:02:38.870> bit

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
workout there's something little bit

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.349 
workout there's something little bit
unique<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.709> I<00:02:40.010> definitely<00:02:40.670> agree<00:02:40.760> with<00:02:40.970> that

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
unique and I definitely agree with that

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.000 
unique and I definitely agree with that
another<00:02:41.660> thing<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:41.959> like<00:02:42.170> about<00:02:42.200> this<00:02:42.620> workout

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
another thing I like about this workout

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.410 
another thing I like about this workout
is<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.519> carbs

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
is the carbs

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.849 
is the carbs
not<00:02:45.019> only<00:02:45.290> is<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.620> three<00:02:46.480> exercises<00:02:47.560> 25<00:02:48.560> reps

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
not only is it three exercises 25 reps

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.220 
not only is it three exercises 25 reps
something<00:02:49.340> ridiculous<00:02:49.880> right<00:02:50.120> but<00:02:50.600> if<00:02:50.870> you

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
something ridiculous right but if you

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.280 
something ridiculous right but if you
look<00:02:51.889> into<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.609> workout<00:02:53.060> program<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:54.079> is

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
look into the workout program this is

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.580 
look into the workout program this is
just<00:02:54.620> 48<00:02:55.069> hours<00:02:55.459> after<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:56.450> last<00:02:57.230> half

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
just 48 hours after the last half

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.220 
just 48 hours after the last half
workout<00:02:58.130> so<00:02:58.420> if<00:02:59.420> you're<00:02:59.600> like<00:02:59.720> me<00:02:59.930> you<00:03:00.109> have

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
workout so if you're like me you have

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.890 
workout so if you're like me you have
skinny<00:03:00.680> car<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.760> know<00:03:01.910> you<00:03:02.359> need<00:03:02.569> to<00:03:02.600> develop

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
skinny car you know you need to develop

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.629 
skinny car you know you need to develop
the<00:03:03.230> carbs<00:03:03.590> this<00:03:04.010> is<00:03:04.190> something<00:03:04.459> that<00:03:04.489> I

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
the carbs this is something that I

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.180 
the carbs this is something that I
recommend<00:03:04.910> because<00:03:05.420> 48<00:03:05.900> hours<00:03:06.260> is<00:03:06.530> perfect

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
recommend because 48 hours is perfect

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.610 
recommend because 48 hours is perfect
