00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.930 
rotate it because if your jeans float to
the<00:03:39.360> top<00:03:40.010> then<00:03:41.010> you'll<00:03:41.160> want<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.400> rotate<00:03:41.580> it<00:03:41.790> so

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
the top then you'll want to rotate it so

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.250 
the top then you'll want to rotate it so
it<00:03:42.210> doesn't<00:03:42.360> just<00:03:42.690> get<00:03:43.550> on<00:03:44.550> the<00:03:44.670> outside<00:03:45.230> so<00:03:46.230> I

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
it doesn't just get on the outside so I

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.320 
it doesn't just get on the outside so I
ended<00:03:46.830> up<00:03:46.950> leaving<00:03:47.160> my<00:03:47.370> pants<00:03:47.610> in<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.910> mixture

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
ended up leaving my pants in the mixture

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.800 
ended up leaving my pants in the mixture
for<00:03:48.840> about<00:03:49.500> two<00:03:49.680> hours<00:03:50.300> checking<00:03:51.300> like<00:03:51.540> every

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
for about two hours checking like every

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.020 
for about two hours checking like every
five<00:03:51.990> minutes<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.709> make<00:03:53.250> sure<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.640> they're

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
five minutes to make sure that they're
