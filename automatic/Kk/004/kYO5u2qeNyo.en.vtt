00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.760 
all right changes are all set to go
there<00:02:45.100> so<00:02:45.400> we're<00:02:45.550> going<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:46.020> do<00:02:47.020> a<00:02:47.050> restart<00:02:47.500> and

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
there so we're going to do a restart and

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.320 
there so we're going to do a restart and
when<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:47.950> pops<00:02:48.130> back<00:02:48.370> up<00:02:48.430> it'll<00:02:48.880> be<00:02:48.970> ready<00:02:49.120> to

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
when it pops back up it'll be ready to

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:58.110 
when it pops back up it'll be ready to
go<00:02:49.450> with<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.720> hotspot

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120

this<00:02:59.110> also<00:02:59.500> coincidentally<00:02:59.680> would<00:03:00.250> apply<00:03:00.519> to

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
this also coincidentally would apply to

this also coincidentally would apply to
