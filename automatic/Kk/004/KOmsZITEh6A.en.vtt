00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
that the two is really good i was on the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.130 
that the two is really good i was on the
verge<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.240> playing<00:00:48.420> three<00:00:48.630> but<00:00:48.810> i<00:00:48.840> took<00:00:48.900> one

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
verge of playing three but i took one

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.560 
verge of playing three but i took one
out<00:00:49.260> anyways<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:50.250> um<00:00:50.460> it's<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:50.880> our<00:00:51.090> loggia

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
out anyways but um it's like our loggia

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.300 
out anyways but um it's like our loggia
because<00:00:52.290> you<00:00:52.410> just<00:00:52.590> summon<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.160> if

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
because you just summon it and if

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.710 
because you just summon it and if
they're<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.580> bad<00:00:53.730> spot<00:00:54.000> like<00:00:54.330> the<00:00:54.480> only<00:00:54.570> have

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
they're in a bad spot like the only have

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.720 
they're in a bad spot like the only have
four<00:00:54.900> cards<00:00:55.140> then<00:00:56.040> it's<00:00:56.250> pretty<00:00:56.340> much<00:00:56.460> again

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
four cards then it's pretty much again

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.800 
four cards then it's pretty much again
for<00:00:56.760> their<00:00:57.000> because<00:00:57.180> when<00:00:57.330> it<00:00:57.420> dies<00:00:57.570> you're

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
for their because when it dies you're

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.600 
for their because when it dies you're
gonna<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.020> something<00:00:58.350> back<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.860> against

doesn't<00:01:35.070> change<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:36.570> game<00:01:36.720> cuz<00:01:36.960> if<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.440> deck

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
doesn't change the game cuz if a deck

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.160 
doesn't change the game cuz if a deck
russia's<00:01:38.400> marks<00:01:39.150> then<00:01:39.540> they're<00:01:39.870> gonna<00:01:39.960> leave

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
because it comes back to hand and then

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.410 
because it comes back to hand and then
you'll<00:02:14.250> draw<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.459> second<00:02:14.879> one<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.209> will<00:02:15.269> just

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
you'll draw a second one it will just

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.449

kind of sit there what was really cool
about<00:02:17.670> him<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.060> if<00:02:18.599> you're<00:02:18.750> afraid<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:18.990> warning

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
about him is if you're afraid of warning

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.059

or they have a

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.830 
or they have a
the<00:02:20.129> on-field<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.670> tribute<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.209> set<00:02:21.719> them

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
the on-field you tribute and set them

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.020 
the on-field you tribute and set them
because<00:02:22.469> then<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:23.099> can't<00:02:23.340> get<00:02:23.489> negated<00:02:23.909> and

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
because then it can't get negated and

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.050 
because then it can't get negated and
then<00:02:24.810> when<00:02:24.930> they<00:02:24.959> attack<00:02:25.639> its<00:02:26.639> effect<00:02:26.969> would

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
then when they attack its effect would

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.220 
then when they attack its effect would
go<00:02:27.180> off<00:02:27.299> because<00:02:27.510> justice<00:02:27.810> flipped<00:02:28.049> face-up

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230
