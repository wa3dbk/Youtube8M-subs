00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.559 

I<00:00:04.410> wanted<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.040> go<00:00:05.160> more<00:00:05.430> in-depth<00:00:05.880> into<00:00:06.029> what<00:00:06.540> I

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
I wanted to go more in-depth into what I

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.690 
I wanted to go more in-depth into what I
call<00:00:06.840> power<00:00:07.470> finesse<00:00:07.950> flippin<00:00:08.340> because<00:00:08.519> it's

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
call power finesse flippin because it's

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.970 
call power finesse flippin because it's
more<00:00:08.910> than<00:00:08.940> it's<00:00:09.870> more<00:00:10.110> than<00:00:10.290> just<00:00:10.349> punching

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
more than it's more than just punching

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.800 
more than it's more than just punching
which<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.250> what<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.460> was<00:00:11.640> really<00:00:11.880> focused<00:00:12.690> on

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:12.810 
which is what I was really focused on

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.530 
which is what I was really focused on
earlier<00:00:13.260> and<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.550> just<00:00:14.730> power<00:00:15.120> power

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
earlier and this is just power power

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.630 
earlier and this is just power power
finesse<00:00:15.960> flippin<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.590> just<00:00:17.369> so<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.550> know

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
finesse flippin and just so you know

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.300 
finesse flippin and just so you know
what<00:00:18.240> I'm<00:00:18.330> talking<00:00:18.720> about<00:00:19.970> the<00:00:20.970> D<00:00:21.180> bomb<00:00:21.470> is<00:00:22.470> a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
what I'm talking about the D bomb is a

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.970 
what I'm talking about the D bomb is a
is<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.789> power<00:00:24.720> flippin<00:00:25.230> bait<00:00:27.320> it's<00:00:28.320> big<00:00:28.560> its

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
is a power flippin bait it's big its

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.790 
is a power flippin bait it's big its
bulky<00:00:29.330> this<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.600> more<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.230> what<00:00:31.350> I<00:00:31.380> consider

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
bulky this is more of what I consider

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.799 
bulky this is more of what I consider
this<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.189> missile<00:00:32.489> crawl<00:00:32.669> it's<00:00:32.910> skinnier<00:00:33.510> a

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
this is a missile crawl it's skinnier a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.439 
this is a missile crawl it's skinnier a
little<00:00:34.140> smaller<00:00:34.410> profile<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.579> baby<00:00:35.819> D<00:00:36.030> mom<00:00:36.210> I

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
little smaller profile the baby D mom I

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.459 
little smaller profile the baby D mom I
consider<00:00:36.929> the<00:00:37.109> same<00:00:37.319> thing<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.859> even<00:00:39.469> their

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
consider the same thing and even their

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.189 
consider the same thing and even their
little<00:00:40.679> likes<00:00:40.829> mini<00:00:41.100> flip<00:00:41.399> jig<00:00:41.899> you<00:00:42.899> know<00:00:42.989> it's

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199 
little likes mini flip jig you know it's

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.829 
little likes mini flip jig you know it's
it's<00:00:43.620> got<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.859> smaller<00:00:44.190> profile<00:00:44.670> than<00:00:45.149> just<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:45.839 
it's got a smaller profile than just the

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:47.569 
it's got a smaller profile than just the
D<00:00:45.960> bomb<00:00:46.139> by<00:00:46.319> itself<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:47.069> know<00:00:47.159> and<00:00:47.339> that's<00:00:47.429> a

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
D bomb by itself you know and that's a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.419 
D bomb by itself you know and that's a
jig<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.120> baby<00:00:48.269> D<00:00:48.479> bomb<00:00:48.629> together<00:00:49.190> so<00:00:50.190> that

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
jig and a baby D bomb together so that

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.309 
jig and a baby D bomb together so that
it's<00:00:50.729> a<00:00:50.819> lot<00:00:50.969> smaller<00:00:51.269> profile<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.019> what

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:52.319 
it's a lot smaller profile this is what

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:56.899 
it's a lot smaller profile this is what
I<00:00:52.350> consider<00:00:53.149> power<00:00:54.149> finesse<00:00:54.859> flippin<00:00:55.859> a<00:00:56.489> lot

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
I consider power finesse flippin a lot

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:00.079 
I consider power finesse flippin a lot
of<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> same<00:00:57.329> principles<00:00:57.959> apply<00:00:58.729> but<00:00:59.729> but

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
of the same principles apply but but

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:01.430 
of the same principles apply but but
you're<00:01:00.209> gonna<00:01:00.299> downsize<00:01:00.780> your<00:01:01.049> line<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> little

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
you're gonna downsize your line a little

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.590 
you're gonna downsize your line a little
bit<00:01:01.559> downsize<00:01:02.459> the<00:01:02.639> profile<00:01:03.030> debate<00:01:03.389> and

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
bit downsize the profile debate and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.240 
bit downsize the profile debate and
you're<00:01:04.379> going<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.559> accomplish<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.040> couple

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
you're going to accomplish a couple

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.100 
you're going to accomplish a couple
different<00:01:05.670> things<00:01:05.700> one<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.420> which<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.840> that

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
different things one of which is that

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.020 
different things one of which is that
you're<00:01:07.440> gonna<00:01:07.590> you're<00:01:08.160> gonna<00:01:08.250> get<00:01:08.490> more<00:01:08.790> bites

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
you're gonna you're gonna get more bites

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.320 
you're gonna you're gonna get more bites
and<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:10.140> some<00:01:10.380> situations<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.700> get<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:12.030> whole

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
and in some situations you get a whole

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.220 
and in some situations you get a whole
lot<00:01:12.600> more<00:01:12.780> bites

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
lot more bites

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.420 
lot more bites
so<00:01:14.690> that's<00:01:15.690> that's<00:01:16.020> where<00:01:16.260> the<00:01:16.770> power<00:01:16.980> finesse

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
so that's that's where the power finesse

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.090 
so that's that's where the power finesse
comes<00:01:17.700> into<00:01:17.940> play<00:01:18.120> is<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.570> size<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.890> bait

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
comes into play is the size of the bait

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.010 
comes into play is the size of the bait
and<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.610> sighs<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.120> think<00:01:21.180> shape<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.780> almost

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
and it's sighs I think shape is almost

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.740 
and it's sighs I think shape is almost
in<00:01:22.230> that<00:01:22.470> same<00:01:22.800> category<00:01:23.300> because<00:01:24.300> you've<00:01:24.570> got

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
in that same category because you've got

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.260 
in that same category because you've got
the<00:01:24.990> you've<00:01:25.290> got<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.650> size<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.820> bait<00:01:27.000> you

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the you've got the size of the bait you

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.150 
the you've got the size of the bait you
know<00:01:27.360> we're<00:01:27.630> talking<00:01:27.780> baby<00:01:28.470> D<00:01:28.680> bomb<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.070> D

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
know we're talking baby D bomb and D

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.500 
know we're talking baby D bomb and D
bomb<00:01:29.340> there's<00:01:29.610> times<00:01:29.850> when<00:01:30.060> they<00:01:30.120> eat<00:01:30.330> that

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
bomb there's times when they eat that

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.880 
bomb there's times when they eat that
baby<00:01:30.720> D<00:01:30.900> bomb<00:01:31.050> like<00:01:31.260> crazy<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.620> they<00:01:31.710> won't

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
baby D bomb like crazy and they won't

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.290 
baby D bomb like crazy and they won't
touch<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.220> Big<00:01:32.370> D<00:01:32.490> bump<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.120> same

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
touch the Big D bump it's the same

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.820 
touch the Big D bump it's the same
profile<00:01:33.660> bait<00:01:33.950> just<00:01:34.950> smaller<00:01:35.270> versus<00:01:36.270> larger

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
profile bait just smaller versus larger

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.620 
profile bait just smaller versus larger
and<00:01:37.830> I<00:01:38.010> think<00:01:38.220> other<00:01:38.430> people<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.390> may<00:01:39.540> have

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
and I think other people you may have

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.750 
and I think other people you may have
seen<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.020> your<00:01:40.140> own<00:01:40.260> fishing<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:41.640> know

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
seen it on your own fishing you know

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.300 
seen it on your own fishing you know
finesse<00:01:42.150> worms<00:01:42.390> versus<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> bigger<00:01:43.950> straight

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
finesse worms versus a bigger straight

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.310 
finesse worms versus a bigger straight
worm<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:45.360> know<00:01:45.480> they'll<00:01:45.630> bite<00:01:45.780> one<00:01:45.990> versus

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
worm you know they'll bite one versus

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.700 
worm you know they'll bite one versus
the<00:01:46.440> other

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
the other

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.860 
the other
the<00:01:47.220> night<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.580> day<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:47.760> size<00:01:48.150> can<00:01:48.450> make<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> big

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
the night and day so size can make a big

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.200 
the night and day so size can make a big
difference

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.920 

places<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.080> use<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.920> power<00:01:53.070> finesse<00:01:53.520> is

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
places to use the the power finesse is

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.270 
places to use the the power finesse is
like<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.110> gave<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.380> Lake<00:01:55.500> Falcon<00:01:55.860> example

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
like that gave the Lake Falcon example

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.570 
like that gave the Lake Falcon example
earlier<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.990> I<00:01:57.990> think<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.070> reason<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.460> that

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
earlier and I think the reason that that

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.340 
earlier and I think the reason that that
Lake<00:01:59.880> Falcon<00:02:00.300> it<00:02:00.780> made<00:02:01.020> such<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.260> difference

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
Lake Falcon it made such a difference

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.190 
Lake Falcon it made such a difference
there<00:02:01.830> is<00:02:01.979> because<00:02:02.300> that<00:02:03.300> Lake<00:02:03.540> has<00:02:03.750> just<00:02:03.990> been

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
there is because that Lake has just been

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.920 
there is because that Lake has just been
absolutely<00:02:04.670> pounded<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.390> last<00:02:06.600> five<00:02:06.869> or

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
absolutely pounded in the last five or

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.219 
absolutely pounded in the last five or
six<00:02:07.200> years<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:08.069> newer<00:02:08.310> there'll<00:02:08.940> be<00:02:08.970> days

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
six years and the newer there'll be days

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.050 
six years and the newer there'll be days
you<00:02:10.229> know<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:11.100> wintertime<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.880> there'll

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
you know in the wintertime and there'll

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.090

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
be 200 votes at every ramp

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.800 
be 200 votes at every ramp
I<00:02:14.130> just<00:02:14.580> gets<00:02:14.790> absolutely<00:02:15.239> slaughtered<00:02:15.660> the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
I just gets absolutely slaughtered the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.510 
I just gets absolutely slaughtered the
water<00:02:16.020> had<00:02:16.350> been<00:02:16.560> low<00:02:16.770> I<00:02:16.980> feel<00:02:17.130> like<00:02:17.250> every

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.309 
water had been low I feel like every
fish<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:17.940> Lake<00:02:18.209> had<00:02:18.390> either<00:02:18.569> seen<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.959> lure
