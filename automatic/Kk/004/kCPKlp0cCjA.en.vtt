00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.390
 so the most important thing for us to talk about 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.589
 that before talking about the course of much 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.880
 harmony is you 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.700
 is we talk a little about what 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.059
 you should expect from the course of harmony 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.740
 okay and it depends a lot on the student of 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.380
 student to student and especially the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.420
 type of music the student likes or 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.820
 type of music the student learns 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.529
 Okay, why are you going to see the course? 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.630
 in harmony we will talk about several 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.210
 theoretical contents that when they will speak 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.120
 of all the rules of harmony and everything 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.790
 more but depending on the musical styles 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.730
 that the student likes us will apply 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.780
 But these are these rules of 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.149
 harmony or not ok then one thing that 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.370
 happens a lot is many students by 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.410
 example they play music for example the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.370
 face plays national rock face only plays 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.840
 National Rock 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.850
 then when he will learn harmony it 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.120
 learn a harmony that the national rock 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.879
 it does not apply ok it just does not use 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.379
 Quiet all those harmonic rules 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.780
 that he is learning for example a 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.430
 book in a method of harmony of a class 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.130
 of harmony and this is a big problem 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.470
 because the practical world of this 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.960
 student and that plays is one he goes to study 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.720
 theory of harmony is another and things 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.060
 do not fuse do not fit 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.159
 so this is a big problem this was 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.869
 the big problem for a long time and 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.970
 nobody said it then for many 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.939
 Sometimes I was a student who is a guy who 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.299
 played rock national rock played blues 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.820
 played the barbie and the guitar and guitar 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.430
 touched finger style but the songs that 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.530
 they did not use this they did not use the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.270
 rules of harmony that I was 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.090
 learning and then I get talking but 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.619
 then it is either not stomach the rule said 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.420
 But this guy I 'm playing here. 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.110
 he does not do that right there and the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.240
 that is wrong 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.840
 after a long time understands that the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.979
 two work out but there is a certain 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.670
 level where the people I'll be right 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.670
 comment 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.450
 so the most important here is you 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.520
 to know that the study of harmony has 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.950
 the most basic studies or the study is 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.079
 one but has the most basic levels and 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.000
 you deepen to a level well 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.830
 advanced harmony 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.020
 ok just the musical styles where 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.970
 nothing harmony levels then this is 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.520
 one thing and this is the topic that I want 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.520
 reach the levels of harmony
