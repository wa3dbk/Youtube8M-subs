00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:20.280
 hello and welcome again i am cs and today 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.260
 I bring you a trick here on the dye map 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.170
 rice and good for it what 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.020
 we will need two pieces 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.910
 the most important piece is tonight 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.700
 and not the other one so first we pick up 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.170
 one for example this one and then we collect 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.120
 This is the important one according to 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.390
 which will have to be dragged 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.949
 this now I teach it for one more player 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.040
 I'll teach it for two players 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.870
 because it 's quite different 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.300
 for two players you have to open this 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.460
 so you'll see later how 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.320
 I do and we drag the piece with the 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.010
 square fast a while walking towards 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.500
 front and square 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.930
 if you do not go out practicing the truth is that 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.550
 it does not cost so much and good here what 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.940
 you will have to do will be to jump and give 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.650
 squared 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.780
 and good once here and 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.060
 and it will be much more difficult for us 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.790
 kill because in this trick we can 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.770
 give occasional random blow like this 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.690
 that I recommend if you can place three 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.000
 pieces place this piece and the accordion 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.770
 and well, nothing simply as 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.020
 you will see here the zombie does not do anything to me 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.860
 as I say put some other blow 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.900
 random as you see 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.930
 and good what is recommended for this is 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.960
 100% have titan and have a good weapon 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.300
 what would be the slide kitty search engine and 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.190
 well now I will teach it to do it in 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.370
 multiplayer mode that would be with two 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.590
 people or those that you want and good 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.650
 it would simply be to take the pieces as 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.260
 before but this time without opening here 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.479
 for the sofa quite important I will have 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.420
 to go down here with great care and 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.880
 you can you can drop the piece and 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.729
 you are quite difficult this step 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.650
 for some who have not done it 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.860
 you have to give is that simply give 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.179
 squared all the time down even 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.100
 that is when you are going down to give the 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.350
 square is quite difficult but at 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.140
 I will end me at first I 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.970
 it cost but I already dominate it and good here 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.270
 it's basically the same jumping and leaving 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.820
 the piece there I recommend leaving the 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.680
 the bellows part is not it also 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.050
 leave the two pieces if you can with a 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.450
 third piece so you would have more 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.580
 security in the trick 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.660
 and well basically this is the barrier 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.640
 is this is pretty easy nothing I hope 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.110
 that you liked manÃ¡ like subscribing 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.110

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.010
