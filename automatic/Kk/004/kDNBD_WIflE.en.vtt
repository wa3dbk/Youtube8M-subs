00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:15.560 
in this lesson we're going to check out

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.010 
in this lesson we're going to check out
the<00:00:15.860> Eric<00:00:16.160> Clapton<00:00:16.580> tune<00:00:16.820> down<00:00:17.210> and<00:00:17.480> out<00:00:17.570> now

the Eric Clapton tune down and out now

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.470 
the Eric Clapton tune down and out now
again<00:00:18.680> this<00:00:18.830> is<00:00:18.890> not<00:00:19.250> exactly<00:00:19.820> the<00:00:20.030> same<00:00:20.240> as

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
again this is not exactly the same as

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.420 
again this is not exactly the same as
the<00:00:20.630> record<00:00:20.990> before<00:00:21.260> anyone<00:00:21.710> grasses<00:00:22.160> on<00:00:22.279> me

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
the record before anyone grasses on me

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.790 
the record before anyone grasses on me
this<00:00:22.939> is<00:00:23.000> an<00:00:23.270> arrangement<00:00:23.810> of<00:00:24.140> the<00:00:24.470> guitar

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
this is an arrangement of the guitar

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.160 
this is an arrangement of the guitar
parts<00:00:25.279> so<00:00:25.790> it<00:00:25.939> sounds<00:00:26.300> nice<00:00:26.540> with<00:00:26.900> just<00:00:27.110> one

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
parts so it sounds nice with just one

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.050 
parts so it sounds nice with just one
guitar<00:00:27.650> because<00:00:27.950> there's<00:00:28.189> a<00:00:28.250> few<00:00:28.580> guitars<00:00:28.880> on

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
guitar because there's a few guitars on

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.659 
guitar because there's a few guitars on
the<00:00:29.180> recording<00:00:29.599> so<00:00:29.840> it's<00:00:30.710> kind<00:00:30.890> of<00:00:30.950> basically

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
the recording so it's kind of basically

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.229 
the recording so it's kind of basically
what<00:00:32.119> he's<00:00:32.300> playing<00:00:32.599> but<00:00:32.900> a<00:00:33.140> little<00:00:33.710> bit<00:00:33.829> more

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
what he's playing but a little bit more

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.300 
what he's playing but a little bit more
simplified<00:00:35.239> and<00:00:35.660> with<00:00:36.230> a<00:00:36.260> few<00:00:36.500> little<00:00:36.950> extra

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:37.310 
simplified and with a few little extra

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.000 
simplified and with a few little extra
bits<00:00:37.489> tucked<00:00:37.850> in<00:00:38.060> as<00:00:38.210> well<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:38.770> I'm<00:00:39.770> just<00:00:39.890> going

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
bits tucked in as well so I'm just going

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.260 
bits tucked in as well so I'm just going
to<00:00:40.070> play<00:00:40.250> it<00:00:40.280> for<00:00:40.489> you<00:00:40.579> now<00:00:40.640> so<00:00:40.730> you<00:00:40.940> hear<00:00:41.149> what

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.940 

which<00:01:55.940> is<00:01:56.180> using<00:01:56.630> a<00:01:56.720> first<00:01:56.990> finger<00:01:57.230> bar<00:01:57.620> I

which is using a first finger bar I

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.010 
which is using a first finger bar I
prefer<00:01:58.880> my<00:01:59.030> third<00:01:59.330> finger<00:01:59.570> they're<00:01:59.780> sometimes

played with the second finger like that
I<00:02:02.510> don't<00:02:02.960> know<00:02:03.050> I<00:02:03.080> find<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.710> a<00:02:03.800> bit<00:02:03.830> easier<00:02:04.250> to

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
I don't know I find it a bit easier to

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.220 
I don't know I find it a bit easier to
get<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.550> stronger<00:02:05.270> grip<00:02:05.450> if<00:02:05.660> I<00:02:05.750> use<00:02:05.900> my<00:02:06.080> third

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.690 
get a stronger grip if I use my third
thing<00:02:06.290> that<00:02:06.590> kind<00:02:06.740> of<00:02:06.770> angles<00:02:07.160> my<00:02:07.280> hand<00:02:07.490> better

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470

-<00:02:18.270> good<00:02:18.420> idea<00:02:18.690> with<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:18.930> one<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.230> use<00:02:19.410> first

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
- good idea with this one to use first

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.740 
- good idea with this one to use first
second<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.250> third<00:02:20.550> fingers<00:02:20.790> for<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.480> reason

second and third fingers for the reason

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.600 
second and third fingers for the reason

good thing to practice is just going for
this<00:04:11.739> jumping<00:04:12.730> your<00:04:12.879> first<00:04:13.150> finger<00:04:13.599> to<00:04:13.870> that

getting<00:04:16.510> your<00:04:16.630> first<00:04:16.870> finger<00:04:17.229> to<00:04:17.380> there<00:04:17.560> so

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
getting your first finger to there so

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.080 
getting your first finger to there so
just<00:04:18.160> do<00:04:18.310> this<00:04:18.549> much<00:04:20.340> worth<00:04:21.340> practicing<00:04:21.609> that

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
just do this much worth practicing that

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.200 
just do this much worth practicing that
again<00:04:23.010> so<00:04:24.010> you<00:04:24.070> can<00:04:24.340> deal<00:04:24.610> with<00:04:24.639> this<00:04:24.910> job

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
again so you can deal with this job

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.540 
again so you can deal with this job
otherwise<00:04:25.570> it's<00:04:25.780> a<00:04:25.840> bit<00:04:25.990> difficult<00:04:26.440> so<00:04:26.830> f

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.070 

F<00:04:30.180> sharp<00:04:30.569> diminished

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.749 

that's<00:04:33.470> another<00:04:33.770> job<00:04:34.069> but<00:04:34.220> this<00:04:34.370> one<00:04:34.550> should

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
that's another job but this one should

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.040 
that's another job but this one should
be<00:04:34.789> a<00:04:34.909> bit<00:04:35.090> more<00:04:35.210> straightforward<00:04:35.479> because<00:04:35.870> it

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
be a bit more straightforward because it

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.399 
be a bit more straightforward because it
jumps<00:04:36.349> to<00:04:36.379> a<00:04:36.530> C<00:04:36.889> chord<00:04:37.990> hopefully<00:04:38.990> one<00:04:39.169> time

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:39.409 
jumps to a C chord hopefully one time

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:40.689 
jumps to a C chord hopefully one time
you<00:04:39.530> play<00:04:39.740> an<00:04:39.800> issue<00:04:39.949> a<00:04:40.099> bit<00:04:40.280> familiar<00:04:40.430> with

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
you play an issue a bit familiar with

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:51.510 
you play an issue a bit familiar with
the<00:04:40.849> C<00:04:41.030> chord<00:04:41.300> so<00:04:41.719> M<00:04:44.740> C<00:04:47.139> this<00:04:48.139> is<00:04:48.319> just<00:04:48.500> a<00:04:48.620> C<00:04:49.270> then

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
the C chord so M C this is just a C then
