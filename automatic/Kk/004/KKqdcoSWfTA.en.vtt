00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:21.720
 welcome to my exercises to have 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.970
 a life account of a dancer 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.430
 these exercises are necessary for 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.810
 have a better performance so let's go 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.810
 to see the exercises 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.949
 let's start doing a little 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:37.170
 warm your arms you're going to 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:40.970
 place in that position and your legs 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.970
 they will go up flexed 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.190
 then we will perform the same 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.620
 exercise than the previous one but now 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.050
 let's tilt our torso and then 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.330
 return to the starting position and so 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.330
 let's work the abdomen but stand up 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.650
 in this exercise we are not going to flex 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.900
 the legs the only thing we're going to do 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.240
 is to tilt the torso and then return 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.250
 to the starting position and so we're going to 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.250
 Exercise all the strength in the abdomen 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.150
 then you're going to put on a towel or 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.340
 carpet and you're going to put your arm in that 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.800
 position recharging your body in the 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.020
 forearm and elbow and what you are going to do is 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.240
 raise one stretched leg and the other one 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.310
 is going to stay on the floor while your torso 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.090
 is going to tilt the side and your arm goes 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.090
 to go up and down 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.930
 now you are going to perform the same exercise 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.900
 than the previous one but totally lying down 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.880
 your leg is going to go up a bit more and you 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.030
 torso will try to lean towards the 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.030
 side 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.630
 in this exercise you will withdraw your 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.880
 legs up and you go to bed 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.550

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.340

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.270
 touch the tips making all the force 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.270
 in the abdomen 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.269
 now performs the same exercise but 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.549
 trying to touch your tips more after 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.060
 of issues to put more pressure on the 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.060
 abdomen 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.510
 you're going to put your arms back in that 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.760
 position and what you're going to do is 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.650

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.650

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.220
 and then rest a few 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.819
 seconds and you go back to do this 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.650
 exercise 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.650

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.760
 being in the same position as the 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.590
 earlier they will do the same but now 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.370
 we go inter each your legs from a side 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.370
 towards the other 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.040
 and in this last exercise what are you going to 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.190
