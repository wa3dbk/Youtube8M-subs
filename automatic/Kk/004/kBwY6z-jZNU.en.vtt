00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.200
 renny vega dialog today with the media in 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.490
 the monumental stadium and highlighted the 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.080
 Importance of winning both matches 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.300
 that are left to qualify for the playoffs 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.480
 leaving for antofagasta this Saturday to 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.610
 18 15 hours on the court david arellano 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.360
 since life says that we had good 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.130
 three finals were workouts only 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.890
 we already work hard to face a 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.650
 party and this step back final hand a 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.170
 team that I personally do not 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.870
 I know well but I know they are difficult 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.430
 complicated and surely here in the 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.880
 monumental all teams come from 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.040
 outside 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.020
 according to something different and good 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.050
 we have to have the strength and that 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.940
 union that we have every day for 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.140
 present to another bad end you already know if it 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.190
 It locks a little quieter but 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.030
 forever 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.530
 the look to the front trying twice as much 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.019
 what we have been working on because 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.670
 So far we have not gained anything the idea 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.769
 of winning this match to enter the 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.659
 playoff the Venezuelan then confessed that 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.340
 He thought about leaving but given his ownership 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.080
 he was enthusiastic about fulfilling his contract 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.880
 until the end of the year independent of 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.649
 technical that can arrive and the output 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.420
 by jaime pizarro ivo bassay who 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.720
 they were the ones who brought him the kilo 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.340
 I'm just doing my job and 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.600
 what the coaching staff asks me in this 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.490
 moment that personal and out 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.890
 then what happens in the future 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.700
 it depends on me I have a contract I would like 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.710
 fulfill it in a good way and 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.240
 and try to do things well and 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.689
 think simply about colo colo ya 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.210
 then I repeat the decision of the 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.009
 directive finally the goalkeeper said that 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.420
 it does not matter who you touch to classify 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.219
 the postseason since you have to 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.380
 place again where colo 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:46.409
 it deserves and I always said it first 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.369
 you have to think about entering the playoffs 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.259
 after we enter the playofs there is 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.450
 think about the final because I'm colo 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.909
 colo as we say everything but that 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.409
 puts the color colo where it has to be 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.240
 to give life to the bloated to 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.729
 us to our family that out there 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.490
 they also suffer in bad times that 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.619
 of our career and simply that 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.849
 we have to think about Saturday and 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.299
 then thinking about the last game 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:09.299
 against waters
