to<00:00:35.430> open<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:35.790> net<00:00:36.300> disk<00:00:36.510> up<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.930> check<00:00:37.140> out

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
to open this net disk up and check out

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:47.340 
to open this net disk up and check out
what's<00:00:37.380> inside

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.810 

okay<00:00:48.350> so<00:00:48.410> looking<00:00:48.920> at<00:00:49.040> the<00:00:49.130> box<00:00:49.370> I<00:00:49.580> mean<00:00:49.700> it's

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
okay so looking at the box I mean it's

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.880 
okay so looking at the box I mean it's
pretty<00:00:49.910> simple<00:00:50.210> it<00:00:50.390> shows<00:00:50.540> a<00:00:50.570> picture<00:00:50.780> of<00:00:51.260> the

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
pretty simple it shows a picture of the

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.610 
pretty simple it shows a picture of the
device<00:00:52.220> it<00:00:52.610> lets<00:00:52.850> us<00:00:52.970> know<00:00:53.000> it's<00:00:53.360> USB<00:00:53.630> AC<00:00:54.020> SATA

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
device it lets us know it's USB AC SATA

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.470 
device it lets us know it's USB AC SATA
and<00:00:54.920> network<00:00:55.670> storage<00:00:55.880> so<00:00:56.180> you<00:00:56.240> know<00:00:56.390> if

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
and network storage so you know if

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.610 
and network storage so you know if
you're<00:00:56.600> taking<00:00:56.870> this<00:00:56.960> with<00:00:57.140> you<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:57.380> you

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
you're taking this with you and you

like<00:01:55.820> that<00:01:56.000> on<00:01:56.300> this<00:01:56.509> CD<00:01:57.399> this<00:01:58.399> is<00:01:58.550> actually

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
like that on this CD this is actually

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.130 
like that on this CD this is actually
pretty<00:01:59.240> big<00:01:59.450> I<00:01:59.660> thought<00:01:59.810> it<00:01:59.869> would<00:01:59.990> be<00:02:00.110> a

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
pretty big I thought it would be a

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.340 
pretty big I thought it would be a
little<00:02:00.320> bit<00:02:00.500> smaller<00:02:00.740> but<00:02:00.920> it<00:02:01.070> is<00:02:02.200> that<00:02:03.200> was

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
little bit smaller but it is that was

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.040 
little bit smaller but it is that was
last<00:02:03.679> walk<00:02:03.950> up<00:02:04.130> here<00:02:04.250> that<00:02:04.369> this<00:02:04.520> your<00:02:04.700> power

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
last walk up here that this your power

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.350 
last walk up here that this your power
connector<00:02:06.050> I'm<00:02:06.289> assuming<00:02:07.600> so<00:02:10.150> here<00:02:11.150> is<00:02:11.330> your

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
connector I'm assuming so here is your

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.220 
connector I'm assuming so here is your

then you have a power switch

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.390 
then you have a power switch
and<00:02:58.720> let's<00:02:59.720> see<00:02:59.960> how<00:03:00.200> easy<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:00.860> is<00:03:00.950> going<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:01.340> be

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
and let's see how easy it is going to be

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.570 
and let's see how easy it is going to be
to<00:03:01.760> open<00:03:02.180> this<00:03:02.300> up<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:03.410> open<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:03.830> up<00:03:04.070> all<00:03:04.370> you

to open this up to open this up all you

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.120 
to open this up to open this up all you
really<00:03:04.700> have<00:03:04.820> to<00:03:04.940> do<00:03:05.210> I'm<00:03:05.450> assuming<00:03:05.990> is<00:03:06.140> remove

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130

really have to do I'm assuming is remove
these<00:03:08.090> two<00:03:08.390> screws<00:03:08.420> so<00:03:09.320> we're<00:03:09.410> going<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.770> do

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
these two screws so we're going to do

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:26.980 
these two screws so we're going to do
that<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:24.520> yeah<00:03:25.520> just<00:03:25.820> pops<00:03:26.060> like<00:03:26.300> that<00:03:26.570> and

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
that and yeah just pops like that and

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.330 
that and yeah just pops like that and
you<00:03:27.950> can<00:03:28.070> open<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.640> you<00:03:28.760> can<00:03:28.910> see<00:03:29.209> I<00:03:30.340> you

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
you can open it and you can see I you

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.340 
you can open it and you can see I you
know<00:03:31.430> just<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.760> simple<00:03:32.090> Bay<00:03:32.330> it<00:03:32.690> looks<00:03:33.110> like<00:03:33.230> the

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
know just a simple Bay it looks like the

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.930 
know just a simple Bay it looks like the
bay<00:03:33.590> actually<00:03:33.920> comes<00:03:34.100> out<00:03:34.220> too<00:03:34.400> so<00:03:34.550> those<00:03:34.700> four

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
bay actually comes out too so those four

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.270 
bay actually comes out too so those four
screws<00:03:35.240> in<00:03:35.420> here<00:03:35.750> that<00:03:36.290> will<00:03:36.800> allow<00:03:37.010> you<00:03:37.070> to

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
take this out and place a hard drive in

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.320 
take this out and place a hard drive in
here<00:03:39.260> and<00:03:39.440> then<00:03:39.739> screw<00:03:40.550> it<00:03:40.700> in<00:03:40.880> with<00:03:41.150> the

right here it's basically like you know
your<00:03:46.430> normal<00:03:46.940> external<00:03:47.930> hard<00:03:48.110> drive

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
your normal external hard drive

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
enclosure except for it has the network

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.590 
enclosure except for it has the network
connection<00:03:50.720> so<00:03:50.959> this<00:03:51.590> is<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:52.010> net<00:03:52.190> this<00:03:52.600> from
