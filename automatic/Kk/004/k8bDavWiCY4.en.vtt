00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
it leave out this heart and that's why

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.359 
it leave out this heart and that's why
I'm<00:01:58.799> wearing<00:01:59.039> the<00:01:59.280> half<00:01:59.460> weeks<00:01:59.820> because<00:02:00.329> I

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
I'm wearing the half weeks because I

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.380 
I'm wearing the half weeks because I
don't<00:02:02.369> know<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:02.520> it'll<00:02:02.700> too<00:02:02.850> much<00:02:02.999> of<00:02:03.090> my<00:02:03.210> hair

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:06.749 
and it's still breaking I think it's

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:09.430
