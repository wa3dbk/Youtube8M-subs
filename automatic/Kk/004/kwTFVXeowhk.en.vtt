with the transposition of the great

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.549 
with the transposition of the great
vessels<00:00:45.800> are<00:00:47.570> generally<00:00:48.570> quite<00:00:48.809> ill<00:00:49.200> at<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
vessels are generally quite ill at the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.600 
vessels are generally quite ill at the
time<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:50.129> birth<00:00:51.320> they're<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.070> first<00:00:53.399> few

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
time of birth they're in the first few

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.819 
time of birth they're in the first few
hours<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.000> life<00:00:54.360> they<00:00:54.660> may<00:00:54.899> be<00:00:54.960> okay<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
hours of life they may be okay but the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.439 
hours of life they may be okay but the
reason<00:00:55.980> why<00:00:56.309> they're<00:00:56.550> okay<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:56.969> because<00:00:57.329> they

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
reason why they're okay is because they

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.160 
reason why they're okay is because they
have<00:00:57.559> persistence<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:59.300> areas<00:01:00.300> inside<00:01:00.899> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
have persistence of areas inside and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.930 
have persistence of areas inside and
outside<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.590> heart<00:01:01.980> where<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> pink<00:01:02.670> blood

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
outside the heart where the pink blood

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.729 
outside the heart where the pink blood
can<00:01:03.210> mix<00:01:03.449> with<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.660> blue<00:01:03.960> blood<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.589> is

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
can mix with the blue blood and this is

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.539 
can mix with the blue blood and this is
what<00:01:04.920> allows<00:01:05.250> them<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.850> be<00:01:06.510> okay<00:01:07.369> but<00:01:08.369> these

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
what allows them to be okay but these

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.899 
what allows them to be okay but these
are<00:01:08.700> temporary<00:01:09.180> connections<00:01:09.990> which<00:01:10.640> will<00:01:11.640> not

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
are temporary connections which will not

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.600 
are temporary connections which will not
sustain<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.510> baby<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.200> long<00:01:13.409> run<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.979> all

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
sustain the baby in the long run so all

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.249 
sustain the baby in the long run so all
babies<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.360> transposition<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.200> great

babies with transposition of the great

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.840 
babies with transposition of the great
vessels<00:01:16.729> require<00:01:17.729> some<00:01:18.720> intervention

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
vessels require some intervention

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.580 
vessels require some intervention
generally<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:21.090> surgery<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.380> usually

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
generally it's surgery and it usually

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.320 
generally it's surgery and it usually
needs<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.189> be<00:01:23.280> done<00:01:23.430> right<00:01:23.490> around<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.150> time

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
needs to be done right around the time

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.210 
needs to be done right around the time
of<00:01:24.390> birth<00:01:24.540> what<00:01:25.470> would<00:01:25.650> be<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.950> kind<00:01:26.100> of

the<00:01:58.979> leg<00:01:59.250> they<00:02:00.060> pass<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.899> up<00:02:01.079> deflated<00:02:01.950> up<00:02:02.159> into

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
the leg they pass it up deflated up into

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.130 
the leg they pass it up deflated up into
the<00:02:02.490> left<00:02:02.700> upper<00:02:03.000> chamber<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.509> heart<00:02:03.659> blow

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
the left upper chamber of the heart blow

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.480 
the left upper chamber of the heart blow
up<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.439> balloon<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.890> pull<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.130> into<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
up the balloon and pull it into the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.280 
up the balloon and pull it into the
right<00:02:05.640> upper<00:02:06.030> chamber<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.630> creates<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.110> a

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
right upper chamber and this creates a a

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.650 
right upper chamber and this creates a a
good-sized<00:02:08.280> hole<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.030> wall<00:02:09.179> between<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
good-sized hole in the wall between the

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
upper chambers of the heart

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.209 
upper chambers of the heart
allows<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.299> blue<00:02:11.569> blood<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:12.560> mix<00:02:12.769> with<00:02:13.069> the

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:13.219 
allows the blue blood to mix with the

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:16.839 
allows the blue blood to mix with the
pig<00:02:13.400> blood<00:02:13.609> so<00:02:14.239> bikes<00:02:14.569> time<00:02:14.959> to<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.950> can<00:02:16.700> do

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
pig blood so bikes time to you can do

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.059 
pig blood so bikes time to you can do
something<00:02:17.120> more<00:02:17.780> corrective<00:02:18.379> yeah<00:02:18.829> that

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
something more corrective yeah that

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.670 
something more corrective yeah that
that's<00:02:19.700> correct<00:02:19.969> and<00:02:20.439> traditionally<00:02:21.439> in<00:02:21.560> the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
that's correct and traditionally in the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.739 
that's correct and traditionally in the
past<00:02:21.920> surgery<00:02:22.700> for<00:02:22.730> transposition<00:02:23.329> of<00:02:23.689> the

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:23.749 
past surgery for transposition of the

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:25.390 
past surgery for transposition of the
great<00:02:23.810> vessels<00:02:24.170> especially<00:02:24.590> if<00:02:25.069> its<00:02:25.219> so

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
great vessels especially if its so

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.699 
great vessels especially if its so
called<00:02:25.579> simple<00:02:26.450> transposition<00:02:27.200> which<00:02:27.409> means

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
called simple transposition which means

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.860 
called simple transposition which means
there's<00:02:28.370> nothing<00:02:28.730> else<00:02:28.849> wrong<00:02:29.030> except<00:02:29.659> for

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
there's nothing else wrong except for

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.080 
there's nothing else wrong except for
the<00:02:29.930> transposition<00:02:30.379> itself<00:02:31.099> and<00:02:31.310> this<00:02:31.790> is<00:02:31.969> the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
the transposition itself and this is the

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.990 
the transposition itself and this is the
majority<00:02:32.239> of<00:02:32.719> babies<00:02:33.139> with<00:02:33.319> transposition<00:02:34.069> in

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
majority of babies with transposition in

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.729 
majority of babies with transposition in
the<00:02:35.180> past<00:02:35.389> that<00:02:35.599> surgery<00:02:36.049> was<00:02:36.200> generally

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
the past that surgery was generally

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.220 
the past that surgery was generally
delayed<00:02:37.099> until<00:02:37.370> three<00:02:37.849> to<00:02:38.120> six<00:02:38.359> months<00:02:38.450> of<00:02:38.959> age

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
delayed until three to six months of age

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.800 
delayed until three to six months of age
but<00:02:40.010> for<00:02:40.189> about<00:02:40.430> proximately<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.120> last<00:02:41.359> 15

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
but for about proximately the last 15

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.830 
but for about proximately the last 15
years<00:02:42.019> or<00:02:42.290> so<00:02:42.530> we've<00:02:43.400> had<00:02:44.030> a<00:02:44.299> different

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
years or so we've had a different

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.899 
years or so we've had a different
surgical<00:02:45.319> approach<00:02:45.769> to<00:02:46.010> transposition<00:02:46.730> that

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
surgical approach to transposition that

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.699 
surgical approach to transposition that
allows<00:02:47.239> us<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:47.689> correct<00:02:48.049> the<00:02:48.169> problem<00:02:48.590> and

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
allows us to correct the problem and

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.470 
allows us to correct the problem and
generally<00:02:49.430> that<00:02:49.579> correction<00:02:50.060> is<00:02:50.180> done<00:02:50.329> in<00:02:50.449> the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
generally that correction is done in the

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.599 
generally that correction is done in the
first<00:02:50.840> week<00:02:51.079> of<00:02:51.199> life<00:02:51.370> do<00:02:52.370> you<00:02:52.459> actually

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
first week of life do you actually

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.789 
first week of life do you actually
reverse<00:02:53.510> two<00:02:53.719> connections<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:54.500> you<00:02:54.560> make

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
reverse two connections so you make

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.890 
reverse two connections so you make
little<00:02:55.489> tunnels<00:02:56.150> well<00:02:56.329> how<00:02:56.419> do<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.569> approach

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
little tunnels well how do you approach

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.319 
little tunnels well how do you approach
the<00:02:57.169> problem<00:02:57.409> or<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.790> history<00:02:58.790> of<00:02:58.819> surgery

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
the problem or the history of surgery

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:00.550 
the problem or the history of surgery
for<00:02:59.480> transposition<00:02:59.870> of<00:03:00.139> the<00:03:00.199> great<00:03:00.260> vessels

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
for transposition of the great vessels

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.050 
for transposition of the great vessels
is<00:03:00.919> interesting<00:03:01.489> from<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.879> beginning

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
is interesting from the beginning

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.259 
is interesting from the beginning
doctors<00:03:02.989> that<00:03:03.169> treated<00:03:03.620> these<00:03:03.829> patients<00:03:04.370> felt

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
doctors that treated these patients felt

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.990 
doctors that treated these patients felt
that<00:03:06.079> the<00:03:06.230> logical<00:03:06.739> solution<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.519> problem

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
that the logical solution to the problem

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.729 
that the logical solution to the problem
was<00:03:08.180> moving<00:03:08.599> those<00:03:08.750> arteries<00:03:09.139> back<00:03:09.500> where

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
was moving those arteries back where

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.849 
was moving those arteries back where
they<00:03:09.889> belong<00:03:10.689> and<00:03:11.689> the<00:03:11.870> tricky<00:03:12.109> part<00:03:12.500> of<00:03:12.650> that

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
they belong and the tricky part of that

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.009 
they belong and the tricky part of that
was<00:03:13.189> not<00:03:13.370> moving<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.909> arteries<00:03:14.299> themselves

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
was not moving the arteries themselves

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.960 
was not moving the arteries themselves
but<00:03:15.229> moving<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:15.799> heart's<00:03:16.250> blood<00:03:16.370> supply

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
but moving the heart's blood supply

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.240 
but moving the heart's blood supply
which<00:03:17.239> is<00:03:17.419> also<00:03:17.720> reversed<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:18.799> transposition

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
which is also reversed and transposition

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.059 
which is also reversed and transposition
of<00:03:19.609> the<00:03:19.669> great<00:03:19.759> vessels<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:21.620> original

of the great vessels the original

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.800 
of the great vessels the original
operations<00:03:22.609> that<00:03:22.759> were<00:03:22.879> designed<00:03:23.269> to<00:03:23.359> do<00:03:23.599> that

operations that were designed to do that

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.390 
operations that were designed to do that

years<00:03:30.829> we've<00:03:31.400> gone<00:03:31.699> back<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.540> taking<00:03:33.470> those

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
years we've gone back to taking those

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.649 
years we've gone back to taking those
odds<00:03:34.040> large<00:03:34.430> arteries<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.239> putting<00:03:35.569> them

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:35.659 
odds large arteries and putting them

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:36.969 
odds large arteries and putting them

appropriate pumping chambers for Nate
the<00:03:39.169> surgery<00:03:39.620> yes<00:03:40.009> it's<00:03:40.250> called<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.579> arterial

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
the surgery yes it's called the arterial

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.589 
the surgery yes it's called the arterial
switch<00:03:41.479> or<00:03:41.989> anatomic<00:03:42.859> repair<00:03:43.280> so<00:03:44.120> basically

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
switch or anatomic repair so basically

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.149 
switch or anatomic repair so basically
you<00:03:44.840> just<00:03:44.870> putting<00:03:45.379> it<00:03:45.470> back<00:03:45.620> way<00:03:45.859> guard

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
you just putting it back way guard

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.099 
you just putting it back way guard
should<00:03:46.340> have<00:03:46.489> done<00:03:46.639> in<00:03:46.759> the<00:03:46.849> first<00:03:46.879> place<00:03:47.209> yes

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
should have done in the first place yes
