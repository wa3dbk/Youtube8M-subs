00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
a Mac 224 I'm picking up just a little

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.110 
a Mac 224 I'm picking up just a little
bit<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.590> product<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.309> I'm<00:00:50.489> gonna<00:00:50.640> work<00:00:50.910> in

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
bit of product and I'm gonna work in

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.560 
bit of product and I'm gonna work in
small<00:00:51.629> circular<00:00:52.050> motions<00:00:56.270> I'm<00:00:57.270> gonna<00:00:57.420> be

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
small circular motions I'm gonna be

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.420 
small circular motions I'm gonna be
starting<00:00:57.840> at<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> outer<00:00:58.350> corner<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.129> working

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
starting at the outer corner and working

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.929 
starting at the outer corner and working
my<00:00:59.730> way<00:00:59.760> inwards<00:01:04.220> and<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.369> can<00:01:05.519> carry<00:01:05.760> this

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
my way inwards and you can carry this

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.020 
my way inwards and you can carry this
however<00:01:06.360> high<00:01:06.960> up<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.470> want<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:10.909> wiping<00:01:11.909> off

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
however high up you want to wiping off

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.850 
however high up you want to wiping off
that<00:01:12.210> brush<00:01:12.450> really<00:01:12.689> well<00:01:13.020> I'm<00:01:13.260> taking<00:01:13.740> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
that brush really well I'm taking the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.160 
that brush really well I'm taking the
blur<00:01:14.250> from<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.790> stack<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.630> probably

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
blur from the stack and it is probably

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.840 
blur from the stack and it is probably
my<00:01:16.350> favorite<00:01:16.770> color<00:01:16.979> because<00:01:17.250> it's<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.729> an

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
my favorite color because it's like an

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.179 
my favorite color because it's like an
eraser<00:01:18.180> shade<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.560> I'm<00:01:19.619> just<00:01:19.830> gonna<00:01:19.950> be

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
eraser shade and so I'm just gonna be

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.109 
eraser shade and so I'm just gonna be
going<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.720> kind<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.610> area<00:01:23.610> where<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:23.970> had

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
going on the kind of area where we had

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.749 
going on the kind of area where we had
unseen<00:01:24.720> I'm<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.799> gonna<00:01:25.950> put<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.490> color

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
unseen I'm just gonna put that color

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.170 
unseen I'm just gonna put that color
right<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.630> area

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
right in that area

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.120 
right in that area
taking<00:01:30.180> enigma<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.500> flat<00:01:31.770> shader<00:01:32.040> brush

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
taking enigma and a flat shader brush

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.039 
taking enigma and a flat shader brush
we're<00:01:32.520> going<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.700> be<00:01:32.790> packing<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
we're going to be packing this on to the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:42.429 
we're going to be packing this on to the
lid

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.200 

we<00:01:43.439> want<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.770> transition<00:01:44.399> between<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.000> lid

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
we want that transition between the lid

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.149 
we want that transition between the lid
color<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.750> crease<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.320> really<00:01:46.770> flow

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
color and the crease to really flow

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.310 
color and the crease to really flow
nicely<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.790> I'm<00:01:47.880> taking<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.360> bit<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:49.110> more

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
nicely so I'm taking a bit of a more

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.590 
nicely so I'm taking a bit of a more
precision<00:01:49.799> blending<00:01:50.159> brush<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.450> M

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
precision blending brush this is the M

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.679 
precision blending brush this is the M
139th<00:01:52.590> from<00:01:52.860> morphe<00:01:53.189> brushes<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.909> taking

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
139th from morphe brushes and taking

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.810 
139th from morphe brushes and taking
that<00:01:54.780> enigma<00:01:55.259> color<00:01:55.500> again<00:01:55.799> we're<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:56.549> gonna

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
that enigma color again we're just gonna

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.179 
that enigma color again we're just gonna
use<00:01:57.000> small<00:01:57.329> circular<00:01:57.840> motions<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.679> blend<00:01:58.830> this

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
use small circular motions to blend this

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.570 
use small circular motions to blend this
into<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> crease<00:02:00.350> it's<00:02:01.350> gonna<00:02:01.530> make<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.009> look

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
into a crease it's gonna make that look

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.819 
into a crease it's gonna make that look
a<00:02:02.729> lot<00:02:03.149> better<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.689> kind<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.960> flow<00:02:04.289> better<00:02:04.590> as

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
a lot better and kind of flow better as

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:13.339 
a lot better and kind of flow better as
a<00:02:05.539> look<00:02:11.090> this<00:02:12.090> part<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.510> completely<00:02:12.690> optional

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
a look this part is completely optional

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.410 
a look this part is completely optional
but<00:02:13.709> I'm<00:02:13.920> gonna<00:02:14.100> go<00:02:14.310> back<00:02:14.549> through<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:14.970> kind

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
but I'm gonna go back through and kind

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.210 
but I'm gonna go back through and kind
of<00:02:15.510> touch<00:02:15.750> up<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.170> other<00:02:16.380> colors<00:02:16.860> we<00:02:16.890> have

I mess up all the time when I'm doing
this<00:04:48.760> I'm<00:04:49.760> just<00:04:50.120> gonna<00:04:50.360> try<00:04:50.690> my<00:04:50.870> best<00:04:50.900> to

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
difference in the liner and then

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.980 
difference in the liner and then
