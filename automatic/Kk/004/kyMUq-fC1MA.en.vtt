00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.269

 Meet sony SLR 5000 and lining 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:32.340
 prikyshchik the first thing to attract attention 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.380
 the user is of course the appearance 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.570
 camera which is without a twinge 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.180
 conscience just gorgeous he is fine 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.160
 combines notes of nostalgia for the 80th 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.710
 years of the last century with 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.860
 all the necessary innovations for cameras 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.750
 21 century camera housing is made of 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.270
 matte plastic is very nice on 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.030
 touch well thanks to the protruding grip and 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.280
 small section on it and 5000 lies in 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.050
 the hand is simply amazing separately would 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.420
 I wanted to stay on the built-in 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.879
 flashes here and there seems to be no button 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.280
 clicked and they now feel like 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.140
 submariner periscope well, something 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:13.860
 talk about build quality here 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.750
 general excess salt and tsoi only 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.790
 what else is worth adding this amount 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.710
 colors in which this data is available 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.869
 model in addition to the classic black and 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.180
 white user available silver 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.840
 and of course pink but what are you 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.840
 important 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.170
 with all this the camera shows off 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.790
 very compact size so without 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.119
 protruding parts of its dimensions 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.470
 The following widths are 100 9 and 6 are height 62 and 8 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.869
 and the thickness is thirty five and seven 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.729
 millimeters but the weight of the device is separate 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.500
 reason to be proud with the battery 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.350
 memory card and whale optics 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.300
 makes about 270 grams what does 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.640
 its record holder among mirrorless 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.650
 interchangeable lens cameras along with 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.530
 the camera comes with a lens 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.070

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.930
 millimeters and aperture f-35 these six in 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.399

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.850
 image stabilizer 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.050
 so even under severe stress 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.330
 image quality will still be 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.730
 excellent and whether the lens you 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.650
