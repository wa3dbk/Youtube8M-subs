for<00:00:11.690> blood<00:00:14.469> in<00:00:15.469> my<00:00:15.620> own<00:00:15.740> practice<00:00:15.889> I<00:00:16.430> do<00:00:17.029> a

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
for blood in my own practice I do a

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.940 
for blood in my own practice I do a
variety<00:00:17.570> of<00:00:17.599> things<00:00:17.810> so<00:00:18.230> I'm<00:00:18.410> a<00:00:18.439> treating

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:18.950 
variety of things so I'm a treating

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.740 
variety of things so I'm a treating
clinician<00:00:19.189> and<00:00:19.700> I<00:00:19.970> see<00:00:20.150> patients<00:00:20.360> with

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
clinician and I see patients with

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.769 
clinician and I see patients with
lymphoma<00:00:21.259> we<00:00:22.220> run<00:00:22.490> clinical<00:00:23.060> trials<00:00:23.480> in<00:00:23.660> my

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
lymphoma we run clinical trials in my

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.359 
lymphoma we run clinical trials in my
institutions<00:00:24.410> so<00:00:24.680> we're<00:00:24.860> certainly

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
institutions so we're certainly

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.819 
institutions so we're certainly
interested<00:00:25.579> in<00:00:26.200> bringing<00:00:27.200> novel

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:27.829

therapeutics<00:00:28.430> into<00:00:28.910> the<00:00:29.029> clinic<00:00:29.559> I've<00:00:30.559> read

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.000 
therapeutics into the clinic I've read
blood<00:00:31.160> since<00:00:31.640> I<00:00:31.759> was<00:00:31.910> a<00:00:31.939> trainee<00:00:32.239> it<00:00:33.200> became<00:00:33.860> my

blood since I was a trainee it became my
textbook<00:00:34.460> at<00:00:34.700> the<00:00:34.790> time<00:00:35.000> so<00:00:35.690> it<00:00:36.170> really<00:00:36.410> is<00:00:36.500> a

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620

of human logic malignancy right now is
just<00:00:48.280> expanding<00:00:49.280> tremendously<00:00:49.879> so<00:00:50.210> we're<00:00:50.390> at

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
just expanding tremendously so we're at

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.500 
just expanding tremendously so we're at
a<00:00:50.510> time<00:00:50.749> where<00:00:51.440> there<00:00:51.649> is<00:00:51.859> an<00:00:52.129> ongoing

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
a time where there is an ongoing

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.209 
a time where there is an ongoing
revolution<00:00:53.510> with<00:00:54.050> molecular<00:00:54.530> insight

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
revolution with molecular insight

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.149 
revolution with molecular insight
through<00:00:56.210> biological<00:00:56.480> dances<00:00:57.379> that<00:00:57.620> really<00:00:58.010> is

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
through biological dances that really is

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.669 
through biological dances that really is
starting<00:00:58.519> to<00:00:58.640> translate<00:00:59.390> into<00:00:59.690> our<00:01:00.230> ability

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
starting to translate into our ability

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.910 
starting to translate into our ability
to<00:01:01.039> identify<00:01:01.460> unique<00:01:02.449> targets<00:01:03.050> it<00:01:03.589> can<00:01:03.800> be

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
to identify unique targets it can be

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.980 
to identify unique targets it can be
exploited<00:01:04.370> therapeutically<00:01:05.269> so<00:01:05.690> for<00:01:05.930> the

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
exploited therapeutically so for the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.660 
exploited therapeutically so for the
first<00:01:06.140> time<00:01:06.350> ever<00:01:06.590> we're<00:01:06.860> able<00:01:07.010> to<00:01:07.190> come<00:01:07.430> in

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
first time ever we're able to come in

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.240 
first time ever we're able to come in
with<00:01:08.420> therapies<00:01:09.350> that<00:01:09.380> are<00:01:09.590> going<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:09.979> be

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
with therapies that are going to be

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.830 
with therapies that are going to be
specific<00:01:11.240> for<00:01:11.450> individual<00:01:12.350> lymphomas

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
specific for individual lymphomas

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
specific for individual lymphomas
historically<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:15.110> treatment<00:01:15.500> of<00:01:15.530> lymphoma

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
historically the treatment of lymphoma

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.790 
historically the treatment of lymphoma
has<00:01:16.550> included<00:01:17.480> chemotherapies<00:01:18.350> that<00:01:18.650> have

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
has included chemotherapies that have

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.710 
has included chemotherapies that have
very<00:01:18.980> non<00:01:19.400> specific<00:01:20.440> targets<00:01:21.440> so<00:01:21.950> the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
very non specific targets so the

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.270 
very non specific targets so the
chemotherapy<00:01:23.720> from<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.050> past<00:01:24.350> basically

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
chemotherapy from the past basically

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.300 
chemotherapy from the past basically
affected<00:01:25.790> not<00:01:25.970> only<00:01:26.030> cancer<00:01:26.660> cells<00:01:26.900> but<00:01:27.110> also

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
affected not only cancer cells but also

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.220 
affected not only cancer cells but also
normal<00:01:28.310> body<00:01:28.520> cells<00:01:28.910> now<00:01:29.750> by<00:01:29.990> identifying

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
normal body cells now by identifying

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.650 
normal body cells now by identifying
really<00:01:31.010> unique<00:01:31.400> targets<00:01:31.880> that<00:01:32.030> are<00:01:32.090> specific

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
really unique targets that are specific

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.200 
really unique targets that are specific
to<00:01:32.690> cancer<00:01:33.170> cells<00:01:33.430> were<00:01:34.430> able<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.820> develop

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
to cancer cells were able to develop

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.030 
to cancer cells were able to develop
novel<00:01:35.720> therapeutics<00:01:36.470> that<00:01:36.590> are<00:01:36.800> very

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
novel therapeutics that are very

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.760 
novel therapeutics that are very
specific<00:01:37.460> for<00:01:38.060> that<00:01:38.210> target<00:01:38.660> thereby<00:01:39.470> sparing

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
specific for that target thereby sparing

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.690 
specific for that target thereby sparing
the<00:01:40.430> normal<00:01:40.910> cells<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:41.900> really<00:01:42.700> improving

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
the normal cells and really improving

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.610 
the normal cells and really improving
the<00:01:43.820> therapeutic<00:01:44.330> ratio<00:01:44.720> so<00:01:45.080> we're<00:01:45.230> able<00:01:45.380> to

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
the therapeutic ratio so we're able to

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.920 
the therapeutic ratio so we're able to
specifically<00:01:46.550> hurt<00:01:46.940> the<00:01:47.120> cancer<00:01:47.480> cells<00:01:47.720> or

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
specifically hurt the cancer cells or

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.710 
specifically hurt the cancer cells or
hurt<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.290> lymphoma<00:01:48.590> cells<00:01:48.980> and<00:01:49.340> minimize<00:01:50.330> the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
hurt the lymphoma cells and minimize the

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.530 
hurt the lymphoma cells and minimize the
toxicity<00:01:51.350> of<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.530> treatment<00:01:51.980> I<00:01:52.450> think<00:01:53.450> the

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
toxicity of the treatment I think the

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.420 
toxicity of the treatment I think the
most<00:01:53.780> exciting<00:01:53.990> thing<00:01:54.470> right<00:01:54.680> now<00:01:54.710> is<00:01:55.100> the

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
most exciting thing right now is the

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.760 
most exciting thing right now is the
fact<00:01:55.580> that<00:01:55.790> through<00:01:56.180> molecular<00:01:57.020> biology

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
fact that through molecular biology

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.890 
fact that through molecular biology
we've<00:01:58.160> really<00:01:58.550> started<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:59.270> develop<00:01:59.630> an

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
we've really started to develop an

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.020 
we've really started to develop an
understanding<00:02:00.080> as<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.830> what<00:02:01.220> makes<00:02:01.550> each

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
understanding as to what makes each

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.560 
understanding as to what makes each
patient<00:02:02.870> different<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:04.430> clearly<00:02:05.270> there<00:02:05.540> are

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
patient different so clearly there are

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.810 
patient different so clearly there are
similarities<00:02:06.110> between<00:02:06.590> different<00:02:07.340> types<00:02:07.610> of

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
similarities between different types of

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.369 
similarities between different types of
patients<00:02:08.239> with<00:02:08.360> lymphoma<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:08.989> different

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
patients with lymphoma and different

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.320 
patients with lymphoma and different
lymphomas<00:02:09.800> that<00:02:09.920> every<00:02:10.220> patient<00:02:10.640> is<00:02:10.789> really

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
lymphomas that every patient is really

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.240 
lymphomas that every patient is really
an<00:02:11.569> individual

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
an individual

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.910 
an individual
and<00:02:12.460> we're<00:02:12.970> starting<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.590> recognize<00:02:14.590> those

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
and we're starting to recognize those

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.060 
and we're starting to recognize those
differences<00:02:16.440> ultimately<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.560> think<00:02:17.800> that

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
differences ultimately I think that

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.640 
differences ultimately I think that
we're<00:02:18.220> moving<00:02:18.370> closer<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.320> everybody's<00:02:20.320> goal

we're moving closer to everybody's goal

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.650 
we're moving closer to everybody's goal
and<00:02:20.920> that's<00:02:21.220> really<00:02:21.490> one<00:02:21.820> of<00:02:21.850> personalized

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
and that's really one of personalized

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.950 
and that's really one of personalized
