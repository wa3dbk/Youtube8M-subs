00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.260
 Trapil

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:32.250
 chicken fillet and chicken legs 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:36.239
 grilled upstream - on mylÃ¨ne there 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.590
 had a team that I did not have if you 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.920
 remember it was roast pork the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:52.129
 pizza area to 6 6 6 6 which had become 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:55.800
 the team gb x controlled by xavier 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:01:01.070
 it's so true I knew I can 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:07.439
 crazy I've actually run a blog 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:09.180
 with them to have 13 rather than 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:15.409
 keep 2 h collecting to make it a 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.670
 zone tap organ donation please 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:22.049
 and finally the little story 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.159
 had mounted wordpress with them but they 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.159
 have a little farted the sinkers 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.230
 both 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:37.020
 and they decided to delete everything 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:42.660
 that there was on wordpress or it's 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.770
 why we never knew shame 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.510
 that they stop world of letters their 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.210
 article is their show but of all the 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.700
 world 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.840
 I find it a pity especially that we 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.550
 was not that two teams what on it 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.750
 and but also for those who are 2016 there 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.840
 had been great to have seen that they were 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.200
 with us but I remember playing it 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.200

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.759
 I saw them in the week yeah 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.020
 but anyway it has stopped 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.550

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.080

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.320
