00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello people what is going on in part kd gaming 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.779
 and welcome to one 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.000
 eleven meter tutorial for fifa 12 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.710
 I'll show you the different types 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.599
 from penalty shooters like her 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.420
 work and you never do that 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.190
 Goal missed the examples now 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.140
 be in training mode when we go there 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.760
 wants to come push in the arena select 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.650
 and then you can do a standard 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.170
 train here now the elfmeter 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.119
 the good thing about this training mode is 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.789
 that we press 11 to 2 on 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.369
 the ps3 and lte on the xbox the 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.020
 this could be help 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.180
 very helpful and after doing this 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.950
 tutorial you should look up 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.890
 in any case, play around with it 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.210
 to get a feel for it myself 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.860
 So basically you shoot 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.110
 eleven meters of course with the press of the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.940
 shot button to be targeted with the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.530
 left stick 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.660
 it is very important the shift button then 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.280
 to press if the mark in the green 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.480
 area otherwise it will be quite 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.239
 hard to hit yet 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.460
 So always orientate in the green area 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.920
 on the subject of shooting strength I can only 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.270
 say that you are between 30 and 80 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.650
 percent should move 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.420
 but of course that is 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.189
 chance to meet if the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.890
 Goalkeeper the right corner again higher 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.510
 if the shot is stronger but 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.479
 never the shot in the red 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.220
 this area will not work that way 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.290
 There are four different types of 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.299
 eleven meters I show you now and 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.000
 as well as the trick you never do 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.100
 goal missed the first is the normal one 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.530
 eleven meters with a lot of power he is the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.329
 easiest and works so easy 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.850
 aim with the left stick and the 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.130
 bullet button press then we have the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.720
 cut eleven again with the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.119
 Aim at the left stick and around the ball 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.360
 keep cutting while holding r1 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.310
 and pressed on the xbox rb if you 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.470
 never want to miss those two types 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.689
 you should use this trick here 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.250
 after selecting the shot power 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.710
 you have to have a little moment 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.170
 wait before you should get such a 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.820
 Wait half an whole second and then 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.229
 but the left stick completely in the 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.850
 Press direction where you shoot 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.009
 want and also in this direction 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.259
 hold down until the ball hits the 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.640
 leave the player's foot then applies 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.710
 it is only to be hoped that the goalkeeper 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.330
 the other corner is wild yet another 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.280
 is the eleven meter with delay in the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.780
 of course, come back here, too 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.250
 aim at the left stick 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.350
 shoot with the shot button but around 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.580
 you have to carry out the delay 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.740
 after selecting the shot strength 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.590
 once again press the shot button 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.640
 and your player is delayed here it is 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.280
 just like the two 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.080
 previous eleven meters had but 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.459
 you have to wait and execute if 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.010
 you see that the player with the 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.780
 delay starts so shot button 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.640
 press to select shot strength 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.530
 then again the shift button to 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.900
 press delay and then if he does 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.430
 attaches to the delay only then the 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.040
 press the left stick in the direction and 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.540
 hold where you want to shoot and the 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.880
 last kind of eleven meters is the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.200
 the elfmeter lashed out to execute it 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.540
 of course you have to come back with that 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.470
 draw left stick and l1 during the 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.110
 keep shooting 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.200
 and if they play on the xbox hold 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.980
 LB during shooting 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.900
 unfortunately you can do this 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.030
 eleven-meter lupfer only in the middle 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.400
 Do something pretty much none 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.840
 effect so i would recommend that 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.620
 aim with the left stick all the way 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.930
 omit 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.340
 to never miss the goal 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.019
 you should fit the shot just 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.900
 just tap for a little while and 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.390
 that's it okay people that was mine 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.799
 eleven meter tutorial for you i hope so 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.019
 I liked you and thank you 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.040
 ever listen 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.750
 Of course, a portion of luck is part of it 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.370
 which corner of the goalkeeper because now 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.900
 chooses and soon believed maybe 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.299
 But go in when he has the corner 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.160
 otherwise you should do something with the 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.500
 practice targeted help in training mode 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.660
