 Tell me beauty, I'm a good guy. 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.189
 I'll talk about the game that's causing you 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:12.410
 discord in the Brazilian family kotale 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.410
 quota for the game of the capeta 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:21.119
 this game is very simple even 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.680
 because it only weighs 2.2 mega in the game you 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.080
 assumes the role of a little bird that 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.119
 seems to know how to fly but soon you discover 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.490
 which is not quite so that it flies 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.349
 just play repeatedly on the ground 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.480
 the goal is to go through these limitations 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.700
 of barrels of 'super mario' not included 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.660
 he more when you leave to 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.570
 back but certain you win the staff 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.930
 here of the infinite loop decided to give a 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.200
 Little play on that fla pi band cuts there by 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:57.350
 personal quota there perceenta playing 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.350
 the flipboard bullying 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:18.040
 I 'm going there the staff is the flipboard that 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.110
 seems very simple but in reality it is very 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.030
 difficult enough this year 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.360
 The game is available for iphone ipad 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.130
 ipod touch and android also alias maintains 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.940
 record here in the comments of the 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.509
 video is not worth lying to a kiss 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.880
 cheese curds little step time and home 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.460
 and now I'm going to have a serious talk 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.780
 with this little bird, perceive 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.960
 little bird there for me 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.960
 the content of everything good 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.360

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.090
 brought a game for you, call the band 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.240
 It's just play play and this I already came back from 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:03.670

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.670
 tighten what wins difficult game 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.500
