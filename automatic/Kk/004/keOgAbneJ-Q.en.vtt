they'll<00:00:30.750> lead<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.170> higher<00:00:31.410> cholesterol

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
they'll lead to higher cholesterol

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.010 
they'll lead to higher cholesterol
levels<00:00:32.489> that's<00:00:33.120> simply<00:00:33.480> not<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> case

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020
