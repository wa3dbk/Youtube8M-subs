00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.530
 white from youtube today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:08.140
 is potato bomb is an arctic food and 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.750
 And today I'm recording the 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.760
 possible videos let's eat something else 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.209
 potatoes so I really like this 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.590
 starts I want to teach so good 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.030
 let's see 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.520
 and so 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.340
 first we go 6000 potatoes and we're going to 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.070
 peel 1 kilo 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.070
 and then we're going to make them puree 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.610
 we have to wait for it to cool down and 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.610
 let's add salt 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:54.300
 and pepper the puree has to be fine 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:57.700
 crushed and without lumps so that our 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.060
 preparation that stops now we are going to 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.850
 pour the eggs if you go to 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.670
 use a kilo of potatoes are going to have 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.530
 that to throw 3 eggs with us we are 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.520
 using those kilo of potatoes we're going to 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.520
 cast 4 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.960
 ah 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.490
 now we incorporate the eggs with the 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.800
 purity 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.100
 with very clean hands 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.380
 now let's throw common flour 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.720
 until you achieve the consistency that 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.660
 we want 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.140
 this is how we are staying now 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.120
 we put to heat sunflower oil in 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.940
 a pan 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.670
 it has to be too much oil to 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.950
 the bombs are covered whole and 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.800
 this is a recipe that has a lot 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.020
 oils and that when you take it out do not worry 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.670
 we're going to drain it to the 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.420
 consistency that we have to stay in 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.420
 our mass 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:16.730
 it exists more or less so that it does not 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:21.970
 I hit you a lot in the hands 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.970
 we deserve the hand to do this 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.810
 ah 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.860
 we put some silver to put together the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.920
 little bombs 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.910
 we cut cream cheese cheese in 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.020
 squares 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.290
 about that size and we make a 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.290
 pellet 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:49.280
 we deserve our hands well 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.280
 we crush it 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.980
 and we put the squares ads and the 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.980
 we close 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:06.260
 and we make the shape of a little circle 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.260
 and we passed by there 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.760
 if you did not understand it goes again 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:24.829
 and assume we said our hands well 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.210
 we cut a piece of dough to the 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:30.380
 amount that we want 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.380
 we crush it 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:39.770
 we cut a piece of cuartirolo cheese 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.770
 and we leave it 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.980
 we make the little ball and pass through flour 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.450
 to know if the lady is hot 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.450
 let's put a wooden knife 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:04.510
 little bubbles because the oil is the 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.510
 catalinas 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.230
 Remember to cover the cheese well with 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.960
 mass so that when you are in our 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.960
 very hot pan do not burn the cheese 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.949
 it does not stand out that's how they have us 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.730
 what to do 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:34.460
 they can do what they want and medium 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:35.479
 for why because they are if they are very 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.729
 big 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.090
 oil sometimes not achieved 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.699
 completely 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.180
 let's put one of the balls in the 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.180
 oil 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:51.860
 you can put 5 to 4 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.860
 depends on the size you make 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.830
 they only fix until when 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.480
 scream and when golden brown down the 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.510
 go round 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.600
 when they see that the sides are already 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:11.230
 doraditos have to go setting follow 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.160
 going around to see if they are already the 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.200
 do not 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.500
 when you find them with a fork or 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:21.390
 Do not pinch them because if not the 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.390
 cheese is based there and it's going to burn 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.050
 Now let's see when and turns 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.050
 they are already there 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.130
 some the same afternoon so do not 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.130
 let's go around 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:45.590
 in a shallow dish we are going to place two 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:48.050
 napkins or absorbent paper 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.380
 when it is golden on both sides 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.770
 let's take them out to try to drain the 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:58.180
 oil and run on the plate with the paper 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.180
 absorbent make light 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:05.349
 and that's how you have to stay 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:18.330
 they have a lot of weight 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:21.960
 ideal is very good riches I leave 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:24.750
 that they can be recommended good in 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.620
 this was all I loved they are 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.620
 very rich 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:39.240
 as much simpler squares 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.949
