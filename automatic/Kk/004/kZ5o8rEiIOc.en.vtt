00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.320
 the state school gets rodrigues 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.720
 It's a school where I pick up a thousand and 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.119
 hundred children 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.230
 she is in the region of brazilÃ¢ndia in 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.210
 village hairstyle 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.570
 the differential of the school that we follow 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.660
 the program read and write and the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.880
 teachers work with the soul in 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.510
 of the program they will develop the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.730
 projects is not always focused on reading and 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.860
 in writing because we believe that 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.230
 when the child can read and write it 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.940
 able to develop any 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:50.129
 business since the year 2013 we 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.210
 we have the support teacher in the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.890
 classroom 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.980
 this was one of the secretary's policies 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.020
 education we wear this shirt 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.879
 and the result was very beneficial 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.680
 we perceive the progress of the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.750
 children in these rooms with the teacher of 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.939
 support that had difficulty and really 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.939
 they passed our expectations 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.189
 we have the intensive recovery that is 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.939
 another recovery this is a class 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.400
 where are you with few children where this 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.040
 teacher and works he uses other 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.020
 then practices his practice to follow 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.280
 the content of the education department is 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.080
 very playful 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.450
 he is developing many things in the 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.220
 concrete and is doing with children who 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.210
 with the non- learning deficit 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.210
 can advance 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.970
 our relationship here is a great 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.810
 family is really the big family mine 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.180
 teachers 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.160
 they have many years leave rodrigues 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.990
 for them here is a continuation of the 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.420
 their house they work very hard 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.970
 dedication and this is something that makes a 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.620
 very large differential in the results 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.410
 I work at the little school. 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.810
 rodrigues for about eight years. 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.460
 work group work makes 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.920
 much difference 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.130
 We are friends and this influences a lot. 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.080
 in our work with students if today 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.000
 my children were little they expect 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.070
 here and the teachers know 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.840
 recognition that time without a teacher 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.760
 there is no profession 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.050
 and here our teachers have this 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.050
 clarity what is the importance
