00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
like so I was playing with those I was

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.330 
like so I was playing with those I was
doing<00:01:32.640> pretty<00:01:32.820> good<00:01:33.740> enjoying<00:01:34.740> myself<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
doing pretty good enjoying myself and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.280 
doing pretty good enjoying myself and
then<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.270> thought<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.750> know<00:01:36.780> what<00:01:36.990> I'm<00:01:37.170> gonna

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
then I thought you know what I'm gonna

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.990 
then I thought you know what I'm gonna
try<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.560> get<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.770> little<00:01:37.920> bit<00:01:38.070> better<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.820> did

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
try to get a little bit better and I did

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.420 
try to get a little bit better and I did
little<00:01:39.270> research<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.380> came<00:01:40.590> upon<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.100> next

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
little research and I came upon the next

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.399 
little research and I came upon the next
thing<00:01:41.640> which<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.509> white<00:01:42.930> controller

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
thing which is the white controller

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.649 
thing which is the white controller
that's<00:01:43.649> on<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.159> middle<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.640> left<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.210> I

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
that's on the middle in the left and I

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.090 
that's on the middle in the left and I
came<00:01:45.720> across<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.229> piece<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.500> equipment<00:01:47.070> that's

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
came across a piece of equipment that's

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.760 
came across a piece of equipment that's
called<00:01:47.460> mod<00:01:47.700> stick<00:01:48.090> pros<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.869> what<00:01:49.590> these<00:01:49.710> are

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
called mod stick pros and what these are

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.319 
called mod stick pros and what these are
are<00:01:50.180> basically<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.540> different<00:01:52.380> type<00:01:52.799> of

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
are basically a different type of

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.160 
are basically a different type of
control<00:01:54.329> freak<00:01:55.909> enhancer<00:01:56.909> it's<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.810> solid

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
control freak enhancer it's a solid

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.980 
control freak enhancer it's a solid
piece<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.380> aluminum<00:01:59.340> that's<00:01:59.610> milled<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.750> you

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
piece of aluminum that's milled that you

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.100 
piece of aluminum that's milled that you
go<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.409> do<00:02:01.710> yourself<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.820> put<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.659> on<00:02:03.869> to

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
a nice piece of equipment I enjoyed it I

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.930 
a nice piece of equipment I enjoyed it I
played<00:02:30.590> with<00:02:30.709> it<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.040> nice<00:02:31.220> thing<00:02:31.430> is<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.760> has

played with it the nice thing is it has
three<00:02:32.390> different<00:02:32.540> sets<00:02:33.310> so<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.370> can<00:02:34.610> have

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
three different sets so you can have

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.430 
three different sets so you can have
them<00:02:34.940> very<00:02:35.150> low<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.840> can<00:02:35.990> have<00:02:36.110> them<00:02:36.260> in<00:02:36.350> the

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
them very low you can have them in the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.050 
them very low you can have them in the
middle<00:02:36.680> or<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:37.010> can<00:02:37.130> have<00:02:37.250> very<00:02:37.610> high<00:02:37.670> which

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
middle or you can have very high which

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.180 
middle or you can have very high which
they<00:02:38.480> say<00:02:38.720> will<00:02:38.900> increase<00:02:39.290> your<00:02:39.470> accuracy<00:02:39.770> I

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
they say will increase your accuracy I

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.400 
they say will increase your accuracy I
noticed<00:02:40.910> that<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.120> can<00:02:41.180> move<00:02:41.480> much<00:02:41.810> faster<00:02:42.050> and

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
noticed that I can move much faster and

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.790 
noticed that I can move much faster and
that<00:02:42.500> allowed<00:02:42.709> me<00:02:42.740> to<00:02:43.600> increase<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:45.440> amount

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
that allowed me to increase the amount

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.280 
that allowed me to increase the amount
of<00:02:46.120> movement<00:02:47.120> that<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.480> would<00:02:47.690> have<00:02:47.870> in<00:02:48.050> the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
of movement that I would have in the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.160 
of movement that I would have in the
precision<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.910> next<00:02:50.209> thing<00:02:50.360> that<00:02:50.390> I<00:02:50.540> did

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
precision the next thing that I did

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.229 
precision the next thing that I did
which<00:02:51.650> was<00:02:51.860> probably<00:02:52.100> quite<00:02:52.580> stupid<00:02:53.000> on<00:02:53.090> my

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
which was probably quite stupid on my

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.360 
which was probably quite stupid on my
part<00:02:53.270> I<00:02:53.630> decided<00:02:54.050> I<00:02:54.260> wanted<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.680> try<00:02:54.920> out<00:02:54.950> a

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
so the next piece of equipment that I

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.770 
so the next piece of equipment that I
bought<00:03:31.430> is<00:03:31.610> on<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.880> bottom<00:03:32.239> right<00:03:32.269> hand<00:03:32.600> side

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
bought is on the bottom right hand side

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.440 
bought is on the bottom right hand side
and<00:03:33.290> that<00:03:33.830> is<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.010> Viking<00:03:34.880> modded<00:03:35.330> controller

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
and that is a Viking modded controller

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.770 
and that is a Viking modded controller
and<00:03:36.200> it<00:03:37.010> is<00:03:37.310> a<00:03:37.340> Viking<00:03:38.650> macro<00:03:39.650> controller

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
and it is a Viking macro controller

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.350 
and it is a Viking macro controller
Viking<00:03:41.780> no<00:03:42.079> longer<00:03:42.440> makes<00:03:42.709> this<00:03:43.010> controller<00:03:43.489> I

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
Viking no longer makes this controller I

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.150 
Viking no longer makes this controller I
believe<00:03:44.840> they<00:03:45.019> may<00:03:45.200> still<00:03:45.560> have<00:03:45.739> some<00:03:45.769> in

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
believe they may still have some in

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.330 
believe they may still have some in
stock<00:03:46.190> but<00:03:46.700> they're<00:03:46.910> super<00:03:47.239> expensive<00:03:48.010> it<00:03:49.010> is

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
stock but they're super expensive it is

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.160 
stock but they're super expensive it is

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
a little computer savvy to do that but

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.330 
a little computer savvy to do that but
overall<00:04:42.810> excellent<00:04:43.500> piece<00:04:43.680> of<00:04:43.860> equipment

would<00:04:44.729> never<00:04:44.940> badmouth<00:04:45.240> Viking

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
would never badmouth Viking

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.140 
would never badmouth Viking
I<00:04:46.169> enjoyed<00:04:46.889> using<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.370> controller<00:04:47.790> while<00:04:48.120> I

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
I enjoyed using the controller while I

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.230 
I enjoyed using the controller while I
well<00:04:48.720> I<00:04:48.750> had<00:04:49.050> it<00:04:49.199> but<00:04:49.949> as<00:04:50.160> I<00:04:50.520> continued<00:04:51.000> to<00:04:51.030> play

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
well I had it but as I continued to play

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.000 
well I had it but as I continued to play
and<00:04:51.600> I<00:04:51.660> was<00:04:51.750> going<00:04:51.990> through<00:04:52.050> black<00:04:52.500> ops<00:04:52.800> and

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
and I was going through black ops and

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.920 
and I was going through black ops and
mw3<00:04:53.490> was<00:04:53.850> getting<00:04:54.060> ready<00:04:54.210> to<00:04:54.360> come<00:04:54.540> out<00:04:54.570> I

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
mw3 was getting ready to come out I

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.260 
mw3 was getting ready to come out I
learned<00:04:55.620> about<00:04:55.740> the<00:04:56.039> scuf<00:04:56.310> controller<00:04:56.340> so<00:04:57.240> I

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
learned about the scuf controller so I

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.270 
learned about the scuf controller so I
decided<00:04:57.690> that<00:04:57.840> I<00:04:57.990> would<00:04:58.380> take<00:04:58.560> that<00:04:58.770> next<00:04:59.039> step

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
decided that I would take that next step

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.330 
decided that I would take that next step
and<00:04:59.340> try<00:04:59.639> the<00:05:00.210> scuf<00:05:00.510> controller<00:05:00.539> out

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
and try the scuf controller out

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.850 
and try the scuf controller out
obviously<00:05:02.340> it's<00:05:02.580> approved<00:05:02.940> by<00:05:03.030> MLG<00:05:03.840> and<00:05:04.260> the<00:05:04.830> e

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
obviously it's approved by MLG and the e

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.750 
obviously it's approved by MLG and the e
GL<00:05:05.479> so<00:05:06.560> it's<00:05:07.560> not<00:05:07.800> considered<00:05:08.340> a<00:05:08.430> modded

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
GL so it's not considered a modded

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.670 
GL so it's not considered a modded
controller<00:05:08.850> so<00:05:09.570> I<00:05:09.810> bought<00:05:10.050> the<00:05:10.199> black<00:05:10.440> one

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
controller so I bought the black one

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.659 
controller so I bought the black one
that's<00:05:10.889> sitting<00:05:11.310> there<00:05:11.370> in<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.639> middle

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
number five and I did an unboxing and I

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.629 
number five and I did an unboxing and I
did<00:05:15.030> a<00:05:15.060> review<00:05:15.419> of<00:05:15.600> it<00:05:16.100> both<00:05:17.100> of<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.370> sticks

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639

there<00:05:39.900> are<00:05:40.020> a<00:05:40.050> couple<00:05:40.139> things<00:05:40.680> that<00:05:40.770> I<00:05:40.919> said<00:05:41.160> I

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
there are a couple things that I said I

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.890 
there are a couple things that I said I
would<00:05:41.400> do<00:05:41.669> differently<00:05:42.090> if<00:05:42.300> I<00:05:42.419> was<00:05:42.630> to<00:05:42.780> buy

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
would do differently if I was to buy

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.580 
would do differently if I was to buy
another<00:05:43.169> one

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
another one

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.150

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
buttons are set up the same way but what

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.200 
buttons are set up the same way but what
I<00:06:00.570> did<00:06:00.780> is<00:06:00.810> is<00:06:01.169> I<00:06:01.289> have<00:06:01.320> a<00:06:01.470> concave<00:06:02.000> stick<00:06:03.000> on

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
I did is is I have a concave stick on

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.390 
I did is is I have a concave stick on
the<00:06:03.389> right<00:06:03.630> thumb<00:06:03.930> and<00:06:04.169> on<00:06:04.710> the<00:06:04.889> left<00:06:05.130> thumb

the right thumb and on the left thumb
it's<00:06:05.639> convex<00:06:06.300> so<00:06:07.229> the<00:06:07.560> one<00:06:07.710> on<00:06:07.740> the<00:06:07.949> right<00:06:08.160> is

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
it's convex so the one on the right is

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.100 
it's convex so the one on the right is
round<00:06:08.699> and<00:06:08.970> the<00:06:09.030> one<00:06:09.180> on<00:06:09.210> the<00:06:09.419> left<00:06:09.630> is<00:06:09.750> scooped

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
one from scuff it does everything but

with the added grip control on the back
I<00:06:46.530> find<00:06:46.830> when<00:06:47.010> I<00:06:47.040> have<00:06:47.310> my<00:06:47.490> two<00:06:47.550> or<00:06:47.910> three<00:06:48.120> hour

I find when I have my two or three hour
ami<00:06:48.570> sessions<00:06:49.140> it<00:06:49.410> doesn't<00:06:49.830> slip<00:06:50.070> at<00:06:50.250> all<00:06:50.430> it's

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180

ami sessions it doesn't slip at all it's
solidly<00:06:51.780> made<00:06:52.140> I<00:06:52.470> really<00:06:53.280> enjoy<00:06:53.520> the<00:06:53.670> fact

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:53.700 
solidly made I really enjoy the fact

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.240 
solidly made I really enjoy the fact
that<00:06:54.060> I<00:06:54.150> have<00:06:54.360> the<00:06:54.480> concave<00:06:54.960> button<00:06:55.380> on<00:06:55.500> the

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250 
that I have the concave button on the

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.420 
that I have the concave button on the
left<00:06:57.000> stick<00:06:57.600> because<00:06:58.140> it<00:06:58.290> tends<00:06:58.860> to<00:06:58.980> help<00:06:59.220> more

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
left stick because it tends to help more

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.830 
left stick because it tends to help more
it<00:06:59.580> just<00:06:59.790> seems<00:07:00.000> to<00:07:00.210> work<00:07:00.390> a<00:07:00.510> little<00:07:00.630> bit

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 
it just seems to work a little bit

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.110 
it just seems to work a little bit
better<00:07:01.070> so<00:07:02.070> I<00:07:02.100> thought<00:07:02.400> what<00:07:02.580> I<00:07:02.610> would<00:07:02.790> do<00:07:02.940> is

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 
better so I thought what I would do is

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.420 
better so I thought what I would do is
just<00:07:03.300> show<00:07:03.630> you<00:07:03.690> what<00:07:04.320> my<00:07:04.500> journey<00:07:04.560> has<00:07:05.160> been
