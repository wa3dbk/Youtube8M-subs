00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
the biggest part of the game was that we

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.190 
the biggest part of the game was that we
were<00:00:05.009> not<00:00:05.130> very<00:00:05.400> sharp<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.970> say<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.270> least<00:00:06.299> I

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
were not very sharp to say the least I

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.360 
were not very sharp to say the least I
probably<00:00:07.980> gave<00:00:08.250> him<00:00:08.400> too<00:00:08.580> much<00:00:08.610> time<00:00:09.059> at

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
probably gave him too much time at

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.400 
probably gave him too much time at
Christmas<00:00:11.370> we<00:00:11.550> played<00:00:12.049> Saturday<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.170> let<00:00:13.320> him

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.250 
go and didn't bring him back until seven
o'clock<00:00:15.210> last<00:00:15.630> night<00:00:17.330> we<00:00:18.330> were<00:00:18.449> not<00:00:18.630> sharp<00:00:18.990> to

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
o'clock last night we were not sharp to

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.620 
o'clock last night we were not sharp to
say<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.560> least<00:00:19.590> but<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:21.180> was<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.330> huge

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
say the least but and that was a huge

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.660 
say the least but and that was a huge
part<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.050> game<00:00:22.260> but<00:00:22.980> at<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.100> same<00:00:23.400> time<00:00:23.609> I

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
part of the game but at the same time I

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.700 
part of the game but at the same time I
didn't<00:00:23.970> think<00:00:24.060> we<00:00:24.240> had<00:00:24.470> excuse<00:00:25.470> me<00:00:25.590> the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
didn't think we had excuse me the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.670 
didn't think we had excuse me the
intensity<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:27.080> concentration<00:00:28.080> level<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.529> we

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
intensity in concentration level that we

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.679 
intensity in concentration level that we
needed<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.039> have<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.580> when<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.269> added<00:00:30.420> both

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
needed to have and when you added both

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.240 
needed to have and when you added both
of<00:00:30.869> those<00:00:30.990> together<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.470> think<00:00:31.560> we're<00:00:32.219> very

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
of those together I think we're very

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.049 
of those together I think we're very
sharp<00:00:32.790> makes<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.809> miss<00:00:33.960> easy<00:00:34.200> shots<00:00:34.559> or<00:00:35.059> throw

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
sharp makes you miss easy shots or throw

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.450 
sharp makes you miss easy shots or throw
the<00:00:36.180> ball<00:00:36.530> who<00:00:37.530> knows<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.890> mean<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.070> couple<00:00:38.280> of

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
the ball who knows I mean a couple of

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.819 
the ball who knows I mean a couple of
times<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:38.850> were<00:00:38.969> passing<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.899> each<00:00:40.559> other

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
times we were passing it to each other

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:41.990 
times we were passing it to each other
instead<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.280> shooting<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.760> all<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.969> sudden

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
instead of shooting and all of a sudden

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.930 
instead of shooting and all of a sudden
it<00:00:42.270> goes<00:00:42.360> out<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.600> bounds<00:00:42.840> but<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:44.070> was<00:00:44.760> not

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
it goes out of bounds but I was not

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.940 
it goes out of bounds but I was not
pleased<00:00:45.239> defensively<00:00:45.930> or<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.800> back

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
pleased defensively or on the back

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.610 
pleased defensively or on the back
boards<00:00:47.340> or<00:00:47.489> being<00:00:47.820> attacking<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.420> basket<00:00:48.620> we

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
boards or being attacking the basket we

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.260 
boards or being attacking the basket we
had<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> tremendous<00:00:50.309> size<00:00:50.489> advantage<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.149> one

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
had a tremendous size advantage of one

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.729 
had a tremendous size advantage of one
of<00:00:51.360> our<00:00:51.480> goals<00:00:51.629> was<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.050> attack<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.590> basket

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
of our goals was to attack the basket

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.600 
of our goals was to attack the basket
and<00:00:53.750> we<00:00:54.750> didn't<00:00:54.960> get<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> single<00:00:55.350> low<00:00:56.010> post<00:00:56.309> up

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
and we didn't get a single low post up

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.160 
and we didn't get a single low post up
or<00:00:56.820> taking<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.120> ball<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.329> basket<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.960> entire

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
or taking the ball the basket the entire

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.950 
or taking the ball the basket the entire
first<00:00:58.410> half<00:00:58.820> so<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.850> was<00:01:00.030> pretty<00:01:00.149> frustrated<00:01:00.840> at

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
first half so I was pretty frustrated at

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.319 
first half so I was pretty frustrated at
that<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.350> put<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.219> those<00:01:02.340> five<00:01:02.609> guys<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.090> start

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
that and put in those five guys to start

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.700 
that and put in those five guys to start
to<00:01:03.480> second<00:01:03.840> half<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.229> thought<00:01:04.379> they<00:01:04.559> gave

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
to second half and I thought they gave

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.450 
to second half and I thought they gave
us<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> tremendous<00:01:05.159> lift<00:01:05.659> defensively<00:01:07.460> did

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
us a tremendous lift defensively did

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.130 
us a tremendous lift defensively did

your<00:02:20.680> lack<00:02:20.950> of<00:02:20.980> maturity<00:02:21.219> now<00:02:21.609> means<00:02:21.849> that<00:02:22.000> we

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
your lack of maturity now means that we

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.429 
your lack of maturity now means that we
can't<00:02:22.299> get<00:02:22.450> there<00:02:22.629> eventually<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:23.290> hope

defensive azlea as I said they guarded I

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.080 
defensive azlea as I said they guarded I
mean<00:04:08.799> it<00:04:08.919> was<00:04:09.009> 50<00:04:09.280> when<00:04:09.459> they<00:04:09.790> were<00:04:09.909> in<00:04:10.000> the

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
mean it was 50 when they were in the

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.640 
mean it was 50 when they were in the
game<00:04:10.269> he<00:04:10.540> didn't<00:04:10.780> jump<00:04:10.989> up<00:04:11.169> in<00:04:11.259> the<00:04:11.290> air<00:04:11.349> they

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
game he didn't jump up in the air they

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.710 
game he didn't jump up in the air they
didn't<00:04:11.889> try<00:04:12.009> to<00:04:12.069> steal<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.549> ball<00:04:12.699> they<00:04:13.659> were

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
didn't try to steal the ball they were

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.680 
didn't try to steal the ball they were
very<00:04:13.989> sound<00:04:14.349> fundamentally<00:04:15.239> Marcus<00:04:16.239> missed<00:04:16.509> a

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
very sound fundamentally Marcus missed a

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.110 
very sound fundamentally Marcus missed a
pretty<00:04:17.530> easy<00:04:17.769> shot<00:04:17.889> that<00:04:18.700> if<00:04:18.820> it<00:04:18.940> had<00:04:19.060> gone<00:04:19.090> in

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
pretty easy shot that if it had gone in

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.430 
pretty easy shot that if it had gone in
you<00:04:20.180> know<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.419> crowd<00:04:20.750> would<00:04:20.989> probably<00:04:21.290> gone

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
you know the crowd would probably gone

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.950 
you know the crowd would probably gone
crazy<00:04:21.709> during<00:04:22.070> that<00:04:22.220> time<00:04:22.430> period<00:04:22.460> but<00:04:22.970> again

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
crazy during that time period but again

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.810 
crazy during that time period but again
it<00:04:24.080> was<00:04:24.199> that<00:04:24.380> they<00:04:24.530> guarded<00:04:24.949> people<00:04:25.280> and<00:04:25.639> that

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
it was that they guarded people and that

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.430 
it was that they guarded people and that
was<00:04:25.970> something<00:04:26.180> that<00:04:26.330> we<00:04:26.540> needed<00:04:26.840> right<00:04:27.020> then

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
was something that we needed right then

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.909 
was something that we needed right then
and<00:04:28.180> I<00:04:29.180> think<00:04:29.900> des<00:04:30.110> may<00:04:30.350> have<00:04:30.470> gotten<00:04:30.650> one

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
and I think des may have gotten one

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.379 
and I think des may have gotten one
block<00:04:31.160> shot<00:04:31.460> down<00:04:31.729> there<00:04:32.000> we<00:04:32.120> got<00:04:32.270> an

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
block shot down there we got an

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.360 
block shot down there we got an
offensive<00:04:32.900> rebound<00:04:33.080> so<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:33.919> little<00:04:34.160> things

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
offensive rebound so the little things

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.620 
offensive rebound so the little things
that<00:04:34.460> I<00:04:34.610> didn't<00:04:34.820> think<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.090> first<00:04:35.120> group<00:04:35.479> were

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
that I didn't think the first group were

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.290 
that I didn't think the first group were
doing<00:04:35.900> my<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:37.130> plug<00:04:37.370> were<00:04:37.520> Hubert<00:04:38.060> say<00:04:38.180> the

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
doing my the plug were Hubert say the

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.879 
doing my the plug were Hubert say the
ball<00:04:38.479> and<00:04:38.930> got<00:04:39.110> it<00:04:39.229> right<00:04:39.380> back<00:04:39.410> to<00:04:39.740> him<00:04:39.830> for

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
ball and got it right back to him for

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.890 
ball and got it right back to him for
that<00:04:40.160> slam<00:04:40.460> dunk<00:04:40.729> and<00:04:40.910> also<00:04:41.270> drove<00:04:41.449> my<00:04:41.570> 10<00:04:41.780> and

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
that slam dunk and also drove my 10 and

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.510 
that slam dunk and also drove my 10 and
they<00:04:41.960> call<00:04:42.139> timeout<00:04:42.440> how<00:04:42.800> much<00:04:42.979> energy<00:04:43.220> did
