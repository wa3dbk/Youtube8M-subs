will<00:00:39.010> be<00:00:39.129> made<00:00:39.309> into<00:00:39.610> a<00:00:39.640> legendary<00:00:40.090> Sparrow

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
will be made into a legendary Sparrow

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.300 
will be made into a legendary Sparrow
and<00:00:40.720> its<00:00:40.810> durability<00:00:41.200> and<00:00:41.470> speed<00:00:42.040> will<00:00:42.190> be

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
and its durability and speed will be

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.640 
and its durability and speed will be
increased<00:00:42.670> by<00:00:42.880> 10%<00:00:43.180> I<00:00:43.810> was<00:00:44.200> kind<00:00:44.410> of<00:00:44.500> hoping

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
increased by 10% I was kind of hoping

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.170 
increased by 10% I was kind of hoping
the<00:00:44.890> speed<00:00:45.160> would<00:00:45.340> go<00:00:45.490> to<00:00:45.550> a<00:00:45.700> hundred<00:00:46.060> percent

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
the speed would go to a hundred percent

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.819 
the speed would go to a hundred percent
so<00:00:46.570> I'm<00:00:46.630> not<00:00:46.750> really<00:00:46.960> sure<00:00:47.050> how<00:00:47.440> your<00:00:47.590> Menem

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
so I'm not really sure how your Menem

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:48.900 
so I'm not really sure how your Menem
acts<00:00:47.980> that<00:00:48.160> out<00:00:48.310> maybe<00:00:48.579> there'll<00:00:48.850> be

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
acts that out maybe there'll be

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.120 
acts that out maybe there'll be
something<00:00:49.150> in<00:00:49.300> DLC<00:00:49.810> I'm<00:00:49.990> not<00:00:50.110> really<00:00:50.290> sure<00:00:50.590> so

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
something in DLC I'm not really sure so

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.130 
something in DLC I'm not really sure so
this<00:00:51.310> is<00:00:51.460> a<00:00:51.520> comparison<00:00:51.850> between<00:00:52.120> my<00:00:52.540> upgraded

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
this is a comparison between my upgraded

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.410 
this is a comparison between my upgraded
legendary<00:00:53.739> Phoenix<00:00:54.220> and<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:54.579> stock<00:00:54.880> Phoenix

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
legendary Phoenix and the stock Phoenix

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.910 
legendary Phoenix and the stock Phoenix
and<00:00:55.570> you<00:00:55.630> can<00:00:55.780> see<00:00:55.930> there's<00:00:56.170> a<00:00:56.230> 10%<00:00:56.470> difference

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
and you can see there's a 10% difference

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.950 
and you can see there's a 10% difference
in<00:00:57.310> both<00:00:57.550> stats<00:00:57.970> and<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.510> difference<00:00:58.810> is

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
in both stats and the difference is

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.900 
in both stats and the difference is
noticeable<00:00:59.590> is<00:00:59.710> definitely<00:01:00.070> a<00:01:00.100> lot<00:01:00.310> faster

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
noticeable is definitely a lot faster

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.490 
noticeable is definitely a lot faster
and<00:01:00.940> obviously<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.690> green<00:01:01.899> fumes<00:01:02.230> look

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
and obviously the green fumes look

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.049 
and obviously the green fumes look
really<00:01:02.800> cool<00:01:02.980> I'm<00:01:03.430> sure<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.760> other<00:01:03.910> ones

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
really cool I'm sure the other ones

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.580 
really cool I'm sure the other ones
would<00:01:04.180> look<00:01:04.329> good<00:01:04.509> as<00:01:04.720> well<00:01:04.899> so<00:01:05.140> if<00:01:05.199> you<00:01:05.290> do<00:01:05.439> get

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
would look good as well so if you do get

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.020 
would look good as well so if you do get
any<00:01:05.649> of<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:05.950> other<00:01:05.979> drives<00:01:06.399> definitely<00:01:06.880> let

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
any of the other drives definitely let

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.880 
any of the other drives definitely let

upgraded<00:01:26.170> sparrows<00:01:26.679> I<00:01:26.920> guess<00:01:27.369> you<00:01:27.520> guys<00:01:27.670> are

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.249 
upgraded sparrows I guess you guys are
wondering<00:01:28.209> if<00:01:28.389> it's<00:01:28.569> really<00:01:28.600> worth<00:01:28.929> spending

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
wondering if it's really worth spending

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.080 
wondering if it's really worth spending
that<00:01:29.590> amount<00:01:29.619> of<00:01:29.979> strange<00:01:30.249> coins<00:01:30.579> on<00:01:30.909> an
