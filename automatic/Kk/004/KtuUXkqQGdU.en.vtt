into four parts you can see just a

00:01:52.230 --> 00:02:02.030 
into four parts you can see just a
little<00:01:53.190> click<00:01:53.430> bit<00:01:54.860> clips<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:57.650> it<00:02:00.800> because<00:02:01.800> you

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
little click bit clips on it because you

little click bit clips on it because you
are<00:02:02.220> a<00:02:02.250> snap<00:02:02.700> off<00:02:03.740> that<00:02:04.740> one<00:02:06.350> yes<00:02:07.350> not<00:02:08.130> obvious

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
are a snap off that one yes not obvious

on<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:08.850> one<00:02:09.060> my<00:02:09.930> friend<00:02:10.200> let's<00:02:10.649> get<00:02:10.800> off<00:02:10.950> on

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
on this one my friend let's get off on

yes bit okay quickly reassemble it so
you<00:02:17.280> can<00:02:17.430> see<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.640> difference<00:02:17.880> between<00:02:17.970> an

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
you can see the difference between an

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:41.900 
you can see the difference between an
ordinary<00:02:18.600> md

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:03:00.530 

I<00:02:57.200> have<00:02:58.200> roughly<00:02:58.770> resembled<00:02:59.520> again<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.300> now<00:03:00.480> I

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
I have roughly resembled again and now I

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.590 
I have roughly resembled again and now I
have<00:03:01.340> another<00:03:02.340> UMD<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.830> can<00:03:05.040> see

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
have another UMD and you can see

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.490 
have another UMD and you can see
different<00:03:07.220> when<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.310> part<00:03:08.610> here<00:03:09.260> is<00:03:10.260> going<00:03:10.410> to

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
different when the part here is going to

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:20.870 
different when the part here is going to
snap<00:03:10.710> top<00:03:11.540> part<00:03:12.590> there<00:03:14.990> hasn't<00:03:19.730> before<00:03:20.730> up

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880
