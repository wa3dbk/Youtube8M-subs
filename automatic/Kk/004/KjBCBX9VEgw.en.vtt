00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.660
 hi guys how are you this is a tutor 

00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:08.860
 to learn how to assemble the 2 x 2 with 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.750
 method of ortega 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.510
 It's very easy but I've seen many 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.449
 tutorials is to say as they focus 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.700
 more in putting together what in explaining it 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:20.740
 then this is a video dedicated to a 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.610
 friend Robert I told him I was going to 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:28.360
 to help him make good the 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:32.730
 joke of the ortega method is to say 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.480
 something solve it in three steps first 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.450
 we make 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.230
 to say something the face of the first 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.230
 face down 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.100
 A) Yes 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.970
 then we see what case we have and with a 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.970
 only algorithm 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.030
 also face up and good in this 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.420
 case I'm staying but there are two cases 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.910
 to finish it well I'm also going to 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.350
 give some tips to be able to put together the most 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:10.390
 fast the first side ok we go first 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.390
 in the first step that is the first face 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:18.740
 ok can you put together intuitively so 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.480
 see for example is between here 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.740
 and this one comes in here 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.010
 but for example if you can put them 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.010
 messy and 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.820
 well messy goals and without any 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.800
 block is made 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.229
 from here none of the colors are 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.800
 together but the whole face down is already 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:51.930
 they grab it wherever they want and they do r2 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:54.300
 efe 2 r2 and be tree 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.430
 so if you give them in the competition 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.310
 now messy and they see that no 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.650
 block is made he puts it in one and they do 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:07.720
 is and is already armed although now when 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:11.070
 a block is formed 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.070
 but that is above 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.100
 for example 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.110
 A) Yes 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.940
 if you have to look for towns and we have here 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.470
 nothing more a block 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.970
 and here not and above also if we do not have 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:39.680
 put the block up 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:42.730
 well and do the 1st 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.730
 efe 2 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.420
 and repress 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.450
 1st bonus and arms 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.790
 but you have to be looking up 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.239
 and now when you have a block up and 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.360
 one below the same color or different 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.360
 for example 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.080
 so here we have one 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.950
 and then correcting to put it 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.750
 Well here you have one and here you have 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.230
 other 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.280
 that's how r2 will be 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.180
 or two 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.180
 r2 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:36.299
 they will be r 2 or r2 soccer 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:45.010
 let's turn to take out 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:48.129
 r 2 or r2 and they are also assembled these are 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.420
 three steps to assemble the face from below 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.310
 very fast 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.950
 I feel it but because it makes me 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.939
 much faster and easier to make it 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:01.060
 intitula good this is the first of the 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:03.719
 face down first face and we will continue 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.719
 with the one that follows
