00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.780 
that because I've never never done that
on<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.540> pc<00:01:48.869> version<00:01:48.899> but<00:01:49.439> if<00:01:49.770> courts<00:01:50.610> are<00:01:50.700> in

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
on the pc version but if courts are in

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.399 
on the pc version but if courts are in
the<00:01:50.880> game<00:01:51.060> there's<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.360> likelihood<00:01:51.930> that

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
the game there's a likelihood that

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.380 
the game there's a likelihood that
courts<00:01:53.070> blocks<00:01:53.430> could<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> game

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
courts blocks could be in the game

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.209 
courts blocks could be in the game
because<00:01:54.780> they're<00:01:54.960> just<00:01:55.170> one<00:01:55.439> plain<00:01:55.799> white

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
because they're just one plain white

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.819 
because they're just one plain white
block<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:57.630> pc<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.229> change<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.710> into

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
block and on pc you can change it into

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.980 
block and on pc you can change it into
pillars<00:01:59.340> or<00:01:59.700> something<00:02:00.000> like<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.750> looks

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
pillars or something like that it looks

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.660 
pillars or something like that it looks
pretty<00:02:01.290> cool<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.829> be<00:02:02.009> another<00:02:02.369> block

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
pretty cool so to be another block

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.319 
pretty cool so to be another block
addition<00:02:03.119> if<00:02:03.240> that's<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.719> case<00:02:03.930> we<00:02:04.890> have<00:02:05.329> we

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
addition if that's the case we have we

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.169 
addition if that's the case we have we
have<00:02:06.450> emeralds<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.229> coming<00:02:08.009> into<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.640> tu<00:02:08.940> of

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
have emeralds of coming into the tu of

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.809 
have emeralds of coming into the tu of
14<00:02:09.629> update<00:02:09.959> which<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.349> really<00:02:10.800> awesome<00:02:10.920> so

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
14 update which is really awesome so

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.949 
14 update which is really awesome so
there's<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.239> murrells<00:02:12.480> there's<00:02:12.690> most<00:02:12.870> likely

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
there's a murrells there's most likely

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.010 
there's a murrells there's most likely
emerald<00:02:13.650> blah

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
emerald blah

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.960 
emerald blah
and<00:02:14.290> they<00:02:14.440> look<00:02:14.620> pretty<00:02:14.800> cool<00:02:15.070> for<00:02:15.310> decoration

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
and they look pretty cool for decoration

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.370 
and they look pretty cool for decoration
because<00:02:16.000> once<00:02:16.480> you<00:02:16.630> get<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.840> buildup<00:02:17.260> of

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
because once you get a buildup of

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.200 
because once you get a buildup of
emeralds<00:02:17.860> don't<00:02:18.430> have<00:02:18.550> anything<00:02:18.760> else<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.090> do

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
emeralds don't have anything else to do

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.570 
emeralds don't have anything else to do
with<00:02:19.240> something<00:02:19.570> besides<00:02:19.870> trading<00:02:20.860> so

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
with something besides trading so

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.090 
with something besides trading so
trading<00:02:22.450> is<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.690> possibility<00:02:23.380> still<00:02:23.650> if

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
trading is a possibility still if

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.460 
trading is a possibility still if
they're<00:02:24.280> adding<00:02:24.640> emeralds<00:02:25.150> but<00:02:25.210> we<00:02:25.780> we<00:02:26.230> do<00:02:26.350> not

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
they're adding emeralds but we we do not

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.860 
they're adding emeralds but we we do not
know<00:02:26.710> for<00:02:26.950> sure<00:02:27.010> on<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.460> but<00:02:28.300> we<00:02:28.690> know

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
know for sure on that but we know

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.030 
know for sure on that but we know
emeralds<00:02:29.380> are<00:02:29.530> there<00:02:29.860> that<00:02:30.130> is<00:02:30.310> for<00:02:31.120> sure

emeralds are there that is for sure

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.740 
emeralds are there that is for sure
potatoes<00:02:33.040> is<00:02:33.190> going<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.430> be<00:02:33.550> another<00:02:34.030> food<00:02:34.480> and

beside the anvil it appears to be trip
wire<00:03:51.490> and<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:51.940> trip<00:03:52.150> wire<00:03:52.300> is<00:03:52.360> also<00:03:52.810> in<00:03:52.900> the

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
wire and the trip wire is also in the

wire and the trip wire is also in the
hot<00:03:53.530> bar<00:03:54.030> that<00:03:55.030> can<00:03:55.180> be<00:03:55.270> used<00:03:55.390> to<00:03:55.570> activate

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
hot bar that can be used to activate

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.410 
hot bar that can be used to activate
redstone<00:03:56.920> stuff<00:03:57.280> like<00:03:57.400> that<00:03:57.670> for<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.180> pressure

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
redstone stuff like that for a pressure

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.420 
redstone stuff like that for a pressure
plate<00:03:58.660> but<00:03:59.080> instead<00:03:59.410> it's<00:03:59.680> like<00:03:59.770> an<00:03:59.920> imaginary

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
plate but instead it's like an imaginary

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.550 
plate but instead it's like an imaginary
line<00:04:00.550> so<00:04:01.000> it's<00:04:01.150> not<00:04:01.300> there<00:04:01.870> you<00:04:02.170> can<00:04:02.350> barely

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
line so it's not there you can barely

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.290 
line so it's not there you can barely
see<00:04:02.920> it<00:04:03.040> so<00:04:03.490> that<00:04:03.970> would<00:04:04.090> be<00:04:04.180> really

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300
