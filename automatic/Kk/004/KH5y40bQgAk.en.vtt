together here for this last one out this

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.280 
together here for this last one out this
way<00:01:10.860> now<00:01:11.850> notice<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.150> what<00:01:12.689> these<00:01:12.810> red<00:01:13.020> lines

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
way now notice that what these red lines

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.859 
way now notice that what these red lines
are<00:01:13.619> different<00:01:14.430> planes<00:01:14.909> as<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.390> shoulders

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
are different planes as the shoulders

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.770 
are different planes as the shoulders
tilt<00:01:16.140> upward<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.950> hip<00:01:17.130> tips<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.640> hip<00:01:18.119> tilts<00:01:18.720> in

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
tilt upward the hip tips of hip tilts in

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.090 
tilt upward the hip tips of hip tilts in
the<00:01:18.869> opposite<00:01:19.350> way<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.740> that's<00:01:19.890> really

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the opposite way and that's really

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.429 
the opposite way and that's really
because<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.610> these<00:01:21.420> two<00:01:21.720> joints<00:01:22.020> here<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
because of these two joints here the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.499 
because of these two joints here the
great<00:01:22.619> trochanter<00:01:23.430> these<00:01:23.790> other<00:01:24.090> are<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
great trochanter these other are the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.899 
great trochanter these other are the
joints<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.470> femur<00:01:25.799> where<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.430> femur<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
joints of the femur where the femur the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.980 
joints of the femur where the femur the
upper<00:01:27.299> thigh<00:01:27.540> bone<00:01:27.900> let<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.070> know<00:01:29.159> snuggly

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
upper thigh bone let you know snuggly

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.609 
upper thigh bone let you know snuggly
fits<00:01:30.990> into<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:32.130> hip<00:01:32.310> joint<00:01:32.780> so<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:34.170> have<00:01:34.409> this

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
fits into the hip joint so we have this

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.460 
fits into the hip joint so we have this
line<00:01:35.549> here<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.299> gives<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.570> dynamic<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.350> it

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
line here and it gives it dynamic to it

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.880 
line here and it gives it dynamic to it
and<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.340> really<00:01:38.820> helps<00:01:39.500> give<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.590> pose<00:01:40.860> a

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
and that really helps give this pose a

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.020 
and that really helps give this pose a
nice<00:01:41.159> look

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.170
