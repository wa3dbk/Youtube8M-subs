00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.200
 further the next section is what i call 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.950
 to myself fantasy yarn that is she 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.630
 either multicolored either with sequins or 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.740
 you with someone else interspersed either 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.480
 Is this a sound? 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.199
 a beach that I almost don't know what 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.340
 do quietly let's get acquainted 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:31.289
 1 Finnish yarn here on the look and about 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.309
 called do not know how to read 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.700
 correct plump yarn she 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.120
 very good composition so so with 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.610
 drip arc points and see 50 grams 100 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.120
 meters one hundred percent wool color 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.270
 awesome transitions cool blue here 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.250
 so rich some kind of green 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.430
 Jade almost and mushrooms are very cool 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.260
 It turns out most likely I will connect from it 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.799
 daughters good vest 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.350
 such a little bit long that is not 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.159
 short to cover it all well 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.619
 it seems to me very comfortable thing to be 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.750
 attending music school because 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.390
 on and warm and at the same time their beautiful 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.790
 smart and cozy 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.040
 I have 6 such hanks I'm afraid that 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.259
 bone is not enough vivifyingly good 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:31.409
 quality can be very Sarah us 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.840
 will itself even more why I do not want it 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.150
 use for adults some things 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.280
 because on adult things where width 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.020
 the canvas is big and beautifully lay down here 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.299
 these sections 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.070
 the volume itself for baby clothes shop 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.369
 by the way this yarn was offered to me 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.200
 Can you imagine how juicy we said that 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.450
 will be worn with notes I will not know 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.000
 like one hundred percent 6 on heels can 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.729
 do anything to withstand me 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.619
 does not seem to be juicy yarn 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:03.210
 absolutely means finland 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.780
 further lana grossa verde plan and beer 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.080
 generally opal den 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.440
 on the beach can be seen that it would be all fine 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.950
 the blade fell so slight emerald 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.990
 malachite color design from it 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:22.780
 it turns the air and is very 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:27.850
 loose so you need to carefully pick up 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.650
 model i can't until i matured like 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.170
 I can not choose what you will 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.110
 fit this thread at the same time 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.360
 come to me because there is 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.500
 the likelihood that she will remember and even 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.890
 under her watch bought beautifully 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.989
 would have looked at and for girls 150 rubles 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.140
 in general, too, leave the link perfectly 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.450
 time passes show all the needle has reached 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.840
 right away it's generally wonderful yarn 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.200
 very noble 75 percent 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.660
 6 wide extras fain 25 cents and park 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.090
 the class is generally super but I can not 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.730
 just be on her business that I can't 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.760
 figure out great 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.430
 further alpaca from German 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.290
 manufacturer on moto 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.750
 one hundred percent very soft thread 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.560
 for some reason I was thinking when I bought it 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.090
 will be tougher and will keep 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.310
 well shaped one of it to tie 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.769
 some sort of rice jacket or 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.010
 another small uzorchiku so he straight 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:33.630
 I was in form but this is not about the yarn is 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.769
 soft sometimes on sweaters some cozy 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.400
 advertisers are so good winter 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.799
 quality things u she is very silk she 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.510
 straight seam whom Yashukova want to iron and 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:47.340
 iron general need to think sits 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.380
 excellent yarn lies holds on 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.799
 not entirely successful yarn in my opinion 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:57.040
 here is a mohair kiddy print of two types 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.750
 me this color here this 6 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.660
 hank this 3rd. 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.319
 this yarn didn't fit because she 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.439
 highly 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.959
 fluffy much fat, I myself from it 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:10.840
 I will definitely not knit hats with 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.959
 mohair I do not like it remains to wait until 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.879
 illumination will descend on some children 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.449
 things 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:20.729
 although I think I know the time has passed 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:24.940
 you are hero 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:28.270
 50 grams two hundred ten meters 100 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.220
 interest 80 percent kid mohair 20 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.599
 interest on the limit is also a good composition 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.789
 the thread is dyed so interesting 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:38.740
 neyarkimi sections such good here 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:42.160
 this option is more fantasy 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:45.099
 and green redhead don't know yet 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:50.800
 lies in general the soul does not lie means to do 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:51.610
 and here are the last two purchases alize sal 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.419
 abundance 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:05:00.190
 written so read 80 percent acrylic 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:03.190
 the rest is also not wool all sorts of nylon and 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:07.690
 Metallic polyester rather not travel by 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:09.340
 him on crunches terrible thing but here 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.440
 the girls have already prompted the blog 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.190
 use with this thread thin 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.409
 thin mohair 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.349
 I'll probably take advantage of this. 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:20.370
 He's very good advice because I 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:24.789
 I want some big blouse 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:27.909
 stitch can with a bat sleeve on 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:31.000
 winter you go to theaters in a circus such 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:33.449
 things are not enough and I do not need 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.249
 so I will knit with them right now 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:38.849
 . jacket and immediately here it is there 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:42.930
 learn yarn and here it is 2 2 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:45.809
 purchase theft brighton cube seller but also 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.479
 manufacturer and seller because they themselves 

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:51.659
 which does not produce bright blue saturated 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:54.779
 the color is interspersed with bright red isolate and 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:57.029
 basically yarn is nothing very 

00:05:54.779 --> 00:06:01.319
 noble composition 30 percent mohair 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:02.789
 35 wool 18 milon 17 metallic me 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:05.309
 it seems good on will serve 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:09.870
 she's a bit of a push I already showed 

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:15.150
 a sample from her carved and most likely 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:18.479
 I do not know that I link from her show 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.249
 then until in general here is such a fantasy 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:25.050
 yarn with them seems to be especially 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:30.599
 neat because it's worth it 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:33.710
 not cheap modelki for her pick me 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:33.710
 at least hard
