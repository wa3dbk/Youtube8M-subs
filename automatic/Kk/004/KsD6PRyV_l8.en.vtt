me and my mom remember it that way but
last<00:01:47.939> year<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.299> bloomed<00:01:48.810> yellow<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.560> this

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740

with<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> splash<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.860> white<00:01:53.130> towards<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
with a splash of white towards the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.090 
with a splash of white towards the
center<00:01:54.299> now<00:01:54.869> her<00:01:55.049> name<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.259> actually<00:01:55.530> vanilla

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
center now her name is actually vanilla

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.459 
center now her name is actually vanilla
because<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.700> color<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.360> yeah<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.110> really

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
because of this color that yeah I really

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.770 
because of this color that yeah I really
like<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.979> new<00:01:59.130> color<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.670> has<00:01:59.880> now<00:02:00.570> some

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
like the new color it has now some

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.469 
like the new color it has now some
people<00:02:00.899> might<00:02:01.439> say<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:02.100> white<00:02:02.969> orchids

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
people might say that white orchids

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.560 
people might say that white orchids
usually<00:02:03.840> get<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:05.280> color<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.939> fertilizer

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
usually get the color of the fertilizer

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.930 
usually get the color of the fertilizer
but<00:02:07.110> I've<00:02:07.229> used<00:02:07.500> green<00:02:07.920> fertilizers<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.849> now

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
but I've used green fertilizers and now

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.910 
but I've used green fertilizers and now
I'm<00:02:09.030> using<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.390> brown<00:02:09.569> fertilizer<00:02:10.170> one

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
I'm using a brown fertilizer one

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.260 
I'm using a brown fertilizer one
fertilizer<00:02:11.430> at<00:02:11.760> some<00:02:12.030> point

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
fertilizer at some point

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.480 
fertilizer at some point
was<00:02:12.420> pink<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.470> I'm<00:02:13.710> really<00:02:13.860> not<00:02:14.070> sure<00:02:14.130> if<00:02:14.400> it

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
was pink so I'm really not sure if it

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.310 
was pink so I'm really not sure if it
has<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.880> do<00:02:14.970> with<00:02:15.000> fertilizer<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:15.900> think<00:02:16.170> it's

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
has to do with fertilizer I think it's

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.950 
has to do with fertilizer I think it's
just<00:02:16.530> her<00:02:16.770> genes<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.490> in<00:02:18.030> my<00:02:18.150> environment<00:02:18.450> it

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
just her genes and in my environment it

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.070 
just her genes and in my environment it
appears<00:02:19.320> that<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.920> yellow<00:02:20.250> gene<00:02:20.810> took<00:02:21.810> hold

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
appears that the yellow gene took hold

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.430 
appears that the yellow gene took hold
of<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.320> orchid<00:02:22.800> but<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.040> do<00:02:23.160> like<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:24.150> way

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
of the orchid but I do like it this way

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.770 
of the orchid but I do like it this way
I'm<00:02:25.440> not<00:02:25.500> sure<00:02:25.740> what<00:02:26.220> exactly<00:02:26.600> variety<00:02:27.600> it<00:02:27.720> is

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
I'm not sure what exactly variety it is

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.710 
I'm not sure what exactly variety it is
I<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:29.040> wasn't<00:02:29.400> able<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.760> identify<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.360> but<00:02:30.570> I<00:02:30.630> do

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
I I wasn't able to identify it but I do

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.040 
I I wasn't able to identify it but I do
love<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.350> it's<00:02:31.770> better<00:02:32.010> than<00:02:32.250> white<00:02:32.810> this<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:33.870> a

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
love it it's better than white this is a

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.890 
love it it's better than white this is a
spring<00:02:34.410> dream<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.800> pollen<00:02:35.510> Dendrobium<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.780> if

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
opinion so yeah this is a case of a

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.920 
opinion so yeah this is a case of a
Dendrobium<00:03:04.590> who<00:03:04.770> changed<00:03:05.210> the<00:03:06.210> pattern<00:03:06.450> as

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
Dendrobium who changed the pattern as

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.710 
Dendrobium who changed the pattern as
well<00:03:07.140> as<00:03:07.350> a<00:03:07.380> bit<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.740> a<00:03:07.830> color<00:03:08.300> other<00:03:09.300> than<00:03:09.540> that

this<00:03:26.970> flower<00:03:27.270> seems<00:03:27.630> to<00:03:27.750> be<00:03:27.870> half<00:03:28.080> white<00:03:28.350> and

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
this flower seems to be half white and

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.240 
this flower seems to be half white and
half<00:03:29.630> colorful<00:03:30.630> most<00:03:31.440> probably<00:03:31.740> this<00:03:31.920> is<00:03:31.980> due

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
half colorful most probably this is due

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.300 
half colorful most probably this is due
to<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.430> genetical<00:03:33.350> mutation<00:03:34.350> but<00:03:34.830> I<00:03:34.890> find<00:03:35.190> it

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
to a genetical mutation but I find it

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.910 
to a genetical mutation but I find it
really<00:03:35.670> nice<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:35.910> really<00:03:36.740> appealing<00:03:37.740> like

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
really nice and really appealing like

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.720 
really nice and really appealing like
this<00:03:38.190> it's<00:03:38.430> special<00:03:38.940> so<00:03:39.240> once<00:03:39.600> again<00:03:39.780> genetic

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
this it's special so once again genetic

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.270 
this it's special so once again genetic
heritage<00:03:41.730> seems<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.450> affect<00:03:43.130> blooming<00:03:44.130> in

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
heritage seems to affect blooming in

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.030 
heritage seems to affect blooming in
some<00:03:44.490> cases<00:03:44.790> I'm<00:03:45.420> not<00:03:45.630> sure<00:03:45.750> if<00:03:45.900> it's<00:03:46.080> a<00:03:46.350> case

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
some cases I'm not sure if it's a case

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.600 
some cases I'm not sure if it's a case
of<00:03:47.280> low<00:03:47.430> temperatures<00:03:48.000> or<00:03:48.950> low<00:03:49.950> light<00:03:50.190> level

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
of low temperatures or low light level

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.460 
of low temperatures or low light level
levels<00:03:51.150> I'm<00:03:51.330> not<00:03:51.510> sure<00:03:51.630> why<00:03:51.780> determine<00:03:52.290> this

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
levels I'm not sure why determine this

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.949 
levels I'm not sure why determine this
but<00:03:52.740> I<00:03:52.770> find<00:03:53.070> it<00:03:53.220> really<00:03:53.580> interesting<00:03:53.930> so<00:03:54.930> I

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
but I find it really interesting so I

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.500 
but I find it really interesting so I
just<00:03:55.320> wanted<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.680> share<00:03:55.860> this<00:03:56.070> with<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.510> of

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
just wanted to share this with you of

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.120 
just wanted to share this with you of
course<00:03:57.570> you<00:03:58.050> all<00:03:58.110> know<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.500> Hawaiian<00:03:58.860> splash

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
course you all know the Hawaiian splash

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.490 
course you all know the Hawaiian splash
layer<00:03:59.370> which<00:03:59.700> has<00:03:59.730> a<00:03:59.970> lot<00:04:00.330> more<00:04:00.360> yellow<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:01.140> the

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
layer which has a lot more yellow to the

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.890 
layer which has a lot more yellow to the
flowers<00:04:01.920> now<00:04:02.340> these<00:04:02.640> flowers<00:04:02.880> are<00:04:03.360> kind<00:04:03.690> on

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
flowers now these flowers are kind on

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.750 
flowers now these flowers are kind on
their<00:04:04.110> way<00:04:04.290> out<00:04:04.500> or<00:04:04.800> they're<00:04:04.980> approaching<00:04:05.580> so

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
their way out or they're approaching so

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.000 
their way out or they're approaching so
the<00:04:05.910> colors<00:04:06.209> are<00:04:06.420> not<00:04:06.570> that<00:04:06.810> vivid<00:04:07.230> but<00:04:07.740> as<00:04:07.860> you

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
the colors are not that vivid but as you

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.490 
the colors are not that vivid but as you
can<00:04:08.190> see<00:04:08.520> in<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.970> middle<00:04:09.300> it<00:04:09.630> really<00:04:10.290> has<00:04:10.470> a

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
can see in the middle it really has a

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.430 
can see in the middle it really has a
splash<00:04:10.800> of<00:04:10.980> yellow<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.430> it<00:04:11.959> last<00:04:12.959> year<00:04:13.200> it

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
splash of yellow to it last year it

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.020 
splash of yellow to it last year it
didn't<00:04:13.800> bloom<00:04:14.010> like<00:04:14.220> this<00:04:14.459> it<00:04:14.670> didn't<00:04:14.910> have

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
didn't bloom like this it didn't have

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.360 
didn't bloom like this it didn't have
this<00:04:15.239> much<00:04:15.480> yellow<00:04:15.959> I<00:04:16.169> guess<00:04:16.980> this<00:04:17.190> is

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
this much yellow I guess this is

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.729 
this much yellow I guess this is
influenced<00:04:18.120> by<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.330> the<00:04:18.870> actual<00:04:19.109> care<00:04:19.500> that

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
influenced by the the actual care that

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.920 
influenced by the the actual care that
I'm<00:04:19.859> providing<00:04:20.130> but<00:04:21.000> in<00:04:21.090> some<00:04:21.270> cases<00:04:21.540> it

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
I'm providing but in some cases it

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.469 
I'm providing but in some cases it
appears<00:04:22.320> that<00:04:22.410> light<00:04:23.340> temperature<00:04:23.760> and<00:04:24.300> good

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
appears that light temperature and good

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:25.460 
appears that light temperature and good
care<00:04:24.750> can<00:04:25.020> influence

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
care can influence

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.110 
care can influence
patterns<00:04:26.040> as<00:04:26.250> well<00:04:26.490> it<00:04:26.760> didn't<00:04:27.000> necessarily

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
patterns as well it didn't necessarily

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.260 
patterns as well it didn't necessarily
changed<00:04:27.780> colors<00:04:28.230> but<00:04:28.890> it<00:04:29.070> did<00:04:29.310> change<00:04:29.670> the

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
changed colors but it did change the

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.540 
changed colors but it did change the
pattern<00:04:30.690> of<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.110> splashes<00:04:31.560> of<00:04:31.740> yellow<00:04:32.070> and<00:04:32.490> I

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
pattern of the splashes of yellow and I

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.540 
pattern of the splashes of yellow and I
do<00:04:32.610> prefer<00:04:33.120> it<00:04:33.240> like<00:04:33.270> this<00:04:33.690> and<00:04:34.160> last<00:04:35.160> but<00:04:35.370> not

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
do prefer it like this and last but not

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.700 
do prefer it like this and last but not
least<00:04:35.850> of<00:04:36.150> course<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.570> Nellie<00:04:36.750> Euler<00:04:37.200> orchid

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
least of course the Nellie Euler orchid

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.680 
least of course the Nellie Euler orchid
which<00:04:38.160> I'm<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:38.520> happy<00:04:38.760> about<00:04:38.910> because<00:04:39.300> as<00:04:39.570> you

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
which I'm so happy about because as you

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.390 
which I'm so happy about because as you
can<00:04:39.840> see<00:04:39.990> it<00:04:40.110> has<00:04:40.290> such<00:04:40.530> a<00:04:40.560> beautiful<00:04:41.160> red

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
can see it has such a beautiful red

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.240 
can see it has such a beautiful red
color<00:04:41.730> and<00:04:42.120> very<00:04:42.840> vivid<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:43.470> without<00:04:43.920> any

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
color and very vivid and without any

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.730 
color and very vivid and without any
other<00:04:44.520> markings<00:04:45.090> on<00:04:45.390> the<00:04:45.510> paddles<00:04:45.900> now<00:04:46.140> on<00:04:46.710> a

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
other markings on the paddles now on a

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.050 
other markings on the paddles now on a
corner<00:04:47.100> of<00:04:47.130> the<00:04:47.340> screen<00:04:47.550> you<00:04:47.730> will<00:04:47.880> see<00:04:48.030> a

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
corner of the screen you will see a

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.690 
corner of the screen you will see a
photograph<00:04:48.330> of<00:04:48.810> this<00:04:49.110> exact<00:04:49.710> same<00:04:50.040> plant<00:04:50.430> and

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
photograph of this exact same plant and

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.420 
photograph of this exact same plant and
it's<00:04:50.850> flowering<00:04:51.440> from<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.620> summer<00:04:52.920> in<00:04:53.220> this

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
it's flowering from the summer in this

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.340 
it's flowering from the summer in this
case<00:04:53.730> it<00:04:54.030> might<00:04:54.330> just<00:04:54.600> be<00:04:54.690> external

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
case it might just be external

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.770 
case it might just be external
conditions<00:04:55.950> but<00:04:56.640> again<00:04:57.060> it's<00:04:57.270> a<00:04:57.360> really<00:04:57.600> nice

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
conditions but again it's a really nice

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.170 
conditions but again it's a really nice
example<00:04:57.990> of<00:04:58.530> how<00:04:59.160> orchids<00:04:59.670> can<00:04:59.850> actually

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
example of how orchids can actually

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.570 
example of how orchids can actually
change<00:05:00.840> patterns<00:05:01.350> whether<00:05:01.920> it's<00:05:02.190> due<00:05:02.400> to

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
change patterns whether it's due to

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.340 
change patterns whether it's due to
environment<00:05:03.150> whether<00:05:03.660> it's<00:05:03.810> due<00:05:04.110> to<00:05:04.290> a

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
environment whether it's due to a

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.160 
environment whether it's due to a
genetical<00:05:05.010> issue<00:05:05.340> or<00:05:05.850> a<00:05:05.910> mutation<00:05:06.270> I<00:05:06.870> just

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
genetical issue or a mutation I just

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.260 
genetical issue or a mutation I just
find<00:05:07.350> it<00:05:07.470> really<00:05:07.500> interesting<00:05:07.920> and<00:05:08.490> it's<00:05:08.970> just

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
find it really interesting and it's just

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.500 
find it really interesting and it's just
something<00:05:09.980> to<00:05:10.980> add<00:05:11.220> into<00:05:12.150> our<00:05:12.180> love<00:05:12.480> of

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
something to add into our love of

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.390 
something to add into our love of
orchids<00:05:13.170> it's<00:05:13.440> something<00:05:13.770> to<00:05:13.920> look<00:05:14.070> forward

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
orchids it's something to look forward

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.760 
orchids it's something to look forward
to<00:05:14.730> and<00:05:15.000> every<00:05:15.240> blooming<00:05:15.690> they<00:05:16.020> might<00:05:16.320> be

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
to and every blooming they might be
