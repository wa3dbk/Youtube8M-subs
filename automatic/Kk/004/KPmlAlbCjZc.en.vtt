you must know it's grimace from Ronald
McDonald<00:00:48.960> land<00:00:49.200> place<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:50.660> sure<00:00:51.660> that's<00:00:51.870> not

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
McDonald land place I sure that's not

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.459 
McDonald land place I sure that's not
that<00:00:52.079> bad

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
that bad

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.560 
that bad
I<00:00:52.500> didn't<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.890> purple<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:53.879> what<00:00:54.300> does<00:00:54.449> this

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
I didn't have purple but what does this

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.569 
I didn't have purple but what does this
drawing<00:00:54.840> convey<00:00:55.199> about<00:00:55.320> me<00:00:55.559> as<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> person<00:00:55.770> well

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
drawing convey about me as a person well

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.400 
drawing convey about me as a person well
according<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.300> new<00:00:57.510> study<00:00:57.750> our<00:00:58.050> drawing

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
according to a new study our drawing

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.049 
according to a new study our drawing
abilities<00:00:58.859> are<00:00:59.010> actually<00:00:59.340> correlated<00:00:59.940> with

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
abilities are actually correlated with

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.090 
abilities are actually correlated with
our<00:01:00.180> intelligence<00:01:00.750> which<00:01:00.989> actually<00:01:01.829> may<00:01:01.949> not

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
our intelligence which actually may not

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.189 
our intelligence which actually may not
bode<00:01:02.399> well<00:01:02.430> for<00:01:02.640> me<00:01:02.879> but<00:01:03.570> back<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.960> study

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
bode well for me but back to the study

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.170 
bode well for me but back to the study
so<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> team<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.920> researchers<00:01:05.189> took<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> group<00:01:06.000> of

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
so a team of researchers took a group of

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.359 
so a team of researchers took a group of
children<00:01:06.479> all<00:01:06.869> aged<00:01:07.170> foreign<00:01:07.740> ask<00:01:07.979> them<00:01:08.189> to

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
children all aged foreign ask them to

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.190 
children all aged foreign ask them to
draw<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> picture<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.390> child<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.960> then<00:01:10.080> they

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
draw a picture of a child and then they

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.320 
draw a picture of a child and then they
scored<00:01:10.560> each<00:01:10.770> picture<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> scale<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.850> 0<00:01:12.240> to

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
scored each picture on a scale of 0 to

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.630 
scored each picture on a scale of 0 to
12<00:01:12.720> based<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.260> how<00:01:13.470> many<00:01:13.530> features<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.400> child

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
12 based on how many features the child

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.510 
12 based on how many features the child
correctly<00:01:15.210> identified<00:01:15.810> head<00:01:16.170> eyes<00:01:16.409> nose<00:01:17.100> arms

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
correctly identified head eyes nose arms

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.520 
correctly identified head eyes nose arms
ears<00:01:17.759> legs<00:01:18.000> etc<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:18.780> my<00:01:18.900> drawing<00:01:19.200> which<00:01:19.409> I

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
ears legs etc so my drawing which I

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.170 
ears legs etc so my drawing which I
still<00:01:19.710> maintain<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.310> masterpiece<00:01:20.729> would<00:01:21.060> be

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
still maintain is a masterpiece would be

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.870 
still maintain is a masterpiece would be
about<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.570> 6<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.439> got<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> body<00:01:23.040> with<00:01:23.400> arms<00:01:23.700> and

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
about a 6 as it got a body with arms and

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.219 
about a 6 as it got a body with arms and
legs<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.270> head<00:01:24.299> with<00:01:24.720> eyes<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.110> mouth

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
legs and a head with eyes and a mouth

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.200 
legs and a head with eyes and a mouth
correct<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.369> they<00:01:26.490> had<00:01:26.610> children<00:01:26.970> do<00:01:27.090> this

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
correct so they had children do this

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.760 
correct so they had children do this
drawing<00:01:27.420> test<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.049> then<00:01:28.140> they<00:01:28.259> tested<00:01:28.650> their

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
drawing test and then they tested their

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.770 
drawing test and then they tested their
intelligence<00:01:29.369> levels<00:01:29.729> at<00:01:29.880> age<00:01:30.030> 4<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.420> then

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
intelligence levels at age 4 and then

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.350 
intelligence levels at age 4 and then
again<00:01:31.170> at<00:01:31.470> age<00:01:31.650> 14<00:01:32.280> turns<00:01:32.610> out<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.970> kids<00:01:33.210> who

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
again at age 14 turns out the kids who

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.850 
again at age 14 turns out the kids who
had<00:01:33.509> higher<00:01:33.689> scores<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:34.229> their<00:01:34.320> drawing<00:01:34.680> at

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
had higher scores on their drawing at

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.399 
had higher scores on their drawing at
age<00:01:35.009> 4<00:01:35.579> were<00:01:36.060> also<00:01:36.600> found<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.049> be<00:01:37.079> more

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
age 4 were also found to be more

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.230 
age 4 were also found to be more
intelligent<00:01:37.770> which<00:01:38.189> isn't<00:01:38.369> SuperDuper

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
intelligent which isn't SuperDuper

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.880 
intelligent which isn't SuperDuper
surprising<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:39.780> itself<00:01:40.020> since<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> test<00:01:40.710> was

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
surprising in itself since the test was

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.230 
surprising in itself since the test was
created<00:01:41.369> as<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> way<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.729> assess<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.210> child's

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
created as a way to assess the child's

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.450 
created as a way to assess the child's
intelligence<00:01:43.049> but<00:01:43.229> what<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.619> surprising<00:01:43.920> that

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
intelligence but what is surprising that

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.910 
intelligence but what is surprising that
even<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.149> decade<00:01:45.540> later<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.320> correlation

we were to make a comparison between

we were to make a comparison between
drawing<00:02:49.109> ability<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.709> say<00:02:49.920> writing<00:02:50.519> ability
