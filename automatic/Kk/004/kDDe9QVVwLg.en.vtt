00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
order to run Bank and toss up on it

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.120 
order to run Bank and toss up on it
I<00:02:50.510> would<00:02:51.510> don't<00:02:51.990> probably<00:02:52.260> get<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:52.680> your<00:02:52.830> room

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
I would don't probably get in your room

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.060 
I would don't probably get in your room
while<00:02:53.370> they<00:02:53.580> do<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:54.030> but<00:02:54.620> stood<00:02:55.620> up<00:02:55.800> for<00:02:56.010> our

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
while they do so but stood up for our

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.830 
while they do so but stood up for our
fuel<00:02:56.550> packages<00:02:57.590> that's<00:02:58.590> one<00:02:58.920> if<00:02:59.880> it's<00:03:00.180> if<00:03:00.510> it

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
fuel packages that's one if it's if it

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.750 
fuel packages that's one if it's if it
if<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.410> contains<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.890> application<00:03:02.490> and<00:03:02.640> the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
if it contains the application and the

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.320 
if it contains the application and the
image<00:03:03.180> file<00:03:03.450> that'll<00:03:04.080> be<00:03:04.170> okay

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
image file that'll be okay

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.330 
image file that'll be okay
so<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.600> is<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.900> analysis<00:03:07.910> well<00:03:08.910> that's<00:03:09.780> great

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
so it is a analysis well that's great

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.459 
so it is a analysis well that's great
all<00:03:11.340> right
