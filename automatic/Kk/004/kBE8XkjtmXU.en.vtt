go<00:01:53.670> down<00:01:53.850> there<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.090> run<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.649> really

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
go down there and run so it's really

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.260 
go down there and run so it's really
going<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.040> be<00:01:56.130> nice<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.640> get<00:01:56.880> down<00:01:57.030> there<00:01:57.210> and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
going to be nice to get down there and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.050 
going to be nice to get down there and
finally<00:01:57.719> run<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.490> hopefully<00:01:59.490> run<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.820> fast

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
