00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:11.160
 we find ourselves having a lot of land 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.780
 wet we took about 750 mm of 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.950
 water from September so we have gods 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.940
 soils that are really sponges 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.070
 the main attention is not to 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.920
 compact the land who had gods 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.510
 ready-made land assess if they are 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.430
 soft enough to sow them 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.890
 as they found with no trouble at 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.930
 remove those who have land that 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.820
 they need to be 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.010
 worked must wait for it 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.510
 they melt a little more and do a lot 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.210
 attention also in this case of the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.039
 passages with machines with tires that 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.460
 don't behave too much 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:46.800
 important situations where it still exists 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.780
 water present in the field as they go 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.730
 managed in this case it is not necessary to have 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.350
 hurry you have to wait for the most 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.960
 possible land to be able to 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.940
 eventually go to sow 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.429
 definitely later then too 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.530
 there to do the work they allow 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.510
 to dry as much as possible not 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.630
 crush the ground in advance for 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.210
 casey avoids really disasters 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.580
 then of three passer and of behaviors 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.040
 that would compromise the success of the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.190
 of culture we speak now of the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.560
 weed management what to do 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.660
 in all cases we have weeds 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.550
 quite developed precisely because 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.110
 we have not been in for several months 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.690
 field with workings for which there 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.490
 we find it from fairly clean soils 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.400
 as in this case we see the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.910
 our shoulders and situations where we have 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.250
 of weeds grasses meadows 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.230
 very much developed in all cases 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.960
 it is advisable to reset with a reserve 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.880
 total with the glyphosates also of the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.560
 very important dosages 5 liters of a 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.540
 grifo latte over 60 per hectare 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.150
 trying to wet ours well 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.040
 always weeds in all cases before 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.320
 to sow or before making 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.420
 refining processes of 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.850
 soil preparation for what 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.880
 instead it concerns weeding by emergency mail 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.860
 therefore the anti germinelli despite 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.190
 we are in an age that the sun could 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.020
 to be enough 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.580
 degrading we say on the molecules that 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.020
 we are going to distribute the anti 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.360
 germinelli still remain 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.630
 weeding at the base for those who do not have large 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.640
 weed problems for and for 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.739
 which a herbicide is always recommended 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.470
 germs in the to postpone instead for 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.080
 all companies that have problems with 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.510
 sorghetta vilucchio and others for en 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.670
 ancient or peaty soils that then the 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.100
 anti germs in the is not to be kept in 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.709
 consideration but to postpone to when 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.989
 the corn is high in post-emergency and from 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.000
 three sheets forward bearing in mind that 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.560
 almost all anti- germ products in the 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.540
 today they can be used 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.730
 up to the two true leaves of the corn for 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.799
 which if one already has the product at home and 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.150
 no rain should come soon 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.209
 still have the possibility of 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.930
 use it also with a corn in 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.730
 emergency or early stages of development 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.130
 choice of hybrids compared to 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.590
 length of the cycle also by virtue of 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.489
 fact that we have a lot of land 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.810
 wet and we're going to compact it 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.720
 we must certainly choose books 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.320
 who are quite rustic who do not 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.150
 has the ability to scratch so the 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.000
 choice of early or recycled books 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:27.600
 medium that have a good apparatus 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.859
 important radical that they succeed to 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.510
 take root well in the ground 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.549
 all the companies that have the 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.989
 possibility of scratching do not have big 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.690
 problems I can do both cycles 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.459
 early medium late as the thing of 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.160
 usual that it does of usual in the 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.570
 own company 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.820
 the important thing is to choose anyway 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.170
 varieties that have an advance of 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.970
 flowering just to have a greater 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:53.140
 build up and escape 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.850
 the call of important in full summer 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.290
 switching to fertilizing 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.880
 regarding the fertilization that 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.730
 the land already ready to be sown 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.280
 he must think only of putting phosphorus 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.990
 localized and then proceed with nitrogen 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.540
 set emergency without going underground 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.790
 no pre- kind of nitrogen for 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.200
 don't touch the grounds and don't lose to 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.410
 gasification not use 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.510
 of urea put there up there 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.310
 for all others who must anyway 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.750
 work of the land they can 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.370
 choose to bury urea beyond 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.660
 to phosphorus potassium as per plan of 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.560
 fertilization based on one's own 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.270
 analysis in pre seeding right in in 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.610
 contemporary or before processing 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.650
 in this case yes you can make a contribution 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.000
 part fractionated even nitrogen 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:43.370
 before sowing and the remainder 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.020
 get to the doses here is that 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.220
 companies need in post emergency 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.740
 for what concerns the quantities 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.169
 nitrogen compared to the limits 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.919
 provided by the Nitrates Directive which 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.660
 considerations can be made ferrara is 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.030
 all nitrates and vulnerable area 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.650
 so we have two levels of 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.550
 distribution regarding the 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:10.340
 corn maize in dry 210 units of nitrogen 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.190
 for corn coming 280 units of nitrogen 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.140
 per hectare for the exact right year 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.320
 I will allow the year without making gods 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:21.080
 more than 100 units in solution 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.150
 unique in today sowing are just 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.190
 matches and are very few days that 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.020
 we left we started with the 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.060
 sowing precisely of this culture that for 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.620
 we are of great importance 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.660
 we consider that we are talking about a basin 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.570
 of more than 6 thousand hectares that come 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.300
 planted with a re ipotizzavamo 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:41.510
 reduction in surfaces compared to 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.750
 those invested in last year of 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.850
 made to date also for choices of 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.340
 so we say replacement of other cultures 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.320
 that we are no longer going to put things into practice 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.340
 we will end up with a substantial 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:57.710
 we are maintaining surfaces today 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.350
 a couple of weeks 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.840
 of delay in sowing compared to 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:06.230
 what would have been the dates 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.910
 volutes of beginning sowing but I would say that 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.300
 in fact this should not be translated 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:13.700
 however in a major damage to the 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.020
 results that we are going to wait for 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.480
 the future 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.610
 the risk of having to resort despite 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.880
 all the water we've had so far 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:25.790
 having to resort to irrigation I say that 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.100
 there is and there is certainly everything to have 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:31.250
 lost these days and leave again more 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.740
 ahead leads us to greater risk 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.450
 to have to intervene as a denial that 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.030
 where possible 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.670
 I say it would be good to start 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:43.010
 also provide for consideration 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.320
 the innovative possibility to do it with the 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:47.510
 hoses we heard yours before 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.120
 colleague marco leonardi who spoke to us 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.520
 as much nitrogen as possible 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.250
 administer each year remaining 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.330
 within the nitrates directive 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.220
 considering the seasonal trend of 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.500
 this year there may be some 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:03.740
 problems related precisely to the nitrogen in the 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.350
 corn no like as if properly 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.840
 my colleague Lonardi also said 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:11.840
 that if we have the foresight to go there 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:14.630
 to fractionate everything or almost 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.550
 in the post-emergency of the culture of 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:19.630
 did we go to work on sui 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:22.640
 remove and I think it is a fertilizer 

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:25.250
 wise of divided in that way may 

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.820
 quietly meet the needs of 

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:27.820
 our fields
