00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:07.720
 now out after publication all the way 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:11.770
 in short what looks like so you see 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.990
 Here is a dammed Venice where 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.990
 here as he is holding the cervical spine 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.370
 the shoulder blades and you look good 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.590
 one of the anterior neck vein 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.289
 huge dammed area and here 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.450
 a narrowing of the vein I here 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.699
 As for now, and you can see here in the 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.760
 second picture you can see that the import 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.140
 from a catheter with a balloon here 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.120
 at this point the introduced 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.159
 first balloon exactly and this bottleneck 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.229
 then sits here the balloon 

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:40.600
 inflated and the constriction becomes 

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:43.510
 blown up and then you see this one here 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.639
 that suddenly this close part of the 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.920
 vein suddenly returns to normal 

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:51.069
 and of course the whole backlog 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.839
 is lifted into the brain flows again 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:54.429
 on the brain and the neurological 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.429
 disturbances disappear overnight 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.690
 tinnitus and the dysfunctions 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:01.659
 short-term memory computer eyes 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.459
 disturbances go away that disappears 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.019
 just everything we've been up to now 

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:07.390
 have learned neurological 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.920
 Diseases are not neurological 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.600
 but do not get sick of it 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:19.509
 are diseases that have to do with 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:23.759
 this topic then oxytocin oxytocin is 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.869
 known in our circles because of the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.460
 christoph grote has a great article 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.450
 published in our magazine 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.240
 to pull over to her 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.750
 very short for oxytocin so first what 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.579
 better known about it is important about 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.409
 Once again, bonding is the partner 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:43.499
 hormone to the anti of ethical hormones 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:47.259
 and important for breast milk production 

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:49.210
 a big role in the 6 6 ua song and 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.789
 then it is important to know if it is in the 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.590
 lack gives people the little oxytocin in 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.549
 her hypothalamus in the hypophysis 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.380
 to produce 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:02.229
 it turns into sociopaths psychopaths 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.250
 Nazi and are often recognizable 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.160
 great 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.020
 manipulate behavioral people with little 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.490
 to pull on them and I have only one 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:15.220
 own known circle in the known circle 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.720
 in topic experiences made with in 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.760
 In this case it was women who were very 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.220
 have manipulatively behave in 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.940
 my field and where I had the chance 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.840
 to measure the oxytocin in the blood or was 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.380
 no measurable amount of oxytocin 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.150
 and blood and today we know that 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.370
 can fix it again by doing that 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.200
 as a homeopathic give in the right one 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.810
 potency with the right treatment 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.850
 can repair this mechanism and 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.080
 many of you use it in the frame 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.100
 the pk work 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.620
 the broken motion of you 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.480
 already pk have done a bit 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.310
 the main topics we are dealing with 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.220
 after that the broken in longer 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.410
 movement when the binding of child 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.790
 to mother or father early 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.060
 was interrupted 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.190
 and there is the peculiar phenomenon 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.080
 people no longer produce oxytocin 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.170
 can and with all the disturbances the 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.400
 come from it and who oxytocin me 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.650
 play and fix that 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.320
 mechanism happen all sorts of things 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.170
 wonder and we often do so in the 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.120
 Framework of APK treatment and is one 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.790
 the main agent for the treatment of 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.680
 autism is also published that 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.200
 correct oxytocin is used in the 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.180
 autism just with the problem that one 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.340
 must give his life long if one 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.430
 Homeopathic will give the repair 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.769
 reinvigorated by the mechanism of 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.590
 oxytocin and when it repairs again 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.549
 is then the children make 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.549
 Giant progress progress
