00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.500
 in the trade between the 31 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.679
 and there's a little something 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.710
 done something green even if it is 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.849
 has rained incredibly and as cold 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.849
 was over long distances 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.220
 well with a flower is still 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.220
 not found 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.160
 here I had me actually more of 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.950
 elsewhere they promised the beautiful ones 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:49.800
 purple here they are very pale 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:52.850
 schierlinger no weeds fall here 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.250
 I looked up 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:16.830
 The pumpkins look sad that I 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:22.200
 out because it is seen cold in South 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:25.640
 also very sad but 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.640
 at least that's it 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.610
 the constant scratching 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:46.710
 and that without bonuses dar 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.650
 and plant the salad more densely inside 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.790
 have 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:54.800
 I say so has also 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.920
 we have bereaved the rocco suffer 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.150
 already know a bit 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.740
 but I think that still stands 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.280
 he just will not be right 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:13.010
 Larger probably because he has the place 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:16.850
 is missing and she is interesting this 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:22.180
 Both a parsley are at the same 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:26.060
 day sown once smooth which is beautiful 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.070
 but there is a chronicle of 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:34.100
 to see 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:37.430
 you can see seeds from yes, too 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.440
 outside my nasturtium we 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.370
 on the tree slices of the fruit trees 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.720
 have actually planted the and 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.720
 yellow and sad 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.269
 there makes the wild rose flowers 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.069
 Here at the edge of the weed I have 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:18.100
 also put a lot of nasturtium and 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:24.340
 In between, the beautiful is juicy 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.340
 However, want to be eroded by the wm 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.120
 here is a back flowerbed what he 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.430
 anyway that suffers and something like that 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.400
 the separation to the neighbors one 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.170
 Garbage collection is not the garden 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.310
 forgive it , no one does anything 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.310
 urge to speak 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.570
 so here the butternut also sees more 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.570
 as an annual out 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.700
 China Shield is coming 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:15.709
 Another pitiful pumpkin too 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.709
 that 's it
