action there position it in a straight
line<00:01:38.610> as<00:01:38.759> much<00:01:38.880> as<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.090> possibly<00:01:39.150> can<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.700> take

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
line as much as I possibly can and take

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.020 
line as much as I possibly can and take
it<00:01:42.720> through<00:01:43.340> roughly<00:01:44.340> about<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.670> same<00:01:44.909> amount

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
it through roughly about the same amount

okay<00:01:49.549> do<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.700> again

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
okay do it again

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.710 
okay do it again
the<00:01:51.840> needle<00:01:52.110> through<00:01:52.759> short<00:01:53.759> rip<00:01:54.090> rule<00:01:54.329> fuller

be firm this is a kind of a stitching
that<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.910> would<00:02:09.090> use<00:02:09.450> say<00:02:09.989> for<00:02:10.259> example<00:02:10.770> if

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
that you would use say for example if

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.830 
that you would use say for example if
you're<00:02:11.250> fitting<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.700> garment<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.540> the

you're fitting a garment this is the
I'm<00:02:12.870> stitching<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:13.500> would<00:02:13.709> use<00:02:15.890> but<00:02:16.890> it's

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
I'm stitching that I would use but it's

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.080 
I'm stitching that I would use but it's
quite<00:02:17.930> stable<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.980> also<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:20.610> can<00:02:20.790> also<00:02:20.910> do

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
quite stable and also you can also do

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.780 
quite stable and also you can also do
them<00:02:21.209> smaller<00:02:21.569> I'm<00:02:21.840> just<00:02:22.290> showing<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.530> here

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
basting stitches all about okay so I've

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.460 
basting stitches all about okay so I've
got<00:02:55.560> my<00:02:55.680> needle<00:02:56.599> right<00:02:57.599> through<00:02:57.660> it's<00:02:58.110> not<00:02:58.290> yet

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
got my needle right through it's not yet

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.910 
got my needle right through it's not yet
it's<00:02:58.620> double<00:02:58.920> thread<00:02:59.190> and<00:03:01.459> basically<00:03:03.799> it<00:03:04.799> is

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
it's double thread and basically it is

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.160 
it's double thread and basically it is
all<00:03:05.069> you<00:03:05.549> even<00:03:05.700> stitches<00:03:05.910> on<00:03:06.120> top<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:08.959> this<00:03:09.959> is

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
all you even stitches on top and this is

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.610 
all you even stitches on top and this is
partly<00:03:10.829> what<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.549> would<00:03:11.700> do<00:03:11.940> for<00:03:12.349> marking<00:03:13.349> and

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
partly what you would do for marking and

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.280 
partly what you would do for marking and
positions<00:03:14.220> on<00:03:14.459> your<00:03:15.769> fabric<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:18.019> they<00:03:19.019> can<00:03:19.170> be

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
positions on your fabric and they can be

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.910 
positions on your fabric and they can be
quite<00:03:19.590> large<00:03:23.900> you<00:03:24.900> don't<00:03:25.139> all<00:03:25.350> have<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.739> be

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
quite large you don't all have to be

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.070 
quite large you don't all have to be
even<00:03:26.489> either

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.400 

okay<00:03:34.220> right

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
okay right

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.460 
okay right
and<00:03:37.410> then<00:03:37.920> when<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.100> just<00:03:38.250> come<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.490> the<00:03:38.640> end

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
and then when you just come to the end

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.250 
and then when you just come to the end
you<00:03:40.470> just<00:03:41.840> not<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:44.510> just<00:03:45.510> put<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.720> knot<00:03:45.900> in<00:03:45.930> there

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
you just not it just put a knot in there

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
you just not it just put a knot in there
so<00:03:46.470> I'll<00:03:46.650> bring<00:03:46.770> that<00:03:46.830> through<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.430> loop<00:03:49.280> and

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
so I'll bring that through the loop and

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.400 
so I'll bring that through the loop and
just<00:03:50.520> create<00:03:51.390> another<00:03:51.510> loop<00:03:52.220> tie<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.280> off<00:03:53.490> I

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
just create another loop tie it off I

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.830 
just create another loop tie it off I
not<00:03:55.410> some<00:03:55.590> me<00:03:55.710> in<00:03:55.800> there<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:56.450> I<00:03:57.450> cut<00:03:57.720> the

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
not some me in there and I cut the

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.340 
not some me in there and I cut the
thread<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:58.790> those<00:03:59.790> was<00:04:00.030> two<00:04:00.270> facing<00:04:01.080> stitch

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
thread and those was two facing stitch

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.520 
thread and those was two facing stitch
so<00:04:02.040> we've<00:04:02.160> got<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.430> eben<00:04:02.730> one<00:04:03.260> which<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.380> even

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
so we've got the eben one which is even

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.490 
so we've got the eben one which is even
on<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:05.040> other<00:04:05.370> side<00:04:05.550> and<00:04:06.230> you've<00:04:07.230> got<00:04:07.380> the

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
on the other side and you've got the

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.750 
on the other side and you've got the
only<00:04:07.650> even<00:04:07.980> one<00:04:08.130> where<00:04:08.250> you<00:04:08.340> can<00:04:08.460> see<00:04:08.640> it's

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
only even one where you can see it's

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.350 
only even one where you can see it's
larger<00:04:09.180> on<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.930> upper<00:04:10.800> side<00:04:10.980> underneath<00:04:11.700> size

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
larger on the upper side underneath size

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.740 
larger on the upper side underneath size
is<00:04:12.870> slightly<00:04:13.110> smaller<00:04:14.120> so<00:04:15.120> that's<00:04:15.240> basting

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
is slightly smaller so that's basting

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.930 
is slightly smaller so that's basting
stitch<00:04:15.990> for<00:04:16.200> you<00:04:16.320> and<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:17.250> use<00:04:17.459> both<00:04:17.670> of<00:04:17.820> those

stitch for you and you use both of those

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.370 
stitch for you and you use both of those
