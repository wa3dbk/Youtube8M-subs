if you just want to make a video of
someone<00:00:37.500> saying<00:00:38.190> something<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.030> very<00:00:39.270> fixed

environments their heads rigid they're
not<00:00:42.300> smiling<00:00:42.570> then<00:00:43.350> that's<00:00:43.500> quite<00:00:43.710> quite<00:00:44.129> easy

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
not smiling then that's quite quite easy

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.590 
not smiling then that's quite quite easy
to<00:00:44.370> do<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:44.850> as<00:00:44.910> soon<00:00:45.059> as<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.180> want<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.420> allow

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
to do but as soon as you want to allow

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.090 
to do but as soon as you want to allow
them<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.809> move<00:00:46.020> their<00:00:46.230> head<00:00:46.320> around<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.920> have

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
them to move their head around and have

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.459 
them to move their head around and have
a<00:00:47.309> variety<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.760> expressions<00:00:48.360> suddenly<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
a variety of expressions suddenly the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.020 
a variety of expressions suddenly the
number<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.739> possibilities<00:00:50.070> becomes<00:00:50.760> much

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
number of possibilities becomes much

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.020 
number of possibilities becomes much
larger<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.690> that's<00:00:52.379> what<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.739> model<00:00:53.030> really

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
larger and that's what this model really

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.660 
larger and that's what this model really
deals<00:00:54.210> with<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> lot<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.949> communication

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
deals with so a lot of the communication

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.450 
deals with so a lot of the communication
between<00:00:57.059> people<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.690> nonverbal<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.469> between

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
between people is nonverbal and between

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.729 
between people is nonverbal and between
people<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.030> machines<00:01:00.090> at<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.629> moment<00:01:01.020> it's

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
people and machines at the moment it's

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.170 
people and machines at the moment it's
not<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.160> at<00:01:02.280> all<00:01:02.430> basically<00:01:03.000> we<00:01:03.059> have

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
not like that at all basically we have

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.660 
not like that at all basically we have
to<00:01:03.359> input<00:01:04.080> all<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.290> commands<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.070> things<00:01:05.309> we

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
to input all the commands and things we

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.330 
to input all the commands and things we
want<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.119> computer<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.570> do<00:01:06.750> ourselves<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.979> it

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
want the computer to do ourselves and it

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.070 
want the computer to do ourselves and it
doesn't<00:01:08.549> pick<00:01:08.700> up<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.000> subtleties<00:01:09.570> such<00:01:09.900> as

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
doesn't pick up on subtleties such as

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.490 
doesn't pick up on subtleties such as
you<00:01:10.290> know<00:01:10.350> gestures<00:01:11.280> by<00:01:11.460> hand<00:01:11.729> or<00:01:12.000> by<00:01:12.180> face<00:01:12.540> so

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
you know gestures by hand or by face so

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.499 
you know gestures by hand or by face so

different<00:01:53.340> emotions<00:01:53.990> we<00:01:54.990> then<00:01:55.259> fed<00:01:55.619> these

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
different emotions we then fed these

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.429 
different emotions we then fed these
into<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> computer<00:01:56.520> vision<00:01:57.110> program<00:01:58.110> which

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
into a computer vision program which

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.620 
into a computer vision program which
tracked<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.950> face<00:01:59.130> or<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.119> motion<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.540> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
tracked the face or the motion of the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.120 
tracked the face or the motion of the
lips<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.200> eyes<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:02.750> then<00:02:03.750> we<00:02:04.049> added<00:02:04.860> this

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
lips and the eyes and then we added this

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.370 
lips and the eyes and then we added this
to<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.399> audio<00:02:05.670> data<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.270> trained<00:02:07.229> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
to the audio data and trained the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.350 
to the audio data and trained the
talking<00:02:07.710> head<00:02:07.890> using<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.849> large<00:02:09.119> set

rotation<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.200> blinking<00:02:16.680> are<00:02:16.830> found<00:02:17.100> this

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
rotation and blinking are found this

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.240 
rotation and blinking are found this
allows<00:02:18.330> us<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.780> control<00:02:19.110> these<00:02:19.530> variables

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
allows us to control these variables

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.030 
allows us to control these variables
manually<00:02:20.910> if<00:02:21.000> desired<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.720> also<00:02:22.440> decouples

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
manually if desired and also decouples

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.490 
manually if desired and also decouples
them<00:02:23.250> from<00:02:23.460> mouth<00:02:23.670> shape<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:25.020> what<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.230> find

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
them from mouth shape so what I find

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.340 
them from mouth shape so what I find
really<00:02:25.710> interesting<00:02:25.800> about<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.460> project<00:02:26.940> is

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
really interesting about this project is

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.110 
really interesting about this project is
how<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:29.190> know<00:02:29.280> interaction<00:02:29.760> with<00:02:30.030> the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
how you know interaction with the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.390 
how you know interaction with the
computer<00:02:30.510> can<00:02:30.690> be<00:02:30.840> done<00:02:30.990> in<00:02:31.140> there<00:02:31.290> in<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.190> more

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
computer can be done in there in a more

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.730 
computer can be done in there in a more
natural<00:02:32.520> way<00:02:32.820> so<00:02:33.000> when<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:33.930> did<00:02:34.110> my<00:02:34.230> PhD<00:02:34.410> in

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
natural way so when I did my PhD in

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.680 
natural way so when I did my PhD in
Cambridge<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.250> was<00:02:35.370> looking<00:02:35.670> at<00:02:35.820> gestures<00:02:36.330> hand

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
Cambridge I was looking at gestures hand

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.300 
Cambridge I was looking at gestures hand
tracking<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.530> now<00:02:37.800> we're<00:02:37.980> looking<00:02:38.190> at<00:02:38.280> a

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
tracking and now we're looking at a

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.620 
tracking and now we're looking at a
different<00:02:38.610> part<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:38.940> body<00:02:39.030> basically<00:02:39.510> the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
different part of the body basically the

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.280 
different part of the body basically the
face<00:02:39.840> which<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.170> very<00:02:40.350> expressive<00:02:41.100> and

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
face which is very expressive and

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.320 
face which is very expressive and
basically<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.500> degree<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:43.830> realism<00:02:44.280> is<00:02:44.970> still

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
basically the degree of realism is still

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.240 
basically the degree of realism is still
not<00:02:45.420> quite<00:02:45.660> there<00:02:45.840> if<00:02:45.990> we<00:02:46.110> look<00:02:46.290> at<00:02:46.440> at<00:02:46.770> films

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
not quite there if we look at at films

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.120 
not quite there if we look at at films
or<00:02:47.550> animations<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:49.770> know<00:02:49.890> getting

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
or animations and you know getting

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.890 
or animations and you know getting
getting<00:02:50.730> that<00:02:50.820> little<00:02:51.060> bit<00:02:51.150> extras<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:51.750> that

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
getting that little bit extras so that

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.450 
getting that little bit extras so that
it<00:02:51.990> really<00:02:52.260> looks<00:02:52.440> like<00:02:52.680> you're<00:02:53.070> talking<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.400> a

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
it really looks like you're talking to a

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.220 
it really looks like you're talking to a
real<00:02:53.610> person<00:02:53.640> it's<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.630> real<00:02:54.780> challenge<00:02:55.170> I

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
real person it's a real challenge I

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.230 
real person it's a real challenge I
think<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.680> even<00:02:56.190> now<00:02:56.310> when<00:02:56.490> we<00:02:56.640> type<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.120> new

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
think and even now when we type in new

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.690 
think and even now when we type in new
text<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.690> set<00:02:57.870> an<00:02:57.990> emotion<00:02:58.410> it's<00:02:58.920> always<00:02:59.280> a

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
text and set an emotion it's always a

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.000 
text and set an emotion it's always a
new<00:03:00.000> surprise<00:03:00.180> because<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.900> never<00:03:01.050> know<00:03:01.380> how

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
new surprise because you never know how

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.110 
new surprise because you never know how
it's<00:03:02.160> going<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.400> sound<00:03:02.610> how<00:03:02.790> it's<00:03:02.910> going<00:03:03.030> to

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
it's going to sound how it's going to

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.150 
it's going to sound how it's going to
look<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.420> will<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:03.810> be<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.470> know<00:03:04.560> spot-on<00:03:04.950> or

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
look it will it be you know spot-on or

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.010 
look it will it be you know spot-on or
will<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.370> be<00:03:05.400> slightly<00:03:05.730> off<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.210> we're<00:03:06.900> really

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
will it be slightly off and we're really

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.440 
will it be slightly off and we're really
working<00:03:07.500> on<00:03:07.620> improving<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.280> if<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.240> think

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
working on improving that if you think

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.090 
working on improving that if you think
just<00:03:09.720> trying<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:09.990> define<00:03:10.320> what<00:03:10.350> an<00:03:10.620> emotion<00:03:10.950> is

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
just trying to define what an emotion is

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.610 
just trying to define what an emotion is
it<00:03:11.430> can<00:03:11.640> be<00:03:11.760> quite<00:03:12.120> hard<00:03:12.350> for<00:03:13.350> example

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
it can be quite hard for example

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.110 
it can be quite hard for example
happiness<00:03:14.010> can<00:03:14.220> be<00:03:14.250> expressed<00:03:14.700> in<00:03:14.880> many

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
happiness can be expressed in many

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.700 
happiness can be expressed in many
different<00:03:15.270> ways

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
different ways

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.570 
different ways
that's<00:03:16.710> when<00:03:16.830> we<00:03:16.920> actually<00:03:17.130> came<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.370> build

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
that's when we actually came to build

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.360 
that's when we actually came to build
the<00:03:17.730> system<00:03:18.030> we<00:03:18.120> needed<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.420> very<00:03:18.450> consistent

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
the system we needed a very consistent

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.770 
the system we needed a very consistent
form<00:03:20.370> of<00:03:20.490> happiness<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.300> same<00:03:21.510> type<00:03:21.750> of

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
form of happiness the same type of

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.140 
form of happiness the same type of
happiness<00:03:22.020> that<00:03:22.320> could<00:03:22.440> we<00:03:22.560> repeat<00:03:23.130> it<00:03:23.280> again

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
happiness that could we repeat it again

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.510 
happiness that could we repeat it again
and<00:03:24.330> again<00:03:24.390> in<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.720> training<00:03:25.050> data<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.530> so

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
and again in the training data and so

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.130 
and again in the training data and so
the<00:03:26.850> actress<00:03:27.240> who<00:03:27.360> we<00:03:27.450> got<00:03:27.540> in<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:27.780> do<00:03:27.930> this

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
the actress who we got in to do this

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.080 
the actress who we got in to do this
though<00:03:28.590> was<00:03:28.770> really<00:03:29.010> good<00:03:29.130> at<00:03:29.250> giving<00:03:29.550> each<00:03:29.940> of

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
though was really good at giving each of

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.760 
though was really good at giving each of
the<00:03:30.150> emotions<00:03:30.570> a<00:03:30.690> very<00:03:30.900> distinct<00:03:31.530> flavour

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
the emotions a very distinct flavour

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.770 
the emotions a very distinct flavour
which<00:03:32.459> means<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:32.850> when<00:03:32.970> we<00:03:33.120> came<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.480> learn

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
which means that when we came to learn

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.710 
which means that when we came to learn
the<00:03:33.900> model<00:03:34.610> it<00:03:35.610> gave<00:03:35.790> us<00:03:35.970> half<00:03:36.240> chance<00:03:36.540> of

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
the model it gave us half chance of

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.140 
the model it gave us half chance of
actually<00:03:36.990> pinning<00:03:37.470> down<00:03:37.740> a<00:03:38.040> basic<00:03:38.760> emotion

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
actually pinning down a basic emotion

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.180 
actually pinning down a basic emotion
for<00:03:39.450> each<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.900> each<00:03:40.440> of<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.620> six<00:03:40.830> emotions

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
for each of the each of the six emotions

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.510 
for each of the each of the six emotions
we<00:03:41.310> models<00:03:41.780> so<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.900> next<00:03:43.080> step<00:03:43.380> is<00:03:43.650> trying<00:03:44.220> to

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
we models so the next step is trying to

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.570 
we models so the next step is trying to
extend<00:03:45.180> this<00:03:45.330> model<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:46.080> take<00:03:46.860> anyone's<00:03:47.340> face

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
extend this model to take anyone's face

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.449 
extend this model to take anyone's face
so<00:03:48.030> from<00:03:48.780> maybe<00:03:48.930> just<00:03:49.200> a<00:03:49.320> couple<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.650> photos<00:03:50.010> or

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
so from maybe just a couple of photos or

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.440 
so from maybe just a couple of photos or
a<00:03:50.610> few<00:03:51.050> seconds<00:03:52.050> of<00:03:52.380> someone<00:03:53.010> speaking<00:03:53.450> to

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
a few seconds of someone speaking to

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.180 
a few seconds of someone speaking to
then<00:03:54.570> be<00:03:54.720> able<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.930> adapt<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.620> talking<00:03:56.040> head

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
then be able to adapt the talking head

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.010 
then be able to adapt the talking head
to<00:03:56.340> look<00:03:56.489> like<00:03:56.700> them<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:57.120> sound<00:03:57.480> like<00:03:57.690> them

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
to look like them and sound like them

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.640 
to look like them and sound like them
