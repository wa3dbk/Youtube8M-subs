00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:15.380 
basically it's a desert race in Rock

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.730 
basically it's a desert race in Rock
race<00:00:15.670> it's<00:00:16.670> held<00:00:16.940> in<00:00:17.119> Johnson<00:00:17.510> Valley<00:00:17.740> they

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
race it's held in Johnson Valley they

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.200 
race it's held in Johnson Valley they
call<00:00:18.950> it<00:00:19.040> the<00:00:19.100> hammer<00:00:19.310> trails<00:00:19.670> and<00:00:20.060> that's

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
call it the hammer trails and that's

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.750 
call it the hammer trails and that's
where<00:00:20.390> Keenan<00:00:20.750> hammers<00:00:20.960> come<00:00:21.170> from<00:00:21.430> it's<00:00:22.430> it

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
where Keenan hammers come from it's it

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.510 
where Keenan hammers come from it's it
is<00:00:23.000> the<00:00:23.270> hardest<00:00:23.840> rock<00:00:24.560> canyons<00:00:25.040> Rock<00:00:25.220> trails

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
is the hardest rock canyons Rock trails

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.740 
is the hardest rock canyons Rock trails
there<00:00:26.210> is<00:00:26.360> definitely<00:00:26.779> a<00:00:26.869> mistake

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
there is definitely a mistake

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.889 
there is definitely a mistake
I<00:00:30.699> don't<00:00:31.699> care<00:00:31.820> if<00:00:31.880> the<00:00:32.029> Racing<00:00:32.329> lawn<00:00:32.509> mowers

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
I don't care if the Racing lawn mowers

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.600 
I don't care if the Racing lawn mowers
as<00:00:33.050> long<00:00:33.200> as<00:00:33.350> we<00:00:33.470> got<00:00:33.590> equal<00:00:33.770> lawn<00:00:34.010> mowers<00:00:34.399> I'm

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
as long as we got equal lawn mowers I'm

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.510 
as long as we got equal lawn mowers I'm
there<00:00:35.239> you<00:00:35.480> know<00:00:35.510> it's<00:00:36.140> whatever<00:00:36.829> it<00:00:37.010> takes<00:00:37.250> to

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
there you know it's whatever it takes to

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.390 
there you know it's whatever it takes to
race<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:38.720> be<00:00:38.809> competitive<00:00:39.160> that's<00:00:40.160> what<00:00:40.370> I

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
race and be competitive that's what I

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:51.840 
race and be competitive that's what I
want<00:00:40.640> to<00:00:40.760> do

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.160 

for<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:52.940> most<00:00:53.089> part<00:00:53.239> our<00:00:53.449> car<00:00:53.629> was<00:00:53.780> totally

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
for the most part our car was totally

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.619 
for the most part our car was totally
solid<00:00:54.410> except<00:00:55.039> for<00:00:55.640> after<00:00:56.030> on<00:00:56.239> that<00:00:56.420> first

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
solid except for after on that first

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.810 
solid except for after on that first
difficult<00:00:57.320> Rock<00:00:57.440> Canyon<00:00:57.829> we<00:00:58.339> stripped<00:00:58.670> an

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
difficult Rock Canyon we stripped an

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.849 
difficult Rock Canyon we stripped an
inner<00:00:59.000> for<00:00:59.210> an<00:00:59.300> axle<00:00:59.690> so<00:00:59.930> we<00:01:00.500> did<00:01:00.680> make<00:01:00.829> it

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
inner for an axle so we did make it

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.229 
inner for an axle so we did make it
through<00:01:00.979> that<00:01:01.219> section<00:01:01.489> we<00:01:01.789> made<00:01:01.969> it<00:01:02.059> to<00:01:02.149> the

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
through that section we made it to the

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.090 
through that section we made it to the
remote<00:01:02.510> pit<00:01:02.750> we<00:01:03.289> had<00:01:03.409> to<00:01:03.500> change<00:01:03.710> out<00:01:03.949> that

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
remote pit we had to change out that

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.310 
remote pit we had to change out that
interaction<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:04.970> that<00:01:05.119> cost<00:01:05.390> us<00:01:05.630> about<00:01:05.840> a

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
interaction and that cost us about a

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.219 
interaction and that cost us about a
good<00:01:06.920> hour<00:01:07.130> hour<00:01:07.549> 15<00:01:08.090> minutes<00:01:08.119> and<00:01:08.570> then<00:01:08.630> also

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
good hour hour 15 minutes and then also

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.020 
good hour hour 15 minutes and then also
also<00:01:09.799> of<00:01:10.009> course<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.399> time<00:01:10.580> that<00:01:10.759> we<00:01:10.820> already

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
also of course the time that we already

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.330 
also of course the time that we already
spent<00:01:11.299> that<00:01:11.450> Canyon<00:01:11.869> so<00:01:12.080> it's<00:01:12.890> hard<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.190> kind

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
spent that Canyon so it's hard to kind

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.560 
spent that Canyon so it's hard to kind
of<00:01:13.460> sit<00:01:13.670> there<00:01:13.820> in<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:13.970> pits<00:01:14.149> and<00:01:14.330> you<00:01:14.390> know

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
of sit there in the pits and you know

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.810 
of sit there in the pits and you know
the<00:01:14.810> top<00:01:15.020> 10<00:01:15.320> 15<00:01:15.740> guys<00:01:15.890> are<00:01:16.189> you<00:01:16.729> know

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
the top 10 15 guys are you know

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:28.419 
the top 10 15 guys are you know
trouble-free<00:01:17.420> underway<00:01:26.560> large<00:01:27.560> designation

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
trouble-free underway large designation

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:30.969 
trouble-free underway large designation
builds<00:01:28.700> not<00:01:28.940> a<00:01:28.970> real<00:01:29.149> hard<00:01:29.530> desert<00:01:30.530> race<00:01:30.710> but

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
builds not a real hard desert race but

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.350 
builds not a real hard desert race but
again<00:01:31.190> we're<00:01:31.340> trying<00:01:31.549> to<00:01:31.610> do<00:01:31.700> desert<00:01:32.060> racing

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
again we're trying to do desert racing

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.539 
again we're trying to do desert racing
in<00:01:32.479> rock<00:01:32.720> crawlers<00:01:33.110> which<00:01:34.009> makes<00:01:34.220> it<00:01:34.310> tough

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
in rock crawlers which makes it tough

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.850 
in rock crawlers which makes it tough
and<00:01:35.149> then<00:01:35.360> you<00:01:35.840> know<00:01:35.959> you<00:01:36.020> go<00:01:36.289> through<00:01:36.319> you're

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
and then you know you go through you're

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.609 
and then you know you go through you're
doing<00:01:37.190> 80<00:01:38.030> 90<00:01:38.539> 100<00:01:38.659> miles<00:01:38.959> now<00:01:39.110> in<00:01:39.259> the<00:01:39.319> desert

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
doing 80 90 100 miles now in the desert

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.139 
doing 80 90 100 miles now in the desert
section<00:01:39.979> then<00:01:40.220> also<00:01:40.369> they<00:01:40.640> send<00:01:40.880> you<00:01:41.000> in<00:01:41.030> a

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
section then also they send you in a

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.510 
section then also they send you in a
rock<00:01:41.330> canyon<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.350> it's<00:01:42.619> just<00:01:42.890> all<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.459> way

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
rock canyon and it's just all the way

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.240 
rock canyon and it's just all the way
down<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.729> 12<00:01:44.330> miles<00:01:44.479> an<00:01:44.659> hour<00:01:44.750> up<00:01:45.500> water<00:01:45.920> falls

down to 12 miles an hour up water falls

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.410 
down to 12 miles an hour up water falls
down<00:01:47.060> down<00:01:47.690> big<00:01:47.990> drop-off<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:49.640> just<00:01:49.970> feeds<00:01:50.209> the

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
down down big drop-off it just feeds the
