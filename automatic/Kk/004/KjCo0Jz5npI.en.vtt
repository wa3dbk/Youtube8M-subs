00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.980
 Hello everyone, we will cook today 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.769
 Ukrainian homemade sausage 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.980
 I saw this recipe on YouTube 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.660
 everything will be good and I'm not sure that I 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.589
 correctly said because I do not own 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.810
 Ukrainian language 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:19.450
 I really like this recipe from Igor 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.790
 misevich and now I want this recipe 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.600
 exercise but the only thing he did 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.490
 in a pork string of sausages, I'll try 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.470
 make in collagen better in 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.439
 the rest I will follow his recipes 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.329
 let's see what we get the recipe very much 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.129
 need a kilo of lean pork 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.589
 half of this meat is necessary 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.539
 pass into place through a meat grinder 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:42.640
 middle grille and the other half 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:44.100
 cut well into such cubes somewhere 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.480
 centimeter per centimeter 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.309
 then we will need fat can 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.260
 salted you can take unsalted me 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.530
 not salty lard which is also necessary 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.480
 dice centimeter by centimeter 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.620
 need salt 25 grams 5 cloves 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.440
 garlic from fishing line I bought stores and 180 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.220
 milliliters and potatoes but of course 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.480
 need a meat grinder shell 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.640
 special stuffing for sausages and 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.640
 cotton paper dressing twine 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.160
 night rush I already sliced owl meat 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.250
 twisted and now cut the meat 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.930
 in small pieces of course 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.150
 centimeter centimeter centimeter yet 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.220
 I can't make perfect cube 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.220
 but by no means thoroughly undermined the knife 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:36.280
 but also to try to generally as the pieces 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:38.800
 there were such small ones and so meat 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.200
 half a kilo of pound rolled 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.790
 the meat is finely chopped finely chopped itself and 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.380
 now we will make stuffing for 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.020
 Ukrainian homemade sausage 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.969
 now you need chopped lard meat 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.700
 and meat twisted but more or less 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.409
 uniform so mix yet 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.710
 kneading strongly just stir and 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.860
 so that the stuffing was more evenly and then 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.479
 let's start adding seasoning 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.610
 crush garlic but garlic and squeeze no 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.920
 for meat and issued in a separate plate 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.410
 then to evenly distribute it 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.819
 on forcemeat otherwise it turns out to be somewhere 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.769
 a lot of garlic somewhere in general here 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.269
 we distribute now garlic 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.910
 meaning of garlic separately 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.519
 squeeze I do it because so that he 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.940
 evenly distributed over minced meat 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:28.340
 to all 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:32.120
 and now with pro inside to taste this 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.959
 add red pepper and various 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.049
 seasoning and add 40 25 grams of salt to 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.780
 1 kilo of meat is also uniform 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.569
 sprinkle and now all this will need 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.560
 knead well and add here 180 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:51.379
 milliliters of cream now I added 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.230
 cream and very good at all this knead 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.269
 the only thing that collective is 1 corrective 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.700
 which I wear in this 30 which I saw 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.700
 there immediately after kneading began 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.859
 I always fill the sausages when I do 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.139
 sausages make the stuffing ripen in 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.989
 the fridge after it's ready in 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:10.970
 for one or two hours because 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.720
 that this maturation it contributes to 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.989
 that stuffing becomes better 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.780
 minced ripe shell collagen in water 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.380
 soaked from one end tied with twine 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.120
 and now we start stuffing sausages here 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.370
 less air in the shell 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.049
 when we do not kill 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.359
 first we skip the meat to 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:37.930
 here she came out on the tip of the boarder and 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.930
 now ships devour the shell 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.599
 but so much sausage got me out of 1 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.450
 kilograms of pork now need them 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:00.520
 good look and not where 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.680
 large air bubbles treats fine 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.300
 a needle that he heard today we will 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.090
 bake only these three sausages 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.470
 quorums form the remaining sausages can 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.870
 either put in the fridge and then 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.019
 tomorrow for example the day after tomorrow to fry them 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.660
 or boil or you can pre them 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.760
 boil but not boil and then 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.470
 roast and timer on coals or on 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.210
 the pan here add potatoes and 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.950
 now potato affairs liked in 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:32.080
 video you would have yourself here this idea 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:33.669
 very cool to form out so 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.229
 jump not lost good 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:41.320
 to make it easier to wash the form where 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:44.470
 was a headlight he takes a potato cuts it 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.520
 the cut into 1 2 parts near i rent 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.340
 into four parts 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.800
 She then this card this potato 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:55.650
 and smears on the form it turns out that 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.650
 the form is peeled and the potatoes are smeared 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:06.970
 we wipe we lay potatoes ship 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:12.780
 sausages oven warmed up to 180 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:16.120
 degrees and we will fry it all 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.700
 the oven warmed to 180 degrees and 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.340
 send there our sausages in the video 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.350
 set a time of 35 minutes I think it 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.830
 It will not be enough I will put 40 and then 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.830

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.880
