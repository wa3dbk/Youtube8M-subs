here<00:04:47.000> is<00:04:47.030> my<00:04:47.510> theory<00:04:47.810> and<00:04:48.110> it<00:04:48.260> is<00:04:48.440> one<00:04:48.710> of<00:04:48.740> those

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
here is my theory and it is one of those

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.020 
here is my theory and it is one of those
I<00:04:50.300> guess<00:04:51.460> conspiracy<00:04:52.460> theories<00:04:52.790> that<00:04:52.910> they

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
I guess conspiracy theories that they

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.470 
I guess conspiracy theories that they
were<00:04:53.090> talking<00:04:53.330> about<00:04:54.610> basically<00:04:55.610> this<00:04:56.210> is<00:04:56.270> how

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
were talking about basically this is how

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.500 
were talking about basically this is how

for<00:06:22.119> last<00:06:22.569> gen<00:06:22.979> consoles<00:06:23.979> I<00:06:24.189> don't<00:06:24.639> think<00:06:24.699> so

00:06:25.049 --> 00:06:25.059 
for last gen consoles I don't think so

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:29.609 
for last gen consoles I don't think so
that's<00:06:25.599> my<00:06:25.809> personal<00:06:26.229> opinion<00:06:26.549> I<00:06:28.139> think<00:06:29.139> that

00:06:29.609 --> 00:06:29.619 
that's my personal opinion I think that

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:31.079 
that's my personal opinion I think that
they<00:06:29.739> want<00:06:29.919> the<00:06:30.039> game<00:06:30.189> to<00:06:30.219> have<00:06:30.459> legs<00:06:30.759> just

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:31.089 
they want the game to have legs just

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:33.649 
they want the game to have legs just
like<00:06:31.179> GTA<00:06:31.599> 4<00:06:31.869> hat<00:06:32.049> they<00:06:32.559> probably<00:06:32.829> got<00:06:33.009> more

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:33.659 
like GTA 4 hat they probably got more

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.579 
like GTA 4 hat they probably got more
downloadable<00:06:34.659> content<00:06:34.809> in<00:06:35.109> the<00:06:35.199> works<00:06:35.379> than

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:35.589

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:39.899 
downloadable content in the works than
just<00:06:35.769> two<00:06:35.889> episodes<00:06:36.369> so<00:06:37.799> to<00:06:38.799> be<00:06:38.919> honest<00:06:39.279> yeah

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:39.909 
just two episodes so to be honest yeah

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:41.249 
just two episodes so to be honest yeah
the<00:06:40.089> game<00:06:40.269> might<00:06:40.479> need<00:06:40.689> some<00:06:40.839> extra<00:06:41.019> polish

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:41.259 
the game might need some extra polish

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:44.159 
the game might need some extra polish
but<00:06:41.799> I<00:06:41.859> do<00:06:41.949> think<00:06:42.399> that<00:06:42.809> the<00:06:43.809> next<00:06:44.139> generation

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:44.169 
but I do think that the next generation

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:47.129 
but I do think that the next generation
systems<00:06:45.129> have<00:06:45.579> something<00:06:46.059> to<00:06:46.239> do<00:06:46.449> with<00:06:46.689> the

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:47.139 
systems have something to do with the

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:49.349 
systems have something to do with the
game<00:06:47.319> being<00:06:47.349> delayed<00:06:47.799> am<00:06:48.099> I<00:06:48.519> mad<00:06:48.759> at<00:06:48.819> that<00:06:48.969> no
