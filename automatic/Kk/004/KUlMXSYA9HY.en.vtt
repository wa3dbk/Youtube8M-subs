00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
different effects on a separate video

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.790 
different effects on a separate video
and<00:00:43.940> then<00:00:44.120> I'm<00:00:44.239> gonna<00:00:44.390> a<00:00:44.540> be<00:00:44.570> them<00:00:45.050> to<00:00:45.559> the

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
and then I'm gonna a be them to the

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.920 
and then I'm gonna a be them to the
actual<00:00:45.980> effects<00:00:46.550> for<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.600> ones<00:00:47.750> that<00:00:47.900> I

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
actual effects for the ones that I

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.569 
actual effects for the ones that I
actually<00:00:48.019> aren't<00:00:48.530> so<00:00:48.949> it<00:00:49.190> should<00:00:49.339> be<00:00:49.400> a<00:00:49.430> lot<00:00:49.519> of

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
actually aren't so it should be a lot of

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.170 
actually aren't so it should be a lot of
fun<00:00:50.440> so<00:00:51.440> I've<00:00:51.890> cut<00:00:52.100> out<00:00:52.250> manual<00:00:53.000> which<00:00:53.629> is<00:00:53.769> cool

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
fun so I've cut out manual which is cool

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.479 
fun so I've cut out manual which is cool
don't<00:00:56.180> need<00:00:56.300> that<00:00:57.760> this<00:00:58.760> is<00:00:58.879> a<00:00:59.030> power<00:00:59.300> supply

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
don't need that this is a power supply

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.479 
don't need that this is a power supply
comes<00:01:01.489> with<00:01:01.729> its<00:01:01.850> own<00:01:01.970> one<00:01:02.830> which<00:01:03.830> you<00:01:04.339> know

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
comes with its own one which you know

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.670 
comes with its own one which you know
it's<00:01:05.239> I<00:01:05.540> guess<00:01:05.930> it's<00:01:06.049> not<00:01:06.110> a<00:01:06.170> bad<00:01:06.260> idea

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
it's I guess it's not a bad idea

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.130 
it's I guess it's not a bad idea
how<00:01:06.860> many<00:01:07.040> volts<00:01:07.220> is<00:01:07.400> this<00:01:07.549> thing<00:01:07.930> so<00:01:08.930> it's<00:01:09.049> a

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
how many volts is this thing so it's a

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.420 
how many volts is this thing so it's a
nine<00:01:09.380> volt<00:01:09.909> mm<00:01:10.909> million<00:01:11.950> so<00:01:12.950> you<00:01:13.009> know<00:01:13.280> it's

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
nine volt mm million so you know it's

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.719 
nine volt mm million so you know it's
close<00:01:13.700> to<00:01:13.729> being<00:01:13.880> standard<00:01:16.270> check<00:01:17.270> that<00:01:17.479> out

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
close to being standard check that out

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.219 
close to being standard check that out
there's<00:01:19.729> no<00:01:19.850> earth<00:01:20.060> pin<00:01:20.450> either<00:01:20.840> which<00:01:21.200> is

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
there's no earth pin either which is

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.530 
there's no earth pin either which is
good<00:01:23.140> and

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
good and

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.990 
good and

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
buttons than a keyboard it's ridiculous

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.640 
buttons than a keyboard it's ridiculous
but<00:02:12.459> it's<00:02:13.090> actually<00:02:13.360> really<00:02:13.569> cool<00:02:13.840> there's

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
but it's actually really cool there's

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.210 
but it's actually really cool there's
four<00:02:14.920> separate<00:02:15.730> tracks<00:02:16.660> here<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:18.040> can

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
four separate tracks here and you can

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.080 
four separate tracks here and you can
preset<00:02:19.180> any<00:02:19.750> number<00:02:20.200> of<00:02:20.470> effects<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.250> tweak

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
preset any number of effects and tweak

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.089 
preset any number of effects and tweak
them<00:02:22.300> much<00:02:22.720> like<00:02:22.959> a<00:02:22.989> standard<00:02:23.410> analog<00:02:23.769> pedal

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
them much like a standard analog pedal

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.970 
them much like a standard analog pedal
you<00:02:24.280> can<00:02:24.430> just<00:02:24.580> turn<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:25.299> dials<00:02:25.720> so<00:02:26.080> that's

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
you can just turn the dials so that's

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.120 
you can just turn the dials so that's
really<00:02:27.130> cool<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:28.620> it's<00:02:29.620> made<00:02:29.799> out<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:30.299> steel

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
really cool and it's made out of steel

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.300 
really cool and it's made out of steel
which<00:02:33.130> actually<00:02:33.730> feels<00:02:33.940> really<00:02:34.209> good<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:35.310> we

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
which actually feels really good and we

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.339 
which actually feels really good and we
have<00:02:36.459> some<00:02:36.700> different<00:02:37.299> things<00:02:37.900> on<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.170> back

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
have some different things on the back

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.610 
have some different things on the back
MIDI<00:02:39.360> expression<00:02:40.360> pedal<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:40.870> guess<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:41.500> can

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
MIDI expression pedal I guess so you can

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.770 
MIDI expression pedal I guess so you can
use<00:02:41.739> that<00:02:41.890> as<00:02:42.099> a<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.910> know<00:02:42.970> your<00:02:43.150> volume<00:02:43.599> or

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
use that as a you know your volume or

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.080 
use that as a you know your volume or
whatever<00:02:45.180> input<00:02:47.220> effects<00:02:48.220> send<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:48.819> return

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
whatever input effects send and return

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.559 
whatever input effects send and return
and<00:02:49.380> output<00:02:50.380> so<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.790> got<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:51.970> monitor<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.480> a

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
and output so you got a monitor and a

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.780 
and output so you got a monitor and a
stereo<00:02:52.989> out<00:02:53.230> for<00:02:53.860> some<00:02:54.099> of<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.250> delay<00:02:54.519> effects

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
stereo out for some of the delay effects

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.539 
stereo out for some of the delay effects
they<00:02:55.000> can<00:02:55.060> run<00:02:55.330> two<00:02:55.510> hands<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.310> there<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:57.400> is

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
they can run two hands and there it is

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.940 
they can run two hands and there it is
so<00:02:58.209> stay<00:02:59.049> tuned<00:02:59.320> in<00:02:59.410> my<00:02:59.440> channel
