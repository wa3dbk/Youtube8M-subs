00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
I could use that and use it more like a

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.870 
I could use that and use it more like a
walkie-talkie<00:01:43.409> than<00:01:44.409> a<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:45.490> know<00:01:45.579> it's<00:01:45.759> just

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
walkie-talkie than a you know it's just

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.120 
walkie-talkie than a you know it's just
it's<00:01:46.119> just<00:01:46.359> the<00:01:46.539> regular<00:01:47.439> foot<00:01:47.679> bone<00:01:47.889> that

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
it's just the regular foot bone that

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.159 
it's just the regular foot bone that
people<00:01:48.429> are<00:01:48.549> used<00:01:48.789> to<00:01:50.219> it's<00:01:51.219> got<00:01:51.369> GPS<00:01:51.959> one<00:01:52.959> neat

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:53.169 
people are used to it's got GPS one neat

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:55.199 
people are used to it's got GPS one neat
thing<00:01:53.200> is<00:01:53.499> it<00:01:53.889> actually<00:01:54.219> has<00:01:54.369> a<00:01:54.399> digital

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
thing is it actually has a digital

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:58.559 
thing is it actually has a digital
compass<00:01:55.749> so<00:01:56.169> you<00:01:56.229> can<00:01:56.669> when<00:01:57.669> you<00:01:57.819> open<00:01:58.389> up<00:01:58.450> the

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
compass so you can when you open up the

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:12.240 
compass so you can when you open up the
display<00:01:58.929> you<00:01:59.319> can<00:01:59.380> use<00:01:59.709> the<00:01:59.889> compass<00:02:00.219> there

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.869 

yeah<00:02:14.650> so<00:02:16.269> just<00:02:17.269> a<00:02:17.480> backup<00:02:17.780> compass<00:02:18.640> built<00:02:19.640> into

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
yeah so just a backup compass built into

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.309 
yeah so just a backup compass built into
the<00:02:19.970> phone<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.390> guess<00:02:20.569> because<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:20.930> uses<00:02:21.110> the

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
the phone I guess because it uses the

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:27.070 
the phone I guess because it uses the
GPS<00:02:21.470> chip<00:02:22.010> in<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:24.519> it<00:02:25.519> lasts<00:02:26.090> forever

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
GPS chip in it it lasts forever

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.890 
GPS chip in it it lasts forever
the<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.310> they<00:02:28.730> say<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.120> standby<00:02:29.450> time<00:02:29.720> on

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
the the they say the standby time on

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.759 
the the they say the standby time on
this<00:02:30.019> is<00:02:30.200> 20<00:02:30.530> out<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.680> 20<00:02:31.069> days<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:32.650> think<00:02:33.650> I've

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
this is 20 out of 20 days I think I've

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.039 
this is 20 out of 20 days I think I've
charged<00:02:34.130> this<00:02:34.280> phone<00:02:34.610> like<00:02:34.880> twice<00:02:35.269> since<00:02:35.870> I

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
make sure before I did this you know

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.089 
make sure before I did this you know
obviously<00:04:04.760> you<00:04:04.849> saw<00:04:05.030> it<00:04:05.209> was<00:04:05.389> on<00:04:05.889> it<00:04:06.889> has<00:04:07.069> a

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
obviously you saw it was on it has a

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.330 
obviously you saw it was on it has a
lock<00:04:07.430> unlock<00:04:07.880> and<00:04:08.120> there's<00:04:08.239> a<00:04:08.299> rubber<00:04:08.540> seal

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.330 
things that does say is it's not
waterproof<00:05:02.710> with<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.639> open<00:05:03.819> like<00:05:04.360> this<00:05:04.629> that

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
waterproof with it open like this that

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.100 
waterproof with it open like this that
from<00:05:06.340> what<00:05:06.550> I<00:05:06.580> have<00:05:06.819> read<00:05:07.090> and<00:05:07.689> some<00:05:07.960> of<00:05:08.020> the

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
from what I have read and some of the

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.740 
from what I have read and some of the
other<00:05:08.229> reviews<00:05:08.620> I<00:05:08.740> had<00:05:08.889> seen<00:05:09.330> where<00:05:10.330> I<00:05:10.360> guess

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
other reviews I had seen where I guess

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.890 
other reviews I had seen where I guess
it<00:05:11.469> possibly<00:05:12.370> leave<00:05:13.089> something<00:05:13.509> open

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
it possibly leave something open

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.869 
it possibly leave something open
although<00:05:14.050> it<00:05:14.319> can't<00:05:14.770> possibly<00:05:15.039> see<00:05:15.520> what<00:05:15.759> it

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:15.879 
although it can't possibly see what it

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:17.939 
although it can't possibly see what it
would<00:05:16.000> be<00:05:16.180> but<00:05:16.449> it<00:05:16.599> did<00:05:16.810> say<00:05:17.110> that<00:05:17.409> they<00:05:17.589> do

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
would be but it did say that they do

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.730 
would be but it did say that they do
recommend<00:05:18.339> I<00:05:19.080> guess<00:05:20.080> if<00:05:20.199> you're<00:05:20.319> gonna<00:05:20.409> fall

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.649 
recommend I guess if you're gonna fall
in<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:20.949> water<00:05:21.099> that<00:05:21.460> you<00:05:21.729> fall<00:05:22.120> in<00:05:22.360> with<00:05:22.509> the

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:22.659 
in the water that you fall in with the

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:27.360 
in the water that you fall in with the
phone<00:05:22.870> closed<00:05:23.620> and<00:05:24.009> not<00:05:24.639> open<00:05:25.060> but<00:05:25.889> here<00:05:26.889> we<00:05:27.159> go

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
phone closed and not open but here we go

we're gonna dump it in and see if we can

00:05:29.889 --> 00:06:03.290 
we're gonna dump it in and see if we can
give<00:05:30.159> it<00:05:30.250> a<00:05:30.310> call
