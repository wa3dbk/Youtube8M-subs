00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.059
 Hello, how are you guys and girls from Youtube? 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.219
 that's adapt this is the crepe and pasta 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:16.230
 of bar death I hope you like it 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.230
 and enjoy it, let's start with this 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.310
 they know how the fox has a way 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.310
 strange to tell the chapters of the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.770
 simpson do not count some doing that 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.410
 the number of episodes is inconsistent 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.890
 the reason for this strange fact is a 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.330
 Lost episode of season 1 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.580
 find details of this episode is 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.470
 something difficult because nobody from the staff 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.780
 who worked on the show at that time 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.879
 wants to talk about it so I 've 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.239
 managed to collect the lost episode 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.290
 It was written entirely by Matt Groening 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.719
 during the production of the first 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.840
 Mata season acted strangely 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.780
 he was silent he looked nervous and something 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.850
 morbid to mention this to someone who 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.829
 was present at those times so 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.989
 regular makes the person angry 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.840
 issue and forbid you mention it 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.850
 amac today first of this event in a 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.680
 event where david silverman was 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.140
 talking to someone in the audience 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.580
 he asked about the episode and silverman 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.500
 he just came out of the scene 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.259
 suddenly ending the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.170
 presentation the episode number 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.980
 lost was 7 06 with the title of 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.290
 harvard bar died episode 706 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.060
 it was done afterwards and he was granted the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.060
 Harvard production code for 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.310
 hide the existence of this in addition 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.290
 to cause anger to ask any 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.150
 staff member about the chapter the 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.890
 will do everything possible to 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.560
 stop talking directly with 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.540
 Matt groening at a fan convention 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.430
 I managed to follow him after he finished 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.440
 talk to the audience and eventually 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.560
 I had an opportunity to talk to him 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.600
 as he left the building he did not 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.150
 Anger that would probably follow him 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.550
 thinking that he was another typical fan when 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.010
 I mentioned the lost episode was put 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.470
 pale and began to tremble when I 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.930
 I asked if you could give me details 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.360
 she seemed about to cry like a 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.610
 piece of paper wrote something in it and 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.550
 he gave it to me he begged me because never again 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.590
 mention the episode again in the 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.600
 piece of paper was the address of a 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.390
 website will not say for reasons 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.070
 narrate e in a second I entered the address 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.290
 to my search engine and I went to a site 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.270
 completely black except for one 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.420
 yellow text line a link of 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.290
 download I clicked and the file started 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.480
 to get off 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.849
 once I finish downloading it 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.549
 computer went crazy the worst virus 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.590
 who have seen restore system not 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.709
 it worked the computer had to be 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.019
 formatted completely before this 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.329
 copy the file to a CD and try 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.920
 open it on my new computer 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:49.709
 totally clean and as I suspected 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.720
 it was an episode of the simpsons the 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.640
 episode started like everyone else 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.159
 but with an animation quality 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.560
 really poor if they have seen the 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.109
 animation for your bening mind was 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.879
 similar but less stable the first 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:06.180
 part was normal but the characters 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:08.549
 they were a little out of it homero 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.189
 I saw angry marie looked depressed 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.200
 Lisa looked extremely anxious and bart 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.790
 he seemed to be full of anger and hatred towards 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.709
 His parents 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.840
 the episode was about the simpsons 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.849
 going on a plane trip and almost to 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.220
 end of the first part when the 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.239
 plane was about 20 or 30 meters 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.220
 in the air 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.189
 bard broke a window of this and it was 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.200
 sucked out at the beginning of the 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:33.239
 series maintained an idea that the 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.890
 animated style of the world of the simpsons 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.800
 represent life and what 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.650
 death will make everything more realistic that's why 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.200
 this episode passed the image of the corpse 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.240
 bart was barely recognizable took 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.550
 total advantage that they should not cheer him up 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.130
 and they drew a picture almost realistic photo 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.600
 the corpse of bart the first act 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.300
 ended with an image extremely 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.550
 graphic of bart's corpse when 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.680
 started the second act homero marge 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.860
 elisa were sitting at the table of the 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.989
 kitchen crying crying seemed no 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.450
 end up becoming more painful and 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.310
 sounding extremely realistic with a 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.890
 better performance than they would believe 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.019
 possible the animation started to decay 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.330
 even more while they cried and you could 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.160
 hear the murmurs in the background 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.590
 characters seemed to be barely 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.109
 were lengthening and erasing 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.080
 it's like deformed shapes painted with 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.570
 random bright colors there were faces 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.220
 in the window watching the potatoes of 'no 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.860
 over and over again so that you never 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.950
 perfectly distinguish the crying 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.380
 followed throughout the second act the act 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.169
 3 started with a title specifying that 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.969
 a year had passed homero marge elisa 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.149
 they were skeletally thin 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:48.239
 still sitting at the table there was no trace 

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:50.939
 of magic the pets decided 

00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:53.249
 visit the grave of bart springfield 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:55.589
 it was totally deserted and while 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:58.319
 they walked through the cemetery the houses were 

00:04:55.589 --> 00:05:00.929
 they came back more and more of criticisms were 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:03.119
 abandoned when they reached the grave 

00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:03.629
 Bart's body was lying in front of 

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:05.699
 his grave 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:08.369
 looking like the end of the first 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:11.459
 act the family began to mourn 

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:14.099
 again they eventually stopped watching 

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:16.619
 fixed the corpse of bart the camera 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:18.689
 he focused on the homer face of 

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:21.149
 according to the summary of the homerous episode 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:23.339
 says a joke in this part but it is not 

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:26.309
 audible in the version that I saw can not be 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:28.409
 know what homero says the camera made a 

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:31.079
 panning when the episode was going to 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:33.089
 finish the graves in the background had 

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:35.849
 the names of each guest star to 

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:39.329
 the simpsons in them some that nobody 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:42.119
 he knew in 1989 some who had not 

00:05:39.329 --> 00:05:44.610
 been still in the show they all had 

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:46.679
 dates of death in them for those who 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.599
 they died since then 

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:50.579
 michael jackson and the george harrison 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:53.309
 dates indicated the day they died 

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:56.339
 the credits were silent and 

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:58.199
 the final image seemed handwritten 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:00.300
 was that of the simpson family in their 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.719
 armchair but all drawn so 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.789
 hyperrealistic similar to the corpse of park 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:08.009
 it occurred to me at first after seeing 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:09.899
 the episode that could use the tombs 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:11.789
 to predict the death of all 

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:14.039
 stars invited to the simpsons that 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:16.889
 they were still alive but there is something very strange 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:18.869
 with respect to those who have not died all 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.590
 their deaths are located in the same 

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:22.900
 date 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.730
 and well that has been the creepy pasta of 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.800
 today I hope you liked it if you 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.720
