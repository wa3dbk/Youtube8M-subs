00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.970

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.880
 legendary pokemon noticed three new 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.230
 legendary pokemon and this brothers 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:42.809
 Pokemon like this one 3a Pokemon 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:45.059
 report like if I do not confuse, and so 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.219
 here so let's consider them now 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:53.960
 Intel animation as always did not take 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:58.320
 Candy principle is always up 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.620
 take a candy and watch it very 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.719
 cool animation he then sits out then 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.710
 I do not know what to run in general 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:11.210
 cool 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:18.210
 this pokemon cool quick the same he 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:19.380
 fiery and spawn he won't even 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.200
 guess right away 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:31.680
 like he fingers the mountains m what is 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:35.130
 exactly they dance fingers care of extreme 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.530
 hills m 1 time per day so on 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.530
 Consider suyku on 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:46.920
 so let's remove so here is suyku 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:53.450
 2 legendary pokemon which of the finger 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.450
 we on how to say it lie down 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:07.500
 here he sleeps at night and by the way when you can 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.770
 fly on the same it can end 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.020
 either this pokemon or this is qigong or 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.030
 meadows either k yoga is very cool 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.980
 three pokemon in almost the same biome 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.910
 very cool and 3 pokemon 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.850
 closing our top three 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.060
 Raikova you are pretty cool 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.010
 pokemon cool animation cool all 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.630
 such a huge pokemon the biggest 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.280
 pokemon not see the counting Gordon 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.739
 animation 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.769
 they are like a tiger and they drink it 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:44.850
 especially more like a type 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:49.170
 so here's an animation and now let's 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:53.220
 look through to see their rider so 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:58.640
 first on strike principle such 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.030
 very cool diman what lion saber-toothed 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.050
 Saber-toothed tiger 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.400
 so further let's see the bag on 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.870
 it is also possible to ride on all three 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.100
 you can ride and I do not know for some reason 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.840
 the developers have decided so or 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.760
 it seems to me that he is slowly swimming in 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:23.590
 water compared to other pokemon 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:29.170
 raise edge slow swim so on 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:33.730
 we go here got hit so surf further 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.970
 we have intel here too 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.320
 I like pokemon too 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.430
 for this threesome i would choose 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.530
 either inter because he is big though 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.650
 no, I generally like everyone 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:52.720
 bitches trading time generally cool 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:56.280
 pokemons and not worth what it is for 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.500
 they made updates like this and 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.660
 actually all on pokemon and let's 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.310
 consider them carefully first 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.400
 pokemon in which we look at it 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.890
 ginormous fake kinar mouse 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.489
 it means no normal effect at all 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.280
 most 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.290
 it's the biggest size 5 7 and here it is 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.230
 such 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:21.160
 Intel goes further , in principle, I show 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.720
 to consider them start them very 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.930
 cool pokemon 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:32.050
 and raykov this way it is rack 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.330
 electric intel fiery and bath 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.500
 tavern 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:41.520
 Pokemon all now get down to giving birth I 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.520
 I do not know why I did not manage ore 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.880
 why it happened but the rues should have been 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.940
 change to another altogether as they 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.580
 should have been different just here 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:05:00.820
 such other they should have a texture 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:04.180
 and this is my way she should have 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:08.430
 different texture basically that's all 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:11.620
 pebbles and chest and now proceed to 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.470
 coaches added 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.810
 I do not know what it is exactly what it is 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.810
 so let's see 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.050
 wolcott floor and then 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:29.509
 for some 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:44.670
 Well, in principle, I do not know what you are 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:48.160
 added to these but here's the coach 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:51.130
 I know for sure that you can give the name of the night 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:57.610
 for example if you mine already have 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:06:01.960
 the night here is also one goal all mikroft 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:04.990
 of at all at all minecraft night 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:08.190
 it's like my practice itself 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.600
 The texture is such and that's the principle when 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:16.680
 writing this command with us this night 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:16.680
 I do not know why this is but oh well 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.730
 so then we will try to Santa that hang up 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:31.250
 why are you so let's look again 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:36.890
 maybe something again and missed so 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:40.190
 come on come on come out so santa and that 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:43.040
 we push santa and nothing basically he 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:47.630
 she looks at we can not fight him 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:50.780
 and this is just buying a pussy from which 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:53.750
 it is impossible to fight even with such 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.960
 fight to no why at all with 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:59.350
 pokemon on the trainer can not fight 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:01.690
 strange it is very strange but oh well 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:04.340
 so that's it 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.470
 the following is our evolutionary stone 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.560
 new stone evolution of taut stone 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:12.530
 he crafts out of nine shards as usual 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.290
 a revolution stone like this 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.510
 kravets and we get downton he 

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.530
 need for an evolutionary pokemon though 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:23.300
 there are not a few of them 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:25.370
 Namely, I do not remember who like ralf yet 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:29.440
 someone and by the way, I did not say where 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.560
 spawns raikov and rekovye we have prickly heat 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.330
 savannah 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.360
 No, I will not even check for sure 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:37.640
 know us savannah memory and i think that 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.850
 in our series of my word try 

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.290
 at least stop and with you was a hedgehog rex 

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:47.230
 subscribe to my channel put 

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:47.230
 likes to offer these under the video to everyone for now
