for is to click the analyze button which
analyzed<00:00:18.000> how<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.270> image<00:00:18.540> was<00:00:18.870> product<00:00:19.320> first

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:19.530 
analyzed how the image was product first

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.250 
analyzed how the image was product first
place<00:00:19.860> this<00:00:20.760> isn't<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.600> terms<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:22.050> have

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
place this isn't the terms I have

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.790 
place this isn't the terms I have
anything<00:00:22.529> under<00:00:22.800> hood<00:00:23.190> which<00:00:23.510> involves<00:00:24.510> some

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
anything under hood which involves some

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
intensive computation and I won't try to

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.550 
intensive computation and I won't try to
explain<00:00:27.900> here<00:00:28.580> the<00:00:29.580> output<00:00:29.790> of<00:00:30.419> this<00:00:30.660> step<00:00:30.990> is

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
explain here the output of this step is

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.920 
explain here the output of this step is
something<00:00:32.160> we<00:00:32.340> call<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.579> blur<00:00:32.910> kernel<00:00:33.329> which

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
something we call a blur kernel which

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.200 
something we call a blur kernel which
you<00:00:34.200> will<00:00:34.440> see<00:00:34.470> in<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.829> moment<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> kind

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
you will see in a moment this is a kind

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.150 
you will see in a moment this is a kind
of<00:00:36.329> slow<00:00:36.600> computer<00:00:37.140> Allah<00:00:37.710> there<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.989> it's

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
of slow computer Allah there it is it's

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.590 
of slow computer Allah there it is it's
essentially<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.340> grayscale<00:00:41.910> images<00:00:42.329> showing

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
essentially a grayscale images showing

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.590 
essentially a grayscale images showing
how<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.260> image<00:00:43.620> was<00:00:43.860> not<00:00:44.130> formally<00:00:44.970> is<00:00:45.270> called

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
how the image was not formally is called

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.570 
how the image was not formally is called
point<00:00:45.870> spread<00:00:46.230> function<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.400> also

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
point spread function but you can also

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.270 
point spread function but you can also
view<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.120> as<00:00:48.330> a<00:00:48.500> motion<00:00:49.500> trajectory<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
view it as a motion trajectory of the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.120 
view it as a motion trajectory of the
camera<00:00:50.790> when<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> shutter<00:00:51.690> was<00:00:51.900> open<00:00:52.050> as<00:00:52.410> a

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
camera when the shutter was open as a

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.850 
camera when the shutter was open as a
lexan<00:00:53.700> next<00:00:54.210> thing<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.540> do<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:55.350> use<00:00:55.590> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
lexan next thing to do is to be use it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:14.429 
lexan next thing to do is to be use it
to<00:00:56.220> restore<00:00:56.640> shopping<00:00:57.980> and<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.910> is

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.590 

and<00:01:15.439> similarly<00:01:16.280> we<00:01:16.520> can<00:01:16.700> define<00:01:16.729> another

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
and similarly we can define another

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.929 
and similarly we can define another
preview<00:01:18.170> window<00:01:18.409> which<00:01:19.220> allows<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:19.880> to

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
preview window which allows you to

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.609 
preview window which allows you to
preview<00:01:20.360> look<00:01:20.960> who<00:01:21.579> sought<00:01:23.170> to<00:01:24.170> see<00:01:24.350> if<00:01:24.409> it<00:01:24.590> is

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
preview look who sought to see if it is

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:37.130 
preview look who sought to see if it is
good

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.890 

you<00:01:37.680> two<00:01:37.920> guys<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.490> should<00:01:38.580> do<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.720> bad

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
you two guys you should do that it's bad

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.260 
you two guys you should do that it's bad
so<00:01:40.380> let's<00:01:40.560> see<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:43.909> because<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.240> a

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
so let's see it because this is a

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.570 
so let's see it because this is a
relatively<00:01:45.869> small<00:01:45.990> image<00:01:46.440> so<00:01:46.800> I'm<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.369> going

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
relatively small image so I'm just going

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.090 
relatively small image so I'm just going
to<00:01:47.869> steal<00:01:48.869> anything<00:01:49.200> too<00:01:49.470> low<00:01:49.650> to<00:01:49.710> pro

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
to steal anything too low to pro

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.190 
to steal anything too low to pro
interest<00:01:52.160> okay<00:01:53.160> I'm<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.460> gonna<00:01:54.200> analyze

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
interest okay I'm just gonna analyze

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.740 
interest okay I'm just gonna analyze
this<00:01:55.560> image<00:01:55.890> which<00:01:56.880> should<00:01:57.150> be<00:01:57.270> quick<00:01:57.450> fast

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
this image which should be quick fast

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:08.980 
this image which should be quick fast
and<00:01:59.810> destroyed<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.710> can<00:02:01.890> see

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.230 

thank<00:02:09.990> you

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.240
