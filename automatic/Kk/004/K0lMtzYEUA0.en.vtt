goals<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:27.140> think<00:02:27.860> we<00:02:28.010> should<00:02:28.040> have<00:02:28.310> made

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
goals and I think we should have made

goals and I think we should have made
that<00:02:28.519> that's<00:02:29.000> that's<00:02:29.269> not<00:02:29.570> at<00:02:29.900> six<00:02:30.200> going<00:02:30.470> and

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
that that's that's not at six going and

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.430
