another riveting video it's very
riveting<00:00:09.860> today<00:00:10.850> we're<00:00:11.750> going<00:00:11.840> to<00:00:11.930> talk<00:00:12.139> about

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:12.790 
riveting today we're going to talk about

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.400 
riveting today we're going to talk about
fancy<00:00:13.790> ribbits<00:00:14.269> nail<00:00:15.140> heads<00:00:15.610> bald<00:00:16.610> rivets<00:00:17.060> and

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
fancy ribbits nail heads bald rivets and

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.890 
fancy ribbits nail heads bald rivets and
pattern<00:00:18.410> rivets<00:00:18.770> how<00:00:19.460> to<00:00:19.520> make<00:00:19.760> them<00:00:19.970> and<00:00:20.720> it's

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
pattern rivets how to make them and it's

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.030 
pattern rivets how to make them and it's
very<00:00:20.990> exciting

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040 
very exciting

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.370 
very exciting
okay<00:00:22.790> so<00:00:22.849> briefly<00:00:23.480> talking<00:00:24.050> about<00:00:24.290> the

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
okay so briefly talking about the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.370 
okay so briefly talking about the
difference<00:00:24.770> in<00:00:25.070> the<00:00:25.910> types<00:00:26.180> of<00:00:26.329> wire<00:00:26.570> this<00:00:27.140> is

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
difference in the types of wire this is

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.790 
difference in the types of wire this is
from<00:00:28.180> sterling<00:00:29.180> silver<00:00:29.210> this<00:00:29.869> is<00:00:30.079> fine<00:00:30.320> silver

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
from sterling silver this is fine silver

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.910 
from sterling silver this is fine silver
and<00:00:31.009> then<00:00:31.550> that's<00:00:31.730> copper<00:00:32.300> you<00:00:32.810> can<00:00:32.989> see<00:00:33.350> the

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
and then that's copper you can see the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.910 
and then that's copper you can see the
fine<00:00:34.579> silver<00:00:34.850> makes<00:00:35.329> a<00:00:35.480> really<00:00:35.870> smooth<00:00:36.380> shiny

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
fine silver makes a really smooth shiny

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.110 
fine silver makes a really smooth shiny
ball<00:00:38.230> this<00:00:39.230> sterling<00:00:39.590> is<00:00:39.980> kind<00:00:40.340> of<00:00:40.430> lumpy<00:00:40.850> and

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
ball this sterling is kind of lumpy and

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.750 
ball this sterling is kind of lumpy and
same<00:00:41.809> with<00:00:42.019> the<00:00:42.109> copper<00:00:42.500> but<00:00:42.859> if<00:00:43.340> that's<00:00:43.489> what

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
same with the copper but if that's what

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.400 
same with the copper but if that's what
you<00:00:43.879> have<00:00:44.059> or<00:00:44.239> you<00:00:44.329> need<00:00:44.600> you're<00:00:45.230> going<00:00:45.260> to

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
you have to do is ball is whoops pull

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.509 
you have to do is ball is whoops pull
this<00:00:52.339> wire<00:00:52.609> up<00:00:52.940> you<00:00:53.570> want<00:00:53.750> it<00:00:53.870> straight<00:00:54.079> so<00:00:54.649> we

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
this wire up you want it straight so we

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:57.189 
this wire up you want it straight so we
talked<00:00:55.760> about<00:00:55.850> this<00:00:56.059> in<00:00:56.210> another<00:00:56.300> video<00:00:56.839> I

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
talked about this in another video I

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.540 
talked about this in another video I
will<00:00:57.679> show<00:00:57.890> you<00:00:57.949> again<00:00:58.579> you<00:00:59.510> need<00:01:00.109> to<00:01:00.230> roll<00:01:00.410> it

will show you again you need to roll it

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.579 
will show you again you need to roll it
to<00:01:01.550> flap<00:01:01.850> it<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:02.300> make<00:01:02.510> it<00:01:02.539> nice<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:02.870> straight

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
and I don't put when I heat these up I

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.610 
and I don't put when I heat these up I
don't<00:01:17.600> want<00:01:17.720> to<00:01:17.780> eat<00:01:17.840> them<00:01:17.900> on<00:01:18.050> the<00:01:18.170> tip<00:01:18.380> like

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
don't want to eat them on the tip like

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.850 
don't want to eat them on the tip like
that<00:01:18.830> i<00:01:19.070> heat<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:19.880> little<00:01:20.120> above<00:01:20.800> try<00:01:21.800> to

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
that i heat it a little above try to

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.310 
that i heat it a little above try to
keep<00:01:22.070> it<00:01:22.220> level<00:01:22.400> and<00:01:22.670> try<00:01:22.910> to<00:01:22.970> ensure<00:01:23.300> that<00:01:24.200> you

have<00:01:24.350> a<00:01:24.500> nice<00:01:24.740> evenly<00:01:25.340> centered<00:01:25.910> spaced<00:01:26.450> ball

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
have a nice evenly centered spaced ball

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.140 
have a nice evenly centered spaced ball
okay<00:01:27.500> so<00:01:27.560> that's<00:01:27.980> done<00:01:28.490> I<00:01:28.520> dropped<00:01:28.970> it

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
okay so that's done I dropped it

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.690 
okay so that's done I dropped it
quenched<00:01:29.540> it<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:30.130> Wow

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
quenched it and Wow

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.360 
quenched it and Wow
there<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:31.970> is<00:01:32.090> so<00:01:32.810> we're<00:01:33.650> going<00:01:33.800> to<00:01:33.860> take<00:01:34.070> this

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
there it is so we're going to take this

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.660 
there it is so we're going to take this
little<00:01:35.210> balled<00:01:35.600> up<00:01:36.100> thing<00:01:37.100> that<00:01:37.310> will<00:01:37.430> someday

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
little balled up thing that will someday

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.390 
little balled up thing that will someday
be<00:01:37.940> a<00:01:37.970> rivet<00:01:38.360> and<00:01:38.630> we're<00:01:38.990> going<00:01:39.290> to<00:01:39.560> put<00:01:40.250> it

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
be a rivet and we're going to put it

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.780 
be a rivet and we're going to put it
into<00:01:40.550> either<00:01:41.270> a<00:01:41.930> draw<00:01:42.710> plate<00:01:43.040> a<00:01:43.250> wire<00:01:43.520> draw

hardware<00:01:54.500> store<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.840> what<00:01:57.590> I<00:01:57.620> do<00:01:57.740> is<00:01:57.980> I<00:01:58.100> flip

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
hardware store and what I do is I flip

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.650 
hardware store and what I do is I flip
it<00:01:58.340> over<00:01:58.490> on<00:01:58.730> the<00:01:58.820> back<00:01:59.030> because<00:01:59.210> I<00:01:59.390> don't<00:01:59.540> want

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
it over on the back because I don't want

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.990 
it over on the back because I don't want
to<00:01:59.750> accidentally<00:02:00.440> pick<00:02:00.620> up<00:02:00.800> any<00:02:00.980> printing<00:02:01.580> and

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
to accidentally pick up any printing and

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.270 
to accidentally pick up any printing and
I'm<00:02:02.360> going<00:02:02.480> to<00:02:02.540> find<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:02.960> hole<00:02:03.140> that<00:02:03.380> closes

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
I'm going to find the hole that closes

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.540 
I'm going to find the hole that closes
sleep<00:02:04.670> closest<00:02:05.270> ly<00:02:05.450> closest<00:02:06.350> fits<00:02:07.420> closest<00:02:09.550> so

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
sleep closest ly closest fits closest so

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.490 
sleep closest ly closest fits closest so
now<00:02:10.819> see<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:11.150> is<00:02:11.360> this<00:02:11.629> is<00:02:11.690> totally<00:02:12.080> cool<00:02:12.260> you

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
this now you could make a rivet of AD

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.160 
this now you could make a rivet of AD
out<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:22.970> this<00:02:23.120> at<00:02:23.300> this<00:02:23.600> point<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.380> I<00:02:24.890> actually

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
out of this at this point and I actually

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.820 
out of this at this point and I actually
had<00:02:27.170> an<00:02:27.440> example<00:02:28.130> out<00:02:28.430> there<00:02:28.730> I<00:02:29.620> don't<00:02:30.620> know<00:02:30.770> if

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
had an example out there I don't know if

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.809 
had an example out there I don't know if
you<00:02:30.920> can<00:02:31.070> see<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:31.550> but<00:02:31.760> there<00:02:32.000> is<00:02:32.210> a<00:02:32.540> ball

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
you can see that but there is a ball

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.390 
you can see that but there is a ball
rivet<00:02:35.080> with<00:02:36.080> an<00:02:36.230> unfinished<00:02:36.620> piece<00:02:36.980> but

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
rivet with an unfinished piece but

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.340 
rivet with an unfinished piece but
anyway<00:02:38.330> so<00:02:38.390> what<00:02:38.660> I'm<00:02:38.750> going<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:38.930> do<00:02:39.080> now<00:02:39.200> is

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
anyway so what I'm going to do now is

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.170 
anyway so what I'm going to do now is
I'm<00:02:39.440> going<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.590> flatten<00:02:39.830> it<00:02:40.010> so<00:02:40.190> I'm<00:02:40.280> basically

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
I'm going to flatten it so I'm basically

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.330 
I'm going to flatten it so I'm basically
making<00:02:41.300> a<00:02:41.720> little<00:02:41.870> nail<00:02:42.110> head<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:43.220> I'm

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
making a little nail head and I'm

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.400 
making a little nail head and I'm
turning<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:43.940> because<00:02:44.240> we<00:02:44.390> do<00:02:44.600> not<00:02:44.750> hit<00:02:45.020> even

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
turning it because we do not hit even

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.850 
turning it because we do not hit even
like<00:02:46.600> some<00:02:47.600> of<00:02:47.720> us<00:02:47.840> don't<00:02:47.990> even<00:02:48.110> hit<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.680> nail

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
like some of us don't even hit the nail

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.880 
like some of us don't even hit the nail
on<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.100> head<00:02:50.290> I'm<00:02:51.290> going<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.560> just<00:02:51.740> keep

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
on the head I'm going to just keep

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.590 
on the head I'm going to just keep

project clean that up a little bit but I
have<00:05:06.160> just<00:05:06.400> created<00:05:06.790> a<00:05:07.330> screw<00:05:08.280> looking<00:05:09.280> rivet

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
have just created a screw looking rivet

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.190 
have just created a screw looking rivet
now<00:05:11.800> this<00:05:12.010> rivet<00:05:12.430> will<00:05:12.880> be<00:05:13.060> set<00:05:13.330> just<00:05:13.660> like<00:05:13.780> you

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
now this rivet will be set just like you

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.820 
now this rivet will be set just like you
would<00:05:14.380> set<00:05:14.710> a<00:05:15.030> regular<00:05:16.030> standard<00:05:16.540> rivet<00:05:16.960> the

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
would set a regular standard rivet the

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.100 
would set a regular standard rivet the
back<00:05:18.280> it<00:05:18.580> goes<00:05:18.760> through<00:05:19.060> you<00:05:19.690> know<00:05:19.810> you<00:05:19.900> take

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
back it goes through you know you take

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.250 
back it goes through you know you take
it<00:05:20.290> put<00:05:20.470> it<00:05:20.560> through<00:05:20.740> your<00:05:20.830> hole<00:05:22.050> trim<00:05:23.050> off

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
it put it through your hole trim off

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.940 
it put it through your hole trim off
leave<00:05:23.530> a<00:05:23.560> one<00:05:23.800> millimeter<00:05:24.040> here<00:05:24.880> clip<00:05:25.360> it<00:05:25.540> and

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
leave a one millimeter here clip it and

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.500 
leave a one millimeter here clip it and
Hammer<00:05:26.950> it<00:05:27.100> flat<00:05:27.400> this<00:05:27.730> end<00:05:28.000> you<00:05:28.090> just<00:05:28.120> don't

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
Hammer it flat this end you just don't

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.150 
Hammer it flat this end you just don't
have<00:05:28.600> to<00:05:28.750> hammer<00:05:29.020> it<00:05:29.320> so<00:05:29.530> it's<00:05:29.800> a<00:05:29.919> little

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
have to hammer it so it's a little

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.280 
have to hammer it so it's a little
simpler<00:05:30.580> of<00:05:30.730> a<00:05:30.850> rivet<00:05:31.180> and<00:05:31.360> then<00:05:31.840> I<00:05:31.870> would<00:05:32.110> go

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
simpler of a rivet and then I would go

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.110 
simpler of a rivet and then I would go
ahead<00:05:32.320> and<00:05:32.560> take<00:05:32.740> sandpaper<00:05:33.430> and<00:05:33.700> clean<00:05:33.970> the

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
ahead and take sandpaper and clean the

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.280 
ahead and take sandpaper and clean the
surface<00:05:34.480> up<00:05:34.630> because<00:05:34.780> it<00:05:34.900> will<00:05:34.960> be<00:05:35.110> a<00:05:35.140> little

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
surface up because it will be a little

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.920 
surface up because it will be a little
marred<00:05:35.620> from<00:05:35.980> being<00:05:36.480> backside<00:05:37.480> of<00:05:37.630> it<00:05:37.720> being

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
marred from being backside of it being

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.470

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
little holes now I would use this

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.900 
little holes now I would use this
something<00:06:35.190> like<00:06:35.340> this<00:06:36.650> as<00:06:37.650> the<00:06:38.220> center<00:06:38.490> of<00:06:38.820> a

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
something like this as the center of a

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:53.870 
something like this as the center of a
flower<00:06:39.650> actually<00:06:40.650> show<00:06:40.920> you<00:06:41.990> this<00:06:42.990> off<00:06:52.880> there

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 
flower actually show you this off there

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.350 
flower actually show you this off there
we<00:06:53.970> go

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
we go

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.020 
we go
and<00:06:54.450> then<00:06:55.380> I<00:06:55.500> would<00:06:55.650> rivet<00:06:55.950> it<00:06:56.160> to<00:06:56.640> whatever<00:06:56.820> I

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
and then I would rivet it to whatever I

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.960 
and then I would rivet it to whatever I
was<00:06:57.300> going<00:06:57.870> to<00:06:58.320> rivet<00:06:58.560> it<00:06:58.650> to<00:06:58.800> but<00:06:59.430> you<00:06:59.880> know

00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.970 
was going to rivet it to but you know

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.090 
was going to rivet it to but you know
it's<00:07:00.090> kind<00:07:00.270> of<00:07:00.330> looks<00:07:00.510> to<00:07:00.780> me<00:07:00.900> like<00:07:00.930> the<00:07:01.350> the

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 
it's kind of looks to me like the the

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.160 
it's kind of looks to me like the the
center<00:07:02.400> of<00:07:02.520> a<00:07:02.580> flower<00:07:02.730> so<00:07:03.480> that's<00:07:03.720> just<00:07:03.870> what

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.170 
center of a flower so that's just what

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.230
