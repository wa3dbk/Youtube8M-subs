 star and unlocked when mario e 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.509
 luigi created a new blend of 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.070
 coffee the characters would be due 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.649
 appear to taste the new ones 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.570
 creations in various scenes captain oils 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.520
 marta pikmin arrived and labeled 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.460
 mario as a strange life form of 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.860
 mario name an anagram of olimar then 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.160
 exchanges louis for some threat e 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.660
 a horde of pikmin launches into the attack 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.109
 mario says the drink sucks and is 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.940
 in debt to bar samus fills her own 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.160
 energy tanks with the mixture of 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.870
 link brothers got lost and recovered 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.969
 seeing coffee instead of using one 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.920
 fairy maybe mcloud and receives one 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.079
 called by sledges he was in need 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.879
 helpful and finally an excitebike pilot 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.789
 makes a big mess getting into the way 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.920
 even give gad was present and everyone gave you 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.659
 would have given a special object one 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.460
 ultraviolet lamp from every sea 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.980
 of wario money from samus energy 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.320
 a link strengthens a fox ring 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.860
 a suspension from the excitebike pilot 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.540
 and a game boy from and gad the scenes are not 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.890
 have never been implemented without any 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.979
 explanation perhaps because they incited 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.050
 caffeine in a game for children but le 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.030
 other suspensions force the money ring 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.409
 the game boy remained in the 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.409
 game without changes 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.460
 if you played super mario sunshine 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.900
 you will come across this guy 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.479
 at least a couple of times 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.280
 he is the pian tissimo a masked man 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.140
 by the inhabitants of the area that challenges 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.759
 mario in some races around the city is 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.680
 very similar to cuba the quick by mario 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.330
 64 and also looks like another 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.890
 nintendo character 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.869
 if you know it was the game and it is removed 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.759
 the mask will reveal that the pian 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.979
 is really the runner of 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.630
 ocarina of time or the corset of marjoram 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.630
 unmask you comparisons 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.119
 in the episode dedicated to supermario will 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.590
 be what has a series of pit and online 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.690
 of the president of nintendo satoru 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.849
 iwata shigeru miyamoto has revealed that 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.250
 the super mario 64 would be due to us 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.810
 be a cooperative split mode 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.880
 screen players could move 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.489
 independently for the castle of 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.470
 beach in the code there is something left if it is 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.510
 connected the second joystiq can 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.250
 check the camera while pc yes 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.480
 congratulates mario and during the titles 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.830
 of tail 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.470
 it was thought that the cooperative mode 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.840
 would have arrived on the super mario 64 2 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.810
 intended for peripheral bankruptcy 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.940
 nintendo 64 disk drive the device 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.860
 he played the games on cd instead of 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.569
 on cartridges but was never released at 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.340
 outside Japan due to failure 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.650
 productivity and for the few sales that 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.890
 made in the Japanese land of super 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.120
 mario 64 2 there is only one of which was not 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.310
 never released to the public 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.290
 the only certain information is that louis 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.569
 would have appeared in the game 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.430
 luigi appears in super mario 64 of s 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.739
 so it is possible that there were others 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.400
 super mario ideas 64 2 reworked for 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.950
 the ds version another thing 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.540
 interesting on the super mario 64 and that 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.370
 was conceived as a game for 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.350
 super nintendo would have used one 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.269
 more advanced version of food exceeded 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.340
 ex who used star fox and doom 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.870
 but the idea was then transported to the 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.269
 next console from home nintendo 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.250
 super mario indeed defines what 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.260
 the new console was the lever 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.269
 analog used to maximize the 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.670
 3d movement and messes for 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.350
 check the visual it looks like it is 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.940
 state 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.010
 miyamoto of a free play 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.100
 fixed cameras to move the game from 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.510
 super nintendo at nintendo 64 and beyond 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.510
 wanting a more powerful processor 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.300
 plus the voice of ox are the voice 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.300
 speeded up bowser 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.790
 there are many super Mario RPGs 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.349
 differences between the northern version 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.120
 American and Japanese 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.129
 one of these is the final exultation 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.870
 of boozer in america is different from that 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:08.330
 Japanese for showing a strange one 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.709
 gesture with a half-bent arm and la 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.450
 hand of the other leaning arm 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.549
 in the hollow of the folded one that in 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.260
 west means ecate use for a 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.419
 another difference is that after speaking 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.280
 with the registrar for the first time if 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.930
 you look behind the path in the room 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.520
 of the princess tod's tool will be found 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.919
 youtube on the question mark 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.900
 question mark question point then 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.639
 your grandmother will come and bribe us for 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.740
 stop us from looking if once 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.930
 when it reaches the group it will return to look 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.639
 the princess will get angry in the 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.930
 Japanese version where the princess 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.020
 it's called pitch 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.510
 the object is named the pitch xxx 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.639
 the letters have been changed for obvious reasons 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.220
 reasons you will never find that object 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.870
 was neither in nor out of the game but 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.410
 it doesn't take long to figure out what 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.479
 could be for this time is everything 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.030
