as you can see in the the image here the
video<00:03:39.060> here<00:03:39.390> that<00:03:39.420> they're<00:03:39.959> both<00:03:41.060> effectively

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
video here that they're both effectively

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.250 
video here that they're both effectively
the<00:03:42.299> same<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:45.030> really<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.660> only<00:03:45.810> difference

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
the same the really the only difference

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.830 
the same the really the only difference
between<00:03:46.379> the<00:03:46.739> two<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:47.299> really<00:03:48.299> really<00:03:48.540> wish<00:03:48.660> you

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
between the two I really really wish you

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.119 
between the two I really really wish you
wouldn't<00:03:49.019> turn<00:03:49.170> her<00:03:49.349> back<00:03:49.500> I'm<00:03:49.799> trying<00:03:49.980> to

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
wouldn't turn her back I'm trying to

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.360 
wouldn't turn her back I'm trying to
like<00:03:50.280> look<00:03:50.370> at<00:03:50.489> both<00:03:50.670> of<00:03:50.700> them<00:03:50.940> from<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.180> front

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
like look at both of them from the front

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.759 
like look at both of them from the front
typical<00:03:53.370> so<00:03:54.269> as<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:55.019> can<00:03:55.110> see<00:03:55.170> really<00:03:55.680> the

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
typical so as you can see really the

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.640 
typical so as you can see really the
only<00:03:56.040> difference<00:03:56.370> is<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.750> S<00:03:57.900> on<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.319> chest

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
only difference is the S on the chest

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.960 
only difference is the S on the chest
and<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.090> belts<00:04:00.920> otherwise<00:04:01.920> it's<00:04:02.400> basically

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
and the belts otherwise it's basically

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.110 
and the belts otherwise it's basically
the<00:04:03.450> same<00:04:03.630> character<00:04:04.139> so<00:04:05.010> fortunately<00:04:06.000> it

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
the same character so fortunately it

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.129 
the same character so fortunately it
doesn't<00:04:06.299> take<00:04:06.569> up<00:04:06.720> two<00:04:06.900> character<00:04:07.380> slots

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
doesn't take up two character slots

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:14.449 
doesn't take up two character slots
because<00:04:10.139> that<00:04:10.440> would<00:04:10.560> be<00:04:10.709> fairly<00:04:11.310> useless<00:04:13.459> but

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
because that would be fairly useless but

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.029 
because that would be fairly useless but
yeah<00:04:14.609> I<00:04:14.639> mean<00:04:14.910> you<00:04:15.329> can't<00:04:15.599> really<00:04:16.039> complain

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
yeah I mean you can't really complain

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.310 
yeah I mean you can't really complain
all<00:04:17.459> that<00:04:17.760> much<00:04:17.940> because<00:04:18.269> it's<00:04:18.750> only<00:04:18.900> taking

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
all that much because it's only taking

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.560 
all that much because it's only taking
one<00:04:19.590> character<00:04:20.070> slot

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
one character slot

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.280 
one character slot
so<00:04:22.570> I<00:04:22.600> digress<00:04:24.180> she<00:04:25.180> obviously<00:04:25.390> shoots<00:04:25.840> lasers

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
so I digress she obviously shoots lasers

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.690 
so I digress she obviously shoots lasers
