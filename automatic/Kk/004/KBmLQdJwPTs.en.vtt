00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.200
 Rhinoceros shield drop test 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.720
 I wandered around the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.200
 Followed by Yahoo shooting group 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.540
 Someone has walked over and said: 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.940
 "David Bogg! David Bog! You must check out our new products!!" 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.940
 I said, "Hey... it’s not very convenient now." 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.560
 He said, "No, no, no, no, no! This is the latest and most embarrassing rhinoceros shield impact-resistant frame shell" 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.620
 I said, "Hehehe... Do you know that these things are everywhere now?" 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.420
 No need~ Thank you for pinching 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.520
 He said: "Slightly wait! This is a successful case of Kickstarter! 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.140
 This is really amazing!!! I show it to you~" 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.800
 Then he started to frantically knock on the wall like this in front of us. 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.840
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.440
 Then he started to throw his mobile phone to the ground like this again. 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.177
 Touch! Touch! 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.320
 All of us are super dumb 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.100
 I want to say that the screen must be broken. 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.754
 He has always said that this is a successful case on Kickstarter. 

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:47.594
 From 20 miles to the concrete floor (closed ~) 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.060
 Honeycomb egg drop technology is super der~ 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.060
 I said, "Okay~ Send me a frame shell for you. 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.140
 It is best to have a mobile phone too~ 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.500
 I won't take my own mobile phone adventure. 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.220
 I will try it out~" 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.860
 Then I put on the shatter-resistant shell 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.580
 Start to drop the phone from the chest height 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.240
 once 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.033
 Again 

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:06.853
 I’ve been throwing it all the time. 

00:01:06.853 --> 00:01:08.013
 Nothing is wrong~ 

00:01:08.013 --> 00:01:09.673
 Then from the height of the head... 

00:01:09.673 --> 00:01:10.713
 BOOOOOOM 

00:01:10.713 --> 00:01:11.557
 Still nothing~ 

00:01:11.557 --> 00:01:13.116
 Then higher than my head... 

00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:15.116
 Higher~ 

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:17.116
 Higher higher~ 

00:01:17.116 --> 00:01:18.896
 ~~~~~~ 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.260
 Touch ~~~~~~~ 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.400
 Wow~~ This thing is too embarrassing!!!!!!! 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.340
 They said it was a patented plastic. 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.600
 The effect achieved by combining with the internal honeycomb structure 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.960
 The anti-drop shell adds a certain seismic thickness to the front and rear surfaces of the mobile phone. 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.038
 This makes people feel a little unbelievable 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.980
 But obviously 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.160
 The only way to make your phone screen burst 

00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:39.525
 That is, the mobile phone screen faces the stone and falls to the top. 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.700
 Finally~ I am successful. 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.177
 From your height of 15 miles, use your hands to do your best to drop your phone down. 

00:02:06.677 --> 00:02:08.677
 "Although I did not break the screen. 

00:02:08.677 --> 00:02:10.237
 But I made the phone slightly bent. 

00:02:10.237 --> 00:02:11.421
 So how to calculate the microphone? ” 

00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:11.994
 Ok~ 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.160
 Consumer Electronics Show crazy show PR Mr.~ 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.020
 I have to say: 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.760
 Your rhinoceros shield impact-resistant frame shell 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.540
 Is all the protective shells I have seen. 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.180
 Provides super incredible protection with minimal volume 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.060
 You won it~
