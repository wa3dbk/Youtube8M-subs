language and I think we were fortunate
enough<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.550> make<00:00:20.670> our<00:00:20.850> mark<00:00:21.119> enough<00:00:21.990> times

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
enough to make our mark enough times

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.140 
enough to make our mark enough times
that<00:00:22.680> people<00:00:22.800> think<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.340> body<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.760> work<00:00:23.970> they

that people think the body of work they

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.640 
that people think the body of work they
don't<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.420> think<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.689> one<00:00:24.900> song<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.500> we've

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
rewarding over 43 years really now that

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.139 
rewarding over 43 years really now that
the<00:00:37.739> songs<00:00:38.010> really<00:00:38.550> are<00:00:38.670> what<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.000> all<00:00:39.120> about

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the songs really are what it's all about

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.750 
the songs really are what it's all about
I<00:00:39.450> mean<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:39.960> wrote<00:00:40.920> them<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.280> produce<00:00:41.520> them

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
I mean we wrote them and produce them

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.430 
I mean we wrote them and produce them
but<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.090> seems<00:00:42.270> like<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.570> music<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> melodies

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
but it seems like the music the melodies

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.799 
but it seems like the music the melodies
are<00:00:43.649> what<00:00:43.820> continually<00:00:44.820> draw<00:00:44.969> people<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.660> and

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
are what continually draw people in and

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.049 
are what continually draw people in and
we're<00:00:46.500> very<00:00:46.680> fortunate<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.640> has<00:00:47.850> gone

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
we're very fortunate that it has gone

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.420 
we're very fortunate that it has gone
around<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> world<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:49.129> two<00:00:50.129> or<00:00:50.280> three

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
around the world and two or three

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.340 
around the world and two or three
generations<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.239> know<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.570> seems<00:00:51.840> like<00:00:52.110> we

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
generations you know it seems like we

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.380 
generations you know it seems like we
see<00:00:52.559> families<00:00:53.309> with<00:00:53.489> their<00:00:53.730> grandchildren

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
see families with their grandchildren

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.080 
see families with their grandchildren
who<00:00:54.809> grew<00:00:55.050> up<00:00:55.199> with<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.559> music<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.910> we're

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
who grew up with the music and so we're

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.330 
who grew up with the music and so we're
very<00:00:57.120> very<00:00:57.840> fortunate<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.770> way<00:00:58.920> does<00:00:59.280> it

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340

the music and I think we don't take that

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.760 
the music and I think we don't take that
for<00:01:32.880> granted<00:01:32.939> do<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.840> both<00:01:34.140> continue<00:01:34.350> to

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
yeah I mean this takes up a lot of our

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.149 
yeah I mean this takes up a lot of our
time<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.150> do<00:01:39.270> about<00:01:39.600> 100<00:01:40.079> shows<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.320> year<00:01:40.650> which

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
time we do about 100 shows a year which

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.520 
time we do about 100 shows a year which
works<00:01:41.430> out<00:01:41.670> at<00:01:41.820> about<00:01:41.880> 200<00:01:42.420> days<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.689> travel<00:01:43.049> so

works out at about 200 days of travel so

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.109 
works out at about 200 days of travel so
although<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.860> could<00:01:44.220> run<00:01:44.490> those<00:01:44.640> numbers<00:01:44.820> and

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
although you could run those numbers and

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.389 
although you could run those numbers and
say<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.299> got<00:01:45.479> 150<00:01:46.170> days<00:01:46.350> off<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.799> lot<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.280> that

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
say you got 150 days off a lot of that

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.880 
say you got 150 days off a lot of that
is<00:01:47.549> spent<00:01:47.670> sleeping<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.420> recovery<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.710> a

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
is spent sleeping and recovery so it's a

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.740 
is spent sleeping and recovery so it's a
little<00:01:50.189> harder<00:01:50.399> than<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.579> used<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.820> be<00:01:50.970> and

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
little harder than it used to be and

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.499 
little harder than it used to be and
then<00:01:51.899> finally<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.399> particular<00:01:54.210> song

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
then finally I is this particular song

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.270 
then finally I is this particular song
over<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.899> years<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.350> means<00:01:55.680> something<00:01:56.130> to
