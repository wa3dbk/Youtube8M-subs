00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 So the foam generator that I collected myself 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.770
 that is, its cost is around 100 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.230
 dollars cost me if available 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.360
 naturally 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.960
 compressor after long scans on 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.500
 the internet 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.240
 nothing sensible nothing sensible 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:24.660
 decided by trial and error 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:27.800
 here is designed please pen 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.980
 generator compressor air supply 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.349
 here 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.320
 Receiver in the receiver is foaming agent 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:42.469
 shuffle with water all let's see 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:50.329
 the action of it so the fluid starts 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:50.329
 Volga went to form 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.219
 here you are 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.840
 Who works 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.840
 fine 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.600
 that is, do not need expensive 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:13.330
 foam generators buy it not especially 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.330
 not necessarily everything is great 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:24.399
 working on a simple sect went on pi on 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:24.399
 chuck simple mesh dishwashing 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.970
 anyone interested write for 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:44.900
 symbolic charge drawings 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:47.170
 google will send the need to adjust 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.170
 a little bit 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.550
 abundant foam 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.270
 of course 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.569
 I can't measure 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.890
 don't understand 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.890
 measure coco drunk gives 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.730
 apparently all
