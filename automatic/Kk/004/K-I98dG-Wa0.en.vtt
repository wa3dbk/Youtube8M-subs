this piece of surgery it was was a lot
less<00:01:07.439> involved<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.280> lot<00:01:08.430> less<00:01:08.640> invasive<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:10.040> so

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
less involved a lot less invasive and so

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.840 
less involved a lot less invasive and so

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
over again would I prefer using the more

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.120 
over again would I prefer using the more
traditional<00:01:24.990> method<00:01:25.290> which<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.680> taking<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
traditional method which is taking the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.830 
traditional method which is taking the
skin<00:01:26.549> from<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.820> roof<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.210> my<00:01:27.240> mouth

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.560 
if it's coming out but it wasn't so I
really<00:02:14.230> think<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.530> like<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.910> more<00:02:16.120> modern

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
really think I like the the more modern

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.870 
really think I like the the more modern
and<00:02:16.810> then<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.200> freestride<00:02:17.700> because<00:02:18.700> it's

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
and then the freestride because it's

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.290 
and then the freestride because it's
more<00:02:19.210> technologically<00:02:20.140> advanced<00:02:20.650> and

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
more technologically advanced and

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.300 
more technologically advanced and
medicine<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.690> dental<00:02:23.290> work<00:02:23.410> is<00:02:23.650> coming<00:02:23.920> so

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
medicine and dental work is coming so

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.920 
medicine and dental work is coming so
far<00:02:24.580> so<00:02:24.850> quickly<00:02:24.970> I<00:02:25.420> just<00:02:25.630> think<00:02:25.780> it's

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
far so quickly I just think it's

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.260 
far so quickly I just think it's
marvelous<00:02:26.430> but<00:02:27.430> that's<00:02:27.730> what<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:27.940> would<00:02:28.150> do<00:02:28.240> I

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
marvelous but that's what I would do I

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.900 
marvelous but that's what I would do I
think<00:02:28.420> I<00:02:28.720> would<00:02:28.930> probably<00:02:29.110> go<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.670> more

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
think I would probably go the the more

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.410 
think I would probably go the the more
modern<00:02:31.710> technologically<00:02:32.710> advanced<00:02:33.100> way<00:02:33.430> if

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
modern technologically advanced way if

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.800 
modern technologically advanced way if
it<00:02:34.630> was<00:02:34.720> up<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.900> me<00:02:35.820> I'm<00:02:36.820> living<00:02:37.240> proof<00:02:37.270> that<00:02:37.510> it

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
it was up to me I'm living proof that it

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.920 
it was up to me I'm living proof that it
works<00:02:37.960> then<00:02:38.350> it's<00:02:38.680> it's<00:02:39.100> it's<00:02:39.520> wonderful<00:02:39.930> and

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
works then it's it's it's wonderful and

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.400 
works then it's it's it's wonderful and
I<00:02:41.140> would<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.860> recommend<00:02:42.550> it<00:02:42.730> highly<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:44.050> would

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
I would I recommend it highly I would

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.610 
I would I recommend it highly I would
highly<00:02:44.740> rated<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.460> value<00:02:46.120> of<00:02:47.080> doing<00:02:47.470> this

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
highly rated the value of doing this

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.270 
highly rated the value of doing this
versus<00:02:48.660> not<00:02:49.660> doing<00:02:49.960> anything<00:02:50.200> or<00:02:50.560> versus
