Max 90 essential colors white black
light<00:00:20.850> crimson<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.779> guess<00:00:22.380> neutral<00:00:22.859> gray

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
light crimson and I guess neutral gray

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.689 
light crimson and I guess neutral gray
that's<00:00:25.350> what<00:00:25.560> my<00:00:26.039> guess<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.519> for<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:28.699> so

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
that's what my guess is for that so

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.240 
that's what my guess is for that so
let's<00:00:29.880> get<00:00:30.000> into<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.269> nice<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.109> simple<00:00:31.710> really

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
and that needs to retire because it's

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.299 
and that needs to retire because it's
like<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.610> crazy<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.480> work<00:00:48.960> probably<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.710> lot<00:00:50.190> of

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
like it's crazy a work probably a lot of

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.910

times and the inner lining on that boat

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.100 
times and the inner lining on that boat
one<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.370> already<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:53.910> making<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.780> hole<00:00:55.079> right

here<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.649> side<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.160> guess<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.850> work<00:00:57.270> too<00:00:57.480> much

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
here on the side I guess I work too much

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.689 
here on the side I guess I work too much
on<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.870> side<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.199> then<00:00:58.379> my<00:00:58.680> shoe<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.579> know

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
on the side and then my shoe you know

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.330 
on the side and then my shoe you know
sometimes<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.359> don't<00:01:00.420> tie<00:01:00.719> my<00:01:00.780> shoelaces<00:01:01.350> say

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430
