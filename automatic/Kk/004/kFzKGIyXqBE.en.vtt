of them so you see we have the same type

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.460 
of them so you see we have the same type
of<00:03:06.850> ace<00:03:07.090> as<00:03:07.300> the<00:03:07.450> front<00:03:07.780> it's<00:03:07.959> not<00:03:08.049> like<00:03:08.170> an<00:03:08.320> a

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
of ace as the front it's not like an a

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.229 
of ace as the front it's not like an a
shape<00:03:08.500> normal<00:03:09.250> when<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.370> nice<00:03:09.580> would<00:03:09.760> go<00:03:09.940> like

shape normal when a nice would go like

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.460 
shape normal when a nice would go like
that<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.630> it<00:03:10.810> would<00:03:10.900> go<00:03:11.019> kind<00:03:11.290> of<00:03:11.350> like<00:03:11.440> a

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
that and it would go kind of like a

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.630 
that and it would go kind of like a
newspaper<00:03:11.860> this<00:03:12.070> one's<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.400> little<00:03:12.459> bit

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
see the kind of the black stroke go

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.220 
see the kind of the black stroke go
around<00:05:01.370> it<00:05:01.610> and<00:05:02.000> it<00:05:02.330> goes<00:05:02.480> through<00:05:02.510> there<00:05:03.050> as

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
around it and it goes through there as

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.040 
around it and it goes through there as
well<00:05:03.890> and<00:05:04.190> you<00:05:04.400> see<00:05:04.580> there's<00:05:04.820> a<00:05:04.910> bigger<00:05:05.240> no

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
well and you see there's a bigger no

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.420 
well and you see there's a bigger no
that's<00:05:06.470> not<00:05:06.530> the<00:05:06.650> same<00:05:06.770> side<00:05:07.040> edge<00:05:07.190> for<00:05:07.370> the

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
that's not the same side edge for the

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.720 
that's not the same side edge for the
stroke<00:05:07.640> around<00:05:07.730> it<00:05:08.060> for<00:05:08.210> the<00:05:08.270> ace<00:05:08.390> of<00:05:08.630> diamonds

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
stroke around it for the ace of diamonds

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.340 
stroke around it for the ace of diamonds
so<00:05:10.730> let's<00:05:10.910> move<00:05:11.060> on<00:05:11.330> to<00:05:11.570> the<00:05:11.810> way<00:05:11.930> this<00:05:12.140> debt

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
so let's move on to the way this debt

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.190 
so let's move on to the way this debt
candles<00:05:12.890> so<00:05:13.490> this<00:05:14.060> deck<00:05:14.270> looks<00:05:14.570> good<00:05:14.840> as<00:05:15.050> the

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
candles so this deck looks good as the

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.360 
candles so this deck looks good as the
back<00:05:15.350> designs<00:05:15.620> you<00:05:15.710> can<00:05:15.740> see<00:05:15.860> the<00:05:15.980> coughing

back designs you can see the coughing

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.820 
back designs you can see the coughing
but<00:05:16.550> they<00:05:16.610> see<00:05:16.730> how<00:05:16.820> it<00:05:16.910> handles<00:05:17.590> so<00:05:18.590> it<00:05:18.650> does

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
but they see how it handles so it does

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.420 
but they see how it handles so it does

pretty<00:05:33.230> can<00:05:33.380> hear<00:05:33.500> the<00:05:33.560> sound<00:05:33.890> of<00:05:34.070> it<00:05:34.480> listen

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
pretty can hear the sound of it listen

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.470 
pretty can hear the sound of it listen
and<00:05:36.500> it<00:05:36.680> sounds<00:05:36.980> good<00:05:37.130> as<00:05:37.220> well<00:05:37.400> so<00:05:38.240> it<00:05:38.330> does

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
and it sounds good as well so it does

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.330 
and it sounds good as well so it does
handle<00:05:38.990> really<00:05:39.140> well<00:05:39.260> but<00:05:39.440> the<00:05:39.560> Fanning<00:05:40.040> looks

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
handle really well but the Fanning looks

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.030 
handle really well but the Fanning looks
really<00:05:40.700> good<00:05:40.850> it's<00:05:41.150> just<00:05:41.390> a<00:05:41.480> standard<00:05:41.990> fan<00:05:42.770> it

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040

really good it's just a standard fan it
looks<00:05:43.370> like<00:05:43.520> and<00:05:43.669> this<00:05:43.790> I'm<00:05:43.940> guessing<00:05:44.120> this<00:05:44.300> is

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
looks like and this I'm guessing this is

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.409 
looks like and this I'm guessing this is
normal<00:05:44.870> bicycle<00:05:45.290> stopped<00:05:45.530> because<00:05:45.890> and<00:05:46.419> it
