00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.349 

I'm<00:00:06.040> now<00:00:06.220> going<00:00:06.460> to<00:00:06.550> do<00:00:06.729> some<00:00:06.760> compression

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:07.359 
I'm now going to do some compression

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.860 
I'm now going to do some compression
testing<00:00:08.019> on<00:00:08.230> the<00:00:08.500> Plymouth<00:00:09.040> engine<00:00:09.550> I<00:00:09.870> tested

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:10.870 
testing on the Plymouth engine I tested

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.220 
testing on the Plymouth engine I tested
the<00:00:10.960> first<00:00:11.200> three<00:00:11.620> cylinders<00:00:12.190> in<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:13.630> this

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 
the first three cylinders in this this

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.890 
the first three cylinders in this this
group<00:00:14.380> here<00:00:15.040> and<00:00:15.309> they<00:00:15.880> all<00:00:16.029> test<00:00:16.359> it<00:00:16.570> between

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
group here and they all test it between

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.640 
group here and they all test it between
110<00:00:17.650> 120<00:00:18.490> pounds<00:00:19.210> I'm<00:00:19.960> going<00:00:20.140> to<00:00:20.199> check<00:00:20.320> the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
110 120 pounds I'm going to check the

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.970 
110 120 pounds I'm going to check the
rear<00:00:20.859> one<00:00:21.220> I<00:00:21.659> wasn't<00:00:22.659> sure<00:00:23.499> if<00:00:23.619> I<00:00:23.710> was<00:00:23.800> going<00:00:23.919> to

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
rear one I wasn't sure if I was going to

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.979 
rear one I wasn't sure if I was going to
get<00:00:24.130> the<00:00:24.279> camera<00:00:24.789> out<00:00:24.819> to<00:00:25.210> record<00:00:25.630> each<00:00:25.810> of

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:25.989 
get the camera out to record each of

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.269 
get the camera out to record each of
these<00:00:26.109> because<00:00:26.289> I<00:00:26.470> thought<00:00:26.650> well<00:00:26.859> if<00:00:26.949> they<00:00:27.099> all

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
these because I thought well if they all

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.929 
these because I thought well if they all
look<00:00:27.579> good<00:00:27.789> i<00:00:27.849> won't<00:00:28.149> have<00:00:28.329> much<00:00:28.599> to<00:00:28.899> report

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
look good i won't have much to report

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.490 
look good i won't have much to report
this<00:00:30.939> one<00:00:31.179> looks<00:00:31.329> like<00:00:31.479> it<00:00:31.689> only<00:00:31.810> gets<00:00:32.110> up<00:00:32.320> to

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
this one looks like it only gets up to

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:45.080 
this one looks like it only gets up to
about<00:00:32.730> 60<00:00:33.730> so<00:00:34.269> we'll<00:00:34.420> demonstrate<00:00:34.629> it<00:00:35.140> now

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.290 

well<00:00:46.090> maybe<00:00:46.300> about<00:00:46.630> let's<00:00:46.900> see<00:00:47.110> if<00:00:47.230> that's<00:00:47.410> 60

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
well maybe about let's see if that's 60

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.510 
well maybe about let's see if that's 60
maybe<00:00:49.300> this<00:00:49.540> one<00:00:49.750> gets<00:00:49.930> up<00:00:50.080> to<00:00:50.260> about<00:00:50.290> 80<00:00:50.739> but

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
maybe this one gets up to about 80 but

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.570 
maybe this one gets up to about 80 but
the<00:00:51.670> other<00:00:51.820> ones<00:00:52.180> were<00:00:53.080> between<00:00:53.610> 110<00:00:54.610> and<00:00:54.850> 120

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
the other ones were between 110 and 120

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.160 
the other ones were between 110 and 120
so<00:00:57.580> I'm<00:00:57.699> going<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:57.910> check<00:00:58.150> the<00:00:58.360> other<00:00:58.540> ones<00:00:58.900> on

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
so I'm going to check the other ones on

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.880 
so I'm going to check the other ones on
the<00:00:59.320> other<00:00:59.470> side<00:00:59.860> now<00:01:00.270> i'm<00:01:01.270> not<00:01:01.480> sure<00:01:01.890> i'm

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
the other side now i'm not sure i'm

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.960 
the other side now i'm not sure i'm
thinking<00:01:03.430> if<00:01:03.550> there<00:01:03.730> was<00:01:03.879> a<00:01:03.910> head<00:01:04.210> gasket<00:01:04.950> leak

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
thinking if there was a head gasket leak

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.540 
thinking if there was a head gasket leak
or<00:01:06.970> ruptured<00:01:07.840> head<00:01:08.050> gasket<00:01:08.650> there'd<00:01:09.340> be

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
or ruptured head gasket there'd be

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.430 
or ruptured head gasket there'd be
almost<00:01:09.700> no<00:01:10.119> compression<00:01:10.660> at<00:01:10.930> all<00:01:11.110> on<00:01:11.320> the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
almost no compression at all on the

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.580 
almost no compression at all on the
cylinder<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:13.330> i'm<00:01:13.780> not<00:01:14.050> sure<00:01:14.470> of<00:01:14.500> that<00:01:14.920> so

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
cylinder but i'm not sure of that so

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.960 
cylinder but i'm not sure of that so
going<00:01:17.590> to<00:01:17.680> check<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.100> other<00:01:18.250> ones<00:01:18.520> out<00:01:18.729> and

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
going to check the other ones out and

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.660 
going to check the other ones out and
see<00:01:19.149> what<00:01:19.330> they<00:01:19.540> look<00:01:19.570> like<00:01:20.130> here's<00:01:21.130> this<00:01:21.369> one

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
see what they look like here's this one

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.050 
see what they look like here's this one
here<00:01:22.440> this<00:01:23.440> one<00:01:25.229> between<00:01:26.229> 110<00:01:26.950> 120<00:01:27.729> that's

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
here this one between 110 120 that's

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.280 
here this one between 110 120 that's
what<00:01:28.240> all<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.570> other<00:01:29.070> ones<00:01:30.070> were<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:31.540> that

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
what all the other ones were on that

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.870 
what all the other ones were on that
other<00:01:32.470> side<00:01:32.590> I<00:01:33.600> notice<00:01:34.600> there's<00:01:34.810> something

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
other side I notice there's something

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.020 
other side I notice there's something
know<00:01:36.880> if<00:01:36.970> this<00:01:37.119> is<00:01:37.149> oil<00:01:37.630> or<00:01:38.140> what<00:01:39.030> something's

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
know if this is oil or what something's

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.969 
know if this is oil or what something's
getting<00:01:40.270> all<00:01:40.539> over<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.930> intake<00:01:41.320> manifold<00:01:41.860> I

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
getting all over the intake manifold I

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.510 
getting all over the intake manifold I
don't<00:01:42.160> know<00:01:42.250> if<00:01:42.340> it<00:01:42.430> may<00:01:42.580> be<00:01:42.640> some<00:01:43.380> gasoline

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
don't know if it may be some gasoline

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.029 
don't know if it may be some gasoline
coming<00:01:45.520> from<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.759> carburetor<00:01:46.300> or<00:01:46.800> or<00:01:47.800> what

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
coming from the carburetor or or what

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:49.859 
coming from the carburetor or or what
but<00:01:48.250> there's<00:01:48.429> some<00:01:48.640> kind<00:01:48.910> of<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.209> something's

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
but there's some kind of a something's

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.410 
but there's some kind of a something's
getting<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:51.119> get<00:01:52.119> in<00:01:52.209> the<00:01:52.300> top<00:01:52.509> of<00:01:52.750> that<00:01:52.899> wet

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
getting the get in the top of that wet

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.850 
getting the get in the top of that wet
I'll<00:01:55.420> go<00:01:55.600> ahead<00:01:55.720> and<00:01:55.869> try<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.200> rest<00:01:56.560> of<00:01:56.770> the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
I'll go ahead and try the rest of the

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.630 
I'll go ahead and try the rest of the
cylinders<00:01:57.399> now<00:01:58.259> here's<00:01:59.259> the<00:01:59.500> spark<00:01:59.920> plug<00:02:00.220> here

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
cylinders now here's the spark plug here

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.389 
cylinders now here's the spark plug here
I<00:02:00.849> can<00:02:01.720> never<00:02:01.869> remember<00:02:02.200> which<00:02:02.590> is<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:03.130> I

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
I can never remember which is the I

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.199 
I can never remember which is the I
think<00:02:03.610> this<00:02:04.030> is<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:06.640> will<00:02:06.849> probably<00:02:07.060> be

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209 
think this is the this will probably be

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:10.589 
think this is the this will probably be
the<00:02:07.300> number<00:02:07.690> two<00:02:07.990> cylinder<00:02:08.709> if<00:02:08.860> I<00:02:09.599> remember

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
the number two cylinder if I remember

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.110 
the number two cylinder if I remember
correctly<00:02:11.849> this<00:02:12.849> cylinder<00:02:13.420> this<00:02:13.690> spark<00:02:14.260> plug

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
correctly this cylinder this spark plug

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.600 
correctly this cylinder this spark plug
has<00:02:16.120> got<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.360> lot<00:02:16.630> of<00:02:16.660> oil<00:02:17.020> on<00:02:17.380> it<00:02:18.599> so<00:02:19.599> I<00:02:20.610> check

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
has got a lot of oil on it so I check

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.449 
has got a lot of oil on it so I check
the<00:02:21.760> compression<00:02:22.330> on<00:02:22.420> that<00:02:22.630> cylinder<00:02:23.080> now<00:02:23.459> and

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
the compression on that cylinder now and

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.390 
the compression on that cylinder now and
that<00:02:24.610> cylinder<00:02:25.050> looks<00:02:26.050> pretty<00:02:26.410> good<00:02:26.680> still<00:02:27.250> in

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
that cylinder looks pretty good still in

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.880 
that cylinder looks pretty good still in
the<00:02:27.489> range<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:27.849> about<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.180> hundred<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.890> let's

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
the range of about a hundred and let's

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.699 
the range of about a hundred and let's
see<00:02:30.390> what<00:02:31.390> are<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:31.660> gradations<00:02:32.349> on<00:02:32.590> there<00:02:34.709> 925

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
see what are the gradations on there 925

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.690 
see what are the gradations on there 925
a<00:02:35.739> hundred<00:02:36.430> hundred<00:02:36.849> and<00:02:37.180> 50<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:39.190> can<00:02:39.580> always

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
a hundred hundred and 50 I can always

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
kind of gauges but it looks about the

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.089 
kind of gauges but it looks about the

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
pretty good so I'm not sure whether to

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.809 
pretty good so I'm not sure whether to

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
suspect the head gasket definitively is

suspect the head gasket definitively is

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
the source of the problem because i

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.920 
the source of the problem because i
think<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.430> lowest<00:03:16.580> cylinder<00:03:17.239> which<00:03:17.420> is<00:03:17.660> the

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
reading of about 70 or so so may try the

to<00:03:34.160> see<00:03:34.450> I'm<00:03:35.450> thinking<00:03:35.720> I'm<00:03:36.200> hoping<00:03:36.440> that<00:03:36.680> it's

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
to see I'm thinking I'm hoping that it's

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.770 
to see I'm thinking I'm hoping that it's

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
either in the intake manifold or it's in

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
pump where the coolant leak is I noticed

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:55.300 
pump where the coolant leak is I noticed
in<00:03:47.120> here<00:03:48.610> we<00:03:49.610> get<00:03:49.819> this<00:03:50.030> open<00:03:50.480> here<00:03:54.130> it<00:03:55.130> looked

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
in here we get this open here it looked

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.059 
in here we get this open here it looked
like<00:03:55.400> there<00:03:55.760> was<00:03:55.910> some<00:03:56.560> see<00:03:57.560> if<00:03:57.680> we<00:03:57.799> can<00:03:57.950> get

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
like there was some see if we can get

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.610 
like there was some see if we can get
the<00:03:58.220> light<00:03:58.430> on<00:03:58.639> here<00:03:59.079> seemed<00:04:00.079> like<00:04:00.260> there<00:04:00.440> was

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
the light on here seemed like there was

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.020 
the light on here seemed like there was
some<00:04:00.920> sludge<00:04:02.410> that<00:04:03.410> looked<00:04:03.709> like<00:04:03.799> oil<00:04:04.340> had

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
some sludge that looked like oil had

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.949 
some sludge that looked like oil had
gotten<00:04:05.269> in<00:04:05.540> there<00:04:06.700> so<00:04:10.329> it's<00:04:11.329> kind<00:04:11.600> of<00:04:11.630> hard<00:04:11.690> to

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
gotten in there so it's kind of hard to

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.970 
gotten in there so it's kind of hard to
say<00:04:12.260> whether<00:04:13.989> that<00:04:14.989> was<00:04:15.109> from<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:15.799> head

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
say whether that was from the head

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.719 
say whether that was from the head
gasket<00:04:16.400> itself<00:04:16.789> or<00:04:17.030> not<00:04:17.810> I<00:04:18.200> know<00:04:19.070> there's<00:04:19.459> two

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
gasket itself or not I know there's two

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.150 
gasket itself or not I know there's two
other<00:04:19.959> possible<00:04:20.959> points<00:04:21.410> for<00:04:21.560> antifreeze<00:04:21.799> can

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
other possible points for antifreeze can

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.310 
other possible points for antifreeze can
get<00:04:22.340> into<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:22.700> crankcase<00:04:23.620> so<00:04:25.600> in<00:04:26.600> order<00:04:26.750> to<00:04:26.900> I

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
get into the crankcase so in order to I

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.279 
get into the crankcase so in order to I
make<00:04:27.680> may<00:04:28.039> try<00:04:28.310> doing<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:28.760> water<00:04:28.970> pump<00:04:29.300> first

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
make may try doing the water pump first

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.529 
make may try doing the water pump first
or<00:04:30.770> me<00:04:30.889> it's<00:04:31.550> kind<00:04:31.639> of<00:04:31.760> hard<00:04:31.940> to<00:04:32.000> decide<00:04:32.360> which

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
or me it's kind of hard to decide which

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.730 
or me it's kind of hard to decide which
one<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:32.840> do<00:04:33.110> first<00:04:33.789> but<00:04:34.789> maybe<00:04:35.570> that<00:04:36.289> I<00:04:36.320> haven't

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
one to do first but maybe that I haven't

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.529 
one to do first but maybe that I haven't
taken<00:04:37.010> all<00:04:37.250> that<00:04:37.280> many<00:04:37.550> compression<00:04:38.210> ratings

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
taken all that many compression ratings

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.330 
taken all that many compression ratings
so<00:04:38.750> maybe<00:04:38.930> if<00:04:39.139> you<00:04:39.289> can<00:04:39.470> give<00:04:39.650> me<00:04:39.680> any<00:04:39.950> any

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
so maybe if you can give me any any

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.529 
so maybe if you can give me any any
advice<00:04:41.860> about<00:04:42.860> what<00:04:43.220> about<00:04:43.729> those<00:04:43.910> what<00:04:44.389> the

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
advice about what about those what the

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:45.940 
advice about what about those what the
reading<00:04:44.870> signifying<00:04:45.440> because<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:45.800> was

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
reading signifying because I was

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.800 
reading signifying because I was
thinking<00:04:46.310> if<00:04:46.430> if<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:46.970> head<00:04:47.270> gasket<00:04:47.720> was

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
thinking if if the head gasket was

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.490 
thinking if if the head gasket was
really<00:04:48.169> bad<00:04:48.880> wouldn't<00:04:49.880> even<00:04:50.150> get<00:04:50.389> that<00:04:51.200> much

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
really bad wouldn't even get that much

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.010 
really bad wouldn't even get that much
compression
