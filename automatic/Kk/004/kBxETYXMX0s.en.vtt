the same way I think it depends on how
the<00:01:24.070> player<00:01:24.310> wants<00:01:24.670> them<00:01:24.820> to<00:01:25.060> but<00:01:25.360> I<00:01:25.600> mean<00:01:26.079> the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
the player wants them to but I mean the

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.109 
the player wants them to but I mean the
Bounty<00:01:26.740> Hunter<00:01:26.770> can<00:01:27.070> live<00:01:27.250> by<00:01:27.400> a<00:01:27.430> code<00:01:27.520> as<00:01:27.939> much

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
Bounty Hunter can live by a code as much

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.600
