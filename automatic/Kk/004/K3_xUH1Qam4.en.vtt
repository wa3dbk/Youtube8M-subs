well<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.980> would<00:00:32.250> be<00:00:32.399> mistaken<00:00:32.579> for<00:00:33.030> thinking

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
well you would be mistaken for thinking

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.060 
well you would be mistaken for thinking
that<00:00:33.750> if<00:00:34.140> you're<00:00:34.380> looking<00:00:34.649> at<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> spec<00:00:35.040> sheet

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
that if you're looking at a spec sheet

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.440 
that if you're looking at a spec sheet
and<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.489> don't<00:00:35.700> really<00:00:35.910> know<00:00:36.149> what<00:00:36.329> you're

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
and you don't really know what you're

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.940 
and you don't really know what you're
looking<00:00:36.540> at<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.870> may<00:00:37.200> think<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.590> these<00:00:37.770> are

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
looking at you may think that these are

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.560 
looking at you may think that these are
both<00:00:38.070> too<00:00:38.550> small<00:00:38.820> phones<00:00:39.090> with<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.390> same

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
both too small phones with the same

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.600 
both too small phones with the same
kinds<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.960> things<00:00:40.020> going<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.620> inside<00:00:41.010> but<00:00:41.309> you

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
kinds of things going on inside but you

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.310 
kinds of things going on inside but you
couldn't<00:00:41.850> be<00:00:41.969> further<00:00:42.120> from<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.450> truth<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
couldn't be further from the truth the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.619 
couldn't be further from the truth the
difference<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.860> course<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.520> with<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.239> s5

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
difference is of course that with the s5

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.779 
difference is of course that with the s5
mini<00:00:45.660> Samsung<00:00:46.440> has<00:00:46.620> watered<00:00:47.039> down<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.489> entire

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
mini Samsung has watered down the entire

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.600 
mini Samsung has watered down the entire
s5<00:00:48.450> experience<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.620> while<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.070> get<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> same

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
s5 experience so while you get the same

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.729 
s5 experience so while you get the same
TouchWiz<00:00:51.120> interface<00:00:51.300> everything<00:00:52.140> looks<00:00:52.379> kind

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
TouchWiz interface everything looks kind

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.979 
TouchWiz interface everything looks kind
of<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.010> same<00:00:53.219> maybe<00:00:53.820> you'll<00:00:54.000> think<00:00:54.059> well<00:00:54.840> this

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
of the same maybe you'll think well this

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.600 
of the same maybe you'll think well this
is<00:00:55.170> kind<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.559> same<00:00:55.800> as<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.129> flagship

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
is kind of the same as the flagship

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.790 
is kind of the same as the flagship
everything<00:00:57.480> looks<00:00:57.690> pretty<00:00:57.899> good<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.199> me<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
everything looks pretty good to me the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.010 
everything looks pretty good to me the
problem<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.670> all<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.910> internals<00:01:00.600> behind

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
problem is that all the internals behind

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.630 
problem is that all the internals behind
that<00:01:01.260> are<00:01:01.440> not<00:01:01.649> really<00:01:01.829> there<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.250> back<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.609> up

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
that are not really there to back you up

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.030 
that are not really there to back you up
so<00:01:03.329> while<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.049> get<00:01:04.199> some<00:01:04.500> great<00:01:04.650> features

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
so while you get some great features

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.920 
so while you get some great features
from<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.430> flagship<00:01:05.909> like<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.360> finger

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
from the flagship like the finger

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.050 
from the flagship like the finger
scanner<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.920> course<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.400> heart<00:01:08.909> rate

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
scanner and of course the heart rate

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.399 
scanner and of course the heart rate
monitor<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.659> back<00:01:09.810> whether<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.229> like

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
monitor on the back whether you like

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.899 
monitor on the back whether you like
those<00:01:10.590> or<00:01:10.740> not<00:01:10.860> they're<00:01:11.100> actually<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.670> here

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
those or not they're actually on here

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.940 
those or not they're actually on here
which<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.090> pretty<00:01:12.330> exciting<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.350> difference

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
which is pretty exciting the difference

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.770 
which is pretty exciting the difference
is<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.369> as<00:01:14.670> far<00:01:14.939> as<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.240> specs<00:01:15.570> go

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
is that as far as the specs go

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.020 
is that as far as the specs go
everything<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> long<00:01:17.009> shot<00:01:17.400> from<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
everything is a long shot from the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.060 
everything is a long shot from the
original<00:01:18.659> flagship<00:01:19.229> you'll<00:01:19.650> get<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> much

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
original flagship you'll get a much

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.490 
original flagship you'll get a much
lower<00:01:20.280> resolution<00:01:20.520> camera<00:01:21.330> slower<00:01:21.810> processor

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
lower resolution camera slower processor

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.039 
lower resolution camera slower processor
less<00:01:22.890> RAM<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.820> kind<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.119> thing<00:01:24.360> whereas

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
less RAM and that kind of thing whereas

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.490 
less RAM and that kind of thing whereas
with<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.710> z3<00:01:26.310> compact<00:01:26.990> it's<00:01:27.990> all<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> name

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
with the z3 compact it's all in the name

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.230 
with the z3 compact it's all in the name
really<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.100> compact<00:01:29.549> version<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
really it's a compact version of the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.690 
really it's a compact version of the
flagship<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:31.290> not<00:01:31.530> watered<00:01:31.920> down<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.460> terms

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
flagship it's not watered down in terms

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.030 
flagship it's not watered down in terms
of<00:01:32.880> specs<00:01:33.150> at<00:01:33.329> all<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:34.020> example<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.680> camera

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
of specs at all for example the camera

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.770 
of specs at all for example the camera
on<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> back<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> twenty<00:01:36.240> point<00:01:36.360> seven

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
on the back is a twenty point seven

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.420 
on the back is a twenty point seven
megapixel<00:01:37.320> shooter<00:01:37.350> that's<00:01:37.860> exactly<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
megapixel shooter that's exactly the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.530 
megapixel shooter that's exactly the
same<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.939> you'll<00:01:39.030> find<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
same one that you'll find on the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.200 
same one that you'll find on the
flagship<00:01:40.110> z3<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.310> there<00:01:41.460> may<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.549> around<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
flagship z3 so there may be around the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.880 
flagship z3 so there may be around the
same<00:01:42.390> size<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:42.990> look<00:01:43.259> at<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.470> spec<00:01:43.710> sheet

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
same size and you look at the spec sheet

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.560 
same size and you look at the spec sheet
and<00:01:44.040> see<00:01:44.189> interesting<00:01:44.670> things<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.000> water

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
and see interesting things like water

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.219 
and see interesting things like water
resistancy<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:46.979> ip68<00:01:47.939> rated<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
resistancy so we have ip68 rated on the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.859 
resistancy so we have ip68 rated on the
z3<00:01:49.500> compact<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.250> ip67<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.630> what<00:01:51.750> does<00:01:51.840> that

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
z3 compact and ip67 so what does that

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.690 
z3 compact and ip67 so what does that
actually<00:01:52.110> mean<00:01:52.320> basically<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.340> means<00:01:53.490> they're

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
actually mean basically it means they're

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.490 
actually mean basically it means they're
both<00:01:53.820> dust<00:01:54.090> proof<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.689> that's<00:01:54.869> great<00:01:55.110> however

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
both dust proof so that's great however

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.679 
both dust proof so that's great however
the<00:01:55.799> z3<00:01:55.979> compact<00:01:56.310> can<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:56.790> left<00:01:57.090> underwater

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
the z3 compact can be left underwater

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.139 
the z3 compact can be left underwater
continuously<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.680> fresh<00:01:58.920> water<00:01:59.070> for<00:01:59.820> up<00:02:00.119> to

about two hours whereas the s5 mini is

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.380 
about two hours whereas the s5 mini is
really<00:02:03.659> only<00:02:03.990> water

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
really only water

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.300 
really only water

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
one meter of water but you really

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.090 
one meter of water but you really
wouldn't<00:02:07.900> want<00:02:07.960> to<00:02:08.110> push<00:02:08.289> it<00:02:08.440> luck<00:02:08.619> with<00:02:08.770> that

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
wouldn't want to push it luck with that

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.580

can't on these a3 compact now other than
processor<00:02:45.550> of<00:02:45.640> course<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:46.030> major<00:02:46.300> difference

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
processor of course the major difference

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.990 
processor of course the major difference
between<00:02:47.050> these<00:02:47.230> two<00:02:47.470> phones<00:02:47.739> is<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.250> camera

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
between these two phones is the camera

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.970 
between these two phones is the camera
so<00:02:49.239> we<00:02:49.360> have<00:02:49.450> twenty<00:02:49.720> point<00:02:49.870> seven<00:02:50.110> megapixel

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
so we have twenty point seven megapixel

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.699 
so we have twenty point seven megapixel
and<00:02:51.160> 8<00:02:51.550> megapixel<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:52.269> course<00:02:52.810> Sony<00:02:53.320> cameras

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
and 8 megapixel of course Sony cameras

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.460 
and 8 megapixel of course Sony cameras
are<00:02:53.830> always<00:02:54.100> fantastic<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.840> Samsung

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
are always fantastic and the Samsung

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.259 
are always fantastic and the Samsung
cameras<00:02:56.890> are<00:02:57.070> no<00:02:57.220> slouch<00:02:57.459> either<00:02:57.670> but<00:02:58.000> if<00:02:58.150> we

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
cameras are no slouch either but if we

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.460 
cameras are no slouch either but if we
take<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.480> look<00:02:58.660> we'll<00:02:58.810> have<00:02:58.930> all<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.200> full

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
take a look we'll have all the full

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.009 
take a look we'll have all the full

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
take a look so you can see the Samsung

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.410 
take a look so you can see the Samsung
performs<00:03:06.100> pretty<00:03:06.220> nicely<00:03:06.550> the<00:03:06.910> sony<00:03:07.269> of

course has a completely trial to one it

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.850 
course has a completely trial to one it
comes<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.610> megapixel<00:03:10.239> count<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:11.410> for<00:03:11.799> the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
first time ever for me I've noticed that

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.819 
first time ever for me I've noticed that
the<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:15.670> s5<00:03:16.329> mini<00:03:16.570> camera<00:03:17.230> doesn't<00:03:17.530> seem<00:03:17.709> to

the the s5 mini camera doesn't seem to

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.060 
the the s5 mini camera doesn't seem to
be<00:03:17.890> quite<00:03:18.070> as<00:03:18.340> contrast<00:03:18.850> as<00:03:19.180> normal<00:03:19.840> up<00:03:20.799> close

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
be quite as contrast as normal up close

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.770 
be quite as contrast as normal up close
they<00:03:21.280> both<00:03:21.430> handle<00:03:21.760> things<00:03:21.970> ok<00:03:22.269> although<00:03:22.510> the

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
they both handle things ok although the

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.199 
they both handle things ok although the
focus<00:03:23.230> wasn't<00:03:23.410> quite<00:03:23.769> so<00:03:23.799> great<00:03:24.220> outside

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
focus wasn't quite so great outside

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.210 
focus wasn't quite so great outside
again<00:03:25.720> things<00:03:26.140> are<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.320> little<00:03:26.380> bit<00:03:26.560> blue<00:03:26.890> here

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
again things are a little bit blue here

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.530 
again things are a little bit blue here
a<00:03:27.250> little<00:03:27.400> bit<00:03:27.610> yellow<00:03:27.820> here<00:03:28.120> neither<00:03:28.329> of

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
a little bit yellow here neither of

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.970 
a little bit yellow here neither of
those<00:03:28.630> is<00:03:28.690> particularly<00:03:29.230> accurate<00:03:29.769> but<00:03:29.890> we'll

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
those is particularly accurate but we'll

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.039 
those is particularly accurate but we'll
have<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.160> full<00:03:30.489> photos<00:03:30.880> for<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.180> low

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
have the full photos for you low

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.620 
have the full photos for you low
resolution<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:33.070> z3<00:03:33.640> compact<00:03:33.790> has<00:03:34.180> an<00:03:34.299> ISO

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
resolution the z3 compact has an ISO

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.569

and<00:03:36.940> obviously<00:03:37.480> it<00:03:37.720> completely<00:03:38.230> destroys<00:03:38.680> the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
and obviously it completely destroys the

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.940 
and obviously it completely destroys the
s5<00:03:39.370> mini<00:03:39.780> this<00:03:40.780> is<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.290> oles<00:03:41.530> photos<00:03:41.829> are

s5 mini this is the oles photos are

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.500 
s5 mini this is the oles photos are
taken<00:03:42.040> on<00:03:42.310> superior<00:03:42.730> auto<00:03:42.910> these<00:03:43.239> are<00:03:43.390> all

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
taken on superior auto these are all

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.900 
taken on superior auto these are all
done<00:03:43.690> on<00:03:43.870> auto<00:03:44.170> as<00:03:44.410> well<00:03:44.620> however<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.250> z3

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
done on auto as well however the z3

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.630 
done on auto as well however the z3
obviously<00:03:46.540> handles<00:03:47.010> changes<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.040> lot<00:03:48.430> better

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
obviously handles changes a lot better

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.690 
obviously handles changes a lot better
than<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.239> s5<00:03:49.690> mini<00:03:50.100> colours<00:03:51.100> are<00:03:51.280> pretty<00:03:51.489> good

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
than the s5 mini colours are pretty good

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.380 
than the s5 mini colours are pretty good
I<00:03:51.970> probably<00:03:52.750> say<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.320> s5<00:03:54.100> has<00:03:54.130> slightly<00:03:54.730> weird

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
I probably say the s5 has slightly weird

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.630 
I probably say the s5 has slightly weird
yellows<00:03:55.840> going<00:03:56.260> on<00:03:56.410> but<00:03:56.769> again<00:03:57.160> you<00:03:57.310> can<00:03:57.489> see

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
yellows going on but again you can see

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.150 
yellows going on but again you can see
that<00:03:57.850> on<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.299> full-size<00:03:58.570> versions<00:03:59.200> on<00:03:59.410> your

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
are pretty similar color reproductions

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.560 
are pretty similar color reproductions
not<00:04:05.530> too<00:04:05.890> bad<00:04:06.130> and<00:04:06.459> sort<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:06.820> slightly<00:04:07.120> murky

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
not too bad and sort of slightly murky

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
last day things are all looking pretty

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.270 
last day things are all looking pretty
much<00:04:12.120> as<00:04:12.299> you'd<00:04:12.540> expect<00:04:12.930> although<00:04:13.349> again<00:04:13.950> the

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
much as you'd expect although again the

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.759 
much as you'd expect although again the
s5<00:04:14.970> is<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.150> little<00:04:15.450> bit<00:04:15.599> tweaked<00:04:15.930> in<00:04:16.169> ways<00:04:16.530> that

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
s5 is a little bit tweaked in ways that

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.969 
s5 is a little bit tweaked in ways that
I<00:04:16.859> don't<00:04:16.919> particularly<00:04:17.370> like<00:04:18.260> then<00:04:19.260> we<00:04:19.739> get<00:04:19.889> to

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
I don't particularly like then we get to

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.920 
I don't particularly like then we get to
here<00:04:20.160> we<00:04:20.370> get<00:04:20.489> a<00:04:20.549> much<00:04:20.880> punchy<00:04:21.419> er<00:04:21.449> black<00:04:21.750> and

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
here we get a much punchy er black and

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.600 
here we get a much punchy er black and
white<00:04:22.079> kind<00:04:22.440> of<00:04:22.560> high<00:04:22.650> contrast<00:04:22.919> thing<00:04:23.370> going

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
white kind of high contrast thing going

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.360 
white kind of high contrast thing going
on<00:04:23.699> in<00:04:23.850> a<00:04:23.940> dim<00:04:24.600> room<00:04:24.810> lit<00:04:25.320> with<00:04:25.710> bright<00:04:25.979> windows

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
on in a dim room lit with bright windows

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.310 
on in a dim room lit with bright windows
and<00:04:26.639> these<00:04:27.060> three<00:04:27.479> compact<00:04:27.810> is<00:04:27.960> doing<00:04:28.229> a

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
and these three compact is doing a

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.750 
and these three compact is doing a
little<00:04:28.440> bit<00:04:28.650> of<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:28.800> weird<00:04:28.949> washed<00:04:29.250> out<00:04:29.520> thing

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
little bit of a weird washed out thing

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.029 
little bit of a weird washed out thing
so<00:04:30.419> of<00:04:30.479> course<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:30.780> z3<00:04:30.960> compact<00:04:31.260> completely

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
so of course the z3 compact completely

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.740 
so of course the z3 compact completely
destroys<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.520> s5<00:04:32.850> mini<00:04:32.880> in<00:04:33.180> terms<00:04:33.389> of<00:04:33.539> make<00:04:33.720> a

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
destroys the s5 mini in terms of make a

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.390 
destroys the s5 mini in terms of make a
pixel<00:04:33.960> count<00:04:34.229> and<00:04:34.530> you'll<00:04:34.830> have<00:04:35.039> to<00:04:35.160> take<00:04:35.340> a

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
pixel count and you'll have to take a

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.040 
pixel count and you'll have to take a
look<00:04:35.610> at<00:04:35.669> the<00:04:35.820> camera<00:04:36.300> results<00:04:36.600> yourself<00:04:36.750> to

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
look at the camera results yourself to

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.290 
look at the camera results yourself to
see<00:04:37.199> which<00:04:37.350> one<00:04:37.530> you<00:04:37.560> prefer<00:04:38.120> but<00:04:39.120> the

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
see which one you prefer but the

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.360 
see which one you prefer but the
important<00:04:39.570> thing<00:04:39.600> to<00:04:39.900> note<00:04:40.080> is<00:04:40.320> that<00:04:40.350> while<00:04:40.949> on

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
important thing to note is that while on

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.189 
important thing to note is that while on
the<00:04:41.699> outside<00:04:42.030> these<00:04:42.210> may<00:04:42.419> look<00:04:42.660> like<00:04:42.930> they

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
the outside these may look like they

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.689 
the outside these may look like they
could<00:04:43.260> be<00:04:43.620> similar<00:04:43.860> kinds<00:04:44.280> of<00:04:44.340> phones<00:04:44.550> the

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
could be similar kinds of phones the

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.210 
could be similar kinds of phones the
important<00:04:45.030> thing<00:04:45.120> is<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.870> z3<00:04:46.410> compact<00:04:46.770> is

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
important thing is the the z3 compact is

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.370 
important thing is the the z3 compact is
a<00:04:47.280> flagship<00:04:47.910> on<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.300> inside<00:04:48.630> that's<00:04:48.960> exactly

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
a flagship on the inside that's exactly

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.050 
a flagship on the inside that's exactly
what<00:04:49.500> it<00:04:49.590> is<00:04:49.620> it's<00:04:49.949> all<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.190> same<00:04:50.370> as<00:04:50.610> you<00:04:50.669> get

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
what it is it's all the same as you get

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.719 
what it is it's all the same as you get
in<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.419> full<00:04:51.720> sizes<00:04:51.960> at<00:04:52.229> three<00:04:52.500> but<00:04:53.010> the<00:04:53.280> s5

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
in the full sizes at three but the s5

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.730 
in the full sizes at three but the s5
mini<00:04:53.760> is<00:04:54.060> really<00:04:54.330> just<00:04:54.570> aspiring<00:04:55.229> to<00:04:55.530> look

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
mini is really just aspiring to look

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.939 
mini is really just aspiring to look
like<00:04:56.039> the<00:04:56.610> flagship<00:04:57.060> Galaxy<00:04:57.389> s5<00:04:58.020> so<00:04:58.500> while<00:04:58.830> it

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
like the flagship Galaxy s5 so while it
