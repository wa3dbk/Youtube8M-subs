00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
forward this side of a face is really

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.240 
forward this side of a face is really
really<00:00:27.060> bright<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.840> side<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.650> really<00:00:28.890> dark

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
really bright this side is really dark

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.580 
really bright this side is really dark
but<00:00:30.000> what<00:00:30.150> if<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.359> was<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.539> say<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.779> could<00:00:31.050> magic

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
but what if I was to say I could magic

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.310 
but what if I was to say I could magic
that<00:00:31.859> away<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.660> was<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.930> go

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
that away I was just to go

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.670 
that away I was just to go
Kazaam<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.969> see<00:00:36.180> how<00:00:36.329> much<00:00:36.480> softer<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.380> is

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
Kazaam you see how much softer that is

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.650 
Kazaam you see how much softer that is
look<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:39.360> what<00:00:39.510> am<00:00:39.600> i<00:00:39.690> doing<00:00:41.360> piece<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.480> white

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
look so what am i doing piece of white

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.250 
look so what am i doing piece of white
card

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
card

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.590 
card
it's<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.620> reflector<00:00:44.309> well<00:00:44.700> actually<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.450> isn't

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
it's a reflector well actually it isn't

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.630 
it's a reflector well actually it isn't
a<00:00:45.750> reflector<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.649> piece<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:46.950> white<00:00:47.280> card

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
a reflector it is a piece of white card

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.639 
a reflector it is a piece of white card
a<00:00:47.879> reflector<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.570> probably<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.170> most<00:00:49.379> basic

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
a reflector is probably the most basic

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.220 
a reflector is probably the most basic
easiest<00:00:50.610> light<00:00:50.850> modifying<00:00:51.390> equipment<00:00:51.510> that

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
easiest light modifying equipment that

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.410 
easiest light modifying equipment that
you<00:00:52.320> could<00:00:52.469> ever<00:00:52.739> use<00:00:53.219> all<00:00:53.760> I'm<00:00:54.030> doing<00:00:54.390> with

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
you could ever use all I'm doing with

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.619 
you could ever use all I'm doing with
this<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.579> think<00:00:56.850> even<00:00:57.059> from<00:00:57.390> there

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
this is just and I think even from there

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.170 
this is just and I think even from there
you<00:00:57.809> can<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.920> difference<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.579> Tasha's

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
you can see the difference on Tasha's

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.299 
you can see the difference on Tasha's
face<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:01.109> by<00:01:01.379> moving<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.800> white<00:01:01.980> card

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
face just by moving the white card

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.840 
face just by moving the white card
around<00:01:03.500> you<00:01:04.500> could<00:01:04.650> use<00:01:04.830> anything<00:01:05.220> there<00:01:05.700> are

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
around you could use anything there are

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.390 
around you could use anything there are
purpose-built<00:01:06.619> reflectors<00:01:07.619> such<00:01:07.860> as<00:01:08.040> this

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
purpose-built reflectors such as this

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.920 
purpose-built reflectors such as this
lastolite<00:01:08.850> which<00:01:09.090> I'm<00:01:09.240> going<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.420> show<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.720> in

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
lastolite which I'm going to show you in

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.340 
lastolite which I'm going to show you in
a<00:01:09.990> minute

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
a minute

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.830 
a minute
you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.650> even<00:01:10.770> use<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> white<00:01:11.369> envelope

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
you can even use a white envelope

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.240 
you can even use a white envelope
anything<00:01:12.840> will<00:01:13.020> do<00:01:13.200> as<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> reflector<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
anything will do as a reflector and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.550 
anything will do as a reflector and
wherever<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.030> move<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.170> get<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
wherever you move it to so you get the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.520 
wherever you move it to so you get the
light<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.580> closer<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.840> Tasha<00:01:19.080> I

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
light the closer this is to Tasha I

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.249 
light the closer this is to Tasha I
think<00:01:20.130> you'll<00:01:20.250> see<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:21.270> stronger<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.170> effect

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
think you'll see the stronger the effect

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.100 
think you'll see the stronger the effect
of<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.770> reflector<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.420> here<00:01:24.720> we've<00:01:24.930> got<00:01:25.049> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
of the reflector so in here we've got a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.690 
of the reflector so in here we've got a
pretty<00:01:25.350> strong<00:01:25.470> effect<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.220> move<00:01:26.340> back

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
pretty strong effect but as I move back

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.999 
pretty strong effect but as I move back
it<00:01:27.150> becomes<00:01:27.509> more<00:01:27.900> subtle<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.380> saw<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.619> sneaky

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
it becomes more subtle I saw that sneaky

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.390 
it becomes more subtle I saw that sneaky
look<00:01:29.130> Natasha<00:01:29.509> it<00:01:30.509> becomes<00:01:31.200> more<00:01:31.530> subtle<00:01:32.220> as

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
look Natasha it becomes more subtle as

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.109 
look Natasha it becomes more subtle as
you<00:01:32.939> move<00:01:33.119> back<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.750> forth<00:01:34.759> wherever<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.880> put

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
you move back and forth wherever you put

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.300 
you move back and forth wherever you put
it<00:01:36.180> I'm<00:01:36.600> using<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.229> now<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.470> soften<00:01:38.009> these

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
it I'm using it now to soften these

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.580 
it I'm using it now to soften these
shadows<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.329> look<00:01:39.540> see<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.140> could<00:01:40.380> put<00:01:40.500> it

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
shadows but look see I could put it

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.679 
shadows but look see I could put it
under<00:01:40.979> here<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.640> try<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:41.850> work<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.420> this

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
under here just to try and work on this

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.749 
under here just to try and work on this
area<00:01:42.990> under<00:01:43.350> Tasha's<00:01:43.770> chin<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.640> bring

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
area under Tasha's chin so you can bring

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.600 
area under Tasha's chin so you can bring
the<00:01:44.909> light<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.360> from<00:01:45.990> underneath<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.369> see

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
the light in from underneath you can see

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.889 
the light in from underneath you can see
how<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:47.970> modifies<00:01:48.090> now<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.659> wouldn't

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
how it modifies now you wouldn't

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.719 
how it modifies now you wouldn't
normally<00:01:49.049> use<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> reflector<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:50.310> such<00:01:50.549> an

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
normally use a reflector in such an

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.330 
normally use a reflector in such an
unsubtle<00:01:51.299> way<00:01:51.479> as<00:01:51.960> we<00:01:52.259> are<00:01:52.439> here<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.250> just

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
unsubtle way as we are here but I just

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.850 
unsubtle way as we are here but I just
want<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.549> show<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.820> what<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.180> does<00:01:54.799> but<00:01:55.799> you

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
want to show you what it does but you

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.830 
want to show you what it does but you
don't<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.340> need<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.549> reflector<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.240> reflect

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
don't just need a reflector to reflect

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.620 
don't just need a reflector to reflect
light<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.829> could<00:01:59.130> use<00:01:59.369> one<00:01:59.610> to<00:02:00.000> remove<00:02:00.360> it

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
light in you could use one to remove it

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.880 
light in you could use one to remove it
if<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.409> come<00:02:01.619> over<00:02:01.649> here<00:02:03.290> all<00:02:04.290> these<00:02:04.439> shadows

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
if I come over here all these shadows

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.980 
if I come over here all these shadows
here<00:02:05.310> are<00:02:05.490> not<00:02:06.149> particularly<00:02:06.509> nice<00:02:06.780> on

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
here are not particularly nice on

here are not particularly nice on
Tasha's<00:02:07.380> face<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.770> let's<00:02:07.920> remove<00:02:08.310> all<00:02:08.610> the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
Tasha's face so let's remove all the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.699 
Tasha's face so let's remove all the
shadows<00:02:09.270> but<00:02:09.840> instead<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.200> we're<00:02:10.379> instead<00:02:10.619> of

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
shadows but instead of we're instead of

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.260 
shadows but instead of we're instead of
adding<00:02:10.920> light<00:02:11.280> we're<00:02:11.610> going<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.819> take<00:02:12.030> some

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
adding light we're going to take some

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.610 
adding light we're going to take some
light<00:02:12.480> away

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
light away

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.640

what<00:02:14.129> I'm<00:02:14.280> going<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.459> do<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:15.690> put<00:02:15.959> Tasha's<00:02:16.379> face

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
what I'm going to do is put Tasha's face

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.520 
what I'm going to do is put Tasha's face
in<00:02:17.010> shade<00:02:17.580> now<00:02:18.330> there<00:02:18.569> are<00:02:18.720> no<00:02:18.930> shadows<00:02:19.379> but

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
in shade now there are no shadows but

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.500 
in shade now there are no shadows but
she's<00:02:19.830> gone<00:02:20.069> very<00:02:20.280> dark<00:02:20.670> compared<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.420> the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
she's gone very dark compared to the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.750 
she's gone very dark compared to the
background<00:02:21.959> but<00:02:22.950> if<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.159> increase<00:02:23.459> your

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
background but if you increase your

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.380 
background but if you increase your
exposure<00:02:23.849> a<00:02:24.299> bit<00:02:24.599> and<00:02:24.840> expose<00:02:25.709> for<00:02:25.950> Tasha

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
exposure a bit and expose for Tasha

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.259 
exposure a bit and expose for Tasha
rather<00:02:27.390> than<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.049> park<00:02:28.879> Tasha<00:02:29.879> will<00:02:30.150> look

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
rather than the park Tasha will look

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.360 
rather than the park Tasha will look
really<00:02:30.599> really<00:02:30.840> nice<00:02:30.989> a<00:02:31.019> beautiful<00:02:31.680> flat<00:02:32.010> even

really really nice a beautiful flat even

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.819

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
things you can do with a reflector so

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
got a silver side if I reflect some

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.149 
got a silver side if I reflect some
light<00:03:12.540> into<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.140> camera<00:03:13.470> lens<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.769> can<00:03:13.920> see

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
light into the camera lens you can see

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.699 
light into the camera lens you can see
just<00:03:14.370> how<00:03:14.459> powerful<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.180> reflects<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.620> I've

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
just how powerful that reflects and I've

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.120 
just how powerful that reflects and I've
also<00:03:16.859> got<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.069> gold<00:03:17.400> side<00:03:17.790> on<00:03:18.090> this<00:03:18.450> one<00:03:19.099> some<00:03:20.099> of

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.729 
also got a gold side on this one some of
them<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.430> might<00:03:20.549> have<00:03:20.819> a<00:03:20.970> white<00:03:21.620> reflector<00:03:22.620> on

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
them you might have a white reflector on

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.830 
them you might have a white reflector on
one<00:03:22.919> side<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.519> silver<00:03:23.910> because<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.630> white

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
one side and a silver because the white

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.809 
one side and a silver because the white
won't<00:03:25.109> be<00:03:25.290> as<00:03:25.410> harsh<00:03:25.680> won't<00:03:25.950> be<00:03:26.010> as<00:03:26.099> strong<00:03:26.489> as

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
won't be as harsh won't be as strong as

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.059 
won't be as harsh won't be as strong as
the<00:03:27.000> silver<00:03:27.389> light<00:03:27.569> if<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:28.019> just<00:03:28.470> kind<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.739> scoop

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
the silver light if I just kind of scoop

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.379 
the silver light if I just kind of scoop
a<00:03:29.190> bit<00:03:29.340> of<00:03:29.430> light<00:03:29.549> onto<00:03:29.760> Tasha<00:03:30.060> with<00:03:30.299> the

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
a bit of light onto Tasha with the

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.000 
a bit of light onto Tasha with the
silver<00:03:30.720> thing<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.349> can<00:03:31.530> see<00:03:31.709> that<00:03:31.889> is

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
silver thing you can see that is

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.240 
silver thing you can see that is
actually<00:03:32.629> it's<00:03:33.629> very<00:03:33.750> very<00:03:34.440> very<00:03:34.650> powerful

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
actually it's very very very powerful

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.680 
actually it's very very very powerful
indeed<00:03:35.549> as<00:03:35.760> I<00:03:35.879> just<00:03:36.150> scooped<00:03:36.599> some<00:03:36.629> light<00:03:37.109> up

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
indeed as I just scooped some light up

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.259 
indeed as I just scooped some light up
now<00:03:39.690> something<00:03:40.079> which<00:03:40.200> is<00:03:40.790> you<00:03:41.790> need<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.030> think

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
now something which is you need to think

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.449 
now something which is you need to think
about<00:03:42.359> is<00:03:42.780> kind<00:03:43.379> of<00:03:43.470> physics<00:03:43.919> the<00:03:44.099> sun's<00:03:44.340> the

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
about is kind of physics the sun's the

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.589 
about is kind of physics the sun's the
lights<00:03:44.730> coming<00:03:45.090> from<00:03:45.180> over<00:03:45.419> there

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
lights coming from over there

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.990 
lights coming from over there
is<00:03:45.750> coming<00:03:46.019> this<00:03:46.169> way<00:03:46.500> so<00:03:47.310> you<00:03:47.400> need<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:47.609> scoop

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
is coming this way so you need to scoop

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.849 
is coming this way so you need to scoop
it<00:03:48.150> up<00:03:48.269> from<00:03:48.510> this<00:03:48.660> side<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:49.319> push<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.650> back

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
it up from this side to push it back

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.129 
it up from this side to push it back
into<00:03:50.129> those<00:03:50.459> shadows<00:03:50.760> this<00:03:51.540> isn't<00:03:51.840> obviously

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
into those shadows this isn't obviously

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.509 
into those shadows this isn't obviously
going<00:03:52.319> to<00:03:52.379> work<00:03:52.560> if<00:03:52.799> you're<00:03:52.919> on<00:03:53.040> this<00:03:53.220> side

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
going to work if you're on this side

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.210 
going to work if you're on this side
because<00:03:54.209> a<00:03:54.530> bit<00:03:55.530> of<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.650> no-brainer<00:03:55.799> really

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
because a bit of a no-brainer really

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.990 
because a bit of a no-brainer really
isn't<00:03:56.489> it<00:03:58.250> with<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.280> silver<00:03:59.609> side<00:03:59.790> we're

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
isn't it with a silver side we're

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.369 
isn't it with a silver side we're
putting<00:04:00.209> in<00:04:00.329> tons<00:04:00.569> of<00:04:00.720> light<00:04:00.930> that's<00:04:01.139> way<00:04:01.319> too

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
putting in tons of light that's way too

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.170 
putting in tons of light that's way too
much<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:01.919> could<00:04:02.099> move<00:04:02.250> back<00:04:02.489> a<00:04:02.549> quite<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:02.970> long

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
much I could move back a quite a long

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.580 
much I could move back a quite a long
way<00:04:03.329> with<00:04:03.510> this<00:04:03.660> and<00:04:03.870> still<00:04:04.109> look<00:04:04.349> at<00:04:04.440> that

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
way with this and still look at that

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.770 
way with this and still look at that
even<00:04:04.859> from<00:04:05.010> back<00:04:05.220> over<00:04:05.579> here<00:04:05.790> hopefully<00:04:06.629> not

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
even from back over here hopefully not

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.210 
even from back over here hopefully not
falling<00:04:07.139> in<00:04:07.199> the<00:04:07.290> river<00:04:07.470> which<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.099> would

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
falling in the river which you would

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.050 
falling in the river which you would
love<00:04:08.519> wouldn't<00:04:08.819> you<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:10.040> can<00:04:11.040> still<00:04:11.430> scoop<00:04:11.849> up

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
love wouldn't you I can still scoop up

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.960 
love wouldn't you I can still scoop up
light<00:04:12.329> look<00:04:13.019> at<00:04:13.169> Tasha's<00:04:13.530> face<00:04:13.709> as<00:04:13.980> it<00:04:14.129> just

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
light look at Tasha's face as it just

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.729 
light look at Tasha's face as it just
pushes<00:04:15.209> some<00:04:15.569> light<00:04:15.750> it<00:04:16.320> makes<00:04:16.530> an<00:04:16.680> enormous

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
pushes some light it makes an enormous

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.539 
pushes some light it makes an enormous
difference<00:04:18.049> yes<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.260> getting<00:04:19.500> close<00:04:19.739> well<00:04:20.519> I

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
difference yes it getting close well I

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.080 
difference yes it getting close well I
just<00:04:20.669> kind<00:04:21.120> of<00:04:21.260> do<00:04:22.260> some<00:04:22.469> of<00:04:22.560> this<00:04:22.620> stuff

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
just kind of do some of this stuff

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.240 
just kind of do some of this stuff
big<00:04:25.090> difference<00:04:25.539> now<00:04:26.319> the<00:04:26.380> Sun<00:04:26.680> is<00:04:26.949> going<00:04:27.190> to

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
big difference now the Sun is going to

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.950 
big difference now the Sun is going to
be<00:04:27.340> going<00:04:27.490> in<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:27.699> out<00:04:27.819> of<00:04:28.000> it<00:04:28.120> as<00:04:28.270> a<00:04:28.300> couple

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
be going in and out of it as a couple

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.540 
be going in and out of it as a couple
little<00:04:29.050> bits<00:04:29.259> of<00:04:29.350> cloud<00:04:29.530> coming<00:04:29.889> along<00:04:30.100> so<00:04:30.520> I

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
little bits of cloud coming along so I

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.860 
little bits of cloud coming along so I
quickly<00:04:30.789> want<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.060> show<00:04:31.240> you<00:04:31.300> what<00:04:31.600> the<00:04:31.660> gold

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
quickly want to show you what the gold

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.800 
quickly want to show you what the gold
sides<00:04:32.169> for<00:04:32.470> this<00:04:33.099> will<00:04:33.250> add<00:04:33.370> color<00:04:33.729> to<00:04:34.150> your

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
sides for this will add color to your

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.600 
sides for this will add color to your
picture<00:04:35.319> this<00:04:35.770> is<00:04:35.889> going<00:04:36.039> to<00:04:36.099> scoop<00:04:36.400> up<00:04:36.580> some

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
picture this is going to scoop up some

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.480 
picture this is going to scoop up some
gold<00:04:37.120> light<00:04:37.419> and<00:04:37.810> fill<00:04:38.680> in<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:38.889> shadows<00:04:39.280> with

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
gold light and fill in the shadows with

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.850 
gold light and fill in the shadows with
gold<00:04:39.759> so<00:04:40.690> Tasha<00:04:40.930> now<00:04:41.169> looks<00:04:41.349> like<00:04:41.530> she's<00:04:41.740> been

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
gold so Tasha now looks like she's been

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.100 
gold so Tasha now looks like she's been
in<00:04:41.919> the<00:04:42.069> tailings<00:04:42.310> tanning<00:04:43.030> salon<00:04:43.419> so<00:04:43.960> we're

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
in the tailings tanning salon so we're

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.950 
in the tailings tanning salon so we're
not<00:04:44.530> only<00:04:44.710> getting<00:04:44.979> rid<00:04:45.069> of<00:04:45.509> the<00:04:46.509> shadows

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
not only getting rid of the shadows

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.749 
not only getting rid of the shadows
we're<00:04:47.259> sort<00:04:47.470> of<00:04:47.500> putting<00:04:47.680> a<00:04:47.860> color<00:04:48.130> onto<00:04:48.400> that

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 
we're sort of putting a color onto that

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:50.490 
we're sort of putting a color onto that
just<00:04:49.270> flip<00:04:49.449> it<00:04:49.509> over<00:04:49.599> to<00:04:49.780> silver<00:04:50.139> again<00:04:50.319> for

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
just flip it over to silver again for

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.650 
just flip it over to silver again for
you<00:04:50.590> quickly<00:04:50.860> so<00:04:51.789> that's<00:04:51.970> a<00:04:52.060> neutral<00:04:52.449> color

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
you quickly so that's a neutral color

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.110 
you quickly so that's a neutral color
and<00:04:54.539> the<00:04:55.539> gold<00:04:55.780> color
