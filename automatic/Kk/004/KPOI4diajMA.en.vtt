00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.259
 nevertheless according to chaves and josé manuel 46 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.970
 they are the area 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.909
 it's midnight 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.849
 we are all tired 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.359
 the last year 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.659
 villepín del machaca with 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.659
 with my friends playing 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.650
 and I will be the baaz 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.070
 I think we're going to see how we're going to meet 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.810
 as always the title 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.780
 he recorded live so he commented live 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.780
 I here anything can happen 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.320
 I love that I recommend this but looking pretty for it the club 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.910
 many of them the Spanish 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.910
 the truth that I like the idea of ​​equity will fall on other people who 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.570
 that equal to the others also 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.160
 the last time that we not only in 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.850
 in spain but also in all latin america of mexico united states 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.280
 Peru water and unjustified 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.290
 now 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.060
 please 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.060
 I grow up like I do not recognize it 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.360
 what he wanted to say 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.360
 Cristina Kirchner 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.870
 the last to do it 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.870
 and at the same time when this one 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.960
 zelaya expressed these guys not the samper knife 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.210
 but I do not know that the citizen I'm better 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.690
 but if that impression lands for the first time 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.270
 the boys cost 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.310
 he says he has a warning 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.300
 efe 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.169
 the school saying 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.339
 9 

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:15.339
 I thought that that leaves nothing 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.749
 he has seen him 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:22.749
 and that explains 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.709
 cúper 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.989
 why are we going 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:36.789
 this witness that yes no 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.509

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.789
 ap 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:46.849
 as he said 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.849
 I'm very pleased with the one that has made any record of bic 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:53.789
 nobody works 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:57.019
 I can not talk about things like that because as soon as I spoke about something 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.969
 haina seems detained leader 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:03.499

 Iranian nuclear program then 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.639
 efe because you do because you do 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.329
 and there I trade by choosing 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:45.759
 I really like what they do 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:50.479

 from the back this debate the crazy 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.349
 It is very nice that there are people with 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.189
 cox channels no i and you have to continue supporting you have to continue supporting 

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:14.149

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.149
 kisses subscribing us 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.319
 The good thing is that 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:26.319

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.659

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.919

 we will win 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:41.589

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.180
 that second tamatan 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:01.449
