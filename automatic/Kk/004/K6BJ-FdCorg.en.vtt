of<00:02:18.959> cool<00:02:19.319> because<00:02:19.890> there's<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:20.670> many

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
of cool because there's so many

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.729 
of cool because there's so many
different<00:02:21.360> ways<00:02:21.510> how<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.870> craft<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:22.500> many

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
different ways how to craft so many

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.800 
different ways how to craft so many
different<00:02:23.160> types<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.550> fireworks<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.270> I'll

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
different types of fireworks and I'll

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.130 
different types of fireworks and I'll
probably<00:02:25.080> be<00:02:25.410> making<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.950> video<00:02:26.099> how<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.550> craft

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
probably be making a video how to craft

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.059 
probably be making a video how to craft
different<00:02:28.140> types<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.440> fireworks<00:02:28.830> for<00:02:29.010> you

guys so you guys can see what that's all

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.830 
guys so you guys can see what that's all
about

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
about

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.140 
about
however<00:02:31.739> is<00:02:32.100> kind<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.310> cool<00:02:32.459> that's<00:02:32.700> just<00:02:33.030> for

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
however is kind of cool that's just for

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.860 
however is kind of cool that's just for
fireworks<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.720> we<00:02:33.900> can<00:02:34.170> still<00:02:34.500> be<00:02:34.650> lazy<00:02:34.950> and

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
fireworks that we can still be lazy and

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.360 
fireworks that we can still be lazy and
we<00:02:36.870> don't<00:02:37.080> have<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.319> worry<00:02:37.590> about<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:37.980> too<00:02:38.190> much

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
we don't have to worry about it too much

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.030 
we don't have to worry about it too much
just<00:02:38.430> for<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.000> fireworks<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:40.040> catching

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
just for the fireworks and catching

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.009 
just for the fireworks and catching
different<00:02:41.370> types<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.880> formulas<00:02:42.660> for<00:02:42.840> that

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
different types of formulas for that

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.780 
different types of formulas for that
however<00:02:43.920> it's<00:02:44.160> kind<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.370> interesting<00:02:44.580> because

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
however it's kind of interesting because

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.420 
however it's kind of interesting because
it<00:02:45.390> kind<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.600> brings<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.110> topic<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:46.980> wonder

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
it kind of brings the topic of I wonder

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.640 
it kind of brings the topic of I wonder
if<00:02:47.670> we<00:02:47.940> will<00:02:48.150> ever<00:02:48.390> have<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.049> feature<00:02:49.290> of

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
if we will ever have the feature of

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.840 
if we will ever have the feature of
having<00:02:50.430> PC<00:02:51.180> crafting<00:02:51.870> for<00:02:52.440> on<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.519> next

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
having PC crafting for on the next

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.940 
having PC crafting for on the next
couple<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.480> updates<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.959> come<00:02:55.230> in<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.799> near

future<00:02:56.100> math<00:02:56.400> changes<00:02:56.670> going<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.850> be<00:02:56.910> coming

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
future math changes going to be coming

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.400

PC crafting for G studios already told

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.120 
PC crafting for G studios already told
us<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:04.170> gonna<00:03:04.290> be<00:03:04.440> really<00:03:04.470> really

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
us that is gonna be really really

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.340 
us that is gonna be really really
complex<00:03:05.549> if<00:03:05.790> they<00:03:05.910> ever<00:03:06.090> try<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.750> make<00:03:07.110> that

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
complex if they ever try to make that

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.460 
complex if they ever try to make that
type<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:08.360> crafting<00:03:09.360> mode<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.750> where<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.380> have

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
type of crafting mode and where you have

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.960 
type of crafting mode and where you have
to<00:03:10.560> like<00:03:10.830> craft<00:03:11.130> individually<00:03:11.760> with<00:03:11.880> the

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
to like craft individually with the

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.970 
to like craft individually with the
formulas<00:03:12.420> its<00:03:12.900> me<00:03:13.019> super<00:03:13.470> super<00:03:13.590> complicated

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
formulas its me super super complicated

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.360 
formulas its me super super complicated
and<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:15.299> honestly<00:03:15.780> don't<00:03:16.230> see<00:03:16.620> them<00:03:16.799> making<00:03:17.190> it

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
and I honestly don't see them making it

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.979 
and I honestly don't see them making it
in<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.489> near<00:03:17.640> future<00:03:17.850> but<00:03:18.180> how<00:03:18.329> crazy<00:03:18.750> would

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
in the near future but how crazy would

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.050 
in the near future but how crazy would
that<00:03:19.140> be<00:03:19.320> if<00:03:19.380> we'd<00:03:19.620> have<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:19.950> manually<00:03:20.670> crap

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
that be if we'd have to manually crap

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.319 
that be if we'd have to manually crap
everything<00:03:22.190> okay<00:03:23.190> with<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.700> crafting<00:03:24.239> table

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
everything okay with the crafting table
