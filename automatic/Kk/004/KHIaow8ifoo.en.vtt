00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.230
 Hi, I'm Luján Mora, professor at the University of Alicante and this video 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.799
 tutorial is part of a series of video tutorials 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:10.890
 dedicated to study design errors 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.560
 Desirability and accessibility that it presents in important websites 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:17.820
 the website that we are going to make next 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.390
 is the main railway operator of Spain 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.259
 the renfe operator company 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:23.260
 nowadays 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.840
 renfe is the only passenger operator in the Spanish railway sector 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.920
 In this video tutorial we will analyze the consistency in the management of 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.290
 dates and the user interface of the france website 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.310
 Consistency is one of the characteristics that influence the 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.620
 usability of a website 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.760
 to achieve consistency he explained to frezeer a similar interface throughout the 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.190
 website and that the items that appear in various parts of the website 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.330
 they have always been used in the same way 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.999
 however how are we going to discover next 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:56.370
 on the renfe website 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.300
 you can enter dates in different ways 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.300
 which can cause problems for many users 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.000
 if we click on this link 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.840
 we go to a web page 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.230
 where we can check the departure and arrival times of trains 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.540
 between two cities 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.659
 to enter the date of the trip 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.550
 we see that we inherit select the day 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.359
 the month and the year 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:22.359
 through these three drop-down lists separately 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.230
 without this page we click on this year announcement 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.390
 we go to this page where we can check the schedules of 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.930
 outskirts of the city of madrid 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.020
 now we see that the date of the trip 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.420
 a single drop-down list is introduced 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.350
 in which a series of dates appear 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.979
 we click on this link 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.220
 to go the purchase page 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.640
 we come to this page where we can enter the date 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.000
 two ways 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.120
 we can write the date directly in this text box 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.380
 but we are not told what format we should use or can 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.950
 click on this button 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.200
 and it will show 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.649
 a calendar in which we can select 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.510
 The day of the trip 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.409
 from the page we can go to my trips 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:12.649
 print tickets 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.909
 and this page appears in which the way to enter the date 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.599
 apparently coincident with the previous page 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.639
 but by clicking on this button 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:25.689
 a calendar appears with a slightly different format than the previous one 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.690
 if we continue browsing the renfe website 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.110
 We can get to this page that allows us to buy a ticket for the 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.789
 trenhotel to portugal 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:39.069
 on this page the date can not be entered can not be written 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.180
 directly 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.849
 as in the previous case 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.639
 we can only click on this button 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.889
 to show a calendar with a different format 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:48.999
 to the previous ones 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:50.099
 and that in addition 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.969
 it is not displayed correctly 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:53.819
 by last 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.720
 However, be removed from holidays on the renfe website 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.699
 we found a new method to enter the dates 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:02.009
 here we can again write the date 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:03.080
 directly 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.189
 although again we are not told what format we should use 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:08.370
 or we can press 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.639
 about this engine 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:10.810
 and it will show 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.469
 a calendar with a totally different format to all the previous ones 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.529
 recapitulating on renfe's website we have found six different ways 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.370
 inside without a date 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.869
 sure there is some other way that we have not found 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:29.229
 This situation is normal and acceptable 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:30.779
 it is not acceptable 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:33.019
 in a few words it is a fudge 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.949
 that a company as a hostage allows itself to be these errors in 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:39.259
 your appointment on your website gives me a lot to think about 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:42.739
 the next time I get a rebound in a renfe train I will cross my fingers 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.739
 so that everything goes well and there is no crossing of lines 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:49.280
 and with this end this video tutorial 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.390
 that has shown the problem of consistency in the handling of dates 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.439
 presenting the site returns to france 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.680
 If you liked it, I recommend you visualize and another video tutorial about 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.620
 the names of the cities 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.069
 on the renfe website
