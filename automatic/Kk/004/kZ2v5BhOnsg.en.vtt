00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.600
 hello in this tutorial I want to show you 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.730
 how to make these Christmas canes that 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.170
 they are made with clean pipes and which 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.449
 they can be a craft so that 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.039
 let's do with our children good for 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.370
 doing it we're going to need three clean 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:24.840
 pipes are going to be one in white red 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.840
 and one green 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.000
 here is 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.580
 and with these he will reach us to do 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.760
 2 little sticks the first thing we have to 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.210
 to do is cut our clean pipes by 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.210
 half 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:58.430
 then we are going to join the red with the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.430
 white thus turning the nothing more 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.990
 and unclog you bend a little 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:15.759
 so that the tip is bent and we do not 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.759
 It stings or itches our children 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.460
 A) Yes 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.830
 we only doubled a little 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:31.340
 Bend 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.340
 A) Yes 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.409
 and good here is already what is our 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.570
 cane to make the moÃ±ito 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.740
 we leave nothing else 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.479
 a bit that will be this part 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.710
 and with our finger we are going to do what 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.710
 It's a little hair 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.200
 we cross 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.200
 we form the other petal 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.880
 we open it well and go again to 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.050
 cross this in the middle so that it is 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.050
 united well 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.400
 and well look at it this way and we 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.160
 will have been completely formed what 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.930
 that is our beautiful and this part already 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.930
 we will also have been parejita miren 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.400
 now you just have to put 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.400
 little bit of glue 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.069
 we put it here 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.450
 and for what is the center of our 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.550
 little sticks we can use a gemita 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.440

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.500
 and we just stick it here in the 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.290
 center and then we get much more 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.010
