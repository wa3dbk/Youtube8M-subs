00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
alright let me just go over articulation

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.139 
alright let me just go over articulation
first<00:00:46.260> he<00:00:46.850> does<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.149> ball<00:00:48.480> jointed<00:00:48.899> head

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
first he does have a ball jointed head

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.819 
first he does have a ball jointed head
which<00:00:51.149> can<00:00:51.390> look<00:00:51.539> up<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.870> down<00:00:51.989> perfectly<00:00:52.530> and

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
which can look up and down perfectly and

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.990 
which can look up and down perfectly and
rotate<00:00:53.699> 360<00:00:54.239> 360<00:00:54.780> degrees<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.129> kind<00:00:56.910> of

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
rotate 360 360 degrees but it kind of

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.880 
rotate 360 360 degrees but it kind of
stuck<00:00:57.660> block<00:00:58.050> bully<00:00:58.739> no<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.550> not<00:01:00.320> there<00:01:01.320> so

stuck block bully no it's not there so

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.929 
stuck block bully no it's not there so
it<00:01:02.160> rotated<00:01:02.550> 360<00:01:02.940> degrees<00:01:03.329> his<00:01:04.519> shoulders<00:01:05.519> do

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.530 
it rotated 360 degrees his shoulders do
are<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.220> ball<00:01:08.220> hinge<00:01:08.460> their<00:01:09.119> ball<00:01:09.299> change

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
but they can't fully rotate because i'm

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.100 
but they can't fully rotate because i'm
afraid<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.270> shoulder<00:01:15.570> pad<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:15.930> might

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
afraid this the shoulder pad here might

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.730 
afraid this the shoulder pad here might
fall<00:01:16.320> off<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:17.340> um<00:01:17.850> yeah<00:01:18.810> they<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.380> still<00:01:19.590> move

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
fall off so um yeah they can still move

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.249 
fall off so um yeah they can still move
up<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.040> down<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.520> little<00:01:20.970> bit<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.420> they<00:01:22.200> do
