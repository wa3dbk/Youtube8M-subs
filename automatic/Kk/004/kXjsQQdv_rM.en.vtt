different<00:01:34.579> that's<00:01:34.850> a<00:01:34.939> clothesline<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:36.710> that

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
different that's a clothesline and that

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.889 
different that's a clothesline and that
is<00:01:37.039> bad<00:01:37.250> I<00:01:37.310> think<00:01:37.700> it's<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:37.939> try<00:01:38.240> if<00:01:38.299> he<00:01:38.600> doesn't

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
is bad I think it's a try if he doesn't

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.899 
is bad I think it's a try if he doesn't
make<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.229> challenge<00:01:39.710> not<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.369> tackle<00:01:40.789> the

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
make the challenge not the tackle the

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.059 
make the challenge not the tackle the
challenge<00:01:41.329> and<00:01:41.929> that<00:01:41.990> is<00:01:42.319> dangerous<00:01:42.590> and

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
challenge and that is dangerous and

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.859 
challenge and that is dangerous and
there's<00:01:43.520> no<00:01:43.729> doubt<00:01:43.939> that<00:01:43.969> is<00:01:44.270> a<00:01:44.299> yellow<00:01:44.539> star

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
there's no doubt that is a yellow star

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.899 
there's no doubt that is a yellow star
and<00:01:45.859> I<00:01:46.039> think<00:01:46.280> you<00:01:46.340> know<00:01:46.369> we've<00:01:46.579> been<00:01:46.609> talking
