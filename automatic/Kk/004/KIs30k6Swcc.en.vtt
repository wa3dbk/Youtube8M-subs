00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.910 
just a way that you know phones should
be<00:01:42.779> heading<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.139> future<00:01:43.469> kind<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.740> thing

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
be heading in the future kind of thing

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.499 
be heading in the future kind of thing
because<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.340> if<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.639> have<00:01:44.849> this<00:01:44.969> option<00:01:45.240> it

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
because I if you have this option it

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.779 
because I if you have this option it
kind<00:01:45.749> of<00:01:45.779> makes<00:01:45.959> your<00:01:46.229> phone<00:01:46.529> so<00:01:47.340> easy<00:01:47.609> to<00:01:47.759> use

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
and just a lot quicker and faster and

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.069 
and just a lot quicker and faster and
more<00:01:50.159> efficient<00:01:50.639> almost<00:01:51.060> more<00:01:51.569> I<00:01:51.599> think<00:01:51.899> more

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
more efficient almost more I think more

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.080 
more efficient almost more I think more
simple<00:01:52.380> than<00:01:52.409> something<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:52.859> iOS<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.669> you

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
simple than something like iOS so you

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.219 
simple than something like iOS so you
know<00:01:54.209> if<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.389> gets<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.539> little<00:01:54.659> bit<00:01:54.840> too<00:01:54.990> close

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
know if it gets a little bit too close

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.809 
know if it gets a little bit too close
you<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.560> change<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:55.979> as<00:01:56.099> well<00:01:56.279> you<00:01:56.429> can<00:01:56.609> kind

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
you can change that as well you can kind

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:58.429
