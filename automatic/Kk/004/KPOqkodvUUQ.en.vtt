00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:08.110
 hello everyone because you're fine 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.940
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:15.219
 realize the heel of a sock with 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:18.109
 a giant knit or a premium knit 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.659
 here it is a knitting martha 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:27.560
 stewart 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:31.210
 so I limited the halves of the knitting 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:36.520
 with colored pimples 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:38.800
 here is the first part of the heel two 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.210
 little remarks before starting the 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:46.329
 first is that this video made 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.230
 with a camera above the 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.680
 tricotin 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.170
 looking at the knitting as if you 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.170
 you were doing the same 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.469
 second remark this video is under 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.109
 copyright thanks if you want to post it 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.030
 on another site at our block of me 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:07.060
 ask permission before there is 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.360
 starting first cardboard part of the peak 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:15.000
 at number one and the colorful pico at the 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.470
 half at the half of the knitting 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.140
 here we are going to knit 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.409
 since a 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:29.020
 at peak at the 16th I put exactly the same 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:33.340
 number of picot on the ms that on a 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.729
 knit a premium ie 30 of 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.729
 pin 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.810
 here I go first 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.320
 the last wave so the yachtman 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.830
 stand alone then I thought about 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.830
 job 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.570
 who knows not to go too fast for 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.750
 the uma is not blurry and pau 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:17.290
 see what I'm doing here 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:24.480
 now the return of the peak to number 1 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.480
 the peak at level 1 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.490
 or for the ms like trying to spades 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.480
 also lies at half of the 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.480
 knit length 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.950
 here 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.650
 I think first of all the last rail as well 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.480
 all the corn have given eu 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.480
 and then the previous ones 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.970
 we will continue as well 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.200
 second row 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:17.840
 or not the second picot 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.840
 and we come to the penultimate ico 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.629
 knitting on one half of the sorting 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.000
 the 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:37.740
 I go first my hours then 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.740
 the previous ones 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.860
 the principle is very simple and in fact 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.370
 he is treated to remember his exit 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.370
 the heel 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.290
 you may wonder why 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:10.440
 Intriguing report prints I started 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:14.640
 on the left, ie in English 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.720
 links at all cases right 1 res 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.799
 it's very sorry it's a wright 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.680
 because it's easier for me to 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.990
 start to top them 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.170
 speak below rather than 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.170
 inverted 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.980
 so now I'm back 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:37.000
 the second rank from 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.000
 the second pitot 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.510
 a report to the peak at the central 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.510
 we are well worth 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.759
 here 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.470
 pass the last mind 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.470
 and the following 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.530
 here 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:23.080
 we continue third rome from the 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.129
 3rd picot 1 2 3 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.129
 of the Center 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.570
 I stop another girl that a two 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.570
 three 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.110
 I spend the last stitch 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.050
 and then the others 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.150
 the return of the 3rd rank 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.810
 then is already on the 3rd mikko 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:28.860
 where stops at the third goal as from 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.860
 colorful center 

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:52.949
 the fourth rank 1 2 3 4 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:07:03.610
 contrite side 2 4th nico from the meaning 

00:06:56.629 --> 00:07:07.209
 and we stop capital 1 2 3 4 before 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.209
 other centers 

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:29.070
 that was to go a little back on 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:32.760
 talk about 80 picot 1 2 3 4 

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.760
 from center 

00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:43.580
 and we stop 

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:43.580
 at the fourth pole 1 2 3 4 

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.260
 from the other source 

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:53.220
 nothing complicated 

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:56.150
 just make sure you do not forget 

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.150
 a return 

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:03.520
 or a step to be wrong of the spicy from 

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.700
 from which one starts or until which one 

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.700
 go
