 or show multitasking a whole that 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:43.819
 should have had a place in this 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.369
 video auxerois but unfortunately 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:49.549

 2 thanks to this tweak you will not have 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.579
 need to use the folders because apex 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.350
 2 allows you to group your 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.310
 applications that have roughly the 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.770
 same functions of use 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.790

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.159
 tidy what better 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.580
 iphone notifications does it take 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.649
 not too much room when I think yes 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.630
 I present you tiny bar when you 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.459
 will receive a notification she will be 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.170
 displayed in the status bar I find 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.510
 by the way that in pre cute 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.269
 besides another tweet that will make 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.370
 your useful status status bar vol 2 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.019

 gives status bar when you 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.190
 increase or decrease it to not be 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.459
 disturbed while you look at one 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.739
 of my protected videos iphone that's 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.870
 good but with appearance there is better 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.480

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.000
 applications with child and putting a 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.290
 password why this is because there is 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.299
 I personally find that 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.680
 the interface and presentation of this 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.630
 tweak is much better than tweets 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.880
 which offers the same kind of function 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.319
