00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.480 
the environmental protection agency
requirements<00:00:17.750> huh<00:00:18.980> let's<00:00:19.980> see<00:00:20.130> if<00:00:20.250> we<00:00:20.369> can

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
requirements huh let's see if we can

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
protection and what we're doing with it

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.109 
protection and what we're doing with it
that's<00:00:27.090> kind<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.330> cool<00:00:28.010> so<00:00:29.010> there's<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.429> all

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
right so you got a view the engine

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.160 
right so you got a view the engine
here's<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> carburetor<00:00:33.329> obviously<00:00:33.899> i<00:00:33.930> took

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
here's the carburetor obviously i took

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.500 
here's the carburetor obviously i took
the<00:00:34.260> fuel<00:00:34.469> line<00:00:34.710> I've<00:00:34.860> got<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.130> connected<00:00:35.579> runs

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the fuel line I've got it connected runs

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.380 
the fuel line I've got it connected runs
up<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.140> two<00:00:37.829> my<00:00:38.010> nice<00:00:38.280> little<00:00:38.520> flasks<00:00:38.879> up<00:00:39.149> here

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
up and two my nice little flasks up here

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.510 
up and two my nice little flasks up here
I'm<00:00:40.170> going<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.379> control<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.860> fuel<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.280> way

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
I'm going to control the fuel that way

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.170 
I'm going to control the fuel that way
so<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.719> see<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.940> cut<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> fuel

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
so you can see it I can cut the fuel

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.850 
so you can see it I can cut the fuel
line<00:00:45.420> or<00:00:45.600> take<00:00:45.750> completely<00:00:46.350> off<00:00:46.500> if<00:00:46.710> it

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
line or take completely off if it

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.040 
line or take completely off if it
decides<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.309> wants<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.640> run<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.899> said

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
decides it wants to run like I said

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.110 
decides it wants to run like I said

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
got back up with the 8-inch cell for

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.729 
got back up with the 8-inch cell for
that<00:00:57.000> if<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.329> need<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.960> we're<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.620> give

it a go like this and see what we get so
first<00:01:02.010> answer<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.850> fuel<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:04.580> this<00:01:05.580> fuel

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
remember if the choke is on this well

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.420 
remember if the choke is on this well
okay<00:01:25.920> that's<00:01:26.160> choke<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.700> that's<00:01:27.030> choke<00:01:27.330> off

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
okay that's choke on that's choke off

okay that's choke on that's choke off
let's<00:01:29.430> put<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.640> choke<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:31.010> engine<00:01:32.390> is<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
let's put the choke on engine is in the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.500 
let's put the choke on engine is in the
on<00:01:33.840> position<00:01:33.870> so<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.920> should<00:01:35.100> run<00:01:35.310> any<00:01:36.270> other

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
on position so it should run any other

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:59.000 
on position so it should run any other
switches<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.080> thing<00:01:37.260> nope<00:01:37.700> that's

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.729 

okay<00:02:19.849> that<00:02:20.849> was<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> governor<00:02:21.989> finally<00:02:22.470> kicking

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
okay that was a governor finally kicking

okay that was a governor finally kicking
on<00:02:22.980> we're<00:02:23.160> not<00:02:23.280> on<00:02:23.459> hydrogen<00:02:23.910> yet<00:02:24.239> it's<00:02:24.390> just

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
on we're not on hydrogen yet it's just

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.030 
on we're not on hydrogen yet it's just
on<00:02:24.780> gas

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:53.640 

go<00:02:29.549> ahead<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.700> turn<00:02:29.909> the<00:02:30.060> fuel<00:02:30.239> off

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:24.570 

see<00:02:54.159> the<00:02:54.310> fuel<00:02:54.579> in<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.939> line<00:02:55.120> right<00:02:55.450> here

let's<00:03:24.940> see<00:03:25.120> what<00:03:25.210> happens<00:03:25.570> when<00:03:25.690> we<00:03:25.810> put<00:03:25.990> the

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
let's see what happens when we put the

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.970 
let's see what happens when we put the
hydrogen<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.800> it

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:36.120 

who<00:03:29.980> flooded<00:03:30.490> it<00:03:31.680> huh<00:03:34.200> muscle<00:03:35.200> must<00:03:35.920> have<00:03:36.040> been

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
who flooded it huh muscle must have been

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.100 
who flooded it huh muscle must have been
pumping<00:03:36.490> too<00:03:36.640> much<00:03:36.850> directly<00:03:37.240> into<00:03:37.600> it<00:03:37.630> let's

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
pumping too much directly into it let's

00:03:38.110 --> 00:04:05.330 
pumping too much directly into it let's
give<00:03:38.350> or<00:03:38.470> start<00:03:38.800> again<00:03:39.040> that's<00:03:39.819> encouraging

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:14.340 

no<00:04:06.340> liquid<00:04:06.790> in<00:04:06.910> it<00:04:09.570> stir<00:04:10.570> before<00:04:10.750> oxygen<00:04:13.350> and

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
no liquid in it stir before oxygen and

00:04:14.350 --> 00:05:13.020 
no liquid in it stir before oxygen and
then<00:04:14.470> got<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:14.680> plug

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:22.390 

hmm<00:05:19.000> don't<00:05:20.000> cut<00:05:20.180> the<00:05:20.300> video
