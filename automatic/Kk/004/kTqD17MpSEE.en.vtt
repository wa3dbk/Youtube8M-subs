00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.099
 galera oak cheer with one more video 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.769
 I 'm here to teach you today. 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.360
 you a really cool technique to do 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.550
 3d drawings and this will help a lot 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.960
 You only have one but you will have to 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.230
 to use photoshop that's why it's 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.810
 here is we will open here nor a new file 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.130
 or control and we will put and 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.949
 let's select the international role 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.710
 that the a4 that is the leaf that we go 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.120
 use to do the drawing later 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.860
 that statement here in photoshop or 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.380
 do the drawing and pediatric you 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.450
 understand more or less how it's done here 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.190
 but the process is simple we will 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.079
 do with this sheet now we'll go 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.030
 duplicate and we will take the selection of 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.420
 down just pay we will do the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.050
 next, we're going to have the control 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.760
 either to transform a to the drawing ne 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.590
 in case the layer that is using people 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.590
 will decrease it by picking up here 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.079
 Let's narrow it down here and 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.049
 here but is already good with holding the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.110
 shift we went and put it to the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.330
 corner to attract not i count holding 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.860
 against what you put so the shift 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.390
 same time she or she will stay 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.299
 up and down if you hold the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.850
 kicked in an equal proportion 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.750
 You do the same here or you can use 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.880
 the perspective of believing 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.210
 transformation and perspective is 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.890
 first we select here too 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:34.350
 then you can lower with control 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.750
 I'll tell you what I need to know. 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.820
 Check the best shape for you I 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.140
 use so you already have a notion more or 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.020
 less than what I want to do 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.049
 right there you position here because 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.420
 in this way to win because here people 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.970
 It is positioning the prospect of our 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.770
 camera is for the drawing design it has 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.320
 to be seen from this position so that 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.659
 stay in 3d if it is not seen 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.030
 position and will not look like a 3d drawing 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.040
 ok it has to be seen from this position 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.469
 good I draw that choose as I am 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.310
 fan so choose a bock support a drawing 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.350
 very simple 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.690
 then this is because the ball will're 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.640
 posting lanús and dot com designs 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.840
 I'll post as soon as the 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.720
 video 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.849
 and that's when you simply play 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.349
 dragging the way I did so the 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.830
 right trailing layer 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.730
 so it's here and then we're going to some 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.019
 drawing is not very high quality 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.849
 strange because the ball is not with 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.500
 a lot of quality to all his life but that 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.060
 no matter how important it is that people 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.360
 will do now we will decrease it 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.280
 and put it on the stage here, see. 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.390
 our design for him to stay 3d 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:43.590
 Look, I came here to do it. 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.660
 Interesting here or so he 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.260
 is leaving a little bit of the area of 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.299
 leaf itself that that part in 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.769
 white and I put my finger on the monitor 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.860
 it's very stupid 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.650
 beauty is put on the finger monitors 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.060
 ridiculously there you select the area 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.190
 you want to do because ball to 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.410
 to appear in 3d and such put 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.180
 Here we are going to do the following to 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.099
 become even more interesting to 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.959
 leave the 3d effect even more 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.030
 we will select will duplicate this 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.069
 layer and we will work with the layer of 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.590
 down there we will give a check have 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.359
 on her and she's going to stay like this look here 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.819
 the inside I'm doing this is 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.940
 and generate a shadow effect underneath 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.739
 you can see there it can be the same as 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.019
 Belt is the same as we are going to use the contra 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.670
 the hull and we will totally decrease the 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.389
 also light it was all black 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.880
 OK 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.420
 there only no shade without all black 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.120
 huh 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.030
 I've been in filter blurs it from here. 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.099
 Let's use the Glaucian blur. See? 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.169
 It looks like has already anne effect is 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.000
 interesting we can use up to a 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:47.340
 opacity to improve this effect is 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.609
 seeing there we can select where 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.560
 more or less is this shadow 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.480
 At that time, the ready ball was perfect. 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.910
 I do not need to touch the drawing anymore 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.329
 so I want to see the 3D drawing 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.239
 on the stage simple hotel like this 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.859
 or a good thing of two minutes and already 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.590
 prepared the image by paper 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.269
 where you will do and will select the 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.280
 let's select the two in mauá the three 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.139
 together let's merge this layer 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.700
 And we'll do the following look. 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.540
 Seeing below that she is out of the 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.280
 stage 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.760
 we will do the following still a 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.260
 Here we have our own in no time. 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.440
 It will happen this also it is 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.660
 selected from the right stage 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.650
 We'll get the contract again and 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.550
 will simply catelan to the top 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.690
 that's exactly how we're going to have to 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.360
 do our example 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.780
 so now you know what to do with 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.970
 your A4 sheet on your A4 sheet you go 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.010
 have to draw the design of this form 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.010
 draw the payout too far 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.900
 It's such a relaxed holiday season . 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.130
 so you're going to have to draw from 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:54.440
 Why do I play ball and that's how it goes? 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.640
 the drawing in the correct perspective and 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.200
 in 3d 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.760
 if you do it that way you can have 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.630
 sure your desire is to stay very well 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.250
 setted up 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.750
 that the camera that will set the 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.980
 3d position but that's how it has to 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.390
 to be drawn 3d 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:10.070
 Okay, just as it's not so good, I'll go 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.780
 do the speedy so far hopefully 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:17.240
 You appreciate it's going to be very simple as well. 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:20.270
 quiet'll focus a lot on in the 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:38.110
 I do not want to show that the technique 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:38.110
 works for you then the photo 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.479
 That's it, the video stays around here. 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.580
 that you liked this video did not 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:03.380
 forget to share by clicking like 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.720
 which is one of the most 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.610
 important to publicize the work of 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.620
 a content producer for youtube 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.150
 We also have a blog going to give 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.520
 no point with where you can have 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.199
 Agenda better with us there and has everything 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.080
 connected to facebook there I can 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:19.520
 materials that use the videos and 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.080
 art-related posts 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.729
 we have here a list of 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.100
 production where you can find 

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:28.039
 very interesting and varied content 

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:30.020
 there in the channel and is also very important 

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:31.910
 say that if you do not know the channel 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.639
 here is a little doll talking to you 

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.330
 subscribe then sign up if you do not 

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:36.800
 knows 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.660
 come to know our project a project 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.460
 interesting that a lot of people already 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.840
 adopted for them then neither learn 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.940
 together with people who do a lot 

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.800
 difference for your work there with 

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.780
 art drawings and things of the genre 

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.620
 okay workout these tests is for you 

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.620
 until the next video
