00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:07.259
 there was light that I dream I will be better than 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.219
 I go to my house 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.219
 but what the fuck 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.059
 leave me 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.300
 I will save you I will save you I will 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.820
 I will save 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.490
 I'm sorry guys but I have to 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.539
 kill but that does not give because they are full 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.890
 of blood 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.890
 shit dies dies dies 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.770
 wholeheartedly moves 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.239
 wham wham wham taking cup 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.390
 when a weapon will be better than the grip 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.969
 and it would also be better for me to leave here 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.820
 most likely these are zombies 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.100
 I'll go for my car and I'll save Juan from 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.699
 sure it's on the disk to watch ass 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.699
 of women 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.560
 for the song 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.790
 and thank God you saved me by 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.890
 true how you knew I was here was 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.890
 something obvious how you like to look ass 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.260
 I thought you would be here hey you know where 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.930

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:01.870
 I think he should be at home better 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.870
 let's save her if that would be the best 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.920
 I do not give a fuck 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.019

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.090
 the bender 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.900
 I think there comes 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.900
 which one get away 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.600
 thanks guys 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.150
 the fast food restaurant 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.970
 I do not think there's any reason that he has 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.110
 reason I think so 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.110
 those values 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.410
 problem you have with me solution 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:24.790

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.790

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.720

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.250
 today thank you friends now let's get out of here 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.800
 that will fill the place of zombies object 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.360
 if I quote this chapter it was very short 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.700
 because we will not know if people will 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.160
 like this but if you tell us that you 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.020

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.430

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.430
