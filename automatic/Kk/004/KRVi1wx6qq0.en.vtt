00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.280 
can move up and down which that that
certainly<00:02:17.430> plays<00:02:17.790> its<00:02:18.030> part<00:02:18.090> in<00:02:18.630> this<00:02:18.990> but

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
certainly plays its part in this but

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.490 
certainly plays its part in this but
another<00:02:20.190> bit<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:21.630> can<00:02:21.810> see<00:02:21.990> right<00:02:22.140> here<00:02:22.200> where

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
another bit you can see right here where

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.820 
another bit you can see right here where
the<00:02:22.620> lockup<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:24.510> just<00:02:24.750> doesn't<00:02:25.200> seat<00:02:25.680> in

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
the lockup is that just doesn't seat in

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.870 
the lockup is that just doesn't seat in
there<00:02:26.010> well<00:02:26.250> at<00:02:26.640> all<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:27.150> mean<00:02:28.160> not<00:02:29.160> even<00:02:29.190> not

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
there well at all I mean not even not

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.270 
there well at all I mean not even not
even<00:02:29.910> almost<00:02:30.300> it's<00:02:30.690> really<00:02:31.310> pretty<00:02:32.310> far<00:02:32.640> off<00:02:32.910> I

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
even almost it's really pretty far off I

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.060 
even almost it's really pretty far off I
mean<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.430> don't<00:02:35.490> know<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.120> would<00:02:37.070> cause

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
mean I don't know that that would cause

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.480 
mean I don't know that that would cause
the<00:02:38.460> blade<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.720> collapse<00:02:40.260> on<00:02:40.560> me<00:02:40.590> well<00:02:41.220> while

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
the blade to collapse on me well while

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.450 
the blade to collapse on me well while
using<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:42.770> but<00:02:43.770> I'm<00:02:43.920> certainly<00:02:44.280> not

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
using it but I'm certainly not

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.130 
using it but I'm certainly not
comfortable<00:02:45.060> with<00:02:45.240> using<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.780> for<00:02:45.960> anything

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
comfortable with using it for anything

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.360 
comfortable with using it for anything
in<00:02:46.950> any<00:02:47.310> hard<00:02:47.580> use<00:02:47.930> because<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:49.080> that<00:02:49.230> if<00:02:50.160> y'all

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
in any hard use because of that if y'all

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.030 
in any hard use because of that if y'all
can<00:02:50.550> see<00:02:50.730> that<00:02:50.910> gap<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:51.390> my<00:02:51.900> camera<00:02:52.710> it<00:02:52.770> turns

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
can see that gap like my camera it turns

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.080 
can see that gap like my camera it turns
out<00:02:53.250> will<00:02:53.490> not<00:02:53.690> autofocus<00:02:54.690> I<00:02:54.840> looked<00:02:55.380> it<00:02:55.530> up

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
out will not autofocus I looked it up

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.780 
out will not autofocus I looked it up
it's<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.240> fixed<00:02:57.540> focus<00:02:57.930> camera<00:02:57.990> so<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.980> sucks

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
it's a fixed focus camera so that sucks

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.590 
it's a fixed focus camera so that sucks
I<00:03:00.120> had<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.930> get<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:01.080> new<00:03:01.200> camera<00:03:01.560> which<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:03.420> don't

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
I had to get a new camera which I don't

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.180 
I had to get a new camera which I don't
have<00:03:03.690> money<00:03:03.930> for<00:03:04.050> right<00:03:04.380> now<00:03:04.410> but<00:03:04.830> I'll<00:03:05.040> work

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
have money for right now but I'll work

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.130 
have money for right now but I'll work
on<00:03:05.370> that

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
on that

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.160 
on that
so<00:03:07.140> anyway<00:03:08.120> really<00:03:09.120> nothing<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.570> can<00:03:09.720> do<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:09.900> mean

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
so anyway really nothing I can do I mean

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.000 
so anyway really nothing I can do I mean
I<00:03:10.530> thought<00:03:11.430> about<00:03:11.490> possibly<00:03:12.120> trying<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:12.480> shave

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
I thought about possibly trying to shave

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.770 
I thought about possibly trying to shave
that<00:03:14.010> bit<00:03:14.220> of<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.370> lock<00:03:14.640> bar<00:03:14.940> down<00:03:15.320> right<00:03:16.320> here

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
that bit of the lock bar down right here

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.490 
that bit of the lock bar down right here
it's<00:03:18.780> just<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.080> I<00:03:19.200> could<00:03:20.750> maybe<00:03:21.750> get<00:03:22.020> it<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.320> fit

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
it's just so I could maybe get it to fit

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.290 
it's just so I could maybe get it to fit
in<00:03:22.620> there<00:03:22.800> right<00:03:23.010> but<00:03:23.340> either<00:03:23.550> way<00:03:23.880> it's<00:03:24.120> gonna

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
in there right but either way it's gonna

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.400 
in there right but either way it's gonna
there's<00:03:24.630> going<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:24.810> be<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:24.990> gap<00:03:25.320> in<00:03:25.880> there<00:03:27.410> so

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
there's going to be a gap in there so

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.020 
there's going to be a gap in there so
there's<00:03:29.100> just<00:03:29.160> no<00:03:29.400> way<00:03:29.520> to<00:03:29.580> get<00:03:29.760> rid<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:29.910> the

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
there's just no way to get rid of the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.690 
there's just no way to get rid of the
blade<00:03:30.240> play<00:03:30.510> if<00:03:31.080> you<00:03:31.170> guys<00:03:31.350> know<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.620> way<00:03:31.890> please

I don't care so much about the grind
