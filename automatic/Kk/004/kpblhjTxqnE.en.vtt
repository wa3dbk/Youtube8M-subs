00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:43.040 

or<00:01:35.200> my<00:01:35.620> avenging<00:01:36.310> so<00:01:37.150> I<00:01:37.180> just<00:01:37.600> gather<00:01:38.440> money

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050

forgot the money and manage III fooled

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.650 
forgot the money and manage III fooled
again<00:01:47.400> you'd<00:01:48.400> asked<00:01:48.610> many<00:01:49.090> times<00:01:49.120> you<00:01:49.480> want

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
again you'd asked many times you want

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.150 
again you'd asked many times you want
just<00:01:49.930> make<00:01:49.990> sure<00:01:50.380> I<00:01:50.680> put<00:01:51.520> money<00:01:51.760> in<00:01:51.880> your<00:01:51.910> bank

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
so I was it all goes I think that it's

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.280 
so I was it all goes I think that it's
best<00:01:58.630> to<00:01:58.750> being<00:01:58.960> a<00:01:59.050> bank<00:01:59.290> just<00:01:59.470> in<00:01:59.650> case<00:02:01.290> that

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
best to being a bank just in case that

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.880 
best to being a bank just in case that
you<00:02:03.090> know<00:02:04.090> just<00:02:04.240> keep<00:02:04.630> them<00:02:04.750> refilling<00:02:07.260> and<00:02:08.260> if
