two healers up here because i'm

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.080 
two healers up here because i'm
receiving<00:01:52.320> healers<00:01:52.710> from<00:01:53.009> let's<00:01:54.000> see<00:01:54.060> a

receiving healers from let's see a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.999 
receiving healers from let's see a

priest and a holy paladin at this point

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.850 
priest and a holy paladin at this point
so<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.570> basically<00:01:57.689> tank<00:01:58.380> tank<00:01:58.770> tank

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860

there<00:02:13.520> we<00:02:13.670> go<00:02:13.819> now<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.390> ground<00:02:14.630> phase<00:02:14.840> is

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
there we go now the ground phase is

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.250 
there we go now the ground phase is
pretty<00:02:15.590> simple<00:02:15.830> have<00:02:16.730> any<00:02:17.120> of<00:02:17.599> your<00:02:17.989> range

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
pretty simple have any of your range

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.850

the spiderlings touch the drones that is

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.600 
the spiderlings touch the drones that is
bad<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.870> tank<00:02:27.319> will<00:02:27.500> take<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.890> drones<00:02:28.160> away

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
bad the tank will take the drones away

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.339 
bad the tank will take the drones away
from<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.880> spiderlings<00:02:29.239> you<00:02:29.599> can<00:02:29.780> see<00:02:29.989> where

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
from the spiderlings you can see where

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.640 
from the spiderlings you can see where
the<00:02:30.500> actual<00:02:31.120> spiderlings<00:02:32.120> are<00:02:32.209> coming<00:02:32.420> out<00:02:32.540> of

the actual spiderlings are coming out of

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.809 
the actual spiderlings are coming out of
once<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:33.709> start<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.040> encounters<00:02:34.459> you<00:02:34.610> can

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
once you start the encounters you can

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.210 
once you start the encounters you can
you<00:02:35.000> know<00:02:35.120> preemptively<00:02:36.080> go<00:02:36.709> ahead<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.069> set

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
you know preemptively go ahead and set

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.600 
you know preemptively go ahead and set
up<00:02:37.250> your<00:02:37.340> CC<00:02:37.849> spinners<00:02:38.890> spiderlings<00:02:39.890> drones

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
up your CC spinners spiderlings drones

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.059 
up your CC spinners spiderlings drones
so<00:02:41.510> here<00:02:41.660> we<00:02:41.690> go<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:41.930> basically<00:02:42.500> go<00:02:42.680> up<00:02:42.890> and

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
so here we go you basically go up and

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.800 
so here we go you basically go up and
down<00:02:43.190> about<00:02:43.459> three<00:02:43.849> times<00:02:44.090> once<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.660> boss

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
down about three times once the boss

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.660 
down about three times once the boss
reaches<00:02:45.200> i<00:02:45.319> believe<00:02:45.620> it's<00:02:45.769> eighty<00:02:46.010> percent<00:02:46.280> it

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
reaches i believe it's eighty percent it

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.770 
reaches i believe it's eighty percent it
might<00:02:46.819> be<00:02:46.970> I'm<00:02:47.060> not<00:02:47.180> a<00:02:47.209> hundred<00:02:47.360> percent<00:02:47.569> sure

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
might be I'm not a hundred percent sure

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.860 
might be I'm not a hundred percent sure
she<00:02:48.530> will<00:02:48.680> come<00:02:48.860> down<00:02:49.069> so<00:02:49.910> here<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.120> am<00:02:50.209> when<00:02:50.840> I

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
she will come down so here I am when I

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.050 
she will come down so here I am when I
but<00:02:51.200> I<00:02:51.230> think<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.620> last<00:02:51.830> phase<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.459> me<00:02:52.670> Tankian

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
but I think the last phase of me Tankian

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.240 
but I think the last phase of me Tankian
are<00:02:53.180> on<00:02:53.299> the<00:02:53.420> upper<00:02:53.660> level<00:02:53.959> and<00:02:54.140> I'm<00:02:55.010> basically

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
are on the upper level and I'm basically

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.130 
are on the upper level and I'm basically
not<00:02:55.610> taking<00:02:55.850> that<00:02:55.880> much<00:02:56.150> damage<00:02:56.360> I<00:02:56.750> have<00:02:57.110> a

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
not taking that much damage I have a

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.420 
not taking that much damage I have a
pretty<00:02:57.430> balanced<00:02:58.430> stamina<00:02:59.269> set<00:02:59.709> with<00:03:00.709> about

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
pretty balanced stamina set with about

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.150 
pretty balanced stamina set with about
53<00:03:02.209> 54<00:03:02.360> percent<00:03:03.080> block<00:03:03.319> chance<00:03:03.620> which<00:03:03.799> is<00:03:03.950> good

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
53 54 percent block chance which is good

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.220 
53 54 percent block chance which is good
and<00:03:04.310> I'm<00:03:05.150> doing<00:03:05.269> a<00:03:05.420> nice<00:03:05.599> little<00:03:05.840> moderate

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
and I'm doing a nice little moderate

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.720 
and I'm doing a nice little moderate
amount<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.500> damage<00:03:06.830> I'm<00:03:07.010> getting<00:03:07.160> my<00:03:07.459> threat

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
amount of damage I'm getting my threat

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.370 
amount of damage I'm getting my threat
up<00:03:07.849> so<00:03:07.970> that<00:03:08.090> when<00:03:08.209> I<00:03:08.239> go<00:03:08.390> down<00:03:08.599> there<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.019> now

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
up so that when I go down there and now

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.740 
up so that when I go down there and now
we<00:03:09.560> pop<00:03:09.830> hero<00:03:10.069> and<00:03:10.310> lust<00:03:10.489> or<00:03:10.760> whatever<00:03:11.000> hero<00:03:11.450> I

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
we pop hero and lust or whatever hero I

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.710 
we pop hero and lust or whatever hero I
guess<00:03:12.110> I<00:03:12.380> like<00:03:13.010> less<00:03:13.190> better<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:14.090> DPS<00:03:14.480> don't

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
guess I like less better the DPS don't

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.990 
guess I like less better the DPS don't
override<00:03:15.019> me<00:03:15.230> in<00:03:15.319> threat<00:03:15.590> 50k<00:03:16.310> jus<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.880> the

override me in threat 50k jus to the
right<00:03:17.180> truce<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:18.640> this<00:03:19.640> is<00:03:19.790> basically<00:03:20.690> a

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
right truce and this is basically a

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.539 
right truce and this is basically a
rinse<00:03:21.019> and<00:03:21.140> repeat<00:03:21.230> of<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.859> ground<00:03:22.070> phase<00:03:22.310> and

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
rinse and repeat of the ground phase and
