00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.920 
do battle with Decepticons whatever he
does<00:00:43.610> so<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.120> detail<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.600> different

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
does so the the detail is different

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.380 
does so the the detail is different
there's<00:00:46.110> stripes<00:00:46.530> all<00:00:46.739> over<00:00:46.770> him<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.309> guess<00:00:48.180> can

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
there's stripes all over him I guess can

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.450 
there's stripes all over him I guess can
call<00:00:48.539> my<00:00:48.690> war<00:00:49.379> stripes<00:00:49.860> or<00:00:50.070> something<00:00:50.340> he's

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
call my war stripes or something he's

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.330 
call my war stripes or something he's
going<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.789> war<00:00:50.969> gotta<00:00:51.930> get<00:00:52.110> his<00:00:52.230> battle<00:00:53.100> paint

detail on the front of the car you can

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.950 
detail on the front of the car you can
barely<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.469> around<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.960> lights

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
barely see it but it's around the lights

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.260 
barely see it but it's around the lights
and<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.350> grill<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.769> everything<00:01:05.100> GMC<00:01:05.909> isn't

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
and the grill and everything GMC isn't

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.300 
and the grill and everything GMC isn't
highlighted<00:01:06.780> with<00:01:07.409> paint<00:01:07.710> it's<00:01:07.860> just<00:01:08.040> black

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
highlighted with paint it's just black

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.399 
highlighted with paint it's just black
as<00:01:08.580> well<00:01:09.210> as<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> Autobot<00:01:09.659> symbol<00:01:09.869> back<00:01:10.140> here

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
as well as the Autobot symbol back here

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.370 
as well as the Autobot symbol back here
you<00:01:10.530> can't<00:01:10.710> even<00:01:10.799> see<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.189> there<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.820> go<00:01:12.770> so<00:01:13.770> I

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
you can't even see it there you go so I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.469 
you can't even see it there you go so I
also<00:01:16.380> these<00:01:16.580> where<00:01:17.580> they<00:01:17.640> come<00:01:17.820> flood<00:01:18.270> light

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
also these where they come flood light

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.140 
also these where they come flood light
flood<00:01:18.840> lights<00:01:19.080> up<00:01:19.290> here<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.770> guess<00:01:20.580> what<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
flood lights up here I guess what the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.960 
flood lights up here I guess what the
column<00:01:21.450> i'm<00:01:21.570> not<00:01:21.689> sure<00:01:21.900> but<00:01:22.159> a<00:01:23.159> lot<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.580> extra

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
column i'm not sure but a lot of extra

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.920 
column i'm not sure but a lot of extra
things<00:01:24.240> added<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.860> vehicle<00:01:26.490> phone<00:01:26.970> which

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
things added to the vehicle phone which

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.469 
things added to the vehicle phone which
i<00:01:28.049> like<00:01:28.259> it's<00:01:28.560> very<00:01:28.770> cool<00:01:28.979> i<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.640> some

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
i like it's very cool i like it some

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.420 
i like it's very cool i like it some
definitely<00:01:31.409> better<00:01:31.680> than<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.070> other<00:01:32.189> ones

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
definitely better than the other ones

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.980 
definitely better than the other ones
we've<00:01:32.610> gotten<00:01:32.909> because<00:01:33.479> there's<00:01:33.630> actually

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
we've gotten because there's actually

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.819 
we've gotten because there's actually
added<00:01:34.890> features<00:01:35.340> onto<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> vehicle<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.829> don't

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
added features onto the vehicle I don't

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.469 
added features onto the vehicle I don't
mind<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.130> paint<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.670> stripes<00:01:38.939> or<00:01:39.210> anything

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
mind the paint the stripes or anything

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.679 
mind the paint the stripes or anything
like<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.840> think<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.200> looks<00:01:40.350> great<00:01:41.689> so

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
like that I think it looks great so

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.219 
like that I think it looks great so
let's<00:01:42.869> get<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.729> robot<00:01:44.729> mode<00:01:45.140> I'm<00:01:46.140> not

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
let's get to the robot mode I'm not

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.780 
let's get to the robot mode I'm not
going<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.439> transform<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.009> there<00:01:47.220> are<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.399> few

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
going to transform it there are a few

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.630 
going to transform it there are a few
slight<00:01:48.299> differences<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.930> transformation

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
slight differences in the transformation

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.889 
slight differences in the transformation
basically<00:01:50.640> these<00:01:50.850> doors<00:01:51.270> right<00:01:51.509> here<00:01:51.540> are

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
basically these doors right here are

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.230 
basically these doors right here are
separated<00:01:52.470> from<00:01:52.500> these<00:01:52.890> ones<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.520> in

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
separated from these ones so in

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.880 
separated from these ones so in
transformation<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.049> just<00:01:55.229> pop<00:01:55.409> these<00:01:55.590> ones

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
transformation you just pop these ones

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.889 
transformation you just pop these ones
straight<00:01:56.250> up<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:57.090> that's<00:01:57.270> pretty<00:01:57.450> much<00:01:57.540> all

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
straight up so that's pretty much all

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.580 
straight up so that's pretty much all
the<00:01:58.969> differences<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.030> there<00:02:00.270> are<00:02:00.590> there

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
the differences that there are there

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.200 
the differences that there are there
might<00:02:01.710> be<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.860> few<00:02:02.040> other<00:02:02.219> ones<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.490> I'll<00:02:02.820> miss

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
might be a few other ones that I'll miss

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.880 
might be a few other ones that I'll miss
but<00:02:03.659> it's<00:02:03.810> not<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> big<00:02:04.170> deal<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.590> let's<00:02:04.740> just

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
but it's not a big deal so let's just

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.620 
but it's not a big deal so let's just
get<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.189> robot<00:02:05.579> mode<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.360> here<00:02:06.509> we<00:02:06.600> have

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
get to the robot mode so here we have

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.839 
get to the robot mode so here we have
iron<00:02:06.960> hide<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.320> robot<00:02:07.710> form<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.459> the

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
iron hide in robot form and the

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.140 
iron hide in robot form and the
differences<00:02:09.420> are<00:02:09.450> there<00:02:10.580> there's<00:02:11.580> like<00:02:11.819> too

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
differences are there there's like too

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.730 
differences are there there's like too
many<00:02:12.270> differences<00:02:12.720> may<00:02:12.900> be<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.200> can<00:02:13.410> think

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
many differences may be that I can think

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.980 
many differences may be that I can think
if<00:02:13.830> that's<00:02:14.490> a<00:02:14.580> back<00:02:14.760> piece<00:02:15.000> here<00:02:15.330> it's<00:02:15.570> a

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
if that's a back piece here it's a

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.710 
if that's a back piece here it's a
little<00:02:16.080> bit<00:02:16.500> wider<00:02:16.950> fatter<00:02:17.400> this<00:02:18.270> is<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.510> lot

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
little bit wider fatter this is a lot

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.980 
little bit wider fatter this is a lot
more<00:02:18.750> going<00:02:19.380> on<00:02:19.560> back<00:02:19.800> here<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.450> the

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
more going on back here and that the the

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.950 
more going on back here and that the the
face<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.230> different<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:23.310> differently

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
face is different so differently

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.470 
face is different so differently
sculpted<00:02:24.960> head<00:02:25.230> as<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.040> can<00:02:26.190> see<00:02:26.400> i<00:02:26.610> don't

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
sculpted head as you can see i don't

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.060 
sculpted head as you can see i don't
know<00:02:27.540> if<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:27.660> can<00:02:27.750> see<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:27.930> very<00:02:28.020> well<00:02:28.200> but<00:02:28.950> it

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
know if you can see it very well but it

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.410 
know if you can see it very well but it
is<00:02:29.190> different<00:02:29.460> i<00:02:29.700> think<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.000> has<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> little<00:02:30.270> bit

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
is different i think it has a little bit

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.630 
is different i think it has a little bit
more<00:02:30.540> articulation<00:02:31.050> any<00:02:31.410> other<00:02:31.530> ones<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:32.040> don't

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
more articulation any other ones I don't

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.100 
more articulation any other ones I don't
have<00:02:32.790> any<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.180> other<00:02:33.330> ones<00:02:33.540> out<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:34.020> I

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
have any of the other ones out so I

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.150 
have any of the other ones out so I
can't<00:02:34.350> compare<00:02:34.770> it<00:02:34.950> but<00:02:35.910> oh<00:02:36.030> well<00:02:36.890> but<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.950> think

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
can't compare it but oh well but I think

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.530 
can't compare it but oh well but I think
the<00:02:38.280> main<00:02:38.460> feature<00:02:38.880> of<00:02:39.390> this<00:02:39.690> guy<00:02:39.960> his<00:02:40.500> weapons

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
the main feature of this guy his weapons

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.750 
the main feature of this guy his weapons
you<00:02:42.540> have<00:02:42.690> his<00:02:43.110> forearm<00:02:43.740> canonet<00:02:44.280> hooks<00:02:44.550> up<00:02:44.730> to

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
you have his forearm canonet hooks up to

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.800 
you have his forearm canonet hooks up to
the<00:02:45.140> bumper<00:02:46.140> here<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.400> makes<00:02:47.550> like<00:02:47.730> a

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
the bumper here and makes like a

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.230 
the bumper here and makes like a
crossbow<00:02:48.810> looking<00:02:49.110> thing<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.910> hooks<00:02:51.000> onto

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
crossbow looking thing and it hooks onto

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.220 
crossbow looking thing and it hooks onto
his<00:02:52.310> forum<00:02:53.310> just<00:02:53.610> like<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:54.030> if<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.900> can<00:02:55.050> get<00:02:55.170> it

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
his forum just like this if I can get it

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.800 
his forum just like this if I can get it
on<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.490> fire<00:02:56.670> is<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.850> missile<00:02:57.320> so<00:02:59.810> that's

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
on and the fire is a missile so that's

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.290 
on and the fire is a missile so that's
cool<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.440> guess<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:02.070> mine<00:03:02.430> has<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.790> little<00:03:03.000> hard

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
cool I guess it mine has a little hard

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.480 
cool I guess it mine has a little hard
time<00:03:03.480> staying<00:03:03.870> on<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.530> falls<00:03:04.830> off<00:03:05.010> every<00:03:05.340> once

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
time staying on it falls off every once

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.140 
time staying on it falls off every once
in<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.700> while<00:03:05.850> but<00:03:06.150> oh<00:03:06.330> well<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:08.040> then<00:03:08.850> you<00:03:08.970> take

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
in a while but oh well and then you take

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.860 
in a while but oh well and then you take
his<00:03:09.270> other<00:03:09.560> canon<00:03:10.560> here<00:03:11.330> stick<00:03:12.330> it<00:03:12.450> on<00:03:12.570> and

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
his other canon here stick it on and

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.180 
his other canon here stick it on and
then<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.230> can<00:03:13.410> like<00:03:13.850> make<00:03:14.850> this<00:03:15.060> huge<00:03:15.540> gun<00:03:16.190> see

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
then you can like make this huge gun see

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.210 
then you can like make this huge gun see
if<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.430> can<00:03:17.550> remember<00:03:17.670> how<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:17.910> do<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:19.220> stick

so<00:04:59.220> if<00:04:59.310> you<00:04:59.400> don't<00:04:59.550> have<00:04:59.699> Ironhide<00:05:00.199> look<00:05:01.199> for

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
so if you don't have Ironhide look for

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.249 
so if you don't have Ironhide look for
this<00:05:01.470> guy<00:05:01.590> pick<00:05:02.039> him<00:05:02.130> up<00:05:02.690> he's<00:05:03.690> well<00:05:03.900> worth<00:05:04.139> it

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259 
this guy pick him up he's well worth it

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:10.990 
this guy pick him up he's well worth it
so<00:05:07.259> I<00:05:08.180> guess<00:05:09.180> that's<00:05:09.449> pretty<00:05:09.780> much<00:05:09.870> it<00:05:10.110> there's

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
so I guess that's pretty much it there's

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.790 
so I guess that's pretty much it there's
his<00:05:12.000> take<00:05:12.720> a<00:05:12.750> look<00:05:12.930> at<00:05:13.020> is<00:05:13.139> I<00:05:13.259> just<00:05:13.320> we<00:05:13.530> can<00:05:13.650> take

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
his take a look at is I just we can take

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.499 
his take a look at is I just we can take
a<00:05:13.830> look<00:05:13.949> at<00:05:14.070> his<00:05:14.160> cannons<00:05:14.610> real<00:05:14.820> quick<00:05:15.090> the

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:15.509 
a look at his cannons real quick the

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.409 
a look at his cannons real quick the
differences<00:05:16.050> much<00:05:16.800> smaller<00:05:17.160> than<00:05:17.330> what<00:05:18.330> we

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
differences much smaller than what we

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:19.850 
differences much smaller than what we
got<00:05:18.599> in<00:05:18.720> the<00:05:18.810> first<00:05:18.990> I<00:05:19.229> from<00:05:19.530> the<00:05:19.620> first

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
got in the first I from the first

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.860 
got in the first I from the first
Ironhide<00:05:20.250> two<00:05:20.639> years<00:05:20.880> ago<00:05:21.000> actually<00:05:21.419> going<00:05:21.720> on

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
Ironhide two years ago actually going on

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.219 
Ironhide two years ago actually going on
three<00:05:22.110> years<00:05:22.139> ago<00:05:22.759> they're<00:05:23.759> just<00:05:24.080> the<00:05:25.080> other

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
three years ago they're just the other

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:26.930 
three years ago they're just the other
ones<00:05:25.500> are<00:05:25.560> like<00:05:25.620> just<00:05:25.919> really<00:05:26.130> big<00:05:26.430> and<00:05:26.460> fat

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
ones are like just really big and fat

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.670 
ones are like just really big and fat
these<00:05:27.240> ones<00:05:27.449> are<00:05:27.570> small<00:05:27.870> more<00:05:28.500> accurate<00:05:29.039> and

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
these ones are small more accurate and

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:39.159 
these ones are small more accurate and
better<00:05:31.680> detail<00:05:32.190> made<00:05:32.699> fire<00:05:33.060> missiles<00:05:35.539> so<00:05:38.030> yes

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
better detail made fire missiles so yes

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.120 
better detail made fire missiles so yes
very<00:05:40.169> cool<00:05:40.500> and<00:05:40.860> I<00:05:41.070> guess<00:05:41.250> you<00:05:42.180> can<00:05:42.389> put<00:05:42.780> the

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
very cool and I guess you can put the

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.010 
very cool and I guess you can put the
left<00:05:44.130> arm<00:05:44.340> cannon<00:05:44.789> and<00:05:44.940> you<00:05:45.000> like<00:05:45.330> two<00:05:45.840> ways

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
left arm cannon and you like two ways

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.290 
left arm cannon and you like two ways
you<00:05:46.050> can<00:05:46.229> put<00:05:46.470> it<00:05:46.560> that<00:05:46.710> way<00:05:46.770> or<00:05:47.159> you<00:05:48.150> can

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
you can put it that way or you can

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.969 
you can put it that way or you can
switch<00:05:48.599> it<00:05:48.630> around<00:05:49.190> and<00:05:50.190> have<00:05:50.370> it<00:05:50.520> that<00:05:51.120> way<00:05:51.979> so

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
switch it around and have it that way so

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.600 
switch it around and have it that way so
a<00:05:53.659> lot<00:05:54.659> of<00:05:54.690> different<00:05:55.340> variations<00:05:56.340> to<00:05:56.430> the

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
a lot of different variations to the

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.170 
a lot of different variations to the
weapons<00:05:56.970> you<00:05:57.060> can<00:05:57.180> go<00:05:57.770> like<00:05:58.770> just<00:05:59.490> change<00:06:00.030> it

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180
