00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.150 
thankfully these dive net type fellows
usually<00:02:17.670> take<00:02:18.600> more<00:02:18.840> time<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.140> get<00:02:19.950> out<00:02:20.130> of

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
usually take more time to get out of

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.550 
usually take more time to get out of
their<00:02:20.520> hat<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.600> have<00:02:21.810> more<00:02:21.960> time<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.350> shoot

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
their hat so you have more time to shoot

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.800 
their hat so you have more time to shoot
them<00:02:22.830> though<00:02:23.460> every<00:02:23.880> time<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.240> say<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.690> of

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
them though every time I say that of

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.670 
them though every time I say that of
course<00:02:24.840> things<00:02:25.320> go<00:02:25.500> wrong<00:02:27.380> things<00:02:28.380> almost

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
course things go wrong things almost

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.700 
course things go wrong things almost
went<00:02:28.920> horribly<00:02:29.370> wrong<00:02:29.460> right<00:02:29.910> there<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:31.560> can

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
went horribly wrong right there you can

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.470 
went horribly wrong right there you can
do<00:02:31.830> this<00:02:31.950> without<00:02:32.100> rush<00:02:32.490> jet<00:02:32.730> if<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:33.000> want<00:02:33.210> but

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
do this without rush jet if you want but

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.600 
do this without rush jet if you want but
I'd<00:02:33.630> rather<00:02:33.780> not<00:02:34.080> risk<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:35.180> spikes<00:02:36.180> as<00:02:37.610> well

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
I'd rather not risk the spikes as well

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.430 
I'd rather not risk the spikes as well
I'd<00:02:38.820> rather<00:02:38.970> risk<00:02:39.210> his<00:02:39.420> few<00:02:39.630> spikes<00:02:39.900> as<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.170> can

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
I'd rather risk his few spikes as I can

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.030 
I'd rather risk his few spikes as I can
that<00:02:40.710> spike<00:02:41.640> hallway<00:02:42.090> next<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.930> me<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.950> we

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
that spike hallway next to me and we

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.460 
that spike hallway next to me and we
just<00:02:44.070> kind<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.850> like<00:02:45.030> ignored<00:02:48.080> if<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.230> try<00:02:49.410> to

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
just kind of like ignored if you try to

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.960 
just kind of like ignored if you try to
rush<00:02:49.680> marine<00:02:50.040> through<00:02:50.280> there<00:02:50.460> in<00:02:50.730> my

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
rush marine through there in my

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.900 
rush marine through there in my
experience<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.810> always<00:02:52.050> kills<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.670> who<00:02:53.670> knows

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
experience it always kills you who knows

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.970 
experience it always kills you who knows
so<00:02:54.390> these<00:02:54.540> invisible<00:02:54.930> block<00:02:55.320> parts<00:02:55.650> which<00:02:55.830> I

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
so these invisible block parts which I

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.590 
so these invisible block parts which I
have<00:02:56.280> not<00:02:56.459> yet<00:02:56.700> talked<00:02:57.000> about<00:02:57.300> because<00:02:57.420> I'm

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
have not yet talked about because I'm

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.900 
have not yet talked about because I'm
still<00:02:57.810> stuck<00:02:58.140> behind<00:02:58.350> in<00:02:58.830> my<00:02:58.980> commentary<00:02:59.580> it

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
still stuck behind in my commentary it

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.010 
still stuck behind in my commentary it
is<00:03:00.680> not<00:03:01.680> too<00:03:01.860> bad<00:03:02.420> yeah<00:03:03.420> there's<00:03:03.720> simple

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
is not too bad yeah there's simple

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.630 
is not too bad yeah there's simple
patterns<00:03:04.470> they're<00:03:04.920> not<00:03:05.100> too<00:03:05.310> threatening

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
patterns they're not too threatening

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.090 
patterns they're not too threatening
well<00:03:06.060> there's<00:03:06.270> desk<00:03:06.480> like<00:03:06.750> split<00:03:07.140> up<00:03:07.320> simple

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
well there's desk like split up simple

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.120 
well there's desk like split up simple
patterns<00:03:08.989> God<00:03:09.989> dang<00:03:10.350> yeah<00:03:12.080> so<00:03:13.080> yeah<00:03:13.260> while

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.640 

play<00:03:36.569> it<00:03:36.629> safe<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:36.959> mean<00:03:37.110> ignore<00:03:37.349> everything

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
play it safe I mean ignore everything

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.500 
play it safe I mean ignore everything
because<00:03:38.129> they<00:03:38.370> really<00:03:38.730> don't<00:03:38.910> deserve<00:03:39.120> my

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
because they really don't deserve my

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.890

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
this gloss is twofold one wax is

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.220 
this gloss is twofold one wax is
probably<00:04:05.250> three<00:04:05.400> for<00:04:05.430> one<00:04:05.940> you<00:04:06.690> can't<00:04:06.959> count

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
probably three for one you can't count

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.160 
probably three for one you can't count
on<00:04:07.440> him<00:04:07.470> as<00:04:07.920> much<00:04:08.190> for<00:04:08.489> timing<00:04:08.760> too<00:04:09.690> sometimes

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
on him as much for timing too sometimes

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.380 
on him as much for timing too sometimes
you<00:04:10.530> will<00:04:10.709> stay<00:04:11.519> there<00:04:11.760> long<00:04:11.970> enough<00:04:12.090> for<00:04:12.329> you

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
you will stay there long enough for you

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.330 
you will stay there long enough for you
hit<00:04:12.569> him<00:04:12.660> a<00:04:12.750> few<00:04:12.780> times<00:04:13.110> sometimes<00:04:13.799> it'll<00:04:14.160> be<00:04:14.310> a

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
hit him a few times sometimes it'll be a

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.289 
hit him a few times sometimes it'll be a
few<00:04:14.519> more<00:04:14.819> and<00:04:16.430> oh<00:04:17.430> we<00:04:17.639> killed<00:04:17.820> him<00:04:18.000> before<00:04:18.239> I

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
few more and oh we killed him before I

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.330 
few more and oh we killed him before I
could<00:04:18.450> finish<00:04:18.479> complaining<00:04:19.260> how's<00:04:19.500> that<00:04:19.530> for

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
could finish complaining how's that for

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.690 
could finish complaining how's that for
silliness<00:04:21.770> also<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.889> hit<00:04:23.040> boxes<00:04:23.370> are<00:04:23.520> too<00:04:23.669> big

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
silliness also the hit boxes are too big

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.250 
silliness also the hit boxes are too big
and<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.060> Met<00:04:24.180> pattern<00:04:24.600> seems<00:04:24.870> somewhat

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
and the Met pattern seems somewhat

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.840 
and the Met pattern seems somewhat
random<00:04:25.590> sometimes<00:04:25.800> so<00:04:26.250> my<00:04:26.400> point<00:04:26.610> is<00:04:26.790> that

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
random sometimes so my point is that

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
this stage will very quickly become one

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.029 
this stage will very quickly become one

quite<00:04:50.340> as<00:04:50.460> much<00:04:50.610> you<00:04:51.600> just<00:04:51.810> skip<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.260> spoon

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
quite as much you just skip the spoon

quite as much you just skip the spoon
yes<00:04:55.430> you<00:04:55.699> can<00:04:56.320> not<00:04:57.320> that<00:04:57.590> we<00:04:57.830> can't<00:04:58.040> hit<00:04:58.190> them

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
yes you can not that we can't hit them

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.670 
yes you can not that we can't hit them

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
and they like always hit you unless you

and they like always hit you unless you
time<00:05:01.070> everything<00:05:01.610> exactly<00:05:02.090> right<00:05:02.180> and
