00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
Leslie so got into the corner yes and

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.670 
Leslie so got into the corner yes and
then<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.040> say<00:02:59.550> strong<00:03:00.390> advantage<00:03:00.870> at<00:03:01.500> this

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
then you say strong advantage at this

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.550 
then you say strong advantage at this
distance<00:03:02.040> oh<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.459> should<00:03:02.580> be<00:03:02.610> unsafe

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.460 

I<00:03:07.790> always<00:03:08.790> thought<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.540> it's<00:03:09.959> better<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.260> be

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
I always thought that it's better to be

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.110 
I always thought that it's better to be
thrown<00:03:10.980> just<00:03:11.400> like<00:03:11.490> Leslie's<00:03:11.760> game<00:03:11.910> thrown

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
thrown just like Leslie's game thrown

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.420 
thrown just like Leslie's game thrown
three<00:03:12.240> times<00:03:12.450> better<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.080> get<00:03:13.230> thrown<00:03:13.530> by<00:03:13.740> evil

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
three times better to get thrown by evil

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.240 
three times better to get thrown by evil
Ryu<00:03:14.610> than<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.240> eat<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.680> counter<00:03:16.680> hit<00:03:16.830> combo<00:03:17.130> and

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
Ryu than to eat a counter hit combo and

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.610 
Ryu than to eat a counter hit combo and
then<00:03:17.370> lose<00:03:17.640> like<00:03:17.819> 400<00:03:18.540> dinars<00:03:18.630> what<00:03:19.410> is<00:03:19.500> your

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
then lose like 400 dinars what is your

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.850 
then lose like 400 dinars what is your
philosophy<00:03:20.030> for<00:03:21.030> whether<00:03:21.990> to<00:03:22.170> tech<00:03:22.380> throw<00:03:22.650> or

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
philosophy for whether to tech throw or

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.260 
philosophy for whether to tech throw or
to<00:03:23.010> just<00:03:23.510> like<00:03:24.510> if<00:03:25.500> we<00:03:25.560> were<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.459> corner<00:03:26.910> I

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.920 

so<00:04:37.380> what<00:04:37.560> would<00:04:37.680> you<00:04:37.800> say<00:04:37.980> is<00:04:38.130> that<00:04:38.750> that<00:04:39.750> is

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
so what would you say is that that is

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.360 
so what would you say is that that is
