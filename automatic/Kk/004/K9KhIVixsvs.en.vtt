00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
characters and who they will ultimately

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.640 
characters and who they will ultimately
become<00:03:24.549> is<00:03:24.970> these<00:03:25.480> events<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:26.200> could<00:03:26.350> see<00:03:26.530> the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
become is these events you could see the

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.140 
become is these events you could see the
pain<00:03:26.799> in<00:03:26.860> him<00:03:27.160> when<00:03:27.340> he's<00:03:27.549> talking<00:03:27.940> about<00:03:28.030> I

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
pain in him when he's talking about I

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.520 
pain in him when he's talking about I
lost<00:03:28.510> most<00:03:28.720> of<00:03:28.870> my<00:03:28.930> brothers<00:03:29.290> at<00:03:29.410> this

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
lost most of my brothers at this

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.360 
lost most of my brothers at this
particular<00:03:29.680> point

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
particular point

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.490 
particular point
likewise<00:03:30.850> when<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.120> see<00:03:31.330> Dom<00:03:31.450> I<00:03:31.600> think<00:03:31.630> but

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
likewise when I see Dom I think but

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.289 
likewise when I see Dom I think but
Hoshi<00:03:32.890> Dharma<00:03:33.190> ultimately<00:03:33.610> will<00:03:33.850> manage<00:03:34.269> to

Hoshi Dharma ultimately will manage to

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.979 
overcome the pain and realize you know I
can't<00:03:36.519> keep<00:03:36.670> hating<00:03:36.880> but<00:03:37.120> I<00:03:37.180> think<00:03:37.450> this<00:03:37.840> is

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
can't keep hating but I think this is

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.110 
can't keep hating but I think this is
where<00:03:38.140> you<00:03:38.170> see<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.500> collapse<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.340> moderate

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
where you see the collapse and moderate

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.640 
where you see the collapse and moderate
ideals<00:03:40.480> because<00:03:40.570> right<00:03:41.019> now<00:03:41.170> it<00:03:41.320> looks<00:03:41.380> like

ideals because right now it looks like

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.500 
ideals because right now it looks like
they<00:03:41.920> both<00:03:42.100> have<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.670> right<00:03:42.700> mindset<00:03:43.269> you

because<00:04:11.410> you<00:04:12.160> know<00:04:12.280> a<00:04:12.310> lot<00:04:12.549> of<00:04:12.579> it<00:04:12.790> isn't

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
because you know a lot of it isn't

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.490 
because you know a lot of it isn't
really<00:04:13.180> focused<00:04:13.630> on<00:04:13.750> what's<00:04:13.989> going<00:04:14.200> on<00:04:14.290> right

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
really focused on what's going on right

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.600 
really focused on what's going on right
now<00:04:14.590> and<00:04:14.709> a<00:04:14.799> lot<00:04:14.920> of<00:04:15.070> this<00:04:15.220> is<00:04:15.340> just<00:04:15.370> like<00:04:15.519> a

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
now and a lot of this is just like a

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.560 
now and a lot of this is just like a
history<00:04:16.060> lesson

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
history lesson

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.810 
history lesson
so<00:04:16.900> Sasuke<00:04:17.350> can<00:04:17.500> make<00:04:17.620> up<00:04:17.739> his<00:04:17.829> mind<00:04:17.890> but<00:04:18.579> I

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
so Sasuke can make up his mind but I

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.580 
so Sasuke can make up his mind but I
imagine<00:04:19.510> this<00:04:19.630> will<00:04:19.840> play<00:04:20.140> a<00:04:20.169> part<00:04:20.410> in

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
imagine this will play a part in

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.159 
imagine this will play a part in
Sasuke's<00:04:21.039> decision<00:04:21.549> heavily<00:04:22.419> for<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:22.900> simple

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
Sasuke's decision heavily for the simple

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.420 
Sasuke's decision heavily for the simple
fact<00:04:23.380> that<00:04:23.500> you<00:04:23.770> look<00:04:23.950> at<00:04:24.130> it

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
know this definitely it feels a lot more

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.220 
know this definitely it feels a lot more
warlike<00:04:39.070> than<00:04:39.850> anything<00:04:40.390> we've<00:04:40.690> experienced

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
warlike than anything we've experienced

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.960 
warlike than anything we've experienced
in<00:04:41.380> our<00:04:41.590> timeline<00:04:41.860> are<00:04:42.220> like<00:04:42.520> shit<00:04:42.760> looked

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
in our timeline are like shit looked

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.520

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
real serious and intense back then

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.110 
real serious and intense back then
because<00:04:44.710> they<00:04:44.800> didn't<00:04:45.040> have<00:04:45.190> these<00:04:45.490> big<00:04:45.820> Jews

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
because they didn't have these big Jews

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.370 
because they didn't have these big Jews
whose<00:04:46.420> eyes<00:04:46.600> like<00:04:46.870> you<00:04:46.960> can<00:04:47.080> tell<00:04:47.170> they<00:04:47.290> had

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
whose eyes like you can tell they had

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.110 
whose eyes like you can tell they had
jutsus<00:04:47.830> but<00:04:48.010> it<00:04:48.250> wasn't<00:04:48.610> nothing<00:04:48.700> like<00:04:48.850> what

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
jutsus but it wasn't nothing like what

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.400 
jutsus but it wasn't nothing like what
we<00:04:49.210> have<00:04:49.360> right<00:04:49.540> now<00:04:49.720> so<00:04:49.900> you<00:04:49.990> can<00:04:50.050> see<00:04:50.230> that

hard-headed<00:05:10.120> but<00:05:10.330> ultimately<00:05:10.720> this<00:05:10.900> is<00:05:10.960> the

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
hard-headed but ultimately this is the

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.240 
hard-headed but ultimately this is the
past<00:05:11.410> and<00:05:11.740> this<00:05:11.830> is<00:05:11.890> where<00:05:12.070> everything

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
for the most part he didn't really

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.130 
for the most part he didn't really
change<00:05:24.220> from<00:05:24.490> back<00:05:24.670> then<00:05:24.910> moderate<00:05:25.660> however

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
change from back then moderate however

you can still see he had that badass
personality<00:05:28.780> intact<00:05:29.170> even<00:05:29.410> as<00:05:29.650> a<00:05:29.680> kid<00:05:29.950> he<00:05:30.040> was

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160

liked<00:05:56.170> the<00:05:56.320> pacing<00:05:56.560> too<00:05:56.830> definitely<00:05:57.010> I've

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
liked the pacing too definitely I've

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.380 
liked the pacing too definitely I've
been<00:05:57.340> a<00:05:57.370> little<00:05:57.610> bit<00:05:57.700> fast<00:05:57.940> and<00:05:58.150> not<00:05:58.240> that<00:05:58.330> I

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
been a little bit fast and not that I

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.270 
been a little bit fast and not that I
want<00:05:58.450> to<00:05:58.630> blitz<00:05:58.870> do<00:05:59.080> this<00:05:59.260> but<00:05:59.560> ultimately<00:06:00.070> the

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
want to blitz do this but ultimately the

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.830 
want to blitz do this but ultimately the
pacing<00:06:00.670> felt<00:06:00.940> a<00:06:01.030> little<00:06:01.240> bit<00:06:01.360> slow<00:06:01.540> with<00:06:01.660> this

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
pacing felt a little bit slow with this

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.110 
pacing felt a little bit slow with this
one<00:06:02.020> and<00:06:02.170> again<00:06:02.410> it's<00:06:02.740> not<00:06:02.920> too<00:06:03.400> relative<00:06:03.970> as

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
one and again it's not too relative as

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.490 
one and again it's not too relative as
far<00:06:04.330> as<00:06:04.450> to<00:06:04.630> like<00:06:04.810> you<00:06:05.080> know<00:06:05.170> the<00:06:05.320> overall
