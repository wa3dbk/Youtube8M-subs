I'm going to import this video which is
about<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:51.359> origins<00:00:52.019> of<00:00:52.170> computing<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.429> you

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
about the origins of computing and you

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.540 
about the origins of computing and you
can<00:00:54.239> see<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.659> Windows<00:00:54.989> Movie<00:00:55.199> Maker<00:00:55.550> can

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
can see that Windows Movie Maker can

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.029 
can see that Windows Movie Maker can
import<00:00:56.909> a<00:00:57.179> fairly<00:00:57.539> wide<00:00:57.719> variety<00:00:58.409> of<00:00:58.620> video

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
import a fairly wide variety of video

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.440 
import a fairly wide variety of video
files<00:00:59.399> avi<00:01:00.329> MPEG<00:01:01.069> MP<00:01:02.069> to<00:01:02.309> MPEG<00:01:04.159> Windows<00:01:05.159> Media

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
Windows Media Video a wide variety so in

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.060 
Windows Media Video a wide variety so in
this<00:01:09.299> case<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.899> a<00:01:10.049> Windows<00:01:10.380> Media<00:01:10.619> Video

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
this case this is a Windows Media Video

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.100 
this case this is a Windows Media Video
so<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.180> import<00:01:12.509> without<00:01:12.719> any

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
so it's going to import without any

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.590 
so it's going to import without any
trouble<00:01:13.530> at<00:01:13.619> all<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:16.369> here<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:17.490> go<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.390> can
