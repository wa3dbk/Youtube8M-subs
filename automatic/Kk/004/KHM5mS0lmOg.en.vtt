00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.190
 the opposite direction 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:11.969
 yes 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.229
 6 

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:17.419
 talking about a captain would take me not only minutes and not examples 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:20.579
 gentlemen put instants that were recorded in the memory of the fans 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.069
 they are men referring 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:26.069
 leaders and that according to acts within the field of play 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.789
 with the shield of an entire staff that is inspired by the pitch and that 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.519
 at the end of the road he wrote his name in the history of a club talking about a 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.080
 captain of a true captain 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.250
 would bring me great memories of epic battles that have remained in the 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.020
 memory of a lifetime 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.250
 the colors or in a shield 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.030
 the captains are as big as a goal scorer 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.550
 an archer but as special as the history of a club 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.470
 according to the PSOE one lives in each match and its style as characteristic as that of 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.800
 an amateur for example of it are names like those of marco antonio 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.880
 figueroa 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.250
 darío franco and why not 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.850
 from omar trujillo 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.580
 in recent times we still vibrate know two golazos the eternal ghosts 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.710
 and the skin will not be left and I would not like to dedicate emotion 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.310
 a guy who was a leader 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.660
 the one that had the pride of connecting with the Morelia fans like no one else did 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.100
 they played tournaments 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.190
 and the site became vacant 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.250
 until an Argentine who possessed the blood of a champion 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.800
 zedillo as the leader 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.950
 the referent of a golden age in arrears 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.860
 the time was passing and his moment came to the end 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.620
 and that badge deserved to change its owner 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.930
 the one in charge of owning it omar trujillo 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.119
 a simple Moreliano and that very to his style ported 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.960
 maybe gray as his personality 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.960
 but that he never stopped fighting on the pitch 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.520
 the heir of so distinguished places mauricio rosemary 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.690
 time is all the requirements to consolidate as a large 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.010
 Argentinean central defense defender quickly locate him as the successor of 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.240
 darío franco 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.520
 his leadership is evident but his time is still short 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.640
 however nobody like him to fill that gaffe 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.670
 that's why the greats have behaved in Morelia did not forget other great ones like 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.770
 were mario díaz judge chilean juan angel busts yes maybe 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.820
 others who have forged the history of a club as big as their hobby 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.260
 Monarchs Morelia
