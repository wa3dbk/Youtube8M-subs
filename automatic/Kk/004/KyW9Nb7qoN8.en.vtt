00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.399
 all the people here him today we get 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.259
 found for a little video for 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.759
 play z then to an ema stories 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.049
 christmas order in brazil as well as 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.510
 disney will do to break everything with this 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.910
 super but he kind do not have commodore 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.349
 and so the first thing you 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.250
 want you to know about z it's 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.540
 that in front of the line you have to 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.400
 absolutely be the one who will go up 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.529
 level 3 in pro league and why because 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.180
 that with this when you are level 3 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.910
 you have a lot of harass and you 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.410
 also especially of this wolf and therefore the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.390
 control cros via 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.619
 your life at your whim 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.150
 so it's very important to be the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.769
 first to level up 3 to be able to do 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.239
 teams like that since with your 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.969
 not if you have a lot of damage on 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.809
 / photo attack and you can do some 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.640
 law enforcement relatively 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.809
 easily on a kasic what happened 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.090
 actually put in the bottom for example in his 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.700
 jungle thanks to our super coming 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.230
 google and so that's so very important 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.520
 to be the first to want it 3 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.600
 especially since here you have some 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.770
 other attacks that make relatively 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.020
 wrong with the emptiness that I give you 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.600
 debut so you can really you 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.620
 allow two very very trades 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.690
 sympathetically if you want for 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.550
 your line at the beginning and what is also 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.520
 beneficial is that since you sleep 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.470
 your lane in early and then you can 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.750
 to lose a lot of shouting not 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.630
 your opponent ci finds himself under his 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.130
 turn is also last thing you have 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.200
 a natural species that is still 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.580
 very very hardcore for the young leader 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.990
 adversary so it's very difficult for 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.470
 we are of this that to enjoy it at 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.270
 maximum of his so for example to confess 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.759
 times jacques greece with the number 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.650
 but I really do that when I 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.020
 know that for example we are at a coppice 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.090
 or the jungler will be forced to care 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.770
 take care of an ox that I saw 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.200
 that he was a certain place on the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.119
 map so it's very important to do 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.860
 that knowingly since you 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.900
 must not hide your team 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.880
 like that so here I do from the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.490
 level 6 I'm doing something pretty 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.770
 violent death I played frankly 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.750
 it was symbolic at the end because he 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.270
 have to know a thing so if you 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.490
 want to kunter z it's very very simple 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.219
 you just have to get rid of him 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.130
 pile when he landed on you 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.380
 with his ultimate 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.729
 why because the ultimate z it works 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.979
 that way there if in fact there 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.329
 apply its mark on you the damage 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.080
 who will you do are going to be in 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.920
 partially re when will say again the 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.860
 the explosion of the brand 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.970
 so if you get to make sure there 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.739
 that's cool so gives empty by 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.450
 example with a job with a flash with 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.810
 a dash out all these years all these 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.819
 things there 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.260
 not only will these columns be put 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.300
 in a vacuum but in addition it will be far 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.590
 so the time pick catch up on you 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.300
 before his mark explodes he will have the 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.580
 time to put very little damage and 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.250
 so hey he can simply 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.630
 the more you expose yourself so he will have 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.750
 until August purchase and then that's it 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.790
 so that's how it is that that 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.299
 you sink and z at his level 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.280
 ultimate 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.709
 so it's very important if you play 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.180
 z you know the costs 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.980
 crazy about your opponent including his 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.230
 costs of the briefs that's why 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.540
 example when I tulasne and dale and 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.340
 bajeux finally after you will see you I 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.670
 will show you a game I'm waiting 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.680
 really that the church are jaime by 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.890
 example for women and decrypts or other 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.230
 thing 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.180
 so there for example there I'm going to do a 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.590
 move a little crappy slips when who 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.209
 has really played really well 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.420
 it's absolutely going on stage because 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.040
 good enough that well here it must finally 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.049
 must focus the square all that so 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.220
 I can still kill him but there 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.750
 I played badly what I should have done 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.799
 I should have typed the plx because 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.000
 that anyway I was dead 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.200
 I might have tried toques 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.290
 there, little Italy, but here we go 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.549
 I played badly I could have located the 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.319
 blitz of all ages who was I would have 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.359
 what was it that was not there? 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.930
 you will see very soon 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:35.780
 what they are about the duke they knew 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.910
 on said year so I'm having fun at 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.920
 quickly take the small hatches for 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.030
 more than good it gives me that she does 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.950
 a few steps here and there you will see 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.170
 I waited a few questions job I 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.790
 put but also stale father to kill her 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.380
 I put molinel and that's it 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.290
 it's as simple as that so very 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.360
 important to 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.159
 really well manage one's costs when 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.469
 you want to kill z it's very simple 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.099
 you must know the cool of one of 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.890
 your opponent 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:02.260
 then you make sure you have 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.489
 your anthem has a slot for cars from 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.900
 put a maximum of two attacks before 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.980
 that the brand explodes and then you 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.790
 here you are trying to snap a lot 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.689
 talented and also very important 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.390
 to know that z 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:15.700
 once it is 22 5% discount 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.910
 costs of a he can place 2nd before that 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.949
 that's his numbers go away here very 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.720
 important also to know that it takes 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.699
 also know that you can also 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.190
 so amuse before before their ivory that 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.539
 of the ultimate z 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.729
 it was enough points in fact you had 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.620
 just to helpful about the guy is 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.599
 the shadow was laid next to you so you 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.880
 could do a 12 ski on it on 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:38.139
 the opponent very very very simply 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.610
 maintenance is no longer so 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.289
 can have fun putting your shadow 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.550
 next to anyway your ultimate 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.800
 guarantees you the natural scripts 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.169
 almost instant is super simple 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.020
 so it's very important as z of 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.990
 know finally to do well in 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.860
 so that you are well placed 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.229
 the moment you launch your 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.560
 ultimate is also very important 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.699
 to launch it for example from a buzz 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.770
 because you can simply 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:05.229
 wine very very easily juke 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.180
 adversaries to the teeth that like a little the 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.710
 j breschi price of civilians Thursday with 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.080
 only so it's very important to 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.720
 know that too so here you will see that 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.520
 here is the blah said to go she jumped el 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.659
 mahrouk facebook or what I have 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.760
 is that I have not tried to dave 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:20.110
 further I reactivated my ultimate and I 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.659
 I'm the same so it's true that zain 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.669
 years became a super safe omid picket 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:25.659
 and I want that end I was great 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.830
 impressed because I was playing it 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.570
 a lot at a time and I have not had 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.190
 a lot need to make games for 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.110
 to do this guide since finally 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.449
 it's really much simpler to 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.949
 play now and he's finally here he 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.330
 is very very safe except when we do 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:39.099
 shit like I like to do it there but 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.270
 short so I hope that in any case these 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.820
 some small minnows you will have some 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.740
 have served you 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.270
 juice it's the end of the game there all of 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.830
 now so very important 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.810
 always know that when you have 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.430
 your ultimate knowledge of where are you 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.880
 launch it if you are if your 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.920
 opponent 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.960
 at unesco we swayed a lot of 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.990
 Turkey swing a slow with your father 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.190
 or your amateur video then useful 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.780
 wants to use them your size if you 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.680
 have it your tiamat too if you have it 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.600
 have done everything you can 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.980
 swing as long as the mark does not have 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.690
 exposed it will be damage that will be 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.820
 useful to the explosion it's so simple 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.710
 that and if you want colors to be 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.480
 simply do you make a purchase or 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.190
 pile when he landed on you 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.480
 and it is necessary to speak here is brief so 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.350
 I hope you enjoyed it was 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.930
 lot of diapers made full of kisses 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.920
 video I hope this video will have you 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.030
 more if it is the case we do not link 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.140
 put a little lake and share it 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.670
 on social networks like facebook 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.080
 or it would help me a lot more than 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.320
 what you imagine to launch this 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.760
 chain 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.340
 and if you still have not
