00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.439 

hey<00:00:01.410> this<00:00:01.680> is<00:00:01.800> Kenneth<00:00:02.159> and<00:00:02.280> today<00:00:02.639> I'm<00:00:03.270> going

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
hey this is Kenneth and today I'm going

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.450 
hey this is Kenneth and today I'm going
to<00:00:03.510> show<00:00:03.659> you<00:00:03.689> how<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:03.929> operate<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.589> jointer

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
to show you how to operate a jointer

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.900 
to show you how to operate a jointer
planer<00:00:06.230> so<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.259> jointer<00:00:07.680> planer<00:00:07.980> is<00:00:08.099> actually

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
planer so a jointer planer is actually

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.330 
planer so a jointer planer is actually
two<00:00:09.210> separate<00:00:09.719> tools<00:00:10.080> which<00:00:10.769> are<00:00:10.889> typically

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
two separate tools which are typically

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.669 
two separate tools which are typically
combined<00:00:11.849> into<00:00:12.179> one<00:00:12.389> in<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.870> multi<00:00:13.200> unit<00:00:13.500> like

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
combined into one in a multi unit like

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.390 
combined into one in a multi unit like
this<00:00:14.030> the<00:00:15.030> jointer<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.830> the<00:00:16.830> tool<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.100> you

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
this the jointer is the tool that you

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.880 
this the jointer is the tool that you
use<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.670> get<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.240> single<00:00:18.660> flat<00:00:18.930> side<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.560> board

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
use to get a single flat side on a board

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.890 
use to get a single flat side on a board
then<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:21.060> would<00:00:21.240> run<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.449> through<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.660> planer

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
then you would run it through the planer

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.830 
then you would run it through the planer
to<00:00:22.289> get<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.340> other<00:00:23.369> side<00:00:23.910> flat<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.600> same

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
to get it the other side flat the same

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.580 
to get it the other side flat the same
so<00:00:26.449> obviously<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.779> short<00:00:28.109> straight

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
so obviously this is a short straight

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.859 
so obviously this is a short straight
board<00:00:28.859> but<00:00:29.189> every<00:00:29.939> single<00:00:30.119> piece<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.660> lumber

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
board but every single piece of lumber

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.020 
board but every single piece of lumber
is<00:00:31.170> inevitably<00:00:31.650> going<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.920> be<00:00:32.070> somehow<00:00:32.279> warped

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
is inevitably going to be somehow warped

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.139 
is inevitably going to be somehow warped
or<00:00:33.540> skewed<00:00:34.170> or<00:00:34.649> bent<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.820> you're<00:00:36.030> going

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
or skewed or bent so that you're going

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.630 
or skewed or bent so that you're going
to<00:00:36.180> need<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.420> get<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.630> straight<00:00:37.309> how<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.370> get

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
to need to get it straight how you get

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.240 
to need to get it straight how you get
it<00:00:38.760> straight<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.360> one<00:00:39.629> side<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.980> feed

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
it straight on one side is that you feed

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.910 
it straight on one side is that you feed
it<00:00:41.430> through<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.090> jointer<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:43.140> what<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.469> has<00:00:43.500> it

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
it through the jointer is what it has it

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.190 
it through the jointer is what it has it
has<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> rotating<00:00:44.760> head<00:00:45.420> right<00:00:45.660> here<00:00:45.960> with

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
has a rotating head right here with

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.889 
has a rotating head right here with
three<00:00:46.590> blades<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.120> would<00:00:48.270> feed<00:00:48.750> it

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
three blades and so you would feed it

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.560 
three blades and so you would feed it
through<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.500> it's<00:00:50.219> going<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.520> get<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
through and it's going to get one of the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.430 
through and it's going to get one of the
sides<00:00:51.840> perfectly<00:00:52.620> flat<00:00:53.840> once<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.110> sides

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
sides perfectly flat once that sides

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.900 
sides perfectly flat once that sides
flat<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.160> run<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.370> through<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.640> planer

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
flat you can run it through the planer

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.139 
flat you can run it through the planer
which<00:00:57.390> has<00:00:57.600> blades<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.320> top<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:59.059> once<00:01:00.059> you

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
which has blades on the top and once you

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.610 
which has blades on the top and once you
have<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> one<00:01:00.570> flat<00:01:00.809> side<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.230> can<00:01:01.379> use<00:01:01.410> that

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
have the one flat side you can use that

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.680 
have the one flat side you can use that
as<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.800> reference<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.399> then<00:01:02.850> cut<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
as a reference and then cut the of the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.570 
as a reference and then cut the of the
top<00:01:03.899> side<00:01:04.199> from<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.309> you'll<00:01:05.430> get

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
top side from that and you'll get

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.730 
top side from that and you'll get
something<00:01:05.820> that's<00:01:06.090> perfectly<00:01:06.420> flat<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.470> I'll

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
something that's perfectly flat so I'll

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.000 
something that's perfectly flat so I'll
first<00:01:07.950> show<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.189> how<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.430> run<00:01:09.350> piece<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.500> piece

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
first show you how to run piece of piece

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.100 
first show you how to run piece of piece
of<00:01:11.159> board<00:01:11.369> through<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.760> jointer<00:01:12.600> which<00:01:12.900> is

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
of board through the jointer which is

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.899 
of board through the jointer which is
this<00:01:13.470> part<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.010> then<00:01:14.400> I'll<00:01:14.490> show<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.670> how<00:01:14.820> to

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
this part and then I'll show you how to

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.219 
this part and then I'll show you how to
run<00:01:15.060> through<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> planer<00:01:15.630> which<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
run through the planer which is the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.200 
run through the planer which is the
other<00:01:16.320> part

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.000 

now<00:01:19.810> when<00:01:20.200> you're<00:01:20.320> getting<00:01:20.500> ready<00:01:20.710> to<00:01:20.830> run<00:01:20.950> a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
now when you're getting ready to run a

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.010 
now when you're getting ready to run a
board<00:01:21.340> through<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.670> jointer<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.810> one

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
board through the jointer the one

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.600 
board through the jointer the one
adjustment<00:01:23.320> that<00:01:23.650> you<00:01:23.710> need<00:01:23.980> to<00:01:24.070> make<00:01:24.250> is<00:01:24.430> you

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
adjustment that you need to make is you

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.280 
adjustment that you need to make is you
need<00:01:24.730> to<00:01:24.790> decide<00:01:25.000> how<00:01:25.330> much<00:01:25.570> of<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.990> bottom

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
need to decide how much of the bottom

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.770 
need to decide how much of the bottom
surface<00:01:26.470> you're<00:01:26.800> going<00:01:26.830> to<00:01:27.010> take<00:01:27.190> off

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
surface you're going to take off

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.540 
surface you're going to take off
underneath<00:01:28.780> underneath<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.680> table<00:01:30.100> there's

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
underneath underneath the table there's

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.430 
underneath underneath the table there's
an<00:01:30.730> adjustment<00:01:31.030> screw<00:01:31.300> as<00:01:31.540> you<00:01:31.690> raise<00:01:32.080> the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
an adjustment screw as you raise the

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.270 
an adjustment screw as you raise the
infeed<00:01:33.010> table<00:01:33.340> anywhere<00:01:34.270> from<00:01:35.130> 1/32<00:01:36.130> of<00:01:36.190> an

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
infeed table anywhere from 1/32 of an

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.180 
infeed table anywhere from 1/32 of an
inch<00:01:36.370> down<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:36.850> 1/8<00:01:37.090> of<00:01:37.240> an<00:01:37.360> inch<00:01:37.479> cut<00:01:38.290> on<00:01:38.500> this

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
inch down to 1/8 of an inch cut on this

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.390 
inch down to 1/8 of an inch cut on this
blade<00:01:39.520> so<00:01:40.210> I<00:01:40.570> much<00:01:41.290> prefer<00:01:41.650> to<00:01:41.800> just<00:01:42.010> take<00:01:42.160> lots

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
blade so I much prefer to just take lots

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.670 
blade so I much prefer to just take lots
of<00:01:42.550> small<00:01:42.940> cuts<00:01:43.240> because<00:01:43.960> I'm<00:01:44.140> just<00:01:44.290> trying<00:01:44.619> to

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
of small cuts because I'm just trying to

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.560 
of small cuts because I'm just trying to
get<00:01:44.830> the<00:01:45.040> good<00:01:45.250> surface<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.790> work<00:01:45.940> off<00:01:46.180> of<00:01:46.210> and

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
get the good surface to work off of and

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.750 
get the good surface to work off of and
so<00:01:47.020> I<00:01:47.050> have<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.470> infeed<00:01:47.860> table<00:01:48.070> set<00:01:48.460> for<00:01:48.670> just

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
so I have the infeed table set for just

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.120 
so I have the infeed table set for just
1/32<00:01:49.660> of<00:01:49.750> an<00:01:50.170> inch<00:01:51.060> when<00:01:52.060> you<00:01:52.149> feed<00:01:52.360> it<00:01:52.479> through

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
1/32 of an inch when you feed it through

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.650 
1/32 of an inch when you feed it through
this<00:01:54.130> thing<00:01:54.399> will<00:01:54.550> like<00:01:54.700> to<00:01:54.729> eat<00:01:54.970> fingertips

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
this thing will like to eat fingertips

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.380 
this thing will like to eat fingertips
and<00:01:55.930> so<00:01:56.500> you<00:01:57.160> want<00:01:57.369> to<00:01:57.430> use<00:01:57.610> some<00:01:57.820> sort<00:01:57.850> of<00:01:58.060> push

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
and so you want to use some sort of push

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.060 
and so you want to use some sort of push
block<00:01:58.720> to<00:01:59.020> really<00:01:59.229> make<00:01:59.410> sure<00:01:59.440> that<00:01:59.619> you<00:01:59.920> don't

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
block to really make sure that you don't

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.480 
block to really make sure that you don't
get<00:02:00.340> your<00:02:00.490> hands<00:02:01.060> tatta<00:02:01.690> machine<00:02:02.170> again<00:02:03.040> let's

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
get your hands tatta machine again let's

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.940 
get your hands tatta machine again let's
play<00:02:03.700> it<00:02:03.790> again<00:02:04.020> here<00:02:05.020> in<00:02:05.110> protection<00:02:05.500> high

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
play it again here in protection high

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.070 
play it again here in protection high
projection<00:02:06.490> don't<00:02:07.060> lose<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.390> fingers<00:02:07.720> it's<00:02:08.020> a

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
projection don't lose the fingers it's a

00:02:08.080 --> 00:03:07.130 
projection don't lose the fingers it's a
good<00:02:08.259> policy

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.870 

now<00:03:08.140> they've<00:03:08.440> got<00:03:08.470> one<00:03:08.860> side<00:03:09.100> nice<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:09.610> smooth

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
now they've got one side nice and smooth

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.630 
now they've got one side nice and smooth
we<00:03:10.510> can<00:03:10.690> use<00:03:10.870> that<00:03:11.110> as<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.560> reference<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.520> now

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
we can use that as the reference to now

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.850 
we can use that as the reference to now
get<00:03:12.940> another<00:03:13.270> one<00:03:13.480> of<00:03:13.569> these<00:03:13.690> sides<00:03:13.959> also

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
get another one of these sides also

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.059 
get another one of these sides also
smooth<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:16.180> then<00:03:16.360> we'll<00:03:16.480> have<00:03:16.690> this<00:03:17.470> side<00:03:17.770> and

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
smooth so then we'll have this side and

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.730 
smooth so then we'll have this side and
the<00:03:18.280> bottom<00:03:18.459> side<00:03:18.750> nice<00:03:19.750> and<00:03:19.990> smooth<00:03:20.260> then

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
the bottom side nice and smooth then

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.840 
the bottom side nice and smooth then
we'll<00:03:20.830> be<00:03:20.920> able<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.070> run<00:03:21.190> this<00:03:21.370> top<00:03:21.610> surface

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
we'll be able to run this top surface

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:55.930 
we'll be able to run this top surface
through<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.450> planer

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:23.530 

you

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.440 

so<00:04:24.540> now<00:04:24.720> that<00:04:24.780> I've<00:04:24.900> got<00:04:25.110> this<00:04:25.710> side<00:04:26.450> jointed

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
so now that I've got this side jointed

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.800 
so now that I've got this side jointed
and<00:04:27.570> then<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:28.170> used<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:28.889> to<00:04:29.160> joint<00:04:29.430> the

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
and then I used it to joint the

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.090 
and then I used it to joint the
90-degree<00:04:30.810> side<00:04:31.080> of<00:04:31.320> so<00:04:31.470> off<00:04:31.650> one<00:04:31.830> of<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:31.950> off

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
90-degree side of so off one of the off

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.400 
90-degree side of so off one of the off
sides<00:04:32.430> now<00:04:33.300> that<00:04:33.450> I've<00:04:33.540> got<00:04:33.660> those<00:04:33.870> two<00:04:33.930> smooth

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
sides now that I've got those two smooth

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.920 
sides now that I've got those two smooth
I<00:04:34.620> can<00:04:34.830> now<00:04:34.919> run<00:04:35.130> it<00:04:35.280> through<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:36.150> planer<00:04:36.570> half

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
I can now run it through the planer half

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.070 
I can now run it through the planer half
to<00:04:37.680> get<00:04:37.860> this<00:04:38.010> top<00:04:38.250> surface<00:04:38.550> smooth<00:04:39.080> relative

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
to get this top surface smooth relative

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.980 
to get this top surface smooth relative
to<00:04:40.320> this<00:04:40.470> one<00:04:40.850> do<00:04:41.850> that<00:04:42.060> I<00:04:42.270> need<00:04:42.480> to<00:04:42.600> lower<00:04:42.840> the

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
to this one do that I need to lower the

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:50.390 
to this one do that I need to lower the
bed<00:04:43.940> here<00:04:48.290> until<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:49.620> board<00:04:49.919> will<00:04:50.040> fit<00:04:50.250> in

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
bed here until the board will fit in

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.970 
bed here until the board will fit in
there<00:04:50.610> all<00:04:51.360> right<00:04:51.810> here<00:04:52.110> it<00:04:52.200> has<00:04:52.350> a<00:04:52.380> dial<00:04:52.770> to

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
there all right here it has a dial to

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.040 
there all right here it has a dial to
show<00:04:53.130> you<00:04:53.220> how<00:04:53.400> aggressive<00:04:54.300> of<00:04:54.419> a<00:04:54.510> cut<00:04:54.750> you'll

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
show you how aggressive of a cut you'll

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.360 
show you how aggressive of a cut you'll
you'll<00:04:55.410> be<00:04:55.560> taking<00:04:55.950> so<00:04:56.960> we'll<00:04:57.960> first<00:04:58.260> lift<00:04:59.190> it

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
you'll be taking so we'll first lift it

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.900 
you'll be taking so we'll first lift it
up<00:04:59.550> so<00:05:00.390> that<00:05:00.540> it's<00:05:00.660> taking<00:05:01.020> off<00:05:01.760> 1/32<00:05:02.760> of<00:05:02.790> an

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
up so that it's taking off 1/32 of an

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.340 
up so that it's taking off 1/32 of an
inch<00:05:03.060> now

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
inch now

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.750 
inch now
the<00:05:04.470> planer<00:05:04.740> is<00:05:04.830> going<00:05:05.040> to<00:05:05.100> be<00:05:05.190> unique<00:05:05.490> and<00:05:05.640> it

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
the planer is going to be unique and it

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.540 
the planer is going to be unique and it
actually<00:05:06.120> has<00:05:06.480> feed<00:05:06.960> rollers<00:05:07.380> in<00:05:07.620> it<00:05:07.800> so<00:05:08.250> once

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
actually has feed rollers in it so once

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.580 
actually has feed rollers in it so once
I<00:05:08.730> get<00:05:08.790> the<00:05:09.090> board<00:05:09.330> started<00:05:09.810> the<00:05:10.169> machine<00:05:10.440> will

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
I get the board started the machine will

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.500 
I get the board started the machine will
actually<00:05:10.950> handle<00:05:11.370> feeding<00:05:12.090> it<00:05:12.180> all<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.419> way

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
actually handle feeding it all the way

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.610 
actually handle feeding it all the way
through<00:05:12.780> and<00:05:13.020> I'll<00:05:13.110> just<00:05:13.230> need<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.440> catch<00:05:13.590> it

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
through and I'll just need to catch it

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.430 
through and I'll just need to catch it
on<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:13.890> other<00:05:13.979> end

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
on the other end

00:05:15.440 --> 00:06:05.640 
on the other end
get<00:05:16.440> some<00:05:16.590> hearing<00:05:16.800> protection<00:05:16.830> on<00:05:18.410> let's<00:05:19.410> go

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.620 

so<00:06:06.650> now<00:06:07.250> we've<00:06:07.400> got<00:06:07.550> one<00:06:07.850> surface<00:06:08.270> through<00:06:08.600> the

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
so now we've got one surface through the

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.570 
so now we've got one surface through the
jointer<00:06:08.979> second<00:06:09.979> surface<00:06:10.130> through<00:06:10.550> the

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
jointer second surface through the

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.120 
jointer second surface through the
jointer<00:06:10.940> relative<00:06:11.419> to<00:06:11.599> it<00:06:11.780> the<00:06:12.349> third<00:06:12.650> surface

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
jointer relative to it the third surface

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.189 
jointer relative to it the third surface
we<00:06:13.610> just<00:06:13.819> did<00:06:14.030> on<00:06:14.150> the<00:06:14.180> planer<00:06:14.539> so<00:06:14.810> now<00:06:14.930> we<00:06:14.990> know

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 
we just did on the planer so now we know

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:16.870 
we just did on the planer so now we know
that<00:06:15.229> these<00:06:15.500> two<00:06:15.770> surfaces<00:06:16.250> are<00:06:16.460> perfectly

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
that these two surfaces are perfectly

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.300 
that these two surfaces are perfectly
straight<00:06:17.000> to<00:06:17.509> each<00:06:17.630> other<00:06:17.810> now<00:06:18.530> to<00:06:19.039> square

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
straight to each other now to square

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.279 
straight to each other now to square
completely<00:06:19.819> square<00:06:20.210> it<00:06:20.330> up<00:06:20.419> we<00:06:21.020> would<00:06:21.139> take

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289 
completely square it up we would take

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:23.680 
completely square it up we would take
the<00:06:21.440> fourth<00:06:21.710> and<00:06:21.919> off<00:06:22.460> on<00:06:22.729> the<00:06:22.849> table<00:06:23.479> saw

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
the fourth and off on the table saw

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.420 
the fourth and off on the table saw
which<00:06:23.900> I've<00:06:24.050> shown<00:06:24.080> you<00:06:24.259> how<00:06:24.410> to<00:06:24.470> do<00:06:24.710> so<00:06:25.310> we'd

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
which I've shown you how to do so we'd
