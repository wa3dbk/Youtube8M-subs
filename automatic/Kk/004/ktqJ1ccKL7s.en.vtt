much as one and I thought it would be
really<00:01:25.619> cool<00:01:25.950> because<00:01:26.280> if<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.909> could<00:01:27.090> just

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
really cool because if you could just

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.630 
really cool because if you could just
like<00:01:27.390> sliced<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.409> zombies<00:01:28.799> heads<00:01:29.040> off<00:01:29.280> not

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
like sliced the zombies heads off not

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.010 
like sliced the zombies heads off not
their<00:01:29.850> arms<00:01:30.240> or<00:01:30.420> anything<00:01:30.720> because<00:01:30.780> that

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
their arms or anything because that
