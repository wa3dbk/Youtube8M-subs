00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
enough but nonetheless this map is very

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.130 
enough but nonetheless this map is very
short<00:05:25.070> it's<00:05:25.310> pretty<00:05:25.730> easy<00:05:26.030> they<00:05:26.570> do<00:05:26.630> give<00:05:27.020> you

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140

lots<00:05:27.500> of<00:05:27.770> health<00:05:28.010> and<00:05:28.310> ammo<00:05:29.260> the<00:05:30.260> two<00:05:30.440> secrets

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
lots of health and ammo the two secrets

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.890 
lots of health and ammo the two secrets

in the main rooms you can just travel

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.550 
in the main rooms you can just travel
back<00:05:37.700> to<00:05:38.000> the<00:05:38.090> secret<00:05:38.450> areas<00:05:38.810> and<00:05:39.050> you<00:05:39.200> can<00:05:39.380> get

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.060 
back to the secret areas and you can get
refilled<00:05:40.010> that<00:05:40.190> way<00:05:40.400> very<00:05:40.940> easily<00:05:41.800> this<00:05:42.800> map

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
refilled that way very easily this map

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.630 
refilled that way very easily this map
is<00:05:43.250> definitely<00:05:43.910> you<00:05:44.540> know<00:05:44.740> not<00:05:45.740> episode<00:05:46.160> 5

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
is definitely you know not episode 5

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.420 
is definitely you know not episode 5
standard<00:05:47.240> of<00:05:47.360> difficulty<00:05:47.930> it's<00:05:48.770> very<00:05:49.130> easy

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
standard of difficulty it's very easy

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.350 
standard of difficulty it's very easy
and<00:05:50.710> so<00:05:51.710> that's<00:05:51.919> the<00:05:52.100> end<00:05:52.250> of<00:05:52.400> floor<00:05:52.730> 3

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
and so that's the end of floor 3

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.610 
and so that's the end of floor 3
next<00:05:53.810> is<00:05:53.990> floor<00:05:54.530> 4<00:05:55.270> which<00:05:56.270> just<00:05:56.870> so<00:05:57.080> happens<00:05:57.530> to

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
next is floor 4 which just so happens to

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.300 
next is floor 4 which just so happens to
be<00:05:57.860> my<00:05:58.250> favorite<00:05:58.910> floor<00:05:59.560> my<00:06:00.560> favorite<00:06:00.950> map<00:06:01.130> of
