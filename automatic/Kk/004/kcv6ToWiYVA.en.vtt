00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.260
 This time 

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:08.400
 It is in the common room of the home that I want to see the tips of the original researcher of the kick serve from the side 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:13.350
 Because it was 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.470
 First will thank you I would like to take a quick take a picture from the side 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.420
 Oh yeah 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.380
 that 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.600
 I want to spin the ball and drop the ball just anyway 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:27.390
 Hold and explain by stroke 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:32.140
 When you hit the ball for a long time, it is from where the ball hits or hits 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:36.550
 The longer this distance pulling the racket , the longer the ball will travel. 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.270
 After you have you I in site dropped the ball short and off or, for example, short cross the ball 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.900
 To become and 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.060
 f 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.320
 Short take it to a result balls follow-through from a distance take shorter or hit by 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:51.250
 Drop to the front 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:55.270
 If you want to hit a long serve in the same way , follow the ball a long distance away from the ball 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.890
 Even though it'll fly and put away for the dish 暴乱and long 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.329
 Spin serve in a short place 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.690
 Four 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.839
 When it comes to wanting to splash with water 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:10.390
 As much as possible racket moves 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:14.650
 There is a point to keep the distance towards the other side short 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:19.990
 It will be miso If you take this long, it will be long on ball and foot 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:24.570
 I do not Otose to shallow to make is to spin serve to rotation amount to at least 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.570
 So I want to go a bit extreme 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.799
 4 days scattered 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.060
 In fact this is 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.360
 Hmm 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:47.590
 Go this a bit longer with a spin serve that you shook so as not to shake as fast as possible 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.590
 Even if it is a spin serve 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.880
 This is quite a ball 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.130
 I can't hit a ball with a nuclear spin in a shallow spot 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.030
 We've put Now spin of prince 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.030
 Have 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:22.470
 I would like also along the video as seen from the side of it is from the back side in love 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:27.630
 Rather than sucking forward from the racket even from here 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:30.560
 Port'll see that waving the racket toward the horizontal fairly It is this baseline field 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.560
 And I liked towards the 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:39.890
 If this touches before, the power goes for a minute ago 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.780
 If you shake it, it means that many rotations will be many 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.110
 I think it is a very easy- to- understand technique 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:51.240
 I think I want to shoot from behind 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:56.550
 Through but it's the back not too high on the back of so much that head 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:58.850
 If you understand that you can hit the spin serve like this even though it is not too high 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.850
 think 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:25.580
 Yes, one more question for serve but take a higher hit 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:31.520
 The racket down which makes the axis of the left hand firmly 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:36.550
 That want advice for improving the basic fact that the body Mars 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:40.500
 Please refer to the explanation for so little basic operation 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:44.950
 I will explain from a biomechanics point of view 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.270
 First of all, you have to hit the ball at another shop, of course. 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.670
 To Takaida shop 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.280
 The racket comes up and the trial 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.000
 Say the place in to the fact that taking the ball 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.930
 Last time I was there 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.380
 Hey traveling exhibition and it takes the check to the ball well but it is what so when you're explanation of 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:05.740
 It will be very important 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:08.050
 Touch the ball came up from the bottom never rather than not sell the ball to the flat 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:13.520
 It takes natural 20 times by 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:18.830
 A place to hit Gum County Serve for wanting to speed up Serve often seen 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.850
 Even with the wrist sticking out, I will take the previous hole ball, but this is also the speed 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.700
 But 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:29.370
 Probability of being notified over the internet is very bad 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:34.650
 It will actually serve the game, so serve is actually like the racket just mentioned 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.550
 The forward rotation to Do Ju love I gain to take the high way the ball came I Ado from the 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.580
 Do you take 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:43.689
 We will gradually return from here in the patent 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:47.019
 Actually come back racket and go back to the next from this state 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:53.529
 Kedomo what I made at Toka other say it works next 

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:55.540
 If the place the marker at the ball when it was hit to the other side and to explain the movement 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:05:00.640
 In fact in a square in the 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:05.500
 One before to say in my and on the left shoulder down the right shoulder March just below the right shoulder 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:09.840
 In our place where this is replaced when hitting a ball, a place turn over shoulder 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:16.590
 There is a state that the one on the shoulder is on the shoulder 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:17.250
 The racket is brought up from bottom to top by being able to do this and replacing it 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.780
 To go 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:27.600
 In Kedomo it was also in the wintering question to Fu Tteyuu not Fusagara racket 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:29.860
 Rather than not has lowered in fact his intention also the racket do is I are saying 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.879
 Only by lowering the position of kapa 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:36.400
 And his whereabouts do not decide it decided the foot 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:42.970
 By replacing one 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:45.970
 Only the racquet is left behind This is naturally the racquet in any stroke 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.639
 Looks like it is left behind 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.120
 this 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:55.800
 Uetsuki's ok who is 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:59.770
 Please think to come determined of the Tteyuu way down the racket, depending on the size 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:06.580
 The racket does not fall if the height difference of this person is small 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:11.259
 By increasing the width of the upper and lower level of turnover the movement of the shoulder If you want to increase the height difference of the racket 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:13.300
 Can you make the racket look much lower by doing it ? 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:18.400
 In it 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:19.660
 Go down another spend the next is in fact Ashiashi from people 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.910
 Well if 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:30.280
 If you do not Yara leave a little more weight on his right foot and say in the way of right-handed 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:31.540
 If weight gets on the left foot at the time of the trophy pose carrying the racket, it will 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.670
 It is the other one is 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:39.510
 It will become a state, such as inclined to reverse not Do state want inclined 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:45.139
 The other the other is actually put Rutte It is foot from Deko' ThatLookLikeThis 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:49.759
 It will be a country where you can serve in a situation where no rotation has occurred 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:54.139
 In fact , let's think about the other side like hitting from the top to the bottom. 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:56.200
 The speed may come out because it has served like a stick out before, but the probability 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:57.910
 Will be very bad 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:04.430
 Because 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:09.140
 Before hitting the shoulder to explain at a high hit point to explain from scratch again 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:09.670
 The weight on the left shoulder was right along with it 

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.249
 a 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:19.059
 Slightly right on the right foot 

00:07:12.249 --> 00:07:22.340
 Firmly on the right foot please be left a fetus at a rate of 60% in the left foot about Shirota 40% 

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:26.000
 By leaving weight than it is shaped steel 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:29.540
 With a right foot determine how it 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:34.940
 Racket goes up to the top square turnover is happening 

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:39.020
 Racket went up from the bottom to the top in the am and resulting in high RBI doing Tteyuu 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:42.550
 By the way forward rotation on the ball by that take the ball is hanging in 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.550
 In particular probability Takeyama enters 

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:49.100
 Thank you very much Please try to reference 

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.100
 Ah
