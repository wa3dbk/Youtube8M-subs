hello everybody and welcome back to
another<00:00:02.460> quick<00:00:02.730> minecraft<00:00:03.270> tutorial<00:00:03.810> today<00:00:04.319> I

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
another quick minecraft tutorial today I

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.590 
another quick minecraft tutorial today I
have<00:00:04.589> view<00:00:04.799> a<00:00:04.890> minecart<00:00:05.490> loader<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:06.089> unloader

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
have view a minecart loader and unloader

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.419 
have view a minecart loader and unloader
and<00:00:06.990> what<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.319> unloader<00:00:07.680> does<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.130> it<00:00:08.250> takes

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
and what the unloader does is it takes

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.070 
and what the unloader does is it takes
the<00:00:08.670> contents<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.240> an<00:00:09.389> incoming<00:00:09.750> chess

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
the contents of an incoming chess

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.440 
the contents of an incoming chess
minecart<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:11.309> deposits<00:00:11.820> them<00:00:12.000> into<00:00:12.330> this

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
minecart and it deposits them into this

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.330 
minecart and it deposits them into this
chest<00:00:12.750> here<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.139> then<00:00:13.469> sends<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.920> minecart

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
chest here and then sends the minecart

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.919 
chest here and then sends the minecart
on<00:00:14.429> its<00:00:14.610> way<00:00:14.759> again<00:00:15.000> so<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.269> can<00:00:15.389> see<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:15.750> one

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
on its way again so you can see this one

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.290 
on its way again so you can see this one
right<00:00:15.960> here<00:00:16.320> has<00:00:16.590> 16<00:00:17.190> items<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.850> now<00:00:18.240> the

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
right here has 16 items in it now the

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.570 
right here has 16 items in it now the
logic<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.840> very<00:00:18.900> simple<00:00:19.529> when<00:00:20.070> there's<00:00:20.250> items

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
logic is very simple when there's items

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.950 
logic is very simple when there's items
passing<00:00:21.029> through<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> hopper<00:00:21.449> here<00:00:21.779> it's

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
passing through the hopper here it's

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.420 
passing through the hopper here it's
going<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.199> turn<00:00:22.380> off<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.650> powered<00:00:22.859> rails<00:00:23.130> and

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
going to turn off the powered rails and

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.830 
going to turn off the powered rails and
so<00:00:23.789> when<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.150> has<00:00:24.330> finished<00:00:24.510> transferring

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
so when this has finished transferring

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.870 
so when this has finished transferring
these<00:00:25.199> items<00:00:25.590> it's<00:00:26.189> going<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.430> send<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.760> on<00:00:26.849> its

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
these items it's going to send it on its

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.700 
these items it's going to send it on its
way<00:00:27.060> again<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.630> there's<00:00:28.199> no<00:00:28.320> need<00:00:28.470> for<00:00:28.500> a

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
way again so there's no need for a

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.380 
way again so there's no need for a
tutorial<00:00:29.010> here<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.609> can<00:00:29.760> see<00:00:29.939> everything

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
tutorial here you can see everything

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.350 
tutorial here you can see everything
that<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.570> need<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.810> build<00:00:30.990> right<00:00:31.349> there

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
that you need to build right there

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.910 
that you need to build right there
now<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.420> minecart<00:00:33.989> loader<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.440> going<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.800> do

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
now the minecart loader is going to do

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.500 
now the minecart loader is going to do
the<00:00:35.040> opposite<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.640> going<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.030> empty<00:00:36.300> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the opposite is going to empty the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.569 
the opposite is going to empty the
contents<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.410> chest<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.219> hopper

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
contents of this chest and this hopper

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.729 
contents of this chest and this hopper
into<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.059> minecart<00:00:39.540> chest<00:00:39.870> now<00:00:40.469> there<00:00:40.620> are

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
into the minecart chest now there are

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.260 
into the minecart chest now there are
two<00:00:40.890> ways<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.340> minecart<00:00:41.820> chest<00:00:42.090> can

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
two ways that this minecart chest can

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.119 
two ways that this minecart chest can
leave<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.629> loader<00:00:42.840> first<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.710> all<00:00:43.860> when<00:00:43.980> all

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
leave the loader first of all when all

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.380 
leave the loader first of all when all
of<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.340> items<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.850> finished<00:00:45.149> transferring

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
of the items have finished transferring

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.840 
of the items have finished transferring
from<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.110> chest<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:47.070> hopper<00:00:47.370> into<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
from the chest and the hopper into the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.430 
from the chest and the hopper into the
minecart<00:00:48.270> chest<00:00:48.570> then<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.899> comparator<00:00:49.410> here

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
minecart chest then this comparator here

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.439 
minecart chest then this comparator here
is<00:00:49.739> going<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.399> turn<00:00:50.640> off<00:00:50.820> it's<00:00:51.059> going<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.270> cause

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
is going to turn off it's going to cause

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.479 
is going to turn off it's going to cause
this<00:00:51.719> piston<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.289> retract<00:00:52.680> which<00:00:53.010> turns<00:00:53.340> on

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
this piston to retract which turns on

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.880 
this piston to retract which turns on
this<00:00:53.760> redstone<00:00:54.090> powers<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.079> block<00:00:55.350> unpause

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
this redstone powers this block unpause

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.950 
this redstone powers this block unpause
the<00:00:55.920> redstone<00:00:56.489> torch<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.030> then<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.600> piston

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
the redstone torch and then the piston

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.750 
the redstone torch and then the piston
here<00:00:58.109> attracts<00:00:58.530> allowing<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.250> minecart

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
here attracts allowing the minecart

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.790 
here attracts allowing the minecart
chest<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.239> leave<00:01:00.449> now<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.109> other<00:01:01.320> way<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.530> it

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
chest to leave now the other way that it

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.740 
chest to leave now the other way that it
can<00:01:01.980> leave<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.399> when<00:01:02.609> its<00:01:02.879> contents<00:01:03.390> are<00:01:03.510> full

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
can leave is when its contents are full

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.630 
can leave is when its contents are full
so<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.409> comparator<00:01:05.010> right<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.549> will

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
so this comparator right here it will

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.760 
so this comparator right here it will
only<00:01:05.850> ever<00:01:06.090> turn<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.420> when<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> contents<00:01:07.650> of

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
only ever turn on when the contents of

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.440 
only ever turn on when the contents of
this<00:01:07.920> minecart<00:01:08.430> chest<00:01:08.729> are<00:01:08.909> full<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.330> then

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
this minecart chest are full and then

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.640 
this minecart chest are full and then
it's<00:01:09.630> going<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.840> power<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.229> redstone<00:01:10.619> here

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
it's going to power the redstone here

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.500 
it's going to power the redstone here
power<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> block<00:01:11.760> turn<00:01:12.000> off<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> torch

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
power the block turn off the torch

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.270 
power the block turn off the torch
retract<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> piston<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.650> allow<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
retract the piston and allow the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.380 
retract the piston and allow the
minecart<00:01:14.790> chest<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.240> leave<00:01:16.909> I'd<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.270> say

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390

could be regular blocks with the lever

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.350 
could be regular blocks with the lever
attached<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.369> them<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.670> power<00:01:41.880> them<00:01:42.119> if<00:01:42.270> you

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
attached to them to power them if you

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.120 
attached to them to power them if you
want<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.600> save<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:42.930> resources<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.920> we're<00:01:44.040> going

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
want to save on resources so we're going

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.830

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.960 
of that a sticky piston above it and
then<00:02:22.500> last<00:02:22.710> of<00:02:22.860> all<00:02:23.010> put<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.250> block<00:02:23.490> there<00:02:23.760> and

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
then last of all put a block there and

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:24.640 
then last of all put a block there and
you're<00:02:24.210> done

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
you're done

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.230

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
so one important thing to note about the

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.360 
so one important thing to note about the
minecart<00:02:27.690> loader<00:02:27.960> is<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.650> use<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.950> same<00:02:29.160> type

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
minecart loader is to use the same type

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.430 
minecart loader is to use the same type
of<00:02:29.400> item<00:02:29.910> if<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.180> have<00:02:30.480> multiple<00:02:30.900> item<00:02:31.230> types

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
of item if you have multiple item types

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.750 
of item if you have multiple item types
in<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.740> system<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.250> could<00:02:32.400> end<00:02:32.610> up<00:02:32.700> with

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
in the system you could end up with

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.790 
in the system you could end up with
different<00:02:33.060> ones<00:02:33.300> in<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.630> chest<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.440> what's<00:02:34.620> in

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
different ones in the chest to what's in

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.350 
different ones in the chest to what's in
the<00:02:34.920> heart<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.430> then<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.850> items<00:02:36.210> won't

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
the heart and then the items won't

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.060 
the heart and then the items won't
transfer<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.140> will<00:02:37.230> just<00:02:37.380> stay<00:02:37.560> stuck<00:02:37.890> on

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
transfer and it will just stay stuck on

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.100 
transfer and it will just stay stuck on
