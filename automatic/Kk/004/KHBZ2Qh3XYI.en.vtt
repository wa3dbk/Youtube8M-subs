00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.470 
do it and the first way is going to be
minecraft<00:00:27.000> texture<00:00:27.420> packs<00:00:28.010> so<00:00:29.010> I'll<00:00:30.000> give<00:00:30.359> you

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
minecraft texture packs so I'll give you

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.569 
minecraft texture packs so I'll give you
the<00:00:30.660> link<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.500> website<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.550> description

and you're going to want to go to
simplistic<00:00:36.149> um<00:00:37.010> texture<00:00:38.010> packs<00:00:38.219> because

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
simplistic um texture packs because

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.100 
simplistic um texture packs because
those<00:00:38.790> are<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.030> ones<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.390> have<00:00:39.840> low

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
those are the ones that have low

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.530 
those are the ones that have low
resolution<00:00:40.940> even<00:00:41.940> though<00:00:42.180> they<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.450> low

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
resolution even though they have low

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.970 
resolution even though they have low
resolution<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.170> lot<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.440> them<00:00:43.590> still<00:00:43.829> look

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
resolution a lot of them still look

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.970 
resolution a lot of them still look
pretty<00:00:44.100> good<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.840> I'll<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.350> be<00:00:46.469> looking<00:00:46.590> for

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
pretty good so I'll just be looking for

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.360 
pretty good so I'll just be looking for
some<00:00:47.309> random<00:00:47.430> one<00:00:48.500> yeah<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.920> default

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
some random one yeah so the default

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.959 
some random one yeah so the default
texture<00:00:50.670> pack<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.149> actually<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> 32<00:00:51.989> by<00:00:52.170> 32<00:00:52.969> but

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
texture pack is actually a 32 by 32 but

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.330 
texture pack is actually a 32 by 32 but
um<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:55.410> ones<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.800> we're<00:00:56.010> trying<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.280> look
