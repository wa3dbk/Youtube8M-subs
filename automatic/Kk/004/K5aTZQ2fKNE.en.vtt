00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.980
 hi how are you here I show you a 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.670
 very short video is only one 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:17.779
 way how to make acrylic wedges 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:22.480
 about nails bitten by me that you have to 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.480
 a girl and well here 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:31.230
 here I am starting as a form here already 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:34.110
 it means the bidding of a bitten nail and 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.210
 here take the canvas is in the form and 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.720
 now I'm going to adjust it in the form 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.720
 cultural 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.970
 to fill in the space where the 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.100
 person does not have a he 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.460
 and so that we can open it in shape 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.460
 sculptural 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.540
 it is better to do the nails bitten when 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.760
 Put it on you do not have a few bites 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.810
 better to make cultural nations with 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.140
 the way why 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:06.860
 so they will last longer 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.840
 because when we put steve like there's no 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.760
 so much nail there is not so much space for 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.940
 paste half the plastic but I will not 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.830
 to say that it's bad is not , but it's going 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.229
 to last less than if we did it with 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.070
 cultural forms because already putting the 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:28.009
 way there is more space to adhere the 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.430
 acrylic then it will have more 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.460
 grip more strength than if the 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.310
 let's do with 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.290
 normal 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.320
 Well, that's how simple it is how 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.909
 get in shape for seasons we know 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.759
 when they eat it 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.399
 here I am putting this that I use 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.880
 for the almond you give them a design 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:54.990
 is only one way how to make more 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:59.369
 some morbid meals 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.119
 every 3 plan cited the tunnel farm and so 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.119
 of simple 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.590
 since it encapsulates I'll wait for it to 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.930
 dry the nail I'm hitting with the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.150
 brush hose even when it is a gaps 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.630
 because they already eat a lot of care 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.150
 we remove the form we give him the 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.390
 way and then when we do in the with 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.020
 cultural forms nail looks more 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.020
 beautiful 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:35.410
 and the first thing that simple 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.800
 I hope this idea helped you 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.610
 and well thank you for seeing my ideas and we 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.610
 let's go to bed
