sword if you try to just make yourself a

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.520 
sword if you try to just make yourself a
metal<00:00:35.489> Claymore<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.270> go<00:00:36.750> directly<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.380> there

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
metal Claymore and go directly to there

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.830 
metal Claymore and go directly to there
you're<00:00:38.250> gonna<00:00:38.340> see<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.149> need<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> minimum

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
you're gonna see that you need a minimum

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.000 
you're gonna see that you need a minimum
of<00:00:39.989> whatever<00:00:40.320> skill<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.370> actually<00:00:41.820> use<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:43.010> so

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
of whatever skill to actually use it so

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.220 
of whatever skill to actually use it so
you'd<00:00:44.430> think<00:00:44.700> maybe<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.270> practice<00:00:45.660> longsword

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
you'd think maybe the practice longsword

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.569 
you'd think maybe the practice longsword
would<00:00:46.379> work<00:00:46.590> but<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.950> actually<00:00:47.160> need<00:00:47.430> a

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
would work but you actually need a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.549 
would work but you actually need a
minimum<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.210> thirty<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.899> use<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.289> now<00:00:49.500> you

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
minimum of thirty to use that now you

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.740 
minimum of thirty to use that now you
can<00:00:50.010> get<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.550> minimum<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.030> thirty<00:00:51.360> when<00:00:51.660> you

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
can get a minimum of thirty when you

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.580 
can get a minimum of thirty when you
roll<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> character<00:00:52.649> but<00:00:53.579> if<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.809> don't<00:00:55.379> have

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.990 
relax a little bit you get closer and
closer<00:01:59.659> slowly<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.189> then<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.340> make<00:02:02.969> your

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
closer slowly and then you make your

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.190 
closer slowly and then you make your
strike

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
strike

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.230 
strike
you<00:02:04.649> have<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.920> get<00:02:05.189> going<00:02:05.369> really<00:02:05.880> nice<00:02:06.030> and

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
you have to get going really nice and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.650 
you have to get going really nice and
quick<00:02:07.129> if<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.250> do<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.489> right<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:09.209> can<00:02:09.390> usually

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
quick if you do it right you can usually

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.140 
quick if you do it right you can usually
manage<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.530> stun<00:02:11.129> them<00:02:12.560> but<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:15.000> is

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
manage to stun them but that is that is

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.470 
manage to stun them but that is that is
a<00:02:15.180> sometimes<00:02:15.720> thing<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:17.430> is<00:02:18.000> definitely<00:02:18.420> a

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
a sometimes thing it is definitely a

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.780 
a sometimes thing it is definitely a
sometimes<00:02:18.959> thing<00:02:20.780> come<00:02:21.780> on

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
sometimes thing come on

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.790 
sometimes thing come on
now<00:02:23.790> with<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:23.970> long<00:02:24.209> enough<00:02:24.420> blade<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:25.530> can

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
now with a long enough blade you can

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.130 
now with a long enough blade you can
actually<00:02:26.040> attack<00:02:26.459> them<00:02:27.019> pretty<00:02:28.019> easily<00:02:30.140> but

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
actually attack them pretty easily but

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.870 
actually attack them pretty easily but
sometimes<00:02:31.860> they'll<00:02:32.220> just<00:02:32.400> be<00:02:32.519> getting<00:02:32.670> away

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
sometimes they'll just be getting away

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.420 
sometimes they'll just be getting away
and<00:02:33.269> you<00:02:33.420> need<00:02:33.599> to<00:02:33.690> let<00:02:33.870> them<00:02:33.989> go<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.620> let<00:02:35.280> them

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
and you need to let them go and let them

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.910 
and you need to let them go and let them
do<00:02:35.580> their<00:02:35.700> thing<00:02:36.380> now<00:02:37.380> as<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.650> can<00:02:37.709> see<00:02:37.890> I

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
do their thing now as you can see I

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.920 
do their thing now as you can see I
increased<00:02:38.790> my<00:02:38.849> skill<00:02:39.209> quite<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.480> bit<00:02:39.720> that's

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
increased my skill quite a bit that's

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.190 
increased my skill quite a bit that's
because<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:41.010> skill<00:02:41.970> increase<00:02:42.480> on<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.870> server

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
because the skill increase on the server

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.979 
because the skill increase on the server
that<00:02:43.290> I'm<00:02:43.470> playing<00:02:43.739> on<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.340> very<00:02:45.120> very<00:02:45.420> high<00:02:45.630> so

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
that I'm playing on is very very high so

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.819 
that I'm playing on is very very high so
now<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.709> can<00:02:46.950> switch<00:02:47.130> over<00:02:47.549> to<00:02:48.030> my<00:02:48.930> practice

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
now I can switch over to my practice

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.819 
now I can switch over to my practice
longsword<00:02:50.690> which<00:02:51.690> should<00:02:52.170> do<00:02:52.349> a<00:02:52.380> bit<00:02:52.620> more

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
longsword which should do a bit more

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.640 
longsword which should do a bit more
damage<00:02:53.239> not<00:02:54.239> too<00:02:54.599> much<00:02:54.840> more<00:02:54.989> damage<00:02:55.410> though<00:02:55.590> I

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
damage not too much more damage though I

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.509 
damage not too much more damage though I
don't<00:02:55.769> think<00:02:55.980> it's<00:02:56.400> it's<00:02:57.000> still<00:02:57.209> pretty<00:02:57.329> basic

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
don't think it's it's still pretty basic

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.940 
don't think it's it's still pretty basic
let's<00:02:59.519> draw<00:02:59.700> that<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.690> for<00:03:01.440> some<00:03:01.590> reason<00:03:01.860> it

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
let's draw that and for some reason it

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.770 
let's draw that and for some reason it
makes<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.190> metal<00:03:02.549> unsheathing<00:03:03.209> sound<00:03:03.510> even

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
makes a metal unsheathing sound even

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.470 
makes a metal unsheathing sound even
though<00:03:03.840> it's<00:03:03.989> made<00:03:04.079> of<00:03:04.230> wood<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:05.420> now<00:03:06.420> we

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
though it's made of wood and now we

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.610 
though it's made of wood and now we
charge<00:03:06.840> again<00:03:11.420> now<00:03:12.420> how<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:12.900> want<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.319> do<00:03:13.500> it

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
charge again now how you want to do it

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.860 
charge again now how you want to do it
is<00:03:13.769> you<00:03:13.859> want<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.069> ready<00:03:14.340> your<00:03:14.519> attack<00:03:14.819> and<00:03:15.090> you

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
is you want to ready your attack and you

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.720 
is you want to ready your attack and you
want<00:03:16.019> to<00:03:16.109> wait<00:03:16.350> until<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:17.190> moose<00:03:17.370> starts

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
want to wait until the moose starts

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.720 
want to wait until the moose starts
moving<00:03:18.329> before<00:03:19.019> you<00:03:19.350> attack<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:19.950> way<00:03:20.670> you

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
moving before you attack that way you

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.090 
moving before you attack that way you
have<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.690> optimal<00:03:22.200> amount<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.500> time<00:03:22.709> to

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
have the optimal amount of time to

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.470 
have the optimal amount of time to
recover<00:03:23.670> your<00:03:23.970> stamina<00:03:24.769> now<00:03:26.180> for<00:03:27.180> where<00:03:27.299> I'm

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
recover your stamina now for where I'm

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.979 
recover your stamina now for where I'm
at<00:03:27.660> right<00:03:27.900> here<00:03:27.930> actually<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:29.400> Moose<00:03:29.850> is<00:03:30.090> for

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
at right here actually the Moose is for

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.129 
at right here actually the Moose is for
the<00:03:31.079> most<00:03:31.410> part<00:03:31.620> stopped<00:03:32.280> moving<00:03:32.840> it's<00:03:33.840> pretty

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
the most part stopped moving it's pretty

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.900 
the most part stopped moving it's pretty
much<00:03:34.230> just<00:03:34.470> walking<00:03:34.829> along<00:03:34.950> now<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.370> guess

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
much just walking along now and guess

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.520 
much just walking along now and guess
it's<00:03:36.090> given<00:03:36.840> up<00:03:36.959> on<00:03:37.109> life<00:03:39.079> so<00:03:40.079> now<00:03:40.200> we<00:03:40.260> can<00:03:40.500> just

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
it's given up on life so now we can just

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.819 
it's given up on life so now we can just
kind<00:03:40.859> of<00:03:40.980> experiment<00:03:41.880> with<00:03:42.380> what<00:03:43.380> hurts<00:03:43.680> the

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
kind of experiment with what hurts the

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.839 
kind of experiment with what hurts the
most<00:03:44.780> it's<00:03:45.780> all<00:03:45.959> blunt<00:03:46.290> damage<00:03:46.739> but<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.700> get

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
most it's all blunt damage but you get

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.879 
most it's all blunt damage but you get
different<00:03:48.090> types<00:03:48.299> of<00:03:48.569> slashes<00:03:49.109> so<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.799> know

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
different types of slashes so you know

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:54.840 
different types of slashes so you know
left<00:03:50.190> /<00:03:50.430> right<00:03:50.579> /<00:03:51.000> left<00:03:51.030> /<00:03:51.630> right<00:03:52.079> /

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
left / right / left / right /

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.400 
left / right / left / right /
I<00:03:55.030> don't<00:03:55.810> have<00:03:55.960> enough<00:03:56.200> for<00:03:56.320> the<00:03:56.410> combo<00:03:56.800> yet

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
I don't have enough for the combo yet

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.110 
I don't have enough for the combo yet
but<00:03:59.410> you<00:03:59.740> can<00:03:59.920> start<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.340> get<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.610> combos

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
but you can start to get the combos

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.880 
but you can start to get the combos
working<00:04:01.630> and<00:04:01.990> you<00:04:02.620> can<00:04:02.890> just<00:04:03.220> get<00:04:04.210> an<00:04:04.270> idea<00:04:04.360> of

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
working and you can just get an idea of

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.050 
working and you can just get an idea of
what<00:04:05.890> does<00:04:06.070> what<00:04:07.440> it<00:04:08.440> seems<00:04:08.680> like<00:04:09.060> slashes

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
what does what it seems like slashes

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.170 
what does what it seems like slashes
with<00:04:10.900> this<00:04:11.170> blunt<00:04:11.770> sword<00:04:12.070> don't<00:04:12.400> do<00:04:12.610> or<00:04:12.970> I<00:04:13.000> mean

with this blunt sword don't do or I mean

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.110 
with this blunt sword don't do or I mean
stabs<00:04:13.890> seems<00:04:14.890> like<00:04:15.040> stabs<00:04:15.340> with<00:04:15.610> this<00:04:15.760> blunt

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
stabs seems like stabs with this blunt

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.570 
stabs seems like stabs with this blunt
sword<00:04:16.300> don't<00:04:16.660> do<00:04:16.840> too<00:04:17.020> much<00:04:17.140> damage<00:04:17.400> but<00:04:18.400> it

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
sword don't do too much damage but it

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.510 
sword don't do too much damage but it
does<00:04:18.790> seem<00:04:19.060> like<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:20.260> overhead<00:04:20.890> is<00:04:21.160> decent

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
does seem like the overhead is decent

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.360 
does seem like the overhead is decent
5.2<00:04:24.520> 7.5<00:04:25.240> as<00:04:25.870> opposed<00:04:26.200> to<00:04:26.350> the<00:04:26.560> two<00:04:26.860> that<00:04:27.190> I<00:04:27.220> was

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
5.2 7.5 as opposed to the two that I was

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.460 
5.2 7.5 as opposed to the two that I was
getting<00:04:27.490> on<00:04:27.670> this<00:04:27.760> stabbed<00:04:28.720> every<00:04:28.990> time<00:04:29.170> and

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
getting on this stabbed every time and

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.740 
getting on this stabbed every time and
then<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.160> sideways<00:04:30.610> slash<00:04:31.000> seems<00:04:31.420> to<00:04:31.630> be

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
then the sideways slash seems to be

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:39.930 
then the sideways slash seems to be
decent<00:04:31.990> also<00:04:32.530> oh<00:04:32.770> yeah<00:04:33.490> 7.4<00:04:34.270> there<00:04:34.480> we<00:04:34.570> go<00:04:36.150> BAM

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.140 

all<00:04:40.660> right<00:04:40.840> so<00:04:41.650> I<00:04:41.980> doubt<00:04:42.370> you<00:04:42.580> would<00:04:42.700> get<00:04:42.940> this

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
all right so I doubt you would get this

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.790 
all right so I doubt you would get this
much<00:04:43.390> leveling<00:04:43.870> if<00:04:44.050> you<00:04:44.230> were<00:04:44.350> using<00:04:44.590> the

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
much leveling if you were using the

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.720 
much leveling if you were using the
regular<00:04:45.010> leveling<00:04:45.610> situation<00:04:46.300> but<00:04:47.220> you<00:04:48.220> can

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
regular leveling situation but you can

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.540 
regular leveling situation but you can
use<00:04:49.270> peaceful<00:04:49.930> animals<00:04:50.380> to<00:04:50.860> get<00:04:50.980> yourself<00:04:51.370> up

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
use peaceful animals to get yourself up

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.140 
use peaceful animals to get yourself up
to<00:04:51.880> a<00:04:52.180> point<00:04:52.540> where<00:04:53.350> well<00:04:54.280> now<00:04:54.610> I<00:04:54.640> can<00:04:54.940> use<00:04:54.970> my

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
to a point where well now I can use my
