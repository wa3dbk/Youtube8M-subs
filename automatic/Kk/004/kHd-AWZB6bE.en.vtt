00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.920 
can do well in the Olympics end of the
year<00:02:18.110> maybe<00:02:18.980> same<00:02:19.280> like<00:02:19.459> last<00:02:19.489> year<00:02:19.910> can<00:02:20.569> stay

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
year maybe same like last year can stay

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.510 
year maybe same like last year can stay
in<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.110> top<00:02:21.380> five<00:02:21.620> my<00:02:21.980> goal<00:02:22.220> for<00:02:22.250> the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
in the top five my goal for the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.040 
in the top five my goal for the
beginning<00:02:22.880> of<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.120> year<00:02:23.269> was<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.660> be<00:02:23.810> solid

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
beginning of the year was to be solid

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.870 
beginning of the year was to be solid
and<00:02:24.290> consistent<00:02:24.470> because<00:02:25.100> that's<00:02:25.489> what<00:02:25.700> the

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
and consistent because that's what the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.540 
and consistent because that's what the
top<00:02:26.209> players<00:02:26.450> are<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.080> that's<00:02:28.010> what<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:28.220> try<00:02:28.310> to

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
top players are and that's what I try to

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.059 
top players are and that's what I try to
do<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.940> whole<00:02:29.090> year<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.600> then<00:02:30.530> we<00:02:30.709> will<00:02:30.890> see

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
do the whole year and then we will see

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.910 
do the whole year and then we will see
how<00:02:31.190> far<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:31.550> brings<00:02:31.790> me
