00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.020
 hello very good friends and frick box and 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:08.360
 welcome to a new chapter of that 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.059
 we know see you already know that in this 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.490
 section we are going to analyze different 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.379
 games series or movies that are by 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.930
 come and let's recap all the 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.450
 information that we have today we are going to 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.260
 talk about division one of the 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:27.580
 most anticipated video games for this year 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.869
 let's hope that for this year so 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.100
 let's start talking and what 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:36.540
 we know of this video game developed 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.640
 by a ubisoft company 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.000
 Well, you know that division is 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.590
 It's about a third-person shooter 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.720
 set in the near future in the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.660
 New York City that after a 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.750
 terrorist attack will be scarce 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.820
 basic resources and survival not 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.980
 will be insured 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.120
 Well, in this video, we want you 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.700
 count so whole recap 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.160
 the information that we have at 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.950
 today and I repeat today if 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.930
 tomorrow some news will be made what 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.670
 I'm sorry but it will not be included in 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.710
 this video so we started 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.770
 of division is based on a form of 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.670
 game similar to sting accustomed to 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.980
 that I mentioned destiny because I'm going to 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.260
 name several times 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.970
 and I mean like fate and 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.220
 campaign and the multiplayer it seems that 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.070
 will be integrated so that we are 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.080
 playing both at once because I'm going to 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.270
 give an example if you are playing and 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.830
 expel them with other soldiers this 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.990
 will be handled by someone from his 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.490
 home but you will be making a 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.710
 mission different from yours and if 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.020
 you want and if of course he too what 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.760
 you wish you can join and perform 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.320
 joint missions 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.970
 for what we have seen in the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.550
 videos we will have technologies 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.770
 advanced enough to think that 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.710
 will be set in a future not very 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.120
 far but not so much to suppose that 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.760
 there is still a long way to go 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.680
 apparently division run to run 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.810
 sorry or at least you will try it at 1080p and 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.239
 30 frames per second 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.790
 according to their managers to maintain the 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:22.940
 graphic quality honestly if you stay 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.370
 well as is the thing I'm satisfied 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.610
 of division will have great touches of rpg 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.400
 that is, there will be trade and others 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.860
 elements that characterize this style 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.080
 how to improve weapons skills 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.330
 equipment and other 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.270
 the competitive modes will take something 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.100
 as well as dark areas where you can 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.110
 Win and lose valuable items 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.240
 permanently 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.490
 when you discover an object of value in 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.080
 the dark areas will have to take you 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.030
 I get it through calls 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.790
 extraction areas if you want 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.470
 keep it in the rest of the game if 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.650
 you die on the way, you can 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.530
 say goodbye to him 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.810
 the secondary characters is to say the 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.629
 citizens and passers- by apparently 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.640
 will have a vital role in history 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.770
 but it has not been revealed yet 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.130
 that neither the comfortable 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.990
 there will be an area called green zone in 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.160
 the one that buy you join with our 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:23.050
 players if the destination tower 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.000
 patrols will have a maximum of 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.740
 four players plus others that is the one 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.830
 can give support from a tablet or 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:33.050
 mobile device in the beginning these 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.300
 patrols will have the name of bands 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.760
 of division plans to reduce everything 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.730
 possible the number of kinematics for 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.170
 Do not interrupt the pace of play I do not know 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.010
 you history projects 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.409
 cooperative 'la them 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.239
 of division will require constant connection 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:51.620
 to the internet to work effectively 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.599
 as defined 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.540
 the game will have an editor of 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:04:00.230
 character that will be accessed nothing more 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.130
 get to the game choose well put 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.440
 that what you choose will be permanent 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.900
 Microsoft long ago 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.490
 he mentioned that he would have exclusivity 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.610
 temporary in downloadable content 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.770
 from division surely similar to 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.530
 the rights of call of dutty in teams 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.109
 Web 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.320
 as a curious fact the same hideo kojima 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:26.020
 the creator of the saga metal gear could 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.850
 see the title a few months ago and the game 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.889
 it left him so hallucinated that according to his 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.969
 words made him want to stop 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.059
 make video games 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:37.789
 and little more in theory and cross the 

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:43.579
 fingers will receive division this year 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:45.319
 2015 for xbox one ps4 ipc and it is definitely 

00:04:43.579 --> 00:04:47.100
 one of the most anticipated titles of this 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:48.690
 year 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.240
 we hope that all this seeing 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.800
 information has clarified a bit and 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.480
 If you know any more information we 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.810
 would love to let us in the 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.380
 comments I say goodbye and until the 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.100
 next video 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.100
 goodbye
