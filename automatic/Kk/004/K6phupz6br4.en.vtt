 about the evening conquerors space 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.340
 just yesterday I stumbled upon a very 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.500
 interesting site is likely to be 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.880
 interest only for those who are spire but 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:19.350
 but I will tell you everything and so conscious 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.560
 glue on the left you can change you need 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.320
 layout convenient for you to fix those 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.240
 who still does not remember and does not know everything slept and 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.880
 You can view only 6 years 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.399
 training it all fought how long you 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.040
 can you get the classic 10 words 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.829
 which you can do as fast 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.350
 combo is how much do you make a stronghold 30 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.719
 seconds hat trick your 3 better combo in 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.579
 for 30 seconds it's random to you 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.789
 need about more you stand 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.950
 from one to three plov and no limit 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.950
 As an example, I will show you the regime by force 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.450
 in this short review comes to an end 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.140
 train develop victories and less
