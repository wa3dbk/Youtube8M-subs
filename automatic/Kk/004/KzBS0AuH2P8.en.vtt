00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
cookie pop because it holds together

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.910 
cookie pop because it holds together
beautifully<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.170> helps<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.619> set<00:01:40.890> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
beautifully and it helps it to set a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.410 
beautifully and it helps it to set a
little<00:01:41.159> bit<00:01:41.340> firmer<00:01:41.549> than<00:01:41.790> if<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.000> use<00:01:42.119> just<00:01:42.299> a

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
little bit firmer than if you use just a

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.300 
little bit firmer than if you use just a
regular<00:01:42.570> frosting<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.560> once<00:01:43.740> your<00:01:43.860> ganache<00:01:43.979> is

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
regular frosting so once your ganache is

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.980 
regular frosting so once your ganache is
nice<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.880> smooth<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.210> just<00:01:45.509> want<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.720> pour<00:01:45.960> it

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
nice and smooth you just want to pour it

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.260 
nice and smooth you just want to pour it
over<00:01:46.200> your<00:01:46.619> cookie<00:01:47.070> mix<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.820> kind<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.119> like

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
over your cookie mix and I kind of like

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.090 
over your cookie mix and I kind of like
to<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.659> by<00:01:48.899> eye<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.170> kind<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.680> like<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.860> put

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
to do this by eye I kind of like to put

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.230 
to do this by eye I kind of like to put
it<00:01:50.220> through<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.579> then<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:50.729> give<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.180> a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
it through and then just give it a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.300 
it through and then just give it a
little<00:01:51.360> stir<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.899> then<00:01:52.290> add<00:01:52.500> more<00:01:52.799> if<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.130> need

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
little stir and then add more if I need

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.249 
little stir and then add more if I need
it<00:01:53.460> what<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.000> want<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.210> avoid<00:01:54.329> here<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> dry

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
it what you want to avoid here is a dry

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.679 
it what you want to avoid here is a dry
mix<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.890> want<00:01:56.009> quite<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.399> moist<00:01:56.790> mix<00:01:57.149> but<00:01:57.600> if

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
mix you want quite a moist mix but if

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:58.850 
mix you want quite a moist mix but if
you<00:01:57.750> put<00:01:57.899> too<00:01:57.930> much<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.469> can<00:01:58.619> end<00:01:58.740> up<00:01:58.799> being

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
you put too much in it can end up being

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.030 
you put too much in it can end up being
a<00:01:59.100> little<00:01:59.310> bit<00:01:59.430> greasy<00:01:59.990> it's<00:02:00.990> almost<00:02:01.500> perfect

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
a little bit greasy it's almost perfect

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.260 
a little bit greasy it's almost perfect
but<00:02:02.100> I'm<00:02:02.250> going<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.460> add<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.909> bit<00:02:03.030> more<00:02:03.149> of

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
but I'm going to add just a bit more of

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.340 
but I'm going to add just a bit more of
that<00:02:03.390> ganache

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
that ganache

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.060 
that ganache
beautiful<00:02:06.350> so<00:02:06.500> that's<00:02:06.650> the<00:02:06.770> kind<00:02:06.950> of

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
beautiful so that's the kind of

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.590 
beautiful so that's the kind of
consistency<00:02:07.549> that<00:02:07.790> you're<00:02:07.909> looking<00:02:08.209> for<00:02:08.420> you

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
consistency that you're looking for you

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.330 
consistency that you're looking for you
can<00:02:08.840> see<00:02:09.080> when<00:02:09.229> I<00:02:09.259> pinch<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:09.740> sort<00:02:09.890> of<00:02:10.009> holds

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
can see when I pinch it it sort of holds

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.949 
can see when I pinch it it sort of holds
its<00:02:10.459> shape<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:11.209> don't<00:02:11.330> want<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:11.630> go<00:02:11.720> anywhere

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
its shape you don't want to go anywhere

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.050

than<00:02:12.620> that<00:02:12.770> but<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.040> certainly<00:02:13.310> don't<00:02:13.520> want<00:02:13.940> a

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
than that but you certainly don't want a

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.030 
than that but you certainly don't want a

freezer that's been in the freezer for
only<00:02:50.959> about<00:02:51.140> 10<00:02:51.410> minutes<00:02:51.620> so<00:02:51.830> it<00:02:52.100> should<00:02:52.310> be

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
only about 10 minutes so it should be

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.250 
only about 10 minutes so it should be
starting<00:02:52.820> to<00:02:52.970> firm<00:02:53.209> up<00:02:53.239> but<00:02:53.600> it's<00:02:53.720> still<00:02:54.019> not

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
starting to firm up but it's still not

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.229 
starting to firm up but it's still not
quite<00:02:54.530> completely<00:02:55.070> firm<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.850> can<00:02:55.940> see<00:02:56.090> there

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
quite completely firm you can see there

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.090 
quite completely firm you can see there
it's<00:02:56.390> holding<00:02:56.720> its<00:02:56.840> shape<00:02:56.900> quite<00:02:57.230> nicely<00:02:57.470> so

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
it's holding its shape quite nicely so

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.259 
it's holding its shape quite nicely so
I'm<00:02:58.190> going<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.430> use<00:02:58.550> this<00:02:58.670> opportunity<00:02:59.239> just

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
I'm going to use this opportunity just

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.750 
I'm going to use this opportunity just
to<00:02:59.450> try<00:02:59.690> and<00:02:59.780> make<00:02:59.900> it<00:03:00.019> as<00:03:00.110> round<00:03:00.530> as<00:03:00.890> possible

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
to try and make it as round as possible

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.640 
to try and make it as round as possible
now<00:03:01.940> so<00:03:02.360> I'm<00:03:02.480> just<00:03:02.690> rolling<00:03:03.170> it<00:03:03.290> back<00:03:03.440> and

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
now so I'm just rolling it back and

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.530 
now so I'm just rolling it back and
forth<00:03:03.830> still<00:03:04.160> on<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.430> parchment<00:03:04.970> paper<00:03:05.180> and

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
forth still on that parchment paper and

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.270 
forth still on that parchment paper and
so<00:03:05.930> that<00:03:06.080> I<00:03:06.110> don't<00:03:06.170> get<00:03:06.440> a<00:03:06.500> new<00:03:06.800> seam<00:03:07.100> in<00:03:07.250> it

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
so that I don't get a new seam in it

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.740 
so that I don't get a new seam in it
when<00:03:07.489> I<00:03:07.519> do<00:03:07.640> refreeze<00:03:08.209> it<00:03:08.239> I'm<00:03:08.420> going<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:08.600> bring

when I do refreeze it I'm going to bring

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.390 
when I do refreeze it I'm going to bring
it<00:03:08.870> all<00:03:09.079> the<00:03:09.110> way<00:03:09.380> back<00:03:09.650> here<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.190> very

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
with these little bits you just want to

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.479 
with these little bits you just want to
grab<00:03:50.840> them<00:03:51.109> and<00:03:51.230> we<00:03:51.350> just<00:03:51.380> kind<00:03:51.950> of<00:03:52.040> roll<00:03:52.310> them

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
grab them and we just kind of roll them

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:53.920 
grab them and we just kind of roll them
out<00:03:52.640> so<00:03:52.820> I'm<00:03:52.880> going<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.090> sandwich<00:03:53.660> them<00:03:53.840> in

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
out so I'm going to sandwich them in

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.229 
out so I'm going to sandwich them in
between<00:03:54.049> the<00:03:54.350> baking<00:03:54.650> paper<00:03:54.829> and<00:03:55.100> push<00:03:55.910> them

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
between the baking paper and push them

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.940 
between the baking paper and push them
down<00:03:56.269> I'm<00:03:57.079> actually<00:03:57.290> going<00:03:57.530> to<00:03:57.620> use<00:03:57.709> a<00:03:57.739> little

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
down I'm actually going to use a little

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.259 
down I'm actually going to use a little
rolling<00:03:58.310> pin<00:03:58.489> just<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:58.760> smooth<00:03:59.060> them<00:03:59.209> out

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
rolling pin just to smooth them out

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.430 
rolling pin just to smooth them out
because<00:03:59.510> you<00:03:59.570> want<00:03:59.750> these<00:03:59.870> as<00:04:00.049> thin<00:04:00.290> as<00:04:00.410> they

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
because you want these as thin as they

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.170 
because you want these as thin as they
can<00:04:00.709> be<00:04:00.859> so<00:04:01.010> they<00:04:01.040> look<00:04:01.310> realistic<00:04:01.700> I'm

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
can be so they look realistic I'm

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.729 
can be so they look realistic I'm
actually<00:04:02.390> just<00:04:02.570> going<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:02.840> use<00:04:02.959> my<00:04:02.989> knife<00:04:03.410> and
