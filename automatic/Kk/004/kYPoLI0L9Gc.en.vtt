00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 Hello everyone and I will talk about the no 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.759
 editor character update a lot 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.200
 people liked the previous video had 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.340
 many likes and I hope it is also 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.080
 if you like it and if you want it to continue 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.450
 recording the editor character I gave him 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.580
 like since good in theories like 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.560
 many what happens is that there was a part 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.359
 of you is the one that finished us 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.500
 liking this hack I understand that no 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.180
 you like it because there are people who are engaged 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.680
 to put on this to play not only 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.449
 to get on servers and put a 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.680
 fuck more people I understand that no 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.900
 you like it for that part but also 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.780
 has good things good things that are 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.180
 can do with this with this editor 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.680
 as for example it facilitates me sometimes 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.000
 record some videos I can catch things 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.770
 from here since you can touch the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.210
 inventory I can upload a character 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.829
 so I did not have to upload it and said 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.770
 skills for example if I want to load 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.660
 a guide and this part is very good 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.210
 I understand that there are people who 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.800
 use to do things like you put 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.129
 servers with a super-high character 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.469
 and does nonsense but in theory that is to say 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.539
 in theory that does not come to you that does not mean 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.789
 it does an evil to you directly like this 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.619
 that does not need to complain so much 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.790
 well I for my part I will explain the 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.270
 neutralization if you want to see what 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.770
 previous 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.630
 said on the screen there will be some label 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.770
 that leads to the previous video in the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.219
 previous 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.390
 let's say I talked about all this 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.820
 that I will not explain in this video 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.710
 also talk about pets and 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.509
 some more things today I'm going to talk about 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.299
 things have placed us that by 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.860
 example here you can the name can be 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.329
 change both the character and the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.640
 pet can also touch the 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.500
 skills the skills here you see the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.750
 skills this is what the X is for 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.250
 upload pet skills to be able to 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.479
 climb in delta wing and all this then 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.159
 from here you can touch they are put 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.140
 numbers and that's 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.360
 also pets have corrected 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.069
 some bugs but have also read 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.720
 now you can touch the inventory this 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.299
 is super good and there are very strange things 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.950
 like what we're going to see right now but 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.689
 before everything has some bugs you have 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.459
 to understand that if for example I 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.140
 I put here the fields that are assigned 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:57.239
 integrations that there is nothing in them 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.549
 it's an empty insurance if I want to change it 

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:02.719
 because with them I'll type that is 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.129
 let's say this allows us to take a 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:08.940
 an object that already has inventory by 

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:10.709
 example and modify it in such a way that 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.359
 I can transform this lamp into one in 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.980
 a weapon if I want that is can be 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:16.380
 touch a lot I can convert this 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.609
 weapon in legendary in normal to change 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.319
 the level I can change the material of 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:22.530
 what is made can change the let's say 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:26.160
 that the title you have in the name 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.350
 Well, I can change the type of weapon that 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.590
 is I can change it until I turn it into 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.620
 food if I want is let's say that respect 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.420
 to what has been the edition of 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.030
 within the inventory you have a great 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.130
 freedom to do what you want there 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.769
 things that like this what allows you is 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.840
 to play let's say it gives you type and it gives you 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.849
 everything in the archives or something 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.859
 well and there are very strange things like 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.620
 example a cube of mana that I 'm going to 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:54.580
 put one so that you see it yesterday I put 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.760
 quantity 1 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.299
 here I will leave it there 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.470
 and I know I'm going to put a gun to see 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.269
 if I can because this is a bit 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.290
 pumped and the best I put a pick 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.290
 see if he leaves me 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.859
 and I put quantity 1 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.540
 it does not leave me beige has when it happens 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.950
 this will be what you see it shine 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.239
 I 'm not going to do it because 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.219
 It would be a waste of time but good 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.109
 I recommend you look at these things if 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:23.030
 better if I discover that the peak 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.709
 I am torch and you give me more information 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.060
 because I really believe that they are 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.019
 things that are going to be put in the same 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.969
 future in the game but we open 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.620
 it's only in the archives but they're 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.849
 very rare and I just think you can 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.950
 catch with hacks because I've never 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.769
 seen in the game and well you can also 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.180
 touch what you can put here food 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.530
 of animals although you can also 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.389
 put in this hole if you want not to 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.909
 you have to come here but anyway 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:46.099
 you can also change the coins that 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:47.989
 you have the let's say I do want 24 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.299
 gold coins because I give to know and the 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.639
 I will have in the game so much for now 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.680
 you can not touch what is being what 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.730
 what your character has equipped 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.109
 You can touch it from here 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.120
 inventory and from the inventory put it 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:02.090
 in the equipment but for now I do not know 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.560
 can play and little else I'm going to put 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.150
 give safe 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.080
 and I'll get into the game for him 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.070
 see 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.070
 one second 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.680
 and you are going to see strange things there are also 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.920
 pictures yes yes yes now you are going to see it 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.810
 there is the one who had touched 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.060
 the body has it strange because I have not yet 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.850
 removed the texture package that put plan 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.380
 had the video here you see the cube 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.410
 of mana this this is something that still not 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.170
 a second is at stake 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.580
 or if you are I do not know it is to say what I have 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.140
 searched for information on the internet and I do not 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.390
 I have seen nothing either I came across 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.470
 one playing so I think they are that 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.990
 they are in the archives but not yet 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:46.660
 in the game 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:46.660
 look at an example result here everything is 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.110
 abal is that I already have one I think is 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.180
 because I already have one equipped before 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.280
 Trying this, he put me a cube of 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.590
 manna I put it on the floor I took and plan 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.320
 cell I picked it up and it got I received a 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.630
 cube of a mana cube and if you look 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.120
 in the character below the experience 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.710
 it has like a cube that is the cube of 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.060
 Mana and I do not know what it's for 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.380
 they are weird things to be in the 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.570
 game and you do not know very well too 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:18.030
 found this here that is a 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.920
 kind of paint look at that there 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.600
 I think they are paintings to decorate houses 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.400
 later because he does not have any 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.890
 another authority if you notice you put power 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.020
 -4 I do not know what this is already knows 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.700
 that sends me a mp telling me what it is 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.530
 this because I'm a little confused 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.560
 and practically also what you can 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.210
 to do is like changing the weapons you can 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.970
 take a gun and for example this one has 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.440
 legendary place of you can also 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.290
 change so that it is not a weapon of 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.270
 warrior can you put the cane pressure 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.140
 there are also peaks things that is also not 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.630
 in the game I still have not seen 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.940
 there are also tools to give 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.500
 for what the crop has been 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.910
 but you still can not because 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.290
 I imagine it is for these for future 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.400
 cubel updates because by 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.830
 now it does not have any use that 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.530
 and I recommend that you come here 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:05.190
 what is the inventory and what 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.190
 let's play 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.700
 what you put here 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.490
 this from here that are objects of 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.300
 medicine emissions that is that I all 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.710
 this 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.500
 for example this this here still 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.180
 have been touched you see that I have not 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.230
 touched because I for example within the 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.330
 game I've never seen these things 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.130
 surely as I said three or 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.800
 four times in the future be but by 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.260
 now it has no use at all this is 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.390
 all 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:38.150
 I'm going to close here no and that's it 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:41.690
 here in the below in the description the 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:44.360
 download link and little else these things 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.400
 I know if I discover something weird or if 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.950
 you know something of all this that I taught you 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.240
 over the peaks and this that maybe if 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.590
 is at stake I still do not know why 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.600
 send me a message a private message 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.130
 for now stopped recording no longer sees no 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.870
 feel video if you want more videos about 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.540
 the charter edited with doctors in then me 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.100
 you leave a like and a comment 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.280
 and nothing new feels video and even the 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.280
 next
