00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:05.940
 Solon get on my first two actually too expensive at the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.510
 greek crisis round that got me pretty excited »throughout 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.040
 Internet Although there were many spectators, especially the g2 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.740
 but only in English many are not so much with the English me 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.039
 here finally 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.120
 clearly is too expensive and I hope it will continue to help 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:26.159
 in this first episode we will start like in no big action 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.329
 be with us 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.640
 Basic functions it's actually the same with Ellison 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:33.070
 How do we get the box to work? 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.050
 so take a look at the surface 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.670
 he is very well structured 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.390
 we have left 6a 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.330
 at the FDP goes 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.410
 and as you can see 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.680
 1 2 were well distributed 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.860
 Löw it in Witten to adjust left and right have each identical 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.730
 we already have it like him playing the NDR 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.250
 the court came 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.480
 critic 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.199
 or in the old mode 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.219
 an iPod 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.940
 Silverstone 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.670
 Gerry Boyle confused 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.260
 four individual DAX 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.740
 but here he has one 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.700
 as said City 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.740
 gave this as Lex indicates the comes 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.370
 and here, of course 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.860
 the costs 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.510
 not to mention at the very end which wounds the USB keyboard 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.920
 but they only exist 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.850
 with the purchase of the in Baar 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.090
 who is a Captcha Kellys, however, can highly recommend 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.310
 For the first time, the Jaaa's hand is not cheap 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.310
 and the resulting so safely stowed and as I said 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.930
 the keyboard is now the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.820
 just for example search functions 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.390
 at these al Pacino 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.730
 that the surface offered to terminals 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.480
 we have once 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.210
 of course he is off 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.360
 Kösching Peace 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.790
 we have a change of expenses for years 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.359
 published right next to it 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:59.950
 Amplifier for example 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.439
 No, we have a key for additional 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.370
 CD text 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.260
 he always wanted to » 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.369
 came 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.819
 and of course, the shooter for mass storage devices 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.989
 that means they can connect hard drives or another one 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.539
 own goal 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:19.539
 he crawled you should definitely clearly released as I said 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:23.169
 where is the cash register 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.929
 Spring then visa - and has all alone up here left 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:30.469
 pressed for two seconds for the domestic rider 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.899
 and because that too Dr 

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:35.849
 Also use DJ Ipek 2 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.749
 a lie it invited me but you could 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.749
 the concern 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:51.749
 yes some are already very impressive 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:56.949
 what actually makes the ALG i de 2 I take this incredible 

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:58.819
 important and useful feature 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.219
 Brad new normalcy 2 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:02.020
 around 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.959
 the iPad is over 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.129
 not only very nice to look at but with a lot of functions 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.220
 like Ndri Romaric use two each 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:16.099
 which is actually meant to be with an iPod, of course 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.099
 this one says it further we take our 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.849
 stand in Rheine 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:26.509
 Lhasa down 

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:33.009
 her father and Saariaho for our library 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:38.599
 want to distract or we want to have them over in the 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.709
 Meanwhile have changed 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:41.649
 against WR 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:45.089
 charged what with the laiterie too sure 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:48.089
 I will do that in an extra tutorial 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:52.459
 she has him 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.459
 the mode for our connected iPod 

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:58.369
 and here Dr 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:02.229
 Jacobi everything we also recognize from its function in Hypo 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:03.229
 we have 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:08.459
 Red Aalen Artest Chance this is reported long ago and if a search option 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.369
 because the ball is nicer 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:13.559
 Ras 

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:15.470
 that was very similar to that 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.799
 Mobile on the iPhone 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.349
 move with whom 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.209
 and select 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.079
 to press 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.079
 yes they visited Zion 

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:28.520
 playlists 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.680
 would have descended 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.420
 what do you say, for example 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.610
 a small selection of two places we did not insert too much 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.419
 to confirm 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.830
 so here again we see Altig Check selection 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.129
 Percent of this playlist open because of it 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:49.729
 and now we come to the point where the music comes into play and the question 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.410
 how do i get a fright a title 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.889
 also conceivable 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.300
 or de 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.270
 and this is 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.080
 Super easy 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.740
 Of course you can everyone with the beer 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.870
 as the titles select each time a pinch his suffering 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:07.249
 We also want Gagfah 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:10.089
 she wants here 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:12.900
 del Pozo endende just does it to me 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.229
 to assert we see 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.580
 because contact to the game 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.870
 it's loaded 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.419
 Intel Corp. lines old 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.419
 and he is ready to play 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.319
 next 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.059
 in addition to the the New Formula Renault 

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:30.069
 also in the EU 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:30.880
 b 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.240
 very difficult here we see the UBI 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.650
 So the DFB 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.469
 but press 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.499
 and already on the way 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:42.499
 so too the jets are now loaded 

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:47.979
 should the checks are loaded and there is nothing against it 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.979
 To make music 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:55.030
 that is conceivable 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.030
 his work 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.830
 Falke Prix started 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.659
 and that both together 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:23.449
 so 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:26.949
 that's actually already the basic function that shared the gp2 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:32.039
 we will go into a later tutorial on the details 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:34.110
 also bears the animal paradise 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:39.770
 even the manager this very important to the training 74 Metier if he all that 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.810
 want to see it 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.540
 Hereby he lies aside since you will find some very important ones in the future 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.409
 Tips and tricks for dealing with Iraq 2 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:50.730
 if he had front 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:51.820
 write me 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.860
 to the Jelly underlined 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.860
 Matchday 2 prompt de 

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:59.419
 at the conclusion this was only 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.800
 very important you are with your party and that is already done 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.529
 Of course, now the whole thing has to be switched off 

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:08.529
 the Stormarner Cemex 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:10.800
 zoom 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.830
 and now 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.089
 who has an iPod of course knows that 

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:16.969
 before we turn it off, of course we have to 

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:18.379
 the iPod 

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:20.319
 Judge me raise 

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:21.809
 and there you will find it 

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:24.219
 the idea Extras Dr 

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:27.219
 the third world just 

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:31.489
 on the display here is again asked if you really want to evaluate 

00:07:31.489 --> 00:07:35.990
 Kasner a sure thing that the thing is not accidentally ejected 

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.990
 We also say advertise 

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:44.529
 to that also otherwise would come from the iTunes now the announcement connection can 

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:45.469
 be separated 

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:47.550
 we do that too 

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.029
 and with that we are ready 

00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:53.119
 to write out the reality two 

00:07:53.119 --> 00:07:54.190
 very easily 

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.190
 press the on / off switch and that 

00:07:58.339 --> 00:08:00.300
 until the red bar here 

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.360
 has arrived at its end so the ad will take a turn 

00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:07.569
 you do not always have him a DJIA 

00:08:07.569 --> 00:08:08.639
 almost avenged 

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:09.909
 switched off 

00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:12.699
 that was better the basics a little overview 

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:16.139
 soon there will be more here on the youtube page 

00:08:16.139 --> 00:08:18.769
 Thank you for your attention until next time
