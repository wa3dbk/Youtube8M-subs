with<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.780> one<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.380> some<00:01:22.560> fun<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.979> let's

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
with this one have some fun and let's

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:50.360 
with this one have some fun and let's
look<00:01:23.369> at

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.860 

I<00:01:52.940> think<00:01:53.940> number<00:01:54.090> two<00:01:54.210> introduces<00:01:54.840> a

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
I think number two introduces a

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.140 
I think number two introduces a
technique<00:01:55.350> like<00:01:55.530> Hendrix<00:01:55.710> likes<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.310> use<00:01:56.520> and

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
technique like Hendrix likes to use and

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.150 
technique like Hendrix likes to use and
that<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.600> unison<00:01:58.050> bones<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.620> think<00:01:58.800> things

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
that is in unison bones I think things

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.000 
that is in unison bones I think things
are<00:01:59.220> really<00:01:59.630> underused<00:02:00.630> these<00:02:00.780> days<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.620> it

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
are really underused these days and it

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.800 
are really underused these days and it
simply<00:02:02.520> put<00:02:02.700> what<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> unison<00:02:03.480> bandits

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
simply put what is a unison bandits

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.410 
simply put what is a unison bandits
where<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.080> bend<00:02:04.350> one<00:02:04.680> string<00:02:05.160> to<00:02:05.370> be<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.120> same

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
where you bend one string to be the same

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.750 
where you bend one string to be the same
note<00:02:06.810> as<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.350> string<00:02:07.680> underneath<00:02:07.980> it<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.550> take

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
note as the string underneath it so take

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.490 
note as the string underneath it so take
for<00:02:08.910> example<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.450> seventh<00:02:09.840> fret<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.380> the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
for example the seventh fret of the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.680 
for example the seventh fret of the
