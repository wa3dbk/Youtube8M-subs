00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
we're committing more players were

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.940 
we're committing more players were
attacking<00:00:39.629> more<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.410> were<00:00:40.469> trying<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.739> beat

men<00:00:41.190> even<00:00:41.309> more<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.850> now<00:00:42.180> I'm<00:00:42.510> hoping<00:00:43.079> that's

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
men even more and now I'm hoping that's

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.420 
men even more and now I'm hoping that's
not<00:00:43.379> because<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:43.860> were<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:44.129> playing<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
not because we were just playing the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.889 
not because we were just playing the
bottom<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.180> league<00:00:45.329> team<00:00:45.629> which

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
obviously we were you have to take that

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.040 
obviously we were you have to take that
into<00:00:47.280> account<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.480> hope<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:48.870> something

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
into account and I hope it's something

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.290 
into account and I hope it's something
that<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.350> see<00:00:49.530> going<00:00:50.010> forward<00:00:50.160> playing<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.149> bit
