also turn them off before you you know
turn<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.870> aircraft<00:02:22.080> off<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:23.250> they<00:02:24.030> are<00:02:24.239> on

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
the gyros spin up as you can hear we're

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.600 
the gyros spin up as you can hear we're
going<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.450> give<00:02:54.599> the<00:02:54.690> engine<00:02:54.989> three<00:02:55.470> shots<00:02:56.340> of

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
going to give the engine three shots of

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.710 
going to give the engine three shots of
primer<00:02:57.830> this<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.010> normally<00:02:59.400> aspirated

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
primer this is a normally aspirated

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.399 
primer this is a normally aspirated
carbureted<00:03:00.980> engine<00:03:01.980> not<00:03:02.310> fuel<00:03:02.580> injected<00:03:03.409> so

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
carbureted engine not fuel injected so

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.290 
carbureted engine not fuel injected so
we<00:03:04.739> are<00:03:04.860> going<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.099> prime<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.760> car<00:03:06.000> with<00:03:06.269> a

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
we are going to prime that car with a

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.949 
we are going to prime that car with a
little<00:03:06.569> bit<00:03:06.690> of<00:03:06.810> fuel<00:03:06.989> I<00:03:08.450> know<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.569> somebody

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
little bit of fuel I know that somebody

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.100 
little bit of fuel I know that somebody
else<00:03:10.050> flew<00:03:10.349> it<00:03:10.470> this<00:03:10.590> morning<00:03:11.209> so<00:03:12.209> too<00:03:13.080> is

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
else flew it this morning so too is

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.080 
else flew it this morning so too is
probably<00:03:13.890> good<00:03:14.190> but<00:03:14.519> it's<00:03:14.670> been<00:03:14.849> a<00:03:14.879> couple

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
probably good but it's been a couple

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.990 
probably good but it's been a couple
hours<00:03:15.800> but<00:03:16.800> only<00:03:17.010> been<00:03:17.129> an<00:03:17.220> hour<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.670> usually

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
hours but only been an hour and usually

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.360 
hours but only been an hour and usually
give<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.750> but<00:03:19.530> since<00:03:19.830> it's<00:03:19.980> been<00:03:20.159> about

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
give it to but since it's been about

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.979 
give it to but since it's been about
three<00:03:20.670> hours<00:03:20.849> I'll<00:03:21.269> just<00:03:21.420> go<00:03:21.569> ahead<00:03:21.659> and<00:03:21.750> give

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
three hours I'll just go ahead and give

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.789 
three hours I'll just go ahead and give
it<00:03:22.019> three<00:03:22.470> push<00:03:23.159> it<00:03:23.310> in<00:03:23.430> slowly<00:03:23.849> and<00:03:24.300> then<00:03:24.799> lock

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
it three push it in slowly and then lock

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.699 
it three push it in slowly and then lock
it<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.040> three<00:03:26.430> shots<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:26.970> locked<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:28.110> then

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
it so three shots and locked and then

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.470 
it so three shots and locked and then
we're<00:03:28.799> going<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:28.950> apply<00:03:29.129> our<00:03:29.340> brakes<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:29.940> hold
