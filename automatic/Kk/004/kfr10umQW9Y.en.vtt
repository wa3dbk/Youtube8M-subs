00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
and then that's when I checked out the

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.080 
and then that's when I checked out the
hook<00:01:53.810> power<00:01:54.040> it's<00:01:55.040> actually<00:01:55.369> hard<00:01:55.700> to<00:01:55.759> use

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
hook power it's actually hard to use

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.490 
hook power it's actually hard to use
kind<00:01:56.360> of<00:01:56.420> because<00:01:56.630> have<00:01:56.719> to<00:01:56.810> aim<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.020> perfectly

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
kind of because have to aim a perfectly

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.620 
kind of because have to aim a perfectly
at<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:57.829> guy<00:01:57.979> like<00:01:58.219> you<00:01:59.060> can<00:01:59.180> get<00:01:59.360> it<00:01:59.479> from<00:01:59.570> here

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
at the guy like you can get it from here

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.529 
at the guy like you can get it from here
you<00:01:59.930> have<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.079> go<00:02:00.259> higher<00:02:00.759> just<00:02:01.759> to<00:02:01.909> second<00:02:02.329> and

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
you have to go higher just to second and

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.069 
you have to go higher just to second and
uh<00:02:03.189> first<00:02:04.189> let's<00:02:04.490> try<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.840> thing<00:02:05.840> and

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
uh first let's try the thing and

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.020 
uh first let's try the thing and
basically<00:02:06.829> what<00:02:07.189> the<00:02:07.280> hook<00:02:07.369> power<00:02:07.579> does<00:02:07.789> is<00:02:07.939> it

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
basically what the hook power does is it

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.600 
basically what the hook power does is it
that<00:02:08.240> it<00:02:08.360> pulls<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:08.800> enemy<00:02:09.800> towards<00:02:10.160> you<00:02:10.399> and

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
that it pulls the enemy towards you and

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.140 
that it pulls the enemy towards you and
I<00:02:11.800> guess<00:02:12.800> if<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.010> can<00:02:13.160> do<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.460> perfectly<00:02:13.820> you

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
I guess if you can do it perfectly you

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.760 
I guess if you can do it perfectly you
can<00:02:14.630> pull<00:02:14.780> them<00:02:14.870> towards<00:02:15.320> you<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.500> then<00:02:15.590> take

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
can pull them towards you and then take

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.720 
can pull them towards you and then take
our<00:02:15.920> yellow<00:02:16.010> stuff

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
our yellow stuff

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.460 
our yellow stuff

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
thing that you have the low

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.990 
thing that you have the low
actress<00:02:18.710> city<00:02:18.890> weapon<00:02:19.220> de<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.520> you<00:02:19.640> can<00:02:19.790> melee

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000
