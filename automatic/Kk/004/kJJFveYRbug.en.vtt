00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
呀齁─♪ Everyone is having fun playing KOF13~ 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.941
 I am rushing to call me out. What are you doing? 

00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:12.765
 It seems that we are looking for us to explain this film. 

00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:16.843
 Oh... trouble is dead... I'm going back. 

00:00:16.963 --> 00:00:21.098
 Hey? K's going back, then Kula will have to go back. 

00:00:21.218 --> 00:00:25.309
 Feeding, it won't be just leaving me alone. At least the little girl left me. 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.451
 Then, will I give me ice to eat if I stay? 

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:33.617
 ... well, wait a minute and buy it again. 

00:00:33.737 --> 00:00:38.005
 Wow-♪ Say it’s good, Uncle. Well, I want strawberry ice cream and barrel ice... 

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:41.418
 Big, uncle... 

00:00:41.538 --> 00:00:44.654
 Let's start with some useful information about canceling HD launches. 

00:00:44.774 --> 00:00:52.056
 When using normal and special skills to cancel the HD start, did you accidentally run out of C or B after starting? 

00:00:52.176 --> 00:00:55.533
 Um~. Seems like this sometimes? 

00:00:55.653 --> 00:00:59.035
 First, let's explain why this happens. 

00:00:59.155 --> 00:01:03.600
 When the HD is launched, if the BC is input early, it will become an automatic forward... 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.609
 However, if you use the HD to launch in the second half of the attack, you will run out of the usual attack. 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.726
 The reason why the attack will be missed is this. 

00:01:14.846 --> 00:01:19.025
 Therefore, if you make a hit confirmation when there are fewer consecutive segments, HD launching often becomes too slow... 

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:23.183
 The possibility of a normal attack running out is greatly increased. Be careful when using HD. 

00:01:23.303 --> 00:01:28.413
 However, if you use the feature that you just ran out of the usual attack when you use HD in the second half of the attack, 

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:33.067
 There is a deliberate delay in the use of BC to use the usual attack. This part chooses how easy it is to get started. 

00:01:33.187 --> 00:01:40.203
 If you press BC at the same time in the second half of the attack, you will definitely become a C attack. 

00:01:40.323 --> 00:01:46.666
 If you do not press at the same time, you will become an attack that causes early custody. Remember this. 

00:01:46.786 --> 00:01:51.453
 The same is true when using HD in the air. Try to be aware of this when using HD in the air. 

00:01:51.573 --> 00:01:54.396
 If you use the air to launch, K' can do such a connection. 

00:02:08.358 --> 00:02:11.505
 how is it? I really understand it. 

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:14.492
 Calling... Finally finished? 

00:02:14.612 --> 00:02:17.373
 .... 

00:02:17.493 --> 00:02:20.564
 The next thing to say is "defense extension." 

00:02:20.684 --> 00:02:26.814
 That is to say, if you constantly switch between standing and kneeling in the defensive action, you can extend the defensive movement skills. 

00:02:26.934 --> 00:02:29.385
 Ah haha, so strange action. 

00:02:29.505 --> 00:02:33.596
 KOF13, because it will not be thrown in the defensive action, can be used to avoid the opponent's throwing attack. 

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:37.629
 In addition to command throwing, you can also avoid the automatic selection of the usual throw... 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:41.832
 You can extend the defense time in an instant, and you can usually avoid throwing your opponents at the fastest speed. 

00:02:41.952 --> 00:02:46.220
 Hey? Since the throwing technique is ineffective, will the hitting skills not be beaten because of the relationship in defense? 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.090
 No, because it is a standing and a squatting posture, there are still points in time that will be hit by the next attack. 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:59.606
 So it is not a omnipotent defense. Abuse is strictly prohibited. 

00:02:59.726 --> 00:03:02.354
 The next thing to say is "defense judgment." 

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:06.831
 The defense decision will be slightly larger than the usual hit determination. 

00:03:06.951 --> 00:03:09.357
 ...? 

00:03:09.477 --> 00:03:15.696
 In other words, the attack (defense) that is played in the defense of the kneeling position may not be hit when it is only squatting. 

00:03:15.816 --> 00:03:23.630
 Occasionally try to take the courage and just try it right down. 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.546
 Next, the "Drive slot" will be explained. 

00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:33.195
 In the case where the HD state ends due to the passage of time, the drive slot can continue to be accumulated immediately... 

00:03:33.315 --> 00:03:45.871
 However, if the HD is canceled or NEOMAX is used to end the startup state, the Drive slot will not increase for a certain period of time. 

00:03:45.991 --> 00:04:00.556
 So, although you can't recycle the Drive slot after using the HD to cancel the drive of the Drive slot, 

00:04:00.676 --> 00:04:09.077
 However, if the part of the link is spent in the end and the end of the time is due to the end of the time, the recovery of the Drive slot can be started immediately... 

00:04:09.197 --> 00:04:13.731
 Finally, you can also connect with super killing skills. 

00:04:13.851 --> 00:04:16.257
 It may be interesting to note that the recycling of the Drive slot is a good way to try to develop a link. 

00:04:16.377 --> 00:04:19.005
 The next thing to say is "attack judgment". 

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:23.337
 In this game, the size of the hit determination in the back state is uniform for the whole character. 

00:04:23.457 --> 00:04:27.725
 What does this mean to understand? 

00:04:27.845 --> 00:04:29.986
 I know! Ok…… 

00:04:30.106 --> 00:04:32.379
 what's the meaning? 

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:38.540
 Once the attack hits the opponent, there will be no change in the way of the link due to the difference in the opponent's character. 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.269
 In short, put this knowledge in a corner of your head. 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.125
 Then, it can't be said that it is because the grandfather is too small to be so empty. 

00:04:44.245 --> 00:04:45.942
 That's it. 

00:04:46.062 --> 00:04:49.288
 In addition, although the explanation just seems to sound like a link without a role limitation, 

00:04:49.408 --> 00:04:54.961
 However, the attack of Lock will have subtle changes depending on the opponent's character, and the pursuit method will change. 

00:04:55.081 --> 00:05:00.590
 Of course, in addition to the backlash, the determination of each character is not the same, so just remember to use the striker link without special changes to the connection. 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.427
 The next thing to explain is "MAX Cancel". 

00:05:03.547 --> 00:05:11.139
 You should know that there are several NEOMAX that will become unconditional chasing when using MAX to cancel. 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.290
 Ok? I certainly know it. 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.570
 (really?) 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:26.612
 Because this is due to changes in performance when MAX is canceled, performance will still change even if the previous super-killer itself does not hit the opponent. 

00:05:26.732 --> 00:05:31.709
 Well, although most of the super-killing skills can't be canceled by MAX except hitting the opponent. 

00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:36.303
 However, some of the super-killers can also cancel MAX when they are empty. 

00:05:36.423 --> 00:05:38.519
 Although the consumption of the Power Slot is very large, it can be made possible by the fact that it can be pursued when it cannot be pursued... 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.824
 If you remember this, when may you come in handy? 

00:05:51.866 --> 00:05:54.082
 The last thing to say is about "falling your knees." 

00:05:54.202 --> 00:06:00.598
 In the beginning part of the knees, there is a frame that has been dropped. 

00:06:00.718 --> 00:06:05.784
坂崎琢磨→←→+P&gt;→↘↓\↙←+K is the scene that you will often see. 

00:06:05.904 --> 00:06:10.792
 Other characters can throw if they spend more time. 

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:15.801
 If you combine all of the above-mentioned "attack judgment", "MAX cancel" and "keep your knees down"... 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.081
 It is possible to make a connection that is quite different in style. 

00:06:34.201 --> 00:06:38.203
 Huh... The content of this video is slightly deeper. 

00:06:38.323 --> 00:06:42.324
 I hope that the skills introduced this time can be used in the battle, so that KOF13 can play more fun. 

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:46.490
 That’s right, because the “Homemade Character Matching Competition” is still in the process of raising funds. 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.701
 Please send more to you. 

00:06:50.821 --> 00:06:55.089
 Like the cute Kula color, the handsome K's color, or the wild uncle... 

00:06:55.209 --> 00:06:59.122
 Uncle...
