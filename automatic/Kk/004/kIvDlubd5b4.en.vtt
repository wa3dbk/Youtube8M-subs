first one is me going down the middle of
it<00:00:21.779> now<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.680> terrible<00:00:23.039> idea

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
it now this is a terrible idea

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.670 
it now this is a terrible idea
especially<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.660> Search<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.050> Destroy<00:00:25.080> because

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
especially in Search and Destroy because

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:41.260 
especially in Search and Destroy because
when<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.010> die<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.490> really<00:00:27.180> affects<00:00:27.570> your<00:00:27.750> team

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.610 

just<00:00:42.270> because<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.840> do<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.050> once<00:00:43.290> doesn't

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
just because you can do it once doesn't

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.350 
just because you can do it once doesn't
mean<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.950> can<00:00:44.100> do<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.340> second<00:00:44.700> time<00:00:44.730> and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
mean you can do it a second time and

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.700 
mean you can do it a second time and
while<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> blood<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.900> your<00:00:46.050> screen<00:00:46.260> does<00:00:46.440> look

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
while the blood on your screen does look

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.700 
while the blood on your screen does look
cool<00:00:46.920> other<00:00:47.520> people<00:00:48.000> can<00:00:48.210> see<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.810> think

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
cool other people can see it I think

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.380 
cool other people can see it I think
this<00:00:49.830> next<00:00:50.280> clip<00:00:50.400> really<00:00:50.760> illustrates<00:00:51.240> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
this next clip really illustrates the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.390 
this next clip really illustrates the
importance<00:00:51.810> of<00:00:52.040> concussions<00:00:53.040> and<00:00:53.190> flash

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
importance of concussions and flash

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.580 
importance of concussions and flash
bangs<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.940> Search<00:00:54.150> and<00:00:54.330> Destroy<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.930> think<00:00:55.530> that

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
bangs in Search and Destroy I think that

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.680 
bangs in Search and Destroy I think that
they<00:00:56.520> should<00:00:56.550> really<00:00:56.910> be<00:00:57.090> used<00:00:57.239> more<00:00:57.450> often

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
they should really be used more often

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.600 
they should really be used more often
because<00:00:58.020> since<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.040> live<00:00:59.160> for<00:00:59.340> such<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> short

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
because since you live for such a short

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.790 
because since you live for such a short
amount<00:00:59.880> of<00:01:00.030> time<00:01:00.170> dances<00:01:01.170> are<00:01:01.320> if<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.559> wait

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
amount of time dances are if you wait

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.590 
amount of time dances are if you wait
too<00:01:02.100> long<00:01:02.309> then<00:01:02.610> you'll<00:01:02.760> just<00:01:02.910> die<00:01:03.180> before<00:01:03.360> you

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
too long then you'll just die before you

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.690 
too long then you'll just die before you
use<00:01:03.870> them<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.260> might<00:01:04.800> as<00:01:04.920> well<00:01:05.070> use<00:01:05.250> them<00:01:05.370> early

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
use them so might as well use them early

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.700 
use them so might as well use them early
on<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:06.000> their<00:01:06.090> own<00:01:06.300> door<00:01:06.660> when<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.380> really

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710
