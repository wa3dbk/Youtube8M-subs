behind<00:00:59.789> extremely<00:01:00.449> easily<00:01:00.839> that's<00:01:01.019> why<00:01:01.260> I

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
behind extremely easily that's why I

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.399 
behind extremely easily that's why I
don't<00:01:01.969> suppose<00:01:02.969> exposed<00:01:03.600> my<00:01:03.809> back<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.290> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
don't suppose exposed my back to the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.980 
don't suppose exposed my back to the
enemies<00:01:04.739> after<00:01:05.159> getting<00:01:05.370> the<00:01:05.460> game<00:01:05.960> so<00:01:06.960> I

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
enemies after getting the game so I

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.289 
enemies after getting the game so I
don't<00:01:07.200> know<00:01:07.260> if<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.440> caught<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.710> at<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.460> gun

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
don't know if you caught it at the gun

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.070 
don't know if you caught it at the gun
selection<00:01:09.780> there<00:01:10.020> I'm<00:01:10.380> using<00:01:11.630> ak-47<00:01:12.630> with<00:01:12.870> no

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
selection there I'm using ak-47 with no

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.780 
selection there I'm using ak-47 with no
attachment<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.100> reason<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.370> that<00:01:14.520> is

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
attachment and the reason for that is

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.550 
attachment and the reason for that is
because<00:01:14.820> when<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.480> put<00:01:15.660> an<00:01:15.750> attachment<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.440> an

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
because when you put an attachment on an

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
because when you put an attachment on an
ak-47

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
ak-47

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.330 
ak-47
it<00:01:18.000> adds<00:01:18.150> idle<00:01:18.510> suede<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.050> which<00:01:19.830> makes<00:01:20.190> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
it adds idle suede to it which makes the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.960 
it adds idle suede to it which makes the
gun<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.850> lot<00:01:21.030> less<00:01:21.240> accurate<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.880> when<00:01:23.880> you

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
gun a lot less accurate and when you

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.490 
gun a lot less accurate and when you
have<00:01:24.090> no<00:01:24.210> attachment<00:01:24.660> on<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.290> works

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
have no attachment on it it just works

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.310 
have no attachment on it it just works
like<00:01:25.920> 10<00:01:26.730> times<00:01:26.910> better<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:28.050> may<00:01:28.200> have

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
like 10 times better you may have

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.900 
like 10 times better you may have
noticed<00:01:28.620> when<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.950> first<00:01:29.190> loss<00:01:29.400> unlock<00:01:29.730> the

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
noticed when you first loss unlock the

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.080 
noticed when you first loss unlock the
AKS<00:01:30.300> seems<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.870> an<00:01:30.990> amazing<00:01:31.170> gun<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.710> then

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
AKS seems like an amazing gun and then

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.790 
AKS seems like an amazing gun and then
you<00:01:33.090> keep<00:01:33.270> using<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.720> putting<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.170> attachments

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
you keep using it putting on attachments

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.190 
you keep using it putting on attachments
and<00:01:35.010> then<00:01:35.550> for<00:01:36.300> some<00:01:36.450> reason<00:01:36.780> you're<00:01:37.140> not

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
and then for some reason you're not

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.930 
and then for some reason you're not
doing<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:37.650> well<00:01:37.830> I<00:01:38.070> don't<00:01:38.640> know

doing as well I don't know

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.670 
doing as well I don't know
I<00:01:38.970> noticed<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.600> before<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.200> then<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.350> found

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
I noticed that before and then I found

game I get a lot of air support but the

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.690 
game I get a lot of air support but the
air<00:02:04.200> support<00:02:04.530> doesn't<00:02:04.740> really<00:02:05.070> dominate<00:02:05.550> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
air support doesn't really dominate the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.880 
air support doesn't really dominate the
game<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.420> does<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.870> some<00:02:06.900> free-for-all

off as they try and get in door so it's

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.400 
off as they try and get in door so it's
always<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.709> good<00:02:45.630> good<00:02:46.630> way<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:46.840> play<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.380> game

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
always a good good way to play the game

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.430 
always a good good way to play the game
and<00:02:47.800> here<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:48.819> see<00:02:49.269> this<00:02:49.510> guy<00:02:49.750> camping<00:02:50.260> in<00:02:50.380> the

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
and here I see this guy camping in the

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.280 
and here I see this guy camping in the
corner<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:52.180> stunned<00:02:52.480> myself<00:02:52.870> but<00:02:53.110> luckily

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
corner and I stunned myself but luckily

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.410 
corner and I stunned myself but luckily
I<00:02:53.410> kill<00:02:53.739> him<00:02:53.890> for<00:02:54.160> my<00:02:54.250> predator<00:02:54.519> missile<00:02:54.910> no<00:02:55.390> I

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
I kill him for my predator missile no I

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.930 
I kill him for my predator missile no I
don't<00:02:55.750> know<00:02:55.810> why<00:02:56.110> in<00:02:56.590> my<00:02:57.010> games<00:02:57.340> there<00:02:57.700> seems

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
don't know why in my games there seems

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.390 
don't know why in my games there seems
to<00:02:58.060> always<00:02:58.209> be<00:02:58.330> people<00:02:58.709> using<00:02:59.709> riot<00:02:59.920> shields

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
to always be people using riot shields

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.890 
to always be people using riot shields
personally<00:03:00.880> I<00:03:00.910> don't<00:03:01.090> think<00:03:01.269> riot<00:03:01.660> shield

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
personally I don't think riot shield

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.600 
personally I don't think riot shield
should<00:03:02.080> be<00:03:02.200> in<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.380> game<00:03:02.500> I<00:03:02.769> never<00:03:02.980> use<00:03:03.190> it<00:03:03.220> but

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
should be in the game I never use it but

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.150 
should be in the game I never use it but
I<00:03:03.850> guess<00:03:04.569> it<00:03:04.750> can<00:03:04.900> be<00:03:04.930> fun<00:03:05.290> if<00:03:05.860> you're<00:03:06.010> playing

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
I guess it can be fun if you're playing

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.309 
I guess it can be fun if you're playing
with<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.370> party<00:03:06.730> but<00:03:06.940> that<00:03:07.569> kid<00:03:07.840> in<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.019> corner

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
with a party but that kid in the corner

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.960 
with a party but that kid in the corner
was<00:03:08.440> obviously<00:03:08.799> playing<00:03:09.010> by<00:03:09.250> himself<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:09.819> don't

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
was obviously playing by himself I don't

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.840 
was obviously playing by himself I don't
know<00:03:10.030> why<00:03:10.209> like<00:03:11.310> what<00:03:12.310> would<00:03:12.430> make<00:03:12.610> you<00:03:12.819> want

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
know why like what would make you want

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.880 
know why like what would make you want
it<00:03:13.269> sit<00:03:14.080> in<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.230> corner<00:03:14.470> with<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.680> riot

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
it sit in the corner with the riot

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.360 
it sit in the corner with the riot
shield<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.340> free-for-all

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
shield and a free-for-all

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.690 
shield and a free-for-all
so<00:03:18.390> anyways<00:03:19.390> my<00:03:20.380> secondary<00:03:20.830> is<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.040> USP

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
so anyways my secondary is a USP

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.460 
so anyways my secondary is a USP
silenced<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.720> reason<00:03:22.930> for<00:03:23.049> that<00:03:23.170> is

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
silenced and the reason for that is

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.890 
silenced and the reason for that is
because<00:03:23.500> it's<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.580> only<00:03:24.700> stealth<00:03:25.420> pistol

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
because it's the only stealth pistol

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.259 
because it's the only stealth pistol
which<00:03:26.170> means<00:03:26.440> that<00:03:27.250> it's<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.609> only<00:03:27.760> pistol

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
which means that it's the only pistol

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.810 
which means that it's the only pistol
that<00:03:28.480> doesn't<00:03:28.810> show<00:03:28.900> up<00:03:29.019> on<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.230> map<00:03:29.380> I<00:03:29.820> like

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
that doesn't show up on the map I like

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.940 
that doesn't show up on the map I like
to<00:03:30.910> use<00:03:31.030> that<00:03:31.239> because<00:03:31.720> my<00:03:32.260> primary<00:03:32.680> weapon

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
to use that because my primary weapon

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.400 
to use that because my primary weapon
the<00:03:33.370> ak-47<00:03:33.850> is<00:03:36.209> not<00:03:37.209> silenced<00:03:37.750> so<00:03:38.019> if<00:03:38.170> I<00:03:38.260> ever

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
the ak-47 is not silenced so if I ever

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.890 
the ak-47 is not silenced so if I ever
need<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:38.739> make<00:03:38.859> a<00:03:38.890> stealthy<00:03:39.340> kill<00:03:39.549> I<00:03:39.790> can<00:03:40.630> pull

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
need to make a stealthy kill I can pull

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.690 
need to make a stealthy kill I can pull
out<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.019> pistol<00:03:41.440> quickly<00:03:41.890> and<00:03:42.160> try<00:03:42.459> and<00:03:42.579> take

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
out the pistol quickly and try and take

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.720 
out the pistol quickly and try and take
a<00:03:42.730> guy<00:03:42.970> out<00:03:43.440> now<00:03:44.440> that<00:03:44.799> may<00:03:45.190> sound<00:03:45.430> pretty

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
a guy out now that may sound pretty

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.729 
a guy out now that may sound pretty
smart<00:03:46.120> but<00:03:46.299> actually<00:03:46.750> every<00:03:47.049> time<00:03:47.079> I<00:03:47.500> try<00:03:47.709> and

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
smart but actually every time I try and

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.710 
smart but actually every time I try and
take<00:03:47.950> out<00:03:48.130> my<00:03:48.310> pistol<00:03:48.519> I<00:03:48.910> end<00:03:49.090> up<00:03:49.239> dying<00:03:49.480> it

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
take out my pistol I end up dying it

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.490 
take out my pistol I end up dying it
seems<00:03:50.019> so<00:03:50.380> you<00:03:51.250> might<00:03:51.430> not<00:03:51.609> want<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:52.500> imitate

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
seems so you might not want to imitate

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.849 
seems so you might not want to imitate
me<00:03:53.890> on<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:55.320> so<00:03:56.320> I<00:03:56.350> don't<00:03:56.590> know<00:03:56.650> if<00:03:56.739> I<00:03:56.799> said

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
me on that so I don't know if I said

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.099 
me on that so I don't know if I said
this<00:03:57.070> already<00:03:57.310> but<00:03:57.549> this<00:03:58.269> was<00:03:58.450> my<00:03:58.600> first<00:03:58.780> game

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
this already but this was my first game

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:00.960 
this already but this was my first game
after<00:03:59.530> two<00:03:59.680> weeks<00:03:59.829> of<00:04:00.070> not<00:04:00.280> playing<00:04:00.609> call<00:04:00.940> of

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
after two weeks of not playing call of

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.770 
after two weeks of not playing call of
duty<00:04:01.260> so<00:04:02.260> I<00:04:02.650> think<00:04:02.920> my<00:04:03.310> aim<00:04:03.519> and<00:04:03.910> alertness<00:04:04.540> and

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
duty so I think my aim and alertness and

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.949 
duty so I think my aim and alertness and
everything<00:04:05.140> is<00:04:05.440> pretty<00:04:06.280> much<00:04:06.810> perfect

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
everything is pretty much perfect

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.819 
everything is pretty much perfect
compared<00:04:08.500> to<00:04:08.560> my<00:04:09.069> usual<00:04:09.930> like<00:04:10.930> I<00:04:11.200> don't<00:04:11.680> think

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
compared to my usual like I don't think

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.770 
compared to my usual like I don't think
I<00:04:11.920> got<00:04:12.100> any<00:04:12.340> worse<00:04:12.519> over<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.000> two<00:04:13.450> weeks<00:04:13.660> of

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
I got any worse over the two weeks of

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.860 
I got any worse over the two weeks of
not<00:04:13.989> playing<00:04:14.670> sometimes<00:04:15.670> you<00:04:16.329> know<00:04:16.450> you<00:04:16.720> get

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
not playing sometimes you know you get

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.690 
not playing sometimes you know you get
rusty<00:04:17.500> especially<00:04:18.039> if<00:04:18.160> you're<00:04:19.829> doing<00:04:20.829> playing

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
rusty especially if you're doing playing

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.529 
rusty especially if you're doing playing
other<00:04:21.880> games<00:04:22.240> I<00:04:22.600> don't<00:04:22.780> know<00:04:23.789> anyways<00:04:24.789> the

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
other games I don't know anyways the

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.180 
other games I don't know anyways the
muscle<00:04:26.200> memory<00:04:26.350> is<00:04:26.560> still<00:04:26.740> there<00:04:26.950> and

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
muscle memory is still there and

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.300 
muscle memory is still there and
everything's<00:04:27.850> working<00:04:27.940> out<00:04:28.270> so<00:04:29.169> I'm<00:04:30.160> probably

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
everything's working out so I'm probably

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.850 
everything's working out so I'm probably
gonna<00:04:30.580> get<00:04:30.729> Halo<00:04:31.000> Reach<00:04:31.030> I<00:04:31.840> might<00:04:32.380> even<00:04:32.530> have

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.630 
it
in<00:04:33.780> about<00:04:34.260> half<00:04:34.470> an<00:04:34.590> hour<00:04:34.710> if<00:04:34.890> my<00:04:35.100> mom<00:04:35.250> decides

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
in about half an hour if my mom decides

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.160
