00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
the progression that's a major focus of

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:51.870 
the progression that's a major focus of
this<00:00:50.890> course<00:00:50.950> you'll<00:00:51.370> hear<00:00:51.550> me<00:00:51.670> talk<00:00:51.850> about

this course you'll hear me talk about

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.729 
this course you'll hear me talk about
that<00:00:52.239> with<00:00:52.420> almost<00:00:52.750> every<00:00:53.290> lick<00:00:53.500> in<00:00:53.650> the

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
that with almost every lick in the

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.590 
that with almost every lick in the
entire<00:00:53.950> course<00:00:54.250> this<00:00:55.150> one<00:00:55.360> in<00:00:55.450> particular

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
entire course this one in particular

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.250 
entire course this one in particular
fits<00:00:56.320> right<00:00:56.980> before<00:00:57.430> bar<00:00:57.670> number<00:00:57.970> five<00:00:58.360> now<00:00:59.140> in

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
fits right before bar number five now in

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260

a<00:00:59.320> typical<00:00:59.800> 12-bar<00:01:00.250> blues<00:01:00.370> progression<00:01:00.520> bar

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
a typical 12-bar blues progression bar

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.000 
a typical 12-bar blues progression bar
number<00:01:01.600> five<00:01:01.930> is<00:01:02.290> where<00:01:02.560> we're<00:01:02.710> going<00:01:02.829> to<00:01:02.890> be

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
number five is where we're going to be

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.520 
number five is where we're going to be
transitioning<00:01:03.790> from<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.089> one<00:01:04.300> chord<00:01:04.660> up<00:01:04.900> to

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
transitioning from the one chord up to

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.650 
transitioning from the one chord up to
the<00:01:05.650> four<00:01:05.890> chord<00:01:06.220> and<00:01:06.400> so<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.180> reason<00:01:07.330> I<00:01:07.509> like

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
the four chord and so the reason I like

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.590 
the four chord and so the reason I like
this<00:01:07.810> lick<00:01:08.050> is<00:01:08.259> because<00:01:08.590> it<00:01:08.710> really<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:10.210> takes

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
this lick is because it really it takes

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.749 
this lick is because it really it takes
advantage<00:01:10.780> of<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.560> momentum<00:01:12.190> in<00:01:12.369> the<00:01:12.520> chord

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
advantage of the momentum in the chord

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.550 
advantage of the momentum in the chord
progression<00:01:13.270> that<00:01:13.390> happens<00:01:13.869> when<00:01:14.259> we<00:01:14.380> make

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
progression that happens when we make

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.170 
progression that happens when we make
that<00:01:14.710> change<00:01:14.979> so<00:01:15.340> let's<00:01:15.520> talk<00:01:15.700> about<00:01:15.759> where

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
that change so let's talk about where

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.790 
that change so let's talk about where
we're<00:01:16.360> going<00:01:16.479> to<00:01:16.540> be<00:01:16.630> planned<00:01:16.899> again<00:01:17.560> we're<00:01:17.740> in
