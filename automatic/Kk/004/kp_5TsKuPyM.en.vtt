00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.630
 Hello length 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:12.870
 It is a gull of the world rubber market . 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:14.549
 Today's theme is doing Te at the way on to memorize the lateral rotation serve only only one of the steps 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.000
 I wonder how 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:24.400
 Well this If you want to write a lateral rotation serve in the target towards the beginners 19's 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.890
 It is a must-see, and it feels like the sense of applying the ball touch rotation of a child of 4 rotations 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:32.809
 It becomes a video to feed well 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:35.930
 Well 4 If you want to rotate to write is I think that are a lot of people not following 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.760
 The amount of rotation of the lateral rotation is easy to see this time 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:44.710
 Because it becomes a little stronger 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:48.700
 This how to catch Toka I'm not the kind of bone called new Please try it by all means 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:56.440
 Keep using the ball of horizontal rotation 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:01:00.460
 I will introduce you to serve practice that I can grasp the sense of making love strong again 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:06.340
 In it would be in only one of the steps, but is here 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.930
 It is only this that we turn sideways with the tip of this market directly below on today 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.510
 Hmm 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:18.040
 Was Unbe in Mashi tip is I think the N center of the racket here is 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:22.420
 Please point it and send out a side turn server with this 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:26.000
 Makes it easier to remember serve with intense side speakers 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.750
 People who commonly use side-to-side rotation serve 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.600
 Rather than using the tip of the racket as a tongue 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.820
 I do not strike at an angle of about 45 degrees 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:42.229
 I'd think that the angle of the surface of the usually well everyone uses'm comfortable Saab's horizontal under rotation 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.430
 It was the side of Mike 's racket and it fell 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.020
 End up half 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:52.149
 Using the power that is coming 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:56.829
 It's easy to play as it often brings out serve 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:02:00.120
 Horizontal in order to become also Tevez is a little play Gachotto more substantial, such is the seabed 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:05.640
 There is a sense of applying rotation , so it is difficult to develop to there 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:10.560
 It is a shape, and this ball will be worn when you raise it to the tip fashionable by raising this side . 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:19.710
 Because the falling momentum does not have this repulsion well 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:22.190
 Himself rubbing the ball woman's body woman's body is Well in the here of the woman Yo 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:28.060
 Because it is different from 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:35.830
 You can to strengthen the accounting in this What only is this Whoa come recoil 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:39.550
 If the amount of rotation in order to Chau at the same time Saddle this the hit was Tanaka is hard to remember the strong form 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:45.930
 It is a form that the person who saw here remembers the rotation 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:50.520
 Since the falling position is a form that is not used Node Tteyuu Pan repulsive force 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:55.980
 It is a form that is out of all rotation It is a form of serve of correction 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:59.030
 This angle etc. is a force to fly forward is basically fly unless it is rotated 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.080
 Because it is an angle 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:06.330
 The rotation will be strong 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:11.070
 Momentum is a form of fly only rotation because they are not ball 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:14.160
 It is this serve point Well I wrote this here 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.180
 Point the tip of the racket to you 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:22.340
 The point is fat 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:27.409
 It is this end which points the corner of the racket to the opponent 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.219
 Sense it means grinded fly only in there you yes point and do it feel like to protrude right 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:31.219
 I'm sorry 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:35.790
 Live at 9 o'clock in one pot of balls 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:39.209
 Well here Ratih Tara This Koller 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:44.040
 Lower left if it is normal 4 horizontal rotation of 4 normal 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:47.129
 Since would capture about 7 hours is rotation do not know is knitting extruded This is it 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.000
 In that I mean in remembering the four rotations in the sense to remember the ball touch 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:52.060
 Said Do and Fujio 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.980
 Since a little strong strong rotation 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.980
 I can do it 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:02.190
 Grip is how to grip, but after all 4 checks are used with forefinger and thumb with these two 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.080
 It feels like this is what I feel like swinging with such a shake 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.550
 Ne 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:11.330
 I think that a little more than 9 flights will come out, so c processing is a bit tight 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:15.100
 Desertion Then hold in the two-finger It is a two-finger 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:20.540
 It is easy to put out for the future of Umm 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:26.840
 It is a grip that is a grip that makes lateral rotation stronger . 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:29.780
 If you do it with two fingers , grab it together and receive the other person and make it a center 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.720
 4 rotation open hit over strongly 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:38.030
 If you can not rub at this time 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:41.340
 With a small 4 rotation in order to become flipping There Decha N bee 飼飛 the care of the market 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.150
 It's not this I still remember the rotation 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.009
 The left hand is do not remember beyond the up times 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:51.509
 So of course you definitely want to put it on the court. 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.509
 Please have one until you enter 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:59.689
 In this way, with no power to fly one before 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:05.050
 I hope I can say that I will try to spin it 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:08.409
 Well, in the service, it means that you have a long ball that you can hit strongly 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.310
 This is a form that firmly remembers the element of lateral rotation 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:15.110
 Then it is here 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:17.720
 Please and is now If you can not return the usual horizontal to the 5 rotation Saab 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.200
 When I think that there sounds 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.230
 I use the horizontal rotation of the above serve, but I can do that 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:28.600
 Form Desun 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:31.200
 Well energy is transmitted to the guy to say I mean Yappa Ii' play all make a positive rotation 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.740
 It looks like 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:38.880
 Everybody's side down rotation travel and rotation side rotation serve 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:41.880
 I think that there is a form that can be upgraded all version up 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:47.150
 Please turn the face of this racket to people 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.150
 Come on and try it if you can do it
