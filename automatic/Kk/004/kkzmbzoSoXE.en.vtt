00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.250
 eh 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.250
 10th 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.390
 a 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.019
 Your description of 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.019
 Never start 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.460
 From this time 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.060
 Towards the danger 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.750
 So the Observatory 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.750
 sliced ​​raw fish 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.190
 f number of machines 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:41.210
 But I think that I want to do the thinking how Esukisu 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.850
 As you I previously Callao story 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.190
 6-8 span 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.190
 Well with this area in mind 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.940
 I think that I want to advance my progress 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.940
 This issue is 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.720
 50 meters full 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:11.740
 You are 40m but 2000 square meters 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.510
 Solid clearing ground for clean qualifications 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.720
 Front road 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:23.600
 20 meters wide road 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:26.420
 A narrow road 10 meters south of what year 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.310
 On the east side 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.689
 Housing 5 - story 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.689
 Park teeth fire 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.920
 Park Well I would like to the expected negative one I love now tea thinking this kind of site 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.280
 But 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.150
 This time's problem is a routine rehabilitation 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.440
 Tsusho rehab 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.970
 But 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:02:00.580
 Well the bonus is a five-story building that comes without 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:04.360
 Is it going to be conventional about it and the wax type of the standard floor on it? 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:07.960
 I wonder if this is going to be a unit 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:14.290
 I do not know exactly, but this time with the care unit 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:20.980
 Well would the game but will anyone a teenager but there is instead about Niso one with that picture 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:25.180
 Not so well this time but the research unit promoted by that country 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:29.580
 I think would like a little thought 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:33.560
 In any case how do you read the crisis that day 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.560
 It becomes important that 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.460
 For now 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.150
 That 2000 square meters of 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.750
 It is a device because it is a dangerous 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.840
 Does the volume ratio come out with fans ? 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.670
 200 or come to in 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.510
 Huh 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:57.540
 I do n't know a bit about this, but the building coverage rate is 50 or 60 ? 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.510
 Well this time the test rate 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.180
 Well about 60 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:08.230
 Since the volume rate is the degree 200 4000 to Wow 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.140
 I 'm flattering, so not 4000 soldiers 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.220
 Huh 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.960
 Let's think about an old dog 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:20.520
 Therefore, because it is that Well IMHO 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.440
 I think there is a problem that I can afford 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.180
 Huh 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:32.079
 Well this time twice edition floor 4 floor 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.079
 80 places on 4 floors after 234 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.459
 For example, 80 indicators on the ion floor 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.819
 This is also a care unit 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.330
 Tari one floor by say in 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:49.300
 10 win address 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.300
 The worm is 10 wins and 10 wins 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.680
 Degree address address 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.459
 Non 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.940
 There are 23 work units 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:06.760
 It is assumed from now on that 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.240
 I would like to go back but first 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.550
 Main 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:15.840
 Where do you have the main entrance to brain research 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:19.459
 Well eh because the main is one of the 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.620
 Over facing the big road 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.630
 Again Well 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:31.729
 It went Press usually the main to name road 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:33.060
 I feel like the other face there Rutte is well natural to say 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.030
 next 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.470
 No tsusho rehab 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:44.190
 It is said that such e-mail must have a good mouth for rehabilitation in a place separate from the prefecture. 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:50.330
 I have to think about what to do with routine rehabilitation 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:51.810
 Perhaps commonly known as blue probably a good will or Outpatient rehabilitation of car 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.750
 car's 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:05:00.650
 Hey 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:05:03.260
 It will be a pick-up rush, so going in and out on this main road 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:10.150
 Very well 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:12.270
 I feel like I'm not afraid I still understand the form that seems to be less traffic 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.160
 Ide is 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.820
 enter 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:25.050
 Well then and later employees or 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:30.169
 This rather than to fall from the surface Again user's parking relationship 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:34.169
 Whether it should not be at the entrance at less of a traffic 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:40.400
 I think, but if you do it like this parking 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:40.400
 Well this kind of parking is going out here 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:49.840
 Well, this cajuni award address 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.840
 It is this weapon, but 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:06:02.020
 20 even while it looked 50m and who's this 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:08.650
 When I take 3 meters of maspan, yeah yeah or gap 3m and Little 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:10.639
 Well, simply because it does not enter at 60 50 meters meters 20 how this in a gun 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:15.080
 It's also a point if you arrange 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:17.440
 As I think this is how many years here 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.950
 How many years 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:24.810
 Junko towards the south face 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:27.690
 Well then and then the apartment and then Kitagawa 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.220
 After all if it is so early 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.340
 Towards the park 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:36.340
 After all, in this case 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:39.470
 It becomes n days, but here bitter and dwelling units 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:43.810
 It is to bring things Tteyuu 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.810
 You think whether not a straightforward way of thinking 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.390
 Hmm
