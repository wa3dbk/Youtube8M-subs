00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
I can see anything even like a tenth of

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.969 
I can see anything even like a tenth of
a<00:01:21.240> millimeter<00:01:21.689> with<00:01:22.049> my<00:01:22.229> own<00:01:22.380> eyes<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.680> don't

need him I wouldn't call that invisible
but<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.520> fact<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:27.000> that's<00:01:27.150> probably<00:01:27.540> an<00:01:27.689> adult

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.330

animal<00:01:39.180> or<00:01:39.299> human<00:01:40.130> is<00:01:41.299> gonna<00:01:42.299> have<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> darker

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
animal or human is gonna have a darker

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.300 
animal or human is gonna have a darker
appearance<00:01:42.990> but<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.770> other<00:01:43.890> ones<00:01:44.070> are<00:01:44.189> gonna

be<00:01:44.490> see-through<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.240> transparent<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.640> you're

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
be see-through and transparent so you're

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.490 
be see-through and transparent so you're

life

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.920 
life
one<00:01:50.040> hundredth<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.640> millimeter<00:01:50.670> or<00:01:51.330> smaller

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.080 

say<00:01:54.930> yeah<00:01:55.110> they<00:01:55.350> got<00:01:55.530> real<00:01:55.770> you're<00:01:56.549> not<00:01:56.759> going

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
say yeah they got real you're not going

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:05.050 
say yeah they got real you're not going
crazy<00:01:58.610> you<00:01:59.610> know<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.759> I<00:02:00.060> know<00:02:01.369> some<00:02:02.369> people<00:02:02.549> have

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.510 

delusions<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.479> stuff<00:02:06.750> like<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.489> but<00:02:08.489> I

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
delusions and stuff like that but I

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.449 
delusions and stuff like that but I
think<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:09.179> it's<00:02:09.420> probably<00:02:09.709> less<00:02:10.709> than<00:02:10.739> 1%<00:02:11.400> of

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
think that it's probably less than 1% of

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.320 
think that it's probably less than 1% of
the<00:02:11.520> cases<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.930> I'm<00:02:13.050> just<00:02:13.260> guessing<00:02:13.470> but<00:02:14.330> yeah

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
the cases and I'm just guessing but yeah

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.110 
the cases and I'm just guessing but yeah
I<00:02:15.360> think<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:17.459> read<00:02:17.670> only<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.970> medical

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
I think to to read only the medical

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.530 
I think to to read only the medical
profession<00:02:18.750> diagnoses<00:02:19.440> us<00:02:19.590> as<00:02:21.290> nuts<00:02:22.290> so

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
profession diagnoses us as nuts so

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.330 
profession diagnoses us as nuts so
you're<00:02:24.540> probably<00:02:24.780> not<00:02:25.050> going<00:02:25.440> nuts<00:02:25.739> if<00:02:26.100> you're

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
you're probably not going nuts if you're

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.080 
you're probably not going nuts if you're
actually<00:02:27.090> looking<00:02:27.239> this<00:02:27.480> up<00:02:27.540> on<00:02:27.840> YouTube<00:02:27.989> so

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
actually looking this up on YouTube so

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.000 
actually looking this up on YouTube so
anyway<00:02:30.290> until<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.470> next<00:02:31.590> video<00:02:32.000> bye
