00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.610
 and later 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.540
 plus 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.610
 plus 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.420
 A) Yes 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.910
 good guys the wait ended here the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.770
 season has arrived because in 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.060
 this channel we will not make an irak for the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.630
 start of the season we are 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.850
 saving for chapter 100 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.650
 and I decided to give you a little review of what 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.090
 what happens in the chapter and my opinion to the 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.160
 respect 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.630
 will be short like those of 'doctor who' and 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.630
 no spoilers do not worry 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.480
 well the two chapters start to 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.609
 animate parts 1 and 2 although originally 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.940
 you want it to be called last that 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.589
 they are left after the press of 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.440
 all parties and their friends are 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:08.580
 they find a map in the castle in their 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.580
 new castle of the dance 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.400
 you decide to travel to a point that is 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.710
 indicating said map which is a 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.810
 small town with you win and discover something 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.920
 weird everyone has that last time with the 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.770
 Equal sign and everyone is happy 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.860
 the leader was seen a unicorn and 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.710
 stable flame there is climate affirms that they use 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.649
 an old object managed to remove the 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.350
 last of all because he says 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:38.770
 she the philosophy of the people says that 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.180
 lasquetty marks mark differences and 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.680
 differences are bad the differences 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.350
 lead to discussions and therefore 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.229
 conflict therefore to anyone having a 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.470
 special talent to not have anyone from 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.260
 special entity that generates equality 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.330
 pure and therefore harmony 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.800
 while everything looks good you put them 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.860
 in the an find out what it is that is 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.970
 happening because they feel that something is not 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.970
 right in that strange place 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.660
 well you can go without giving spoilers the 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.310
 chapter is great is a very good start 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.160
 a little different from what we already had 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.750
 seen in previous seasons 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.690
 but let's go with history history 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.830
 touches topics that range from 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.870
 individuality to even the 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.290
 communism xaltocan communism the 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.290
 history 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:31.440
 in fact a lot of what is handled in the 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:34.080
 better story I will not tell you anything else 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.010
 but there are some that there are some very good 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.409
 tweets 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.380
 in particular as to who will 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.540
 save the day 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.820
 and some moments are very dark for the 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.230
 caricature so my story I give a 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.230
 10 was a very good start 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.780
 then in music we only had one song 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.840
 this time it was and north still sung by 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.420
 this tear and his people that is is 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.850
 it's good to present the world 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.770
 it's not a masterpiece it's not 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.010
 spectacular but will be fine in what 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.599
 fair 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.599
 a song is worth it 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.750
 now in when animation improved a lot 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.110
 you can notice even shading in 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.150
 under the mane somewhere 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.920
 he is very well armed 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.310
 a great improvement comparison of the 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.310
 First season 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.340
 we see that we have more humor animation 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.709
 the mood was very good my country is very 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.870
 well in this chapter likewise after 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.239
 have your moment to shine a moment 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.069
 with my sea ​​that sincerely made me 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.250
 part of the hospitality laughter will see in the 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.200
 chapter 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.910
 and good as you have realized that 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.590
 going fast because I think what he did 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.350
 stronger that chapter was in fact its 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.060
 villana I'm line in the subway say 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.460
 I think it's the most different villain that 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.200
 we have seen in the series is now 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:01.580
 I mean for start villains 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.640
 end of season if we have not had 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:09.100
 we are the monumentals of marble 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.590
 dischord crystal and shadow direct 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.860
 but stable is a common unicorn and 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.060
 current that's not surprising and from 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.520
 done they do not know what a pressure to 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.410
 many are hundredths and that's because that's how it is 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.470
 as you are above is a counterpart of 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.940
 twilight which makes it more interesting 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.700
 I think it's more counterpart of all 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.940
 law that are sets 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.030
 what first is a smart character 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.830
 who knows magic and that like 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.610
 everyone who has a group of ponies 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.230
 following her following faithfully the 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.360
 difference are your means while the 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.790
 aek achieves this through harmony and 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.470
 of the minimum differences it achieves 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.320
 through deception and the 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.300
 it can be a million if union 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.639
 not no of facts in that of uniformity 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.490
 and he's not a villain that at least until 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.710
 now it would be revealed that he was doing it for 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.190
 a larger plan really believed in what 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.190
 I was doing 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.479
 to part that is the first villain to be 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:12.629
 dares to do things that no other 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:14.849
 had done is curious because in certain 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:17.430
 shape looks like someone who thinks 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:20.180
 doing the right thing 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:24.390
 so much so that at one point in the chapter 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.910
 it seems that his anger comes from 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.009
 it does not come so much because its master plan 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.289
 ruined 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:33.599
 because we still do not know if yes or no already 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.759
 They will know soon because when they see it, 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.520
 by intromission of the six cops and 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:40.559
 that the dangerous enemy position be 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.169
 perhaps he ends up hating what is 

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:45.740
 probable power is a great threat 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.740
 future 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.650
 could become a much more villain 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.960
 fearsome 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.699
 and I was told that I am the person of the 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.610
 things that made this chapter be 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:59.430
 come back legendary 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.840
 that and other details also get 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.479
 there is a big surprise at the end about 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.270
 who make the day the best was very 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.500
 well the story was excellent is the 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.110
 darker story that we've had 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.479
 so far in the series well who knows 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:16.080
 so you can tell which last was a 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:18.090
 good chapter was a good chapter was 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.790
 interesting and it's really worth it 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.190
 check it 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:25.850
 if the season continue like this I think 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.740
 that we are going to have a great trip so 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.460
 if not the moment to wait four 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.460
 fans out 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:57.989
 ok kids that hid the government from 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:59.699
 us and I was amazed looking 

00:06:57.989 --> 00:07:02.779
 information and it turns out that in that time 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:05.600
 in which he had seen the first chapter and 

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:08.750
 right now 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.830
 Well, the brownies that was a concession 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.830
 the fans called
