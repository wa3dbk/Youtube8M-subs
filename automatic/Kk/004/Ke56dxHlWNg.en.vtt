00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.500
 not only interesting from the 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.960
 mathematics maybe completely 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.450
 extremely important because there are many mistakes 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.889
 do while writing down numbers because 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.529
 Strangely, only in German 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.529
 language is a small turntable there 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.480
 namely at the one and the tens 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.160
 ziffer I have now the English 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.109
 you can speak all languages 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.359
 going through it the same way we did 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.980
 have the number 58 and it would be in 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.420
 English beautiful from left to right 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.450
 read fifty eight 50 and 8 results 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.290
 logically 58 only the Germans 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.890
 rotate 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:46.200
 the last two around and say it is 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:49.860
 Of course 58 58 are together again 58 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.960
 but often in spelling this one 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.699
 Turners then I will say a number 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.160
 then of course as written as 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.660
 I speak is synonymous only meaningful 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.879
 last two are in german 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.739
 reversed we take 1237 in German 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.430
 in English as well as in all others 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.400
 languages 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:18.320
 I abbreviated it a bit now 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:30.900
 1200 the sevenone 1207 all together 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:33.329
 1237 only 1237 1237 results 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.280
 of course, the correct number only 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.220
 Again we do not read nice from the left 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.380
 to the right the 1000 the 230 and the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.030
 seven but we say 1237 so 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.020
 maybe a little tip that 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.030
 if you find fault there if 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.880
 one at one discussed 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.890
 version of a number in the end something 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.890
 It probably lies about it reversed
