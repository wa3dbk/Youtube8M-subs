00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:09.559
 work 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.740
 so besides this product 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.740
 employment 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.240
 prim 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.210
 New Newspaper 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.860

 Volga then was not yet 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.430
 the first stage is parallel 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.369
 t 

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:49.369
 and here it is 

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:53.349
 how to be 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:56.349
 m 

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:02.749
 t 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.460
 earlier 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.589
 some kind of economy 

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:14.589
 only there 

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:20.129
 4 further orchids 

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:23.879
 this approach to what so policy 

00:07:25.809 --> 00:07:28.809

00:07:28.809 --> 00:07:30.749
 tons of waste sent 

00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:34.069
 on this we end t 

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:37.069
 So 

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:45.069
 which and 

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:50.729
 htc 

00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:53.729
