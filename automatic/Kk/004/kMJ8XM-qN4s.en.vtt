00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 wait wait there's something wrong 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:14.250
 or rather animal trees or more of us with 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:16.859
 the little pigs to the minecraft brothers 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.260
 I am a piece and today I am here for 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.670
 present you a new fashion today 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.560
 is the waste land 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.240
 mod let's start immediately let's see 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.740
 how to use this fashion 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.810
 meanwhile we must create a new world 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.029
 let's go to single player cretini world 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.969
 games we can put some want 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.440
 a wall ward option in world child 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.420
 we have to change to issue waste land 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.450
 wasteland then what we do generate 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.040
 the world and we will spur indicate one 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.620
 new dimension 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.469
 this dimension is also taken from the game 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.770
 of fall outs that is, that is, radiations 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.260
 the world after radiation like how 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.340
 it ends as how the world changes afterwards 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
 radiation 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.449
 I think this way is very simple 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.129
 but very beautiful because it will be 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.610
 really hard to survive 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.830
 trees are very but very rare and 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.229
 just the same is very rare 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.640
 food that is the challenge is just to succeed 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.159
 survive in hard core 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.310
 yes, because the animals spa on 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.189
 very rarely we have no seeds or 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.560
 we will find them very, very rarely 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.450
 wood there is not a lot of minerals 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.570
 we have to dig a lot because 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.509
 obvious values ​​have also been heard or seen 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.430
 there is a lot we say the value of 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.119
 minerals to find very low respect 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.920
 to the rest 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.500
 and then what we will find in this 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.970
 dimension we find these little ones 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.740
 paths of small houses 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.720
 abandoned for example like those 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.820
 see we can find lampposts 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.250
 own street lamps that show us one 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.350
 way to something I won't do it to you 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.090
 see but precisely for the reason why 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.670
 I want you to really play it 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.270
 wonderful and I know they will be introduced 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.950
 also reported fallout bosses 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.630
 there is nothing to say except here 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.850
 now I have found from top to case and that 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.439
 lucky dad here is here inside 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.649
 what they do in this house meanwhile 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.370
 they could shoot fashions and then the thing 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.799
 difficult if we put maybe 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.049
 but in difficult we give ourselves a piece of furniture 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.780
 they shoot 56 so it's hard to do 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.220
 or now I didn't want to do it to you 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.799
 see but I found a part of the 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.430
 what village is this is a small one 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.840
 village you see destroyed there are gods 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.700
 secrets within the world ie 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.739
 this one is just a small village 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.079
 here for example there is another there is one 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.000
 village house you see we find 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.670
 different objects inside the seeds that 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.370
 luckily we found some water seeds 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.079
 as you can see there isn't so it's a bit 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.359
 difficult to survive you will understand me 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.579
 because we ca n't grow crops 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.810
 we do not find animals we find again 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.340
 very few 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.079
 you say but how do I maybe we can 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.239
 find how you saw a toilet now 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.909
 basketball so we have luck though 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.349
 we say that survival is proper 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.129
 extreme is even more difficult 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.859
 of hardcore because there is little food 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.900
 there is little trees to do things there 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:12.109
 it's not much to survive 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.109
 easy and mobs don't expose practically 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:20.690
 nothing except look silly i hope to 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:23.239
 not having you ok let's have a night 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.980
 except at night you see now I don't know if 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.540
 Spider shoulder straps should be here indeed 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.910
 they are coming slowly 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.400
 see there are so many enemy monsters and 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.870
 no monster friend you see 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.599
 here and it is quite difficult 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.519
 survive I repeat it in my opinion for 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.950
 maybe a series of survival one 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.379
 survival a hard core survival 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.480
 it would be a good challenge also because it was 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.639
 very particular way it introduces 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.040
 really many secrets that is different 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:52.400
 city ​​also see what this is 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:56.180
 to the normal blues that I hope there 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.769
 introduces several different things boss who 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.859
 there will be and will be introduced in 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.989
 upcoming versions are already doing it 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:04.430
 several dungeons that will be introduced e 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.560
 two or three I know they've already been 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.930
 introduced in the fashion then really 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.669
 particular and will need anyway 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.579
 wait for an update to receive 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:16.160
 let's say the maximum functions from this 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.380
 mode that is very much inspired by the world 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.139
 of fallout maybe mega giant cities with 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.060
 wonderful bosses it was a nice idea I hope 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.320
 that will carry it forward well then 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.760
 guys that 's all there is 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.650
 introduces the fashion was very 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.050
 simple but very pretty especially 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.580
 useful for survival I recommend you 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.669
 download it if someone wants to do one 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.909
 very but very difficult minecraft series 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:41.240
 so much showmanship there 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:43.070
 remember to put it like the 150 mi 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.690
