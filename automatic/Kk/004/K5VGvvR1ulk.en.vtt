00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:19.279
 but then a lot of formats the 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:22.550
 about and well listen to the problem 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:26.150
 that arises is that lawyers are 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.279
 registered at bars and the bâtonnier 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.500
 has disciplinary power from the 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.509
 opportunity to initiate proceedings 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.420
 disciplinary proceedings against a lawyer for 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.190
 possibly be able to pronounce 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.590
 possibly pronounce a radiation 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.760
 that is, chasing a lawyer from 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.370
 the profession so the problem is the 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.680
 difficulty lies in the fact that it is 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.770
 to these are procedures and a system 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.470
 which was set up under the 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.810
 of gingham by lawyers 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.820
 especially to say to them a 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.560
 since it is laval stone which 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.400
 not intended Bar in Paris 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.059
 1,907 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.680
 and then joseph barthélémy lawyer at 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.570
 bar of paris also so they have 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.689
 put in place these procedures which 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.930
 allow somehow to the bâtonnier 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:16.520
 to hunt from the profession a lawyer 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.720
 who would they be committing 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.630
 disciplinary offenses 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.729
 so the difficulty that arises well 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.130
 in the fact that a number of 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.170
 barman commit abuses of 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.990
 procedure carries false accusations 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.500
 against lawyers to try to 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.870
 chasing the professor so in 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.090
 missing as far as I'm concerned I already have 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.090
 is the subject of those of this kind of 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.440
 lured in 2008 I had a 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.930
 cement mixer named nathalie 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.180
 barber of the bar of the holy seine 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.700
 denis who engaged against me a 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.610
 disciplinary procedure so on this 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.729
 false accusation 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.600
 I was struck off by a nickname a board 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.310
 of discipline 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.409
 and then I appealed to the court 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.479
 Paris call that has purely and 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.320
 simply cancel the whole procedure 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.370
 because the accusations 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.979
 which had been brought against me 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.220
 and is completely false and still 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.320
 because the radiation that had been 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.830
 pronounced against me had not 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.570
 been taken by the legal jurisdiction 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.580
 that is, by the council of 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.260
 regional discipline but by some sort 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.720
 special section composed of lawyers 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.580
 dishonest sitting without right or title 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.410
 so that's the story the sphere he's 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.970
 is therefore in 2009 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.100
 I took the exam normally 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.440
 the practice of the profession of lawyer and 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.310
 very recently in september 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.440
 latest 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.410
 the president of the Seine-saint-denis 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.280
 sir robert makes the air has committed to 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.980
 my counter 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.830
 a new disciplinary procedure on 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.140
 particularly false accusations 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.870
 and whimsical gives you an example 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.570
 very simple I am accused of having 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.000
 insulted magistrates the problem is 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.400
 that they are not able to say the name 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.260
 magistrates judge would have insulted them 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.959
 are not able to say in front of which 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.140
 Jurisdiction it's her breasts swore and been 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.769
 uttered and before which audience which 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.650
 day so these are accusations 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:22.209
 purely imaginary that were invented 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.910
 by the batonnier robert makes the air and 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.490
 so 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.690
 I'm sent back for more 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.690
 an audience that will happen 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.780
 May 7 before the Council of 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:39.120
 discipline that will be held at home 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:44.190
 of the Paris Bar this bone 2 and 4 rue du 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:47.640
 harley hrl at y 75001 paris 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.020
 and then what happens is that from the 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.540
 same way as in 2008 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.000
 I am invited to appear not 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.920
 before the Regional Disciplinary Board 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.080
 of the Paris Court of Appeal that comes the 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.090
 disciplinary jurisdiction provided for in 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.400
 law but by some kind of section 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.710
 special composed by lawyers 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.700
 absolutely sitting without right or title 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:11.760
 and so the big problem that arises 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.430
 is that the whole class jurisdiction 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.239
 disciplinary action provided for by law does not 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.070
 been installed you have lawyers who 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.010
 seat without right or title and in particular 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.020
 lawyers at the bar of Essonne 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.670
 lawyers of the Val de Marne Bar and 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.910
 lawyers of the bar of the holy seine 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:32.190
 denis it's still 28 lawyer 148 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.970
 lawyer sits without right or title 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.560
 and then when the lawyers who are going 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.950
 sit on the disciplinary board 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.450
 regional authorities have been designated 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.820
 principle legally but there it is not 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.060
 the case they must then meet 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.200
 to proceed to the election of the president 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.240
 the disciplinary council 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.190
 I have all the documents I have all the 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.490
 papers the minutes of elections 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.630
 attendance and registration sheets 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.500
 fraudulent election say that in 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:04.470
 principle for how to say perform 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.980
 validly the election needs more 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.290
 half of the lawyers registered either 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.270
 present the lawyers registered these 48 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.240
 lawyers 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.140
 more than half it's twenty-five 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.600
 the election is done with thirteen 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:22.830
 people what then in these 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:25.050
 circumstances this is the circumstance he 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.510
 had an obligation to bring a lawsuit 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.850
 verbal deficiency and instead 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.919
 you have two lawyers who have drawn up a 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:35.160
 wrong report of election 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:37.380
 Francois Detton and then Damien Mannarino 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.780
 so we are in a dance is 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.280
 in a situation of this nature so 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.220
 I will appear before a kind of 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.160
 two exceptional jurisdictions klina which 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.870
 is not provided for by law and so I 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.330
 challenged all his lawyers well 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.410
 obviously so in principle they did not 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.030
 not the right to sit 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:59.039
 but with these people there is to be expected 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:00.960
 to everything we created if we fall president 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:07.590
 I am chairman of the support committee 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:10.950
 of m françois so we call all 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:14.970
 citizens who does not break this message to 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:20.070
 come to the regional council of 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:21.450
 discipline on Wednesday, May 7th from 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.000
 midday 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:27.840
 so I remember the address was hard 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.690
 two cases of 4 rue du Palais it's 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.039
 behind the courthouse and the 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.039
 bar house
