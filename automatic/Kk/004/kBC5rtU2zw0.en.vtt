00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
then it will go to up for five fifteen

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.800 
then it will go to up for five fifteen
seconds<00:02:29.069> at<00:02:29.159> most<00:02:29.370> just<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.329> cool<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.659> system

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
seconds at most just to cool the system

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.940 
seconds at most just to cool the system
a<00:02:31.049> little<00:02:31.140> bit<00:02:31.439> down<00:02:31.650> again<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:33.620> this<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.769> it

so<00:03:33.989> what's<00:03:34.409> about<00:03:34.620> battery<00:03:35.159> life<00:03:35.310> on<00:03:35.909> a<00:03:35.970> full

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
so what's about battery life on a full

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.500 
so what's about battery life on a full
charge<00:03:36.900> doing<00:03:37.859> only<00:03:38.129> texting<00:03:38.909> a<00:03:39.000> lot<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.239> light

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
charge doing only texting a lot of light

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.349 
charge doing only texting a lot of light

usage<00:03:42.840> or<00:03:43.019> so<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.739> will<00:03:43.979> get<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.579> a<00:03:44.609> two<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.060> a

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
usage or so you will get you a two and a

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.539 
usage or so you will get you a two and a
half<00:03:45.269> up<00:03:45.629> to<00:03:46.049> three<00:03:46.379> hours<00:03:46.829> out<00:03:47.040> of<00:03:47.340> this

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
half up to three hours out of this

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.500 
half up to three hours out of this
device<00:03:47.879> without<00:03:48.650> problems<00:03:49.819> of<00:03:50.819> course<00:03:51.239> it's

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
device without problems of course it's

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.780 
device without problems of course it's
no<00:03:51.840> problem<00:03:52.199> at<00:03:52.500> all<00:03:52.709> to<00:03:52.769> get<00:03:53.159> under<00:03:53.519> two<00:03:53.760> hours

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
no problem at all to get under two hours

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.869 
no problem at all to get under two hours
out<00:03:54.359> of<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.139> six<00:03:55.409> cell<00:03:55.680> four<00:03:56.220> thousand<00:03:56.699> four

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
out of the six cell four thousand four

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.369 
out of the six cell four thousand four
million<00:03:57.239> per<00:03:57.569> hours<00:03:57.599> battery<00:03:58.729> but<00:04:00.379> definitely

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
million per hours battery but definitely

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.180 
million per hours battery but definitely
it's<00:04:01.979> still<00:04:02.250> ok<00:04:02.579> I<00:04:02.819> still<00:04:03.540> think<00:04:04.260> this<00:04:04.859> device

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
it's still ok I still think this device

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.580 
it's still ok I still think this device
waits<00:04:05.609> around<00:04:06.120> two<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.049> a<00:04:07.109> half<00:04:07.260> three

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
waits around two and a half three

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.089 
waits around two and a half three
kilograms<00:04:08.329> it's<00:04:09.329> not<00:04:10.199> a<00:04:10.229> device<00:04:10.680> you<00:04:10.889> will

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
kilograms it's not a device you will

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.819 
kilograms it's not a device you will
carry<00:04:11.459> around<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:12.299> lot<00:04:12.590> definitely<00:04:13.590> not

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
carry around a lot definitely not

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.420 
carry around a lot definitely not
therefore<00:04:14.639> the<00:04:14.760> battery<00:04:15.269> is<00:04:15.540> too<00:04:15.840> weak<00:04:16.079> as<00:04:16.289> it

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
therefore the battery is too weak as it

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.640 
therefore the battery is too weak as it
devices<00:04:17.430> too<00:04:17.760> heavy<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.419> maybe<00:04:19.199> the<00:04:19.409> device

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
devices too heavy and maybe the device

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.279 
devices too heavy and maybe the device
is<00:04:19.829> even<00:04:20.070> too<00:04:20.220> big<00:04:20.659> if<00:04:21.659> you<00:04:21.810> want<00:04:22.019> to<00:04:22.109> want

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
is even too big if you want to want

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.050 
is even too big if you want to want
something<00:04:22.650> with<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:22.800> bigger<00:04:23.400> bit<00:04:23.669> a<00:04:23.700> better

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
something with a bigger bit a better

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.790 
something with a bigger bit a better
bigger<00:04:24.779> longer<00:04:25.320> battery<00:04:25.560> life

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
bigger longer battery life

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.580 
bigger longer battery life
get<00:04:27.400> up<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:28.120> don't<00:04:28.389> know<00:04:28.569> something<00:04:29.080> with<00:04:29.229> more

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
get up I don't know something with more

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.290 
get up I don't know something with more
battery<00:04:29.949> power<00:04:30.069> of<00:04:30.490> course<00:04:30.819> everyone's

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
battery power of course everyone's

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.330 
battery power of course everyone's
something<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.810> carry<00:04:32.020> around<00:04:32.190> definitely<00:04:33.190> get

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
something to carry around definitely get

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.610 
something to carry around definitely get
something<00:04:33.910> lighters<00:04:34.690> maybe<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.110> new<00:04:35.259> MacBook

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620
