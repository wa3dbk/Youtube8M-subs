to show you what we were using out there

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.220 
to show you what we were using out there
using<00:00:08.670> chicken<00:00:09.030> rigs<00:00:09.389> it's<00:00:09.630> one<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.050> first

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
using chicken rigs it's one of the first

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.080 
using chicken rigs it's one of the first
times<00:00:10.530> I've<00:00:10.710> ever<00:00:10.740> used<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.340> chicken<00:00:11.670> rig<00:00:11.849> for

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
times I've ever used a chicken rig for

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.749 
times I've ever used a chicken rig for
snapper<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.870> all<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.500> chicken<00:00:14.009> rig<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.429> is

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
snapper and all a chicken rig is is

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.300 
snapper and all a chicken rig is is
basically<00:00:15.150> multiple<00:00:15.990> hooks<00:00:16.230> tied<00:00:16.590> on<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.130> a

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
basically multiple hooks tied on to a

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.970 
basically multiple hooks tied on to a
leader<00:00:17.609> we<00:00:18.270> have<00:00:18.449> 50<00:00:18.960> pound<00:00:19.199> test<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.830> is

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
leader we have 50 pound test this is

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.769 
leader we have 50 pound test this is
seaguar<00:00:20.430> flourocarbon<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.660> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
seaguar flourocarbon and this is the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.109 
seaguar flourocarbon and this is the
premier<00:00:21.990> leader<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:23.400> helps<00:00:23.699> win<00:00:23.939> if

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
premier leader and it helps win if

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.580 
premier leader and it helps win if
you're<00:00:24.240> bouncing<00:00:24.660> around<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.990> rocks<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.500> the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
you're bouncing around the rocks and the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.800 
you're bouncing around the rocks and the
reef<00:00:25.769> down<00:00:26.010> there<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:26.400> very<00:00:26.490> very<00:00:26.970> abrasion

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
reef down there it's very very abrasion

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.740 
reef down there it's very very abrasion
resistant<00:00:28.349> easy<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.130> tie<00:00:29.340> knots<00:00:29.640> with<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.240> all

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
resistant easy to tie knots with and all

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.420 
resistant easy to tie knots with and all
we're<00:00:30.900> doing<00:00:31.170> basically<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.650> tying<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.160> loop

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
we're doing basically is tying a loop

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.520 
we're doing basically is tying a loop
into<00:00:33.149> your<00:00:33.300> leader<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.630> then<00:00:33.899> tie<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.290> three

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
into your leader and then tie in three

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.319 
into your leader and then tie in three
different<00:00:34.739> hooks<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.760> hooks<00:00:35.969> we're<00:00:36.149> using

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
different hooks on the hooks we're using

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.569 
different hooks on the hooks we're using
today<00:00:36.630> they're<00:00:36.960> they're<00:00:37.350> five<00:00:37.710> watt<00:00:37.980> see

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
extra strands of spectra fiber in this

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.349 
extra strands of spectra fiber in this
and<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.890> absolutely<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.609> makes<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.120> super

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
and it absolutely just makes it super

doesn't create a lot of drag when you

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.560 
doesn't create a lot of drag when you
have<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> lot<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.890> current<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.580> did<00:01:08.790> using

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
did I clipped off the chicken rig and I

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.390 
did I clipped off the chicken rig and I
used<00:01:27.509> one<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.780> these<00:01:27.990> five<00:01:28.259> oxy<00:01:28.680> circles<00:01:29.159> in

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400
