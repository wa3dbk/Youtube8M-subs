00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
hackers around and they're opening up

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.060

that<00:01:47.399> they're<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.759> problem<00:01:48.030> or<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.390> reason

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
that they're the problem or the reason

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.120 
that they're the problem or the reason
