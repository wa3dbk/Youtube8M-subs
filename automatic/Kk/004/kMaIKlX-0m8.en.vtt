00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:10.160
 welcome to my channel as 2013 is a 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:17.840
 more time with you friends today I have 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:20.960
 a nokia model 500 that we're going to see how 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.290
 is the inmate of this nokia and the 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.830
 This problem is not to touch the 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.830
 tactile 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:35.020
 has achieved no longer serves no longer works 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.770
 let's check it 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:43.350
 this cell phone and now all cell phones 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:46.469
 they come with touch system 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.739
 few times they come towards now in the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:55.230
 currently but mostly they come in the 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.269
 tactile here we are seeing this 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.560
 we are learning and we see that if 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.360
 turns on 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:06.600
 but the problem is that we can not 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.820
 activate it tactism works 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.050
 then there for example 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.050
 we want to unblock we can not 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.950
 unlock because the touch is not 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.520
 working then what are we going to do 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.520
 we are going to pay 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.960
 and later 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.890
 we will bring it closer to the battery 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.890
 and we are going to 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:42.790
 to see how the touch is changed 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:46.590
 of a Nokia 500 model cell phone and for 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.590
 we are going to take a 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.290
 screwdriver 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.290
 hexagonal 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:00.790
 This screwdriver is special 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.040
 and then we are going to disarm it 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.750
 and let's see how the touch is changed 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.759
 of a 500 Nokia and at the same time we will see 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.430
 the intern 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.609
 tonight 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.090
 we are taking out the permits or the 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:19.660
 bolts that carry 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.660
 here 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.720
 and then we are going to 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.500
 open it now 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.720
 and we have already taken it but as it comes 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.650
 this pressure 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.650
 we are not going to open 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.329
 carefully 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.959
 not to spoil the flex of the screen 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:50.439
 touch level although you are already 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.370
 matured but we are now here we have 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:55.010
 the 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.980
 the nokia 500 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.550
 here we have 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.550
 this 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.800
 the parts are internally of 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.800
 these 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.040
 heatsinks 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.190
 but before that we realize 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.790
 also that here it takes 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.790
 this 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.410
 the vibrator and we also have here in the 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.190
 camera 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:32.440
 and then we see this side next 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:38.230
 right we found that there is a flexo 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:40.780
 we remove the staple and lift the 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.730
 card but on the card in the part 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:48.230
 behind 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:53.530
 is connected on the screen 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.530
 and we took it out pretty the screen 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.790
 we raise the insurance and this screen 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.379
 it comes out but right now we do not need 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:04.050
 lift the screen of the screen is 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:07.710
 well what we want is the tactile 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:11.310
 then this is the card from the 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.720
 screen we put it here have 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.829
 side stand 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:19.799
 to then take out the touch to be able 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:23.250
 change to another touch then elevate it 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.970
 this we raise a little because it comes 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.250
 glued 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.700
 and then we also raise here in the 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.700
 part 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.730
 or forward the front 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:44.420
 with a key or something development 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:48.580
 fine flat we raise 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.580
 it is tactile can get nice 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.289
 and we are taking out the poster 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.620
 and you are ready and this is the touch 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.080
 no 500 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.960
 we buy this and we return it to 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:11.139
 place in the same way we place it like this 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.139
 as we have removed it, we put it back 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.590
 right now I do not have the tactician if I do not 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.830
 we change but right now I am demonstrating 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.260
 how is it removed and how is the 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:27.120
 next touch 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.120
 and there we hit it again 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:35.160
 and then we grabbed the card with a 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:38.010
 screen and we put it back 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.790
 carefully so that the flex of the 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.740
 screen does not do more about 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.460
 because if we do not have to change 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:50.069
 screens too 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.069
 then we carefully put the screen 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:59.510
 ready and it's on the screen then what 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.620
 we place 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.620
 the card 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.740
 and we place carefully and then on 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:16.380
 grams 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:19.120
 the fertile flex that brings you here 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.200
 once placed 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.040
 and it is already 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.040
 we put it 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:29.680
 the back cover 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:33.680
 we put the front part first 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:36.370
 we press it to the sides so that 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.370
 that big 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:44.490
 and now we have placed the chip and the 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.230
 memory but since we do not have the chip nor 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.210
 the memory we are going to prove it like that nothing 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.910
 more let's place 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:53.069
 the battery and let's check if 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.070
 It works because sometimes disarmed and no 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:58.220
 works more 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:07:01.190
 then we have turned it on to see how 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.540
 is not we go in the altar type when what 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.810
 we have changed only I am 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:08.290
 demonstrating how it changes there we see that 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.290
 is already 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.970
 working but let's see 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:21.249
 list and I learned then carefully 

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:23.979
 saying we value ourselves but if what 

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:26.619
 we do abruptly we can spoil and 

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:28.180
 and you will not will not help anything very 

00:07:26.619 --> 00:07:30.370
 good friends that's all for today in 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:34.270
 how about the nokia 

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:36.639
 500 how it is changed and how is the interior 

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:41.010
 from a cell phone 

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:41.010
 thank you very much will be up soon
