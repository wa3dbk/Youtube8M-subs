 Welcome 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.490
 to fully understand the 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.070
 History of Bolivia is indispensable 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.100

 they are developing in the plains go 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.229

 the indigenous world that is born in america 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.490

 a particular development in the area of 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.290
 the andes on the buttress of that 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.440
 mountain range and on the plains that are 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.230
 next from a set of 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.840
 experiences the discovery of

 will mark an extraordinary route with 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.310
 notable examples probably the most 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.130
 important linked to what is today the

 Bolivian territory in Tiahuanaco 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:38.000
 indigenous world at that time is going to 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.980
 establish a worldview a way to 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.740
 understand the world of understanding space 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.530
 and the time that is indispensable to follow 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.850
 to be able to find the development of what 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.480
 what would Bolivian society be
