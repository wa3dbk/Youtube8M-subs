00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello handsome and beautiful that you care 

00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:05.520
 I am this box and lady we are here 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.580
 One more Sunday forgive me my voice 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.530
 trucker character or joaquÃ­n sabina but 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.340
 I'm a little hoarse so if you see me 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.619
 some cock or if something strange but good the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.429
 theme of the week is to face two things 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.310
 do a verse, I'm going to face 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:26.240
 books against movies so nothing 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.240
 go for it 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.050
 i 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.040
 the first obvious and obvious difference 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.930
 for everyone who has not come in 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.910
 a cave is that the books have 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.530
 that watching the movies is simply 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.570
 have to see this can be both a 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.860
 advantage as a disadvantage in both cases to 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.989
 People who do not like to read a book 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.430
 it can be torture and torture 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.410
 huge but for me for example that I 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.850
 love it is a supreme pleasure what I 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.150
 I like to read a lot and it does not mean 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.610
 effort or torture added in some 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.010
 way movies I love the problem 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.180
 that you just have to sit and watch them 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.400
 obviously for people who do not like it 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.930
 reading is an advantage and that's why 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.820
 many times they wait for me to take the 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.159
 wig on some book medel stand up to 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.690
 read it because they do not like to read are the 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.280
 two biggest differences 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.850
 present ourselves a little more in 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.440
 more specific features for me 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.420
 he accomplished in my book is that as you would 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.850
 you have to read you can imagine what 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.220
 What you want is to say that they discover you a 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.320
 character as the author wants that 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.000
 so you see it is impossible for you you 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.260
 imagine a character exactly the same 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.119
 that the author or that any other 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.950
 person your character get into traits 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.900
 that you are more attractive or more 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.460
 unpleasant because if it is the contrary 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.110
 but you will always adapt to your tastes 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.850
 that's why it's never going to be 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.520
 same in the head of a person that in 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.190
 the other change in a movie an actor 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.440
 it's like that may seem more or less 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.570
 handsome or a prettier actress who acts 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.490
 better or worse but it is as it is not the 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.610
 you can change and that is a point 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.340
 which in my opinion is a disadvantage already 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.590
 that if an actor is not well chosen 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.150
 for me the movie bone loses all the 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.460
 I sense the load and come to see 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.560
 great movies with argument 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.570
 great but that in choice the doctor 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.300
 that does not do well or overacts or 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.190
 who does not know how to get into paper and 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.540
 movie loses all sense is it 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.400
 exempt remove the desire to see her 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.440
 complete something that you say in favor of 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.120
 the movies are the special effects 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.860
 yes it is true that in a book you 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.760
 you can imagine what you want and if 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.130
 you write in a fantasy world 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.350
 with dragons and unicorns you can 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.480
 imagine but it is not the same imagine 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.800
 what to see it from a movie now 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.420
 also with the super technology that 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.550
 we have can do super realistic 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.220
 because it's as if I was watching it from 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.870
 truth and you enter is that little dot that you say 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.980
 I'm thinking I can see it 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.810
 seeing I'm believing that that 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.140
 could there really be a point please 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.870
 for books 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.150
 he really tells you what he wants and you 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.700
 you read that directly written from their 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.680
 hands therefore will not see changes 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.750
 like the movies that cut pieces that 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.459
 they change the history a little adapt the 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.050
 script is not going to be any kind of 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.700
 modification therefore you are going to read 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.959
 exactly the story that the author 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.610
 wants to transmit in exchange for a 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.770
 movie always more possibilities of 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.810
 they changed a little argued that some 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.340
 character because it does not look like the one 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.130
 was described at first I 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.840
 you understand, let's not put into practice a 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.730
 book to me it seems much more comfortable to me 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.440
 take away do not do this battery and I'll 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.510
 you can see anywhere and instead 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.950
 I do not know anything like that with the 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.720
 mobile but it takes on the smartphone 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.540
 or tablet or whatever and you can see it 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.340
 anywhere but this battery and it's 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.410
 quite uncomfortable to see it on the little screen 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.940
 so tiny of subdued subtitles you 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.489
 jump the retinas directly 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.320
 melt then I think so a book 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.970
 always it is going to be a lot more comfortable 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.410
 take to entertain you out there is me 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.350
 lowering more and more the tone of the voice 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.580
 what am i trying 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.860
 go up pretty high you can and good for 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.470
 to finish I will emphasize what to me 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.780
 It seems incredible and essential that you 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.820
 it gives a very very very very favorable prow to 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.310
 the movies and it's the soundtrack what 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.260
 What is missing in a book is music 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.700
 that for me a story that has a band 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.350
 sound is that it changes it completely 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.180
 imagine yourself on proof of having a 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.250
 movie without music is that it is impossible 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.900
 it does not transmit anything to the story 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.670
 it can be super good that like music 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.400
 is poorly chosen or there is no music is you 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.110
 you stay like vacuum is like you 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.760
 missing something there is not a book is that what 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.770
 they do so well too that I give them 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.240
 I imagine already as a movie and narrate 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.580
 So beautiful that I can imagine them 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.860
 even with its ambient music but 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.230
 in a movie if age music is fine 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.510
 chosen and I have already won then 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.920
 that 's a very good point in favor and 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.200
 well I'm going to leave it here I can 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.270
 choose between movie or book is 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.800
 impossible because I like both I am very 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.180
 movie lover and I am very fond of the 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.950
 reading that choice is I leave it to 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.870
 you decided in the comments that 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.550
 you prefer is a movie or a 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.170
 good book I have given you then my 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.730
 arguments which I consider 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.590
 important before leaving I love you 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.630
