00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.059
 hello friends, I'm Maria and today I'm going to 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.700
 talk about this new terminal is the 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.130
 x5 videos from Huawei it is a mobile 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.080
 with a value for money 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.630
 exceptional so if you think we're going to 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.820
 see it as always to place the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.820
 sim card we will remove the battery 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.880
 but for the microsd card it 's more 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.550
 simple you see the slot is separated 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.420
 so we would not need to take the 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.920
 drums 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.070
 we would simply have to remove the 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.070
 top 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.670
 Well, the truth is that it is very soft and very 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.950
 manageable look up here we find 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.890
 the on / off button next to the 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.730
 3.5 jack for headphones and in the 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.430
 side 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.720
 we found the volume control 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.610
 below is a little hole that you are seeing 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.610
 here is the microusb connector 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.270
 the first time we turn it on we 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.460
 asks for some configuration data 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.370
 staff that we can change more 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.710
 forward is a very simple process of 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.320
 I want to highlight this screen in 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.720
 the one that asks us if we have rate 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.250
 flat data I do have it because 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.410
 the best way to take advantage of 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.880
 terminal like this one is to hire 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.140
 a flat data rate and so you 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.240
 you connect to the internet the times that 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.340
 you want and that you do not have to be 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.650
 worrying about the cost but in 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.630
 any case in the x5 we can 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.510
 activate or deactivate mobile data 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.790
 very easily from this bar 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.120
 drop down and in this way we can 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.710
 save on data and even on battery and 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.860
 let's continue to know the x5 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.010
 comes equipped with android froyo one 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.160
 very good screen of 3.8 inches as 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.500
 you see and a 5 megapixel camera with 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.960
 flash that also allows us to record in 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.940
 hd and everything from a very comfortable interface 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.940
 so if you think we're going to try it 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.660
 and to share is very simple 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:24.510
 we simply give this icon 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.820
 share and select the gmail channel 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.910
 bluetooth messages or directly 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.800
 youtube and talking about youtube apart from 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.860
 can see all our videos too 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.230
 from here we can access our 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.600
 channel and record videos to hang them 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.220
 directly but not only the videos in 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.200
 high definition because it has a sound 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.260
 in 3-d that is as if we were 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.320
 listening live and if it does not lend 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.320
 Attention 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.290
 and good that if I do not mess and I do not follow 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.170
 telling what I like the most about 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.600
 ideos x5 and is the amount of things that 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.520
 I can customize and this to tune the 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.170
 mobile I love it because it 's like 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.290
 if he did it more own we think 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.490
 well for example we can change the 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.220
 number of terminal screens 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.190
 we press the contextual menu key we 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.690
 we go to setup start settings 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.520
 advanced and we select the number of 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.010
 screens and what do we want the 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.440
 main I'm going to put 7 that is my 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.120
 lucky number as the principal 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.880
 4 which is the middle one and is the most 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.280
 We can also select how 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.220
 we want to move from one screen to another in 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.070
 contextual startup settings and 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.260
 we select an animation I go to 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.590
 select the one from the book that is my 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.980
 favorite and now you will see how it happened as 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.379
 if they were the pages of a book 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.409
 and more things we can add access 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.940
 direct in a very simple way 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:01.519
 we will simply do a long press 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.920
 in one of the screens and we add 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.870
 shortcut me how do I talk a lot with 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.510
 javier I will put your contact as a 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.989
 shortcut so I'm going to the j 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:16.350
 here and he just selected it already 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.850
 you will see here it appears on the screen and 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.519
 another one of the characteristics that 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.350
 they like a lot of ideos x5 is the 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.810
 facility to interact with networks 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.940
 social for example from the application 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.949
 of facebook we have everything important 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.680
 at first sight and if we want to know 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.510
 the latest news news and for 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.460
 write then it's just as simple 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.380
 be here on facebook in a message of 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.669
 text or on any other clear side if 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.470
 we make a long press on the 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.539
 writing space unfolds a 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.610
 menu where we can indicate the form 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.410
 in which we want to enter the text there 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.330
 several options but to me the one that 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.430
 it is more comfortable is the usual keyboard 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.050
 that as you all know consists of 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.360
 move your finger through the letters that 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.560
 they form the words as soon as you take them 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.930
 the trick is very easy 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.870
 and another of the advantages of this terminal 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.030
 is the file management is very 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.340
 simple because it looks a lot like that of 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.760
 the computers keep all the 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.470
 documents in good folders as well as 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.090
 on all mobiles equipped with the 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.620
 Android operating system we can 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.800
 download a lot of applications 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.350
 from the market is very simple and good 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.970
 some are free and others you can not 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.310
 download as many applications as 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.470
 you want the memory has 2 gigs but 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.360
 you can always expand and between my 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.030
 favorite applications are those of 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.760
 navigation the one that I use most maps that 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.830
 It shows my location on a map as well 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.919
 has more icons like for example this 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.850
 of places where we can search 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:45.490
 places that are within our 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.490
 around for example let's look 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.370
 and now we see the bars that are 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.760
 near where I am and how 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:59.390
 ideos screen x5 is multitouch for 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.920
 expand or reduce is enough to separate or 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.080
 put your fingers together but the 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.120
 application that really fascinates me is 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.640
 layer is a reality system 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.160
 increased this what does it mean very 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.720
 simple is a system that extends us the 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.700
 information of the environment in which we 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.320
 we find for example if we were in 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.480
 the street we would simply have to 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.240
 look through the camera and we 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.630
 would appear overprinted information from 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:26.840
 restaurants bus stops 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:29.090
 You see subway mouths is very practical 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.490
 and very comfortable to use and as you 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.430
 you will imagine the x5 has many more 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:37.520
 applications of which I have told you 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.169
 for example look has several 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.290
 applications that manage mail 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:41.290
 electronic 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:47.640
 and the document was that it is a viewer of 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:50.340
 word powerpoint and pdf documents too 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.650
 I want to talk about another application very 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.720
 useful the voice search is a 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.570
 Searching application 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:01.340
 by voice for example I'm going to look 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.340
 the word cat cat 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.500
 you see now he's doing a search 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.480
 because the terminal recognizes it and we 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.570
 all the options appear in google 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.160
 great really good, we're already 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.410
 ending but I do not want to dismiss 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.050
 without telling you two last characteristics 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.030
 very important the first is that this 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.520
 terminal serves as an access point 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.740
 to internet for a computer with wifi and 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.860
 the second is that we can connect it by 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:31.070
 usb to our pc and thus get us the 

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:34.760
 data to the computer very comfortable and also 

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:37.790
 if we want usb memory in summary the 

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.680
 x5 is a terminal with many 

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.410
 benefits has a relationship 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.320
 unbeatable quality-price and also what 

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:48.130
 that I told you can be customized 

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:53.050
 many things I recommend you 

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:53.050
 ideos x5 see you later
