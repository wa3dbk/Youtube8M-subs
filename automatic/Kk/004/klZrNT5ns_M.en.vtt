handicap system is for and and if you
calculate<00:00:28.580> a<00:00:28.610> handicap<00:00:29.180> then<00:00:29.390> you<00:00:29.480> can

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
calculate a handicap then you can

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.090 
calculate a handicap then you can
compete<00:00:29.960> in<00:00:30.140> tournaments<00:00:30.320> and<00:00:30.740> compete<00:00:31.070> in

levels so don't worry about it if you've

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.360 
levels so don't worry about it if you've
never<00:00:39.410> bowled<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:39.800> league<00:00:39.980> ask<00:00:40.160> your

never bowled the league ask your

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.639 
never bowled the league ask your
tournament<00:00:40.640> officials<00:00:40.820> what<00:00:41.660> basis<00:00:42.109> of<00:00:42.320> score

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
tournament officials what basis of score

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:44.919 
tournament officials what basis of score
percentage<00:00:42.890> factor<00:00:43.550> they<00:00:43.670> use<00:00:43.969> sometimes<00:00:44.780> the

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
percentage factor they use sometimes the

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:49.380 
percentage factor they use sometimes the
basis<00:00:45.350> for<00:00:45.530> score<00:00:45.859> is<00:00:46.070> a<00:00:47.019> 200<00:00:48.019> or<00:00:48.170> 210<00:00:48.620> or<00:00:48.829> 220

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
basis for score is a 200 or 210 or 220

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.939 
basis for score is a 200 or 210 or 220
score<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:51.230> then<00:00:51.409> they'll<00:00:51.620> pick<00:00:51.800> either

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
score and then they'll pick either

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.279 
score and then they'll pick either
eighty<00:00:52.429> ninety<00:00:52.999> or<00:00:53.120> a<00:00:53.329> hundred<00:00:53.420> percent<00:00:53.839> of

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
eighty ninety or a hundred percent of

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.270 
eighty ninety or a hundred percent of
the<00:00:55.190> basic<00:00:55.699> score<00:00:56.089> in<00:00:56.960> certain<00:00:57.589> competition

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
the basic score in certain competition

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.369 
the basic score in certain competition
so<00:00:58.460> you<00:00:58.489> find<00:00:58.909> out<00:00:59.089> what<00:00:59.659> the<00:01:00.019> particular

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
so you find out what the particular

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:01.840 
so you find out what the particular
competition<00:01:01.069> that's<00:01:01.370> a<00:01:01.519> league<00:01:01.729> or

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
competition that's a league or

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.969 
competition that's a league or
tournament<00:01:02.390> is<00:01:02.539> using<00:01:03.139> for<00:01:03.289> a<00:01:03.319> basis<00:01:03.710> score

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
tournament is using for a basis score

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.010 
tournament is using for a basis score
and<00:01:04.220> what<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:04.640> percentage<00:01:05.059> handicap<00:01:05.540> is<00:01:05.810> and

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
and what the percentage handicap is and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.440 
and what the percentage handicap is and
then<00:01:06.530> for<00:01:06.950> example<00:01:07.310> you<00:01:07.430> can<00:01:07.640> calculate<00:01:07.880> what

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
then for example you can calculate what

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.590 
then for example you can calculate what
your<00:01:09.200> handicap<00:01:09.829> would<00:01:10.070> be<00:01:10.219> as<00:01:10.460> example<00:01:11.360> if<00:01:11.450> you

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
your handicap would be as example if you

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.870 
your handicap would be as example if you
have<00:01:11.780> a<00:01:11.810> three-game<00:01:12.500> scores<00:01:12.890> a<00:01:13.009> one<00:01:13.280> forty<00:01:13.729> one

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
have a three-game scores a one forty one

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.749 
have a three-game scores a one forty one
forty<00:01:14.540> six<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.200> one<00:01:15.649> hundred<00:01:15.890> fifty<00:01:16.159> six<00:01:16.369> just

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
forty six and one hundred fifty six just

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.609 
forty six and one hundred fifty six just
making<00:01:17.119> some<00:01:17.570> random<00:01:17.930> numbers<00:01:18.259> and<00:01:18.290> you<00:01:18.530> have

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
making some random numbers and you have

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.100 
making some random numbers and you have
a<00:01:18.649> total<00:01:19.009> series<00:01:19.310> of<00:01:19.490> four<00:01:20.030> forty<00:01:20.420> two<00:01:20.630> you

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
a total series of four forty two you

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.649 
a total series of four forty two you
simply<00:01:21.560> divide<00:01:21.710> your<00:01:22.070> series<00:01:22.430> score<00:01:22.700> by<00:01:23.270> three

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
simply divide your series score by three

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.660 
simply divide your series score by three
for<00:01:23.899> your<00:01:24.020> per<00:01:24.200> average<00:01:24.619> game<00:01:24.890> score<00:01:25.219> that's

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
for your per average game score that's

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.100 
for your per average game score that's
just<00:01:25.939> going<00:01:26.030> to<00:01:26.090> be<00:01:26.180> one<00:01:26.270> hundred<00:01:26.329> forty-seven

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
just going to be one hundred forty-seven

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.020 
just going to be one hundred forty-seven
we're<00:01:27.259> going<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:27.439> drop<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:27.799> point<00:01:28.070> three<00:01:28.369> pins

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
we're going to drop the point three pins

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.779 
we're going to drop the point three pins
per<00:01:29.240> game<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:29.689> then<00:01:30.320> your<00:01:30.680> official<00:01:31.100> average

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
per game and then your official average

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.800 
per game and then your official average
in<00:01:32.030> this<00:01:32.210> example<00:01:32.659> would<00:01:33.320> be<00:01:33.430> 147<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:35.390> if<00:01:35.659> you

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
in this example would be 147 so if you

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.219 
in this example would be 147 so if you
have<00:01:35.960> a<00:01:35.990> 90<00:01:36.380> percent<00:01:36.820> basis<00:01:37.820> of<00:01:38.420> 200<00:01:39.079> average

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
have a 90 percent basis of 200 average

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.399 
have a 90 percent basis of 200 average
of<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:40.310> 200<00:01:40.759> basis<00:01:41.119> score<00:01:41.359> and<00:01:41.600> they<00:01:41.840> use<00:01:41.960> a<00:01:41.990> 90

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
of a 200 basis score and they use a 90

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.800 
of a 200 basis score and they use a 90
percent<00:01:42.590> percentage<00:01:43.369> factor<00:01:43.880> then<00:01:44.539> if<00:01:44.689> your

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
percent percentage factor then if your

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.859 
percent percentage factor then if your
average<00:01:45.109> is<00:01:45.259> 147<00:01:46.219> like<00:01:46.340> in<00:01:46.520> our<00:01:46.700> example<00:01:46.869> your

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
average is 147 like in our example your

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.010 
average is 147 like in our example your
official<00:01:48.439> average<00:01:48.799> in<00:01:48.950> this<00:01:49.390> again<00:01:50.390> then<00:01:50.630> your

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
official average in this again then your

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.109 
official average in this again then your
official<00:01:51.380> handicap<00:01:51.829> would<00:01:52.009> be<00:01:52.130> thirty<00:01:52.520> seven

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
official handicap would be thirty seven

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.330 
official handicap would be thirty seven
point<00:01:53.329> seven<00:01:53.659> or<00:01:53.929> thirty<00:01:54.500> seven<00:01:54.859> pins<00:01:55.100> per

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340
