and<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:10.110> has<00:02:10.349> vitamin<00:02:10.890> E<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.520> that's

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
and it has vitamin E in it so that's

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.460 
and it has vitamin E in it so that's

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
delicate eye area and it also has a

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.880 
delicate eye area and it also has a
built-in<00:02:16.650> short<00:02:17.280> printer<00:02:18.320> so<00:02:19.320> that<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.680> can

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
built-in short printer so that you can

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.810 
built-in short printer so that you can
sharpen<00:02:20.690> this<00:02:21.690> retractable<00:02:22.350> pencil<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.490> a

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
sharpen this retractable pencil to a

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.140 
sharpen this retractable pencil to a
point<00:02:24.180> if<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.450> need<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:25.670> I'm<00:02:26.670> almost<00:02:26.940> running

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
point if you need to I'm almost running

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.720 
point if you need to I'm almost running
out<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.480> this<00:02:27.630> one<00:02:28.040> because<00:02:29.040> I've<00:02:29.190> used<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.550> so

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
out of this one because I've used it so

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.600 
out of this one because I've used it so
much<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:31.080> is<00:02:31.290> retractable<00:02:31.830> whereas<00:02:32.430> this

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
much so this is retractable whereas this

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.400 
much so this is retractable whereas this
is<00:02:32.670> just<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.210> regular<00:02:33.570> pencil<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.260> have

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
is just a regular pencil that you have

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.020 
is just a regular pencil that you have
to<00:02:34.590> sharpen<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:37.490> that's<00:02:38.490> where<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.730> owl<00:02:38.850> may

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
to sharpen and that's where the owl may

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.430 
to sharpen and that's where the owl may
it<00:02:39.180> also<00:02:39.360> says<00:02:39.630> that<00:02:39.660> it's<00:02:39.930> hypoallergenic

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
it also says that it's hypoallergenic

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.320 
it also says that it's hypoallergenic
and<00:02:41.270> opthamologist<00:02:42.270> testing<00:02:42.740> okay<00:02:44.330> alright

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
and opthamologist testing okay alright

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.000 
and opthamologist testing okay alright
now<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.540> we've<00:02:45.810> read<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.110> claims<00:02:46.500> I'm<00:02:46.770> gonna

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
talk about the urban decay when I first

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.830 
talk about the urban decay when I first
applied<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.830> it<00:03:08.100> glided<00:03:08.790> on<00:03:08.970> like<00:03:09.240> butter<00:03:09.480> it's

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
applied it it glided on like butter it's

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.920 
applied it it glided on like butter it's
so<00:03:10.140> smooth<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.950> creamy<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.790> like<00:03:12.480> you<00:03:12.810> know

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
so smooth and creamy and like you know

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.110 
so smooth and creamy and like you know
the<00:03:13.110> claim<00:03:13.350> said<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:14.130> really<00:03:14.340> do<00:03:14.640> have<00:03:14.880> time

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
the claim said you really do have time

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.660 
the claim said you really do have time
to<00:03:15.390> just<00:03:15.420> smudge<00:03:16.320> it<00:03:16.470> out<00:03:16.620> if<00:03:16.770> you<00:03:16.890> want<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.280> and

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
to just smudge it out if you want to and

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.670 
to just smudge it out if you want to and
then<00:03:17.880> after<00:03:18.210> just<00:03:18.420> let<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.720> set<00:03:18.930> but<00:03:19.530> what<00:03:19.650> I

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
then after just let it set but what I

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.220 
then after just let it set but what I
noticed<00:03:20.190> was<00:03:20.520> that<00:03:20.550> it<00:03:21.180> can<00:03:21.480> get<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.690> little<00:03:21.990> bit

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
noticed was that it can get a little bit

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.440 
noticed was that it can get a little bit
messy<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.980> fact<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.370> it<00:03:23.520> is<00:03:23.640> so<00:03:23.820> creamy<00:03:24.090> and

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
messy the fact that it is so creamy and

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.770 
messy the fact that it is so creamy and
also<00:03:25.410> not<00:03:26.040> long<00:03:26.280> after<00:03:26.730> maybe<00:03:27.060> like<00:03:27.330> 15

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
also not long after maybe like 15

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.870 
also not long after maybe like 15
minutes<00:03:27.960> after<00:03:28.200> applied<00:03:28.710> it<00:03:29.250> actually<00:03:29.610> did

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
minutes after applied it actually did

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.450 
minutes after applied it actually did
start<00:03:30.570> kind<00:03:31.380> of<00:03:31.440> smudging<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.070> little<00:03:32.340> bit

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
start kind of smudging a little bit

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.840 
start kind of smudging a little bit
underneath<00:03:32.910> my<00:03:33.360> lower<00:03:33.540> lash<00:03:33.840> line<00:03:34.700> so<00:03:35.700> that's

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
underneath my lower lash line so that's

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.900 
underneath my lower lash line so that's
pretty<00:03:36.180> much<00:03:36.330> how<00:03:36.570> I<00:03:37.580> that's<00:03:38.580> pretty<00:03:38.790> much

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
pretty much how I that's pretty much

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.030 
pretty much how I that's pretty much
what<00:03:39.120> happened<00:03:39.480> after<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:39.990> applied<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:40.740> and

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
what happened after I applied this and

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.010 
what happened after I applied this and
then<00:03:41.850> with<00:03:42.270> the<00:03:42.510> Almay<00:03:43.110> this<00:03:44.040> isn't<00:03:44.430> as<00:03:44.610> creamy

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
then with the Almay this isn't as creamy

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.360 
then with the Almay this isn't as creamy
but<00:03:46.020> there<00:03:46.170> are<00:03:46.320> ways<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.560> warm<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.160> up<00:03:47.250> a<00:03:47.340> bit

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
but there are ways to warm it up a bit

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.340 
but there are ways to warm it up a bit
like<00:03:47.760> sticking<00:03:48.390> it<00:03:48.510> under<00:03:48.630> your<00:03:48.840> armpit<00:03:49.140> or

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
like sticking it under your armpit or

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.630 
like sticking it under your armpit or
under<00:03:50.040> your<00:03:50.190> knee<00:03:50.370> pit<00:03:50.640> or<00:03:51.180> wherever<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:52.650> you

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
under your knee pit or wherever and you

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.070 
under your knee pit or wherever and you
just<00:03:53.820> warm<00:03:53.970> it<00:03:54.030> up<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.210> bit<00:03:54.240> and<00:03:54.540> then<00:03:54.630> apply<00:03:55.050> it

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
just warm it up a bit and then apply it

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.530 
just warm it up a bit and then apply it
and<00:03:55.470> this<00:03:55.890> actually<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:57.060> know<00:03:57.150> it<00:03:57.300> glides

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
and this actually is you know it glides

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.980 
and this actually is you know it glides
right<00:03:57.780> on<00:03:57.840> -<00:03:58.230> it's<00:03:58.680> just<00:03:59.250> not<00:03:59.460> as<00:03:59.700> soft<00:04:00.120> but

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
right on - it's just not as soft but

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.130 
right on - it's just not as soft but
they're<00:04:01.320> both<00:04:01.560> very<00:04:02.010> pigmented<00:04:02.460> and<00:04:03.000> as<00:04:03.870> far

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
they're both very pigmented and as far

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.610 
they're both very pigmented and as far
as<00:04:04.200> I<00:04:04.500> can<00:04:04.560> see<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.700> color<00:04:05.970> is<00:04:06.450> still<00:04:06.870> pretty

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
as I can see the color is still pretty

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.240 
as I can see the color is still pretty
intense

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
intense

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.500 
intense
even<00:04:08.700> after<00:04:09.000> eight<00:04:09.120> hours<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:11.510> some

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
even after eight hours and some

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.330 
even after eight hours and some
differences<00:04:13.020> I<00:04:13.170> can<00:04:13.320> see<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.710> that<00:04:13.920> with<00:04:14.100> the

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
differences I can see is that with the

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.030 
differences I can see is that with the
urban<00:04:14.700> decay<00:04:14.820> eye<00:04:15.030> right<00:04:15.570> here<00:04:15.600> they<00:04:16.380> transfer

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
urban decay eye right here they transfer

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.840 
urban decay eye right here they transfer
right<00:04:17.310> up<00:04:17.460> here<00:04:18.080> there's<00:04:19.080> a<00:04:19.109> bit<00:04:19.650> it's<00:04:20.549> much

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
right up here there's a bit it's much

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.930 
right up here there's a bit it's much
little<00:04:21.239> teeny<00:04:21.570> bit<00:04:21.750> more

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
little teeny bit more

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.219 
little teeny bit more
and<00:04:23.940> I<00:04:24.720> think<00:04:25.410> if<00:04:25.590> I<00:04:25.770> didn't<00:04:26.250> apply<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:27.780> on<00:04:28.080> my

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
and I think if I didn't apply the on my

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.500 
and I think if I didn't apply the on my
waterline<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:29.040> okay<00:04:29.610> I<00:04:29.639> applied<00:04:30.030> it<00:04:30.210> on<00:04:30.300> my

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
waterline I okay I applied it on my

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.810 
waterline I okay I applied it on my
upper<00:04:30.540> lash<00:04:30.900> line<00:04:30.930> my<00:04:31.830> lower<00:04:32.010> lash<00:04:32.280> line<00:04:32.580> and

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
upper lash line my lower lash line and

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.820 
upper lash line my lower lash line and
my<00:04:33.000> waterline<00:04:33.449> I<00:04:33.720> think<00:04:34.139> if<00:04:34.229> I<00:04:34.320> didn't<00:04:34.620> apply

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
my waterline I think if I didn't apply

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.980 
my waterline I think if I didn't apply
either<00:04:35.040> one<00:04:35.400> of<00:04:35.430> these<00:04:35.639> on<00:04:35.970> my<00:04:36.510> waterline

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
either one of these on my waterline

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.990 
either one of these on my waterline
it<00:04:37.199> wouldn't<00:04:37.590> have<00:04:37.800> smudged<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:38.460> smeared<00:04:38.820> out

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
it wouldn't have smudged and smeared out

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.250 
it wouldn't have smudged and smeared out
to<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.840> side<00:04:40.080> here<00:04:40.410> as<00:04:40.620> much<00:04:40.979> as<00:04:41.250> it<00:04:41.460> did<00:04:42.260> so

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
to the side here as much as it did so

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.080 
to the side here as much as it did so
that's<00:04:43.440> also<00:04:43.710> something<00:04:43.919> to<00:04:44.070> consider<00:04:44.520> on<00:04:44.970> my

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
that's also something to consider on my

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.800 
that's also something to consider on my
waterline<00:04:45.419> these<00:04:45.870> two<00:04:46.110> we're<00:04:46.410> about<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:46.949> same

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
waterline these two we're about the same

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.830 
waterline these two we're about the same
from<00:04:48.810> what<00:04:48.960> I<00:04:48.990> can<00:04:49.080> see<00:04:49.310> it's<00:04:50.419> not<00:04:51.419> really<00:04:51.720> on

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
from what I can see it's not really on

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.900 
from what I can see it's not really on
the<00:04:51.990> waterline<00:04:52.260> anymore<00:04:52.919> except<00:04:53.669> for<00:04:53.820> the

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
the waterline anymore except for the

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.219 
the waterline anymore except for the
urban<00:04:54.180> decay<00:04:54.270> I<00:04:54.570> think<00:04:54.780> there's<00:04:54.930> just<00:04:55.080> a

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
urban decay I think there's just a

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.320 
urban decay I think there's just a
teensy<00:04:56.039> little<00:04:56.070> bit<00:04:56.490> more<00:04:56.699> right<00:04:56.940> in<00:04:57.120> the

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
teensy little bit more right in the

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.200 
teensy little bit more right in the
inner<00:04:57.570> side<00:04:57.930> in<00:04:58.229> a<00:04:58.410> corner<00:04:58.770> here<00:04:59.100> and<00:04:59.699> it's

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
inner side in a corner here and it's

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.640 
inner side in a corner here and it's
really<00:05:00.479> faded<00:05:00.690> though<00:05:00.990> you<00:05:01.050> really<00:05:01.380> can

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
really faded though you really can

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.320 
really faded though you really can
barely<00:05:01.889> see<00:05:02.070> it<00:05:02.190> but<00:05:02.639> yeah<00:05:02.760> they<00:05:02.940> we're<00:05:03.120> about

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
barely see it but yeah they we're about

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.070 
barely see it but yeah they we're about
the<00:05:03.449> same<00:05:03.710> so<00:05:04.710> for<00:05:05.280> those<00:05:05.430> who<00:05:05.850> really<00:05:06.210> loved

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
the same so for those who really loved

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.629 
the same so for those who really loved
this<00:05:07.350> on<00:05:07.560> their<00:05:07.800> waterline<00:05:08.220> think<00:05:08.490> that

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
this on their waterline think that

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.310 
this on their waterline think that
lassen<00:05:09.120> doesn't<00:05:09.419> budge<00:05:09.539> on<00:05:09.720> their<00:05:09.900> waterline

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
lassen doesn't budge on their waterline

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.730 
lassen doesn't budge on their waterline
that's<00:05:10.860> awesome<00:05:11.280> but<00:05:11.550> for<00:05:12.180> me<00:05:12.330> with<00:05:13.050> most<00:05:13.440> of

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
that's awesome but for me with most of

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.340 
that's awesome but for me with most of
the<00:05:14.120> eyeliners<00:05:15.120> I've<00:05:15.270> experienced<00:05:15.870> with<00:05:16.050> you

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
the eyeliners I've experienced with you

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.230 
the eyeliners I've experienced with you
know<00:05:16.440> on<00:05:16.560> my<00:05:16.680> waterline<00:05:16.949> they<00:05:17.669> only<00:05:17.850> stay<00:05:18.180> on

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
know on my waterline they only stay on

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.570 
know on my waterline they only stay on
my<00:05:18.360> waterline<00:05:18.660> for<00:05:18.810> maybe<00:05:19.590> an<00:05:19.740> hour<00:05:19.919> too<00:05:20.340> and

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
my waterline for maybe an hour too and

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.700 
my waterline for maybe an hour too and
they'll<00:05:20.669> start<00:05:20.880> fading<00:05:21.150> and<00:05:21.539> kind<00:05:21.900> of<00:05:21.990> sliding

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
they'll start fading and kind of sliding

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.520 
they'll start fading and kind of sliding
right<00:05:22.830> off<00:05:22.889> so<00:05:23.669> yeah<00:05:24.150> I'm<00:05:24.539> not<00:05:24.780> sure<00:05:25.050> these<00:05:25.320> are

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
right off so yeah I'm not sure these are

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.140 
right off so yeah I'm not sure these are
safe<00:05:25.740> for<00:05:25.919> the<00:05:25.979> waterline<00:05:26.430> I<00:05:26.460> don't<00:05:26.729> think<00:05:26.940> so

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
safe for the waterline I don't think so

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.000 
safe for the waterline I don't think so
but<00:05:27.780> a<00:05:27.810> lot<00:05:27.990> of<00:05:28.020> us<00:05:28.229> break<00:05:28.440> the<00:05:28.590> rules<00:05:28.770> and

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
but a lot of us break the rules and

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.620 
but a lot of us break the rules and
still<00:05:29.250> apply<00:05:29.460> it<00:05:29.520> on<00:05:29.700> our<00:05:29.729> waterline<00:05:30.240> anyways

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
still apply it on our waterline anyways

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.760 
still apply it on our waterline anyways
and<00:05:31.849> so<00:05:32.849> yeah<00:05:33.030> that's<00:05:33.330> basically<00:05:33.539> it<00:05:34.289> I'll

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
and so yeah that's basically it I'll

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.760 
and so yeah that's basically it I'll
have<00:05:35.099> before-and-after<00:05:36.060> shots<00:05:36.380> if<00:05:37.380> you're<00:05:37.590> on

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
have before-and-after shots if you're on

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.300 
have before-and-after shots if you're on
a<00:05:37.800> budget<00:05:38.160> and<00:05:38.610> you<00:05:39.229> just<00:05:40.229> want<00:05:40.979> something

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
a budget and you just want something

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.980 
a budget and you just want something
that's<00:05:41.490> pigmented<00:05:42.060> and<00:05:42.360> the<00:05:42.570> staying<00:05:42.870> power

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
that's pigmented and the staying power

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.800 
that's pigmented and the staying power
to<00:05:43.560> be<00:05:43.650> pretty<00:05:43.860> good<00:05:44.130> I<00:05:44.460> would<00:05:45.060> suggest<00:05:45.450> that

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
to be pretty good I would suggest that

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.589 
to be pretty good I would suggest that
Omni<00:05:46.380> one<00:05:46.729> and<00:05:47.729> if<00:05:48.060> you<00:05:48.180> want<00:05:48.360> something

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
Omni one and if you want something

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.320 
Omni one and if you want something
that's<00:05:49.110> just<00:05:49.380> extremely<00:05:50.070> creamy<00:05:50.400> that's<00:05:51.120> not

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
that's just extremely creamy that's not

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.810 
that's just extremely creamy that's not
gonna<00:05:51.510> skip<00:05:51.930> on<00:05:52.320> your<00:05:52.620> lid<00:05:52.860> whatsoever<00:05:53.580> when

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
gonna skip on your lid whatsoever when

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.390 
gonna skip on your lid whatsoever when
you<00:05:53.849> apply<00:05:54.180> it<00:05:54.240> and<00:05:54.780> you<00:05:55.710> know<00:05:55.830> just<00:05:55.860> basically

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
you apply it and you know just basically

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.560 
you apply it and you know just basically
glides<00:05:56.760> right<00:05:57.030> on

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
glides right on

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.920 
glides right on
you<00:05:57.930> still<00:05:58.169> have<00:05:58.289> time<00:05:58.470> to<00:05:58.530> smudge<00:05:58.919> it<00:05:58.949> and

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
you still have time to smudge it and

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.050 
you still have time to smudge it and
it's<00:06:00.930> still<00:06:01.289> pretty<00:06:01.680> intense<00:06:02.280> you<00:06:02.940> know

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
it's still pretty intense you know

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.060 
it's still pretty intense you know
throughout<00:06:03.330> the<00:06:03.510> day<00:06:03.750> then<00:06:04.590> I<00:06:04.740> would<00:06:04.860> get<00:06:05.010> the

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
throughout the day then I would get the

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.589 
throughout the day then I would get the
Urban<00:06:05.370> Decay<00:06:05.460> one<00:06:05.789> but<00:06:06.030> keep<00:06:06.180> in<00:06:06.300> mind<00:06:06.330> this

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
Urban Decay one but keep in mind this
