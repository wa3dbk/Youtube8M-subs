00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.279
 the jury says that to improve I need 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.020
 I'll go ahead while it stings so much I think 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.019
 will only capture what is necessary to be the 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.610
 better on stage and these are your 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.920
 challenge is to retransmit 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.530
 and communicate 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.160
 I liked how you sang last concert 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.980
 but I did not feel it in the therapies for 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.930
 raise issues for the eyes and I think 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.910
 that the one that before as escaped and the 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.430
 interpreters implement in a character 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.710
 sing note or me then I like to try 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.290
 something with you I need a bring 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.460
 absolute you have to be the child again 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.460
 who believes in a thousand 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:49.010
 and do not put more than you could leave 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.199
 at this point it is not attempted 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.480
 much more demanding than ever 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.190
 Guillermo, that 's what you have 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.019
 what to do sing from the bottom of your 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.480
 heart and transmit it you are prepared 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.010
 for it is much perfect so it is that 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.839
 I ask your mom Sara to give you the 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.879
 blessing that gives you a very strong hug 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.460
 so that you can go to position 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.140
 because tonight guillermo sings to us 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.140
 Jon's success dried up and it's called 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.450
 already 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.220
 new and total 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.580
 from my 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.540
 with me 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.540
 I do not need that 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.270
 you do not think 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.630
 let's see 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.630
 two 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.930
 yes 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.450
 this moment to live 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.970
 but the light of your eyes 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.970
 shines africa 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.970
 you are 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.050
 and man 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.810
 heart 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.980
 and she shines bright 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.980
 you are 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.180
 the moon 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.190
 when guillermo to shine in this 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:29.980
 stage with his presentation we go with 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.980
 our grain to clean of listening to them 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:40.990
 I think you're like trying to get into 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.780
 an atmosphere where you want to soak 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:47.740
 of that feeling of the song not 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:51.550
 I understand well if your eyes shine 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.990
 or shine, I think there's a little bit of 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:59.730
 bad diction at the moment in certain 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.730
 parts have to be more eager 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.640
 luis vernet 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.659
 he wants very honestly that he is 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:12.390
 surprised that we look in your face 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.850
 I understand the heart 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.420
 that you went out with everything 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.960
 that you left with desire 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.760
 to continue towards the end of wanting to be 

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.620
 a finalist 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.580
 I am very happy because it has shown 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.900
 I'm very much with you, thank you 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.569
 very well 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.569
 lola courteous 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:37.029
 tonight I sing jump a 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:39.339
 A little more nuance felt that started 

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:40.839
 with much punch the song then 

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:43.439
 There came a time when I felt it a 

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:46.509
 so much shouted this I would have liked 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:48.699
 certain nuances in some parts of the 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:50.319
 song and they explode them all of a sudden 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.959
 will return if you explode again 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:55.389
 then that was for me what we 

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:59.849
 missed but I imagine you in this genre 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.849
 musical doing it in large 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.800
 very good a polite 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.020
 red for guillermo therefore say 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.740
 it is your alicia 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.539
 and I think we're on the line there 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.080
 another opportunity ok 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:27.110
 there is always going to be the opportunity 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.860
 red buttons 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.140
 for Guillermo Wow , we've already been four 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.360
 sentenced tonight you have a 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.190
 second chance where you can 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.660
 save you from this sentence with your 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.140
 acoustic what song are you going to sing 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.970

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.210
 very good but while that happens I 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.410
 I want to ask you something, a little bird told me 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.260
 that you are not only a great 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.870
 singer that you are an expert in doing 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:56.590
 you can teach us 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:00.030

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.960
 to see another chance for the ball 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.470
 that does not have 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.880
 you need a specialist Guillermo who 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.870
 can teach you how to make the cranks 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.040
 combined 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.450

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.450

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.099
