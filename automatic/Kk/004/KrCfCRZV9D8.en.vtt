00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.820
 and here are examples of basic rhythmic figures 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.719
 on which are built more complex 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:24.480
 rhythmic patterns based on 4 16 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:27.359
 remove 2 and get figured sake in 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.500
 Based on the same 4 16 remove the last note 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.500
 gets the shape number 2 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:50.570
 this time we choose the third 16 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:52.600
 get figure number three here we are 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.410
 choose two notes at once the second and third 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.410
 we get figures number 4 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.370
 for this picture we remove 2 last 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.370
 case figure number 5 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.850
 these drawings are basic on their 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.520
 basis you can get a lot 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.770
 Of others, the main thing you now know as their 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.700
 calculate here are some examples on 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.700
 the basis of these drawings 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.670
 today it's all subscribe to my 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.880
