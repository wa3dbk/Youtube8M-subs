00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.980
 Hi everyone, today I want to introduce you to a 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.010
 very fast and easy project that 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.849
 I did to start trying the 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.300
 porcelain fria del e quarte for which it is 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.570
 absolutely my first approach with 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.840
 cold porcelain or corn paste 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:28.740
 exotic giving this product that is me 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.619
 been donated by the online art store 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.930
 visu own according to a 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.329
 collaboration to make a series of 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.379
 tutorial 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:42.230
 how do you see this cold porcelain 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.460
 it is packaged in an envelope and then 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.450
 inside there is also some film 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:52.800
 transparent and after having cut one 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.050
 piece lori well closed well because yes 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.550
 air dry and therefore it is important not 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.949
 let it dry 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.109
 I closed the transparent plastic 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.949
 I put it back in the envelope and mass 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.920
 also in another sealed envelope 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.939
 now with the little piece you have 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.850
 seen cutting 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.170
 i am starting to model some little ones with 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.950
 tickets 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:21.030
 the first thing I did was 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:25.770
 shaping the body let's say it is 1 1 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:29.880
 worth it again and then I added two 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.710
 small tv cylinders for the ears 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.439
 was the first time he modeled the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.350
 porcelain and honestly I am not 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.540
 not even going to watch other videos 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.450
 tutorial I tried to work a little 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.610
 as I work with polymer pastes for 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.409
 which adding these two small pieces 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.780
 of the ears I went then to 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.670
 damage the junction with the 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.790
 brush with rubber tip o 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.340
 scardino and arrange the details too 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.759
 with the burin I saw then in others 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.340
 videos that you can add the others 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.680
 share by placing a divine note 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.039
 a thousand and then maybe we'll see it together 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.500
 in the next videos to continue the 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.530
 definition of this engraved bunny 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.170
 two points in the eye with the sticker 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.440
 and with one of the tools for the 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.370
 cake design model I went to 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.740
 make two cross incisions that give me 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.010
 the effect of the casino with the mouth of the 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.860
 rabbit and then I did 2 more 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.810
 bunnies with ears set in 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.000
 bike a little different in the first 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.060
 bunny made an incision in half 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.090
 of the ear and the fold of one of the 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.040
 two and in the second flight said I put 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.140
 both ears turned a little 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.110
 to one side as you see in the 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.260
 imagine the eyes the nose with the 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.630
 I made them the same way 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.459
 I started from the project very easy and 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.069
 fast and simple just because it was the 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.500
 first time he was using this 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.090
 pasta and I didn't want to complicate myself 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.390
 too much life 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.180
 but maybe we'll see later I'll do 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.880
 some things even a little more complex and 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.870
 this second model of bunnies I have 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.209
 changed the part of the mill a little 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.610
 and of the mouth I put the nose e 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.610
 relief always with a very small one 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.630
 ball of cold porcelain and to do 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:29.870
 the mouth or incised a vertical cut is 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.959
 a horizontal cut and I helped myself 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.959
 both with the precision cutter and both 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.120
 always with the tools for the models 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.180
 of cake design to define 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:45.019
 these details and also with the 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.150
 burin and with regard to the mouth 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.190
 in addition to the vertical cut and to that 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.470
 horizontal I made two small ones 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.910
 ball engravings to be on the left 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:59.060
 of the mouth and also one in the middle this 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.519
 pasta does not need cooking, therefore 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.010
 I then let it dry inside 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:07.130
 home for a couple of days I don't know in 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.070
 actually how much time does it have to 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.170
 a little studying these things anyway later 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.660
 two days were perfectly dry 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.720
 and I wanted to give a little effect 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.090
 antiqued with the color of di ricoh ho 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.159
 got a brown acrylic first I have 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.880
 spends side over the entire surface of the 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:27.060
 bunnies and then I went 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.000
 remove it with a wet towel and 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.700
 then the brown is deposited 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.130
 only in the folds of the processing 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.170
 then with light pink I defined the 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.360
 cheeks the inner part of the 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.210
 ears with a fine-tip brush 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.450
 but you can do it also with the burin e 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:49.860
 with dark red I went to make a 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:52.050
 splash of color on the noses 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.110
 The workability of this pasta is very 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.960
 good and completely different for 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.000
 consistency from polymeric posts for 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.750
 which in my opinion to work with this 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.210
 dough but not designed projects 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.070
 appropriate and above all for what 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.830
 it concerns precisely the junction la 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.080
 overlapping parts of the projects 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.210
 as simple as this can be 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.710
 easily redone in polymer clay 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.900
 but not all pasta projects 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.860
 polymer can be made with the 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.770
 corn pasta 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.690
 however this is my first impression 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.640
 absolutely positive 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.980
 I greet you and wish you good again 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.910
 Easter and see you soon with the 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.390
 next video 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.390
 bye Bye
