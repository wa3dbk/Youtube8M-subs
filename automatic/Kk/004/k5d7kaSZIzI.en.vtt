a Red Bull is essentially the top half
or<00:00:23.160> conventional<00:00:23.940> death<00:00:24.180> it's<00:00:25.020> a<00:00:25.110> great

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
or conventional death it's a great

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.410 
or conventional death it's a great
movement<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.369> use<00:00:26.520> more<00:00:26.850> weight<00:00:27.060> than<00:00:27.270> you're

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
movement to use more weight than you're

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.019 
movement to use more weight than you're
usually<00:00:27.570> able<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.200> hold<00:00:28.439> or<00:00:29.040> a<00:00:29.070> maximum<00:00:29.760> lift

usually able to hold or a maximum lift

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.430 
usually able to hold or a maximum lift
so<00:00:30.570> set<00:00:31.439> up<00:00:31.619> reps<00:00:32.130> get<00:00:32.400> set<00:00:32.730> up<00:00:32.760> in<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.059> raft<00:00:33.440> as

so set up reps get set up in a raft as

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.350 
so set up reps get set up in a raft as
far<00:00:34.710> as<00:00:34.830> bar<00:00:35.070> placement<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.970> can<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.239> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
far as bar placement you can have the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.260 
far as bar placement you can have the
bar<00:00:36.570> anywhere<00:00:37.140> from<00:00:37.410> mid-shin<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.940> above

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
bar anywhere from mid-shin to just above

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.540 
bar anywhere from mid-shin to just above
the<00:00:39.480> knee<00:00:39.660> if<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.350> had<00:00:40.500> our<00:00:40.800> little<00:00:41.040> lower

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
the knee if you had our little lower

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.670 
the knee if you had our little lower
not<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.090> give<00:00:42.210> use<00:00:42.480> quite<00:00:42.840> as<00:00:42.989> much<00:00:43.170> weight<00:00:43.470> way

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
not to give use quite as much weight way

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.950 
not to give use quite as much weight way
you<00:00:43.770> will<00:00:43.949> get<00:00:44.190> full<00:00:44.489> range<00:00:44.640> motion<00:00:44.790> use<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
you will get full range motion use the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.619 
you will get full range motion use the
bar<00:00:46.170> our<00:00:46.800> higher<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.640> can<00:00:48.000> use<00:00:48.150> more<00:00:48.390> weight

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
bar our higher you can use more weight

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.299 
bar our higher you can use more weight
but<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.260> won't<00:00:49.440> have<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.710> same<00:00:49.920> range<00:00:50.160> of

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
but you won't have the same range of

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.889 
but you won't have the same range of
motion<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.790> it's<00:00:50.910> kind<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.210> trade-off<00:00:51.510> I

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
motion so it's kind of a trade-off I

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.500 
motion so it's kind of a trade-off I
recommend<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.680> mix<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.100> up<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.790> in<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
recommend you mix it up so in the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.120 
recommend you mix it up so in the
shoulder<00:00:54.809> with<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.020> part<00:00:55.050> where<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.920> can
