back out of here what we gotta look at

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.750 
back out of here what we gotta look at
is<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:43.409> fifth<00:02:43.650> skill<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.220> that's<00:02:44.400> what<00:02:44.640> I've

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
here some weird skill stuff the gear

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.460 
here some weird skill stuff the gear
here<00:02:52.859> it<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:53.069> you're<00:02:53.400> he's<00:02:54.120> pointing<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.319> see

here it is you're he's pointing you see

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.000 
here it is you're he's pointing you see
I<00:02:55.500> like<00:02:55.739> this<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.129> like<00:02:56.459> this<00:02:56.519> tutorial<00:02:58.010> usually

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
I like this I like this tutorial usually

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.399 
I like this I like this tutorial usually
the<00:02:59.670> Torrio's<00:03:00.150> when<00:03:00.450> they<00:03:00.659> just<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.379> know

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
the Torrio's when they just you know

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:02.509 
the Torrio's when they just you know
they<00:03:01.620> add<00:03:01.739> something<00:03:02.040> new

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
they add something new

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.250 
they add something new
they<00:03:02.639> just<00:03:02.849> put<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.120> there<00:03:03.269> then<00:03:03.450> they<00:03:03.780> expect

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
they just put it there then they expect

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.679 
they just put it there then they expect
you<00:03:04.409> to<00:03:04.560> know<00:03:04.709> what<00:03:04.739> to<00:03:05.280> do<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.760> then<00:03:06.239> I'm<00:03:06.540> like

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689 
you to know what to do and then I'm like

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:08.690 
you to know what to do and then I'm like
but<00:03:07.049> I<00:03:07.079> don't<00:03:07.439> know<00:03:07.590> what<00:03:07.769> to<00:03:07.920> do<00:03:08.069> you<00:03:08.280> have<00:03:08.310> to

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
but I don't know what to do you have to

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.289 
but I don't know what to do you have to
do<00:03:08.849> this<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.480> telling<00:03:10.379> us<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.620> tap<00:03:10.859> that<00:03:11.299> you

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
do this so telling us a tap that you

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.319 
do this so telling us a tap that you
hear<00:03:12.540> can<00:03:12.720> now<00:03:12.870> equip<00:03:13.379> additional<00:03:14.340> gear<00:03:14.790> the

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
hear can now equip additional gear the

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.509 
hear can now equip additional gear the
special<00:03:15.900> gear<00:03:16.139> will<00:03:16.319> maximize<00:03:16.889> ability<00:03:17.430> or

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
special gear will maximize ability or

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.220 
special gear will maximize ability or
defense

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
defense

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.589 
defense
so<00:03:19.230> these<00:03:19.379> gears<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.310> only<00:03:20.819> found<00:03:21.209> in<00:03:21.510> the

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
so these gears is only found in the

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:27.110 
so these gears is only found in the
dimension<00:03:22.500> rift<00:03:24.500> resist<00:03:25.500> device<00:03:26.160> slow<00:03:26.669> times

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
dimension rift resist device slow times

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:37.250 
dimension rift resist device slow times
one<00:03:27.540> let's<00:03:27.810> press<00:03:27.959> ok

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.620 

[Music]

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.200 

all<00:03:43.230> right<00:03:43.350> so<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.830> talks<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.250> bit<00:03:44.400> about<00:03:44.430> what's

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.210 
all right so it talks a bit about what's

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:51.530 
all right so it talks a bit about what's
happening<00:03:45.660> here<00:03:49.790> okay<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:51.090> says<00:03:51.300> something

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
happening here okay it says something

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.370 
happening here okay it says something
about<00:03:51.690> tap<00:03:53.390> essentially<00:03:54.390> this<00:03:54.600> is<00:03:54.930> movement

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
about tap essentially this is movement

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.040 
about tap essentially this is movement
down<00:03:56.250> resistance<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.480> notice<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:58.220> in<00:03:59.220> the

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
down resistance you notice that in the

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.740 
down resistance you notice that in the
the<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:02.220> villain<00:04:02.670> portion<00:04:03.210> the<00:04:03.330> village

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
the the villain portion the village

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.570 
the the villain portion the village
stage<00:04:04.610> what<00:04:05.610> happened<00:04:06.000> was<00:04:07.100> Bulls<00:04:08.100> on<00:04:08.370> you

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
stage what happened was Bulls on you

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.040 
stage what happened was Bulls on you
know<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.820> guy<00:04:08.850> we<00:04:09.150> hate<00:04:09.360> we<00:04:09.570> all<00:04:09.750> hate

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
know the guy we hate we all hate

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.980 
know the guy we hate we all hate
bullseye<00:04:10.920> well<00:04:11.670> he<00:04:11.940> slows<00:04:12.270> you<00:04:12.420> down<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:12.690> I

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
bullseye well he slows you down and I

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.040 
bullseye well he slows you down and I
guess<00:04:13.200> equipping<00:04:13.830> this<00:04:14.010> will<00:04:14.310> give<00:04:14.490> you

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
guess equipping this will give you

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:23.450 
guess equipping this will give you
resistance<00:04:16.050> to<00:04:16.770> that<00:04:21.830> now<00:04:22.830> what<00:04:23.010> stinks<00:04:23.280> is

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
resistance to that now what stinks is

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.820 
resistance to that now what stinks is
nobody<00:04:23.820> has<00:04:24.030> found<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.420> dimension<00:04:24.900> rift<00:04:25.050> so<00:04:25.680> I'm

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
nobody has found a dimension rift so I'm

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.130 
nobody has found a dimension rift so I'm
sitting<00:04:26.190> here<00:04:26.370> waiting<00:04:26.610> for<00:04:26.970> somebody<00:04:27.180> to<00:04:27.390> to

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
sitting here waiting for somebody to to

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.720 
sitting here waiting for somebody to to
give<00:04:28.320> me<00:04:28.440> a<00:04:28.470> give<00:04:29.370> me<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.490> rift<00:04:31.130> alright<00:04:32.130> so<00:04:32.400> I

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
give me a give me a rift alright so I

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.450 
give me a give me a rift alright so I
guess<00:04:32.910> we<00:04:33.360> might<00:04:33.600> as<00:04:33.660> well<00:04:33.810> go<00:04:34.320> check<00:04:35.160> out<00:04:35.310> if

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
guess we might as well go check out if

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.870 
guess we might as well go check out if
