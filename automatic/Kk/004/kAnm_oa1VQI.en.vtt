00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.580 
tricks on base from my ranking from C to
B<00:03:57.820> to<00:03:58.330> an<00:03:58.420> eighth<00:03:58.630> it<00:03:58.900> doesn't<00:03:59.230> like<00:03:59.320> you<00:03:59.500> and

as to a SS then to an ex ex being the

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.740 
as to a SS then to an ex ex being the
very<00:04:02.920> best<00:04:03.250> i'll<00:04:03.520> probably<00:04:03.730> get<00:04:03.910> very<00:04:04.180> few<00:04:04.450> as

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
very best i'll probably get very few as

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:12.250 
very best i'll probably get very few as
mostly<00:04:05.710> what<00:04:05.830> I<00:04:05.860> did

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260
