there's a story so I'll just make one up

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.220 
there's a story so I'll just make one up
as<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.010> go<00:00:26.039> along<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:27.119> basically<00:00:27.660> Fast<00:00:28.019> Eddie

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
as I go along so basically Fast Eddie

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.580 
as I go along so basically Fast Eddie
who<00:00:28.730> he<00:00:29.730> has<00:00:29.849> diabetes<00:00:30.480> because<00:00:30.840> he's<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.260> fat

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
who he has diabetes because he's so fat

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.530 
who he has diabetes because he's so fat
he<00:00:32.099> has<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.489> lose<00:00:32.669> weight<00:00:32.969> otherwise<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
he has to lose weight otherwise the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.450 
he has to lose weight otherwise the
doctors<00:00:33.870> are<00:00:34.020> going<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.200> take<00:00:34.410> his<00:00:34.559> foot<00:00:34.829> so

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
doctors are going to take his foot so

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.819 
doctors are going to take his foot so
basically<00:00:36.059> what<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.510> have<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.809> do<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.230> go

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
basically what you have to do is go

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.100 
basically what you have to do is go
around<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.399> collect<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.940> stuff<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.480> assume

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
around and collect and stuff I assume

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.729 
around and collect and stuff I assume
it's<00:00:40.350> insulin<00:00:41.070> or<00:00:41.190> something<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:42.739> while

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
it's insulin or something and while

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.709 
it's insulin or something and while
these<00:00:43.860> goombas<00:00:44.370> which<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.850> assume<00:00:45.210> are<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
these goombas which I assume are the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.110 
these goombas which I assume are the
sugar<00:00:46.020> troops<00:00:46.440> i'll<00:00:46.770> call<00:00:46.980> them<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.399> they're

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
sugar troops i'll call them and they're

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.670 
sugar troops i'll call them and they're
basically<00:00:48.450> trying<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.840> inject<00:00:49.200> Fast<00:00:49.500> Eddie

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
basically trying to inject Fast Eddie

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.279 
basically trying to inject Fast Eddie
with<00:00:49.950> some<00:00:50.160> kind<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.579> hyper<00:00:51.360> sugar<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:52.079> makes

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
with some kind of hyper sugar that makes

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.250 
with some kind of hyper sugar that makes
him<00:00:52.530> into<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.520> incredible<00:00:54.149> blob<00:00:54.390> man<00:00:54.780> an

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
him into the incredible blob man an

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.229 
him into the incredible blob man an
incredible<00:00:55.860> blob<00:00:56.100> man<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.640> eats<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.000> state

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
incredible blob man that eats the state

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.660 
incredible blob man that eats the state
capital<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.020> then<00:00:58.500> after<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.039> know<00:00:59.309> he

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
capital and then after that I know he

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.029 
capital and then after that I know he
