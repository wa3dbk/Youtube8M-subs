different masking materials for example
here<00:01:59.429> I'm<00:01:59.610> putting<00:01:59.759> down<00:01:59.880> two<00:02:00.210> inch<00:02:00.390> tape

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830

and<00:02:05.250> cut<00:02:05.399> out<00:02:05.520> accurately<00:02:05.940> but<00:02:06.750> I'd<00:02:06.899> have<00:02:07.110> to

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
and cut out accurately but I'd have to

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.529 
and cut out accurately but I'd have to
cover<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.039> whole<00:02:08.220> thing<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.579> frisk<00:02:08.820> it<00:02:09.000> it's

cover the whole thing and frisk it it's

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.940 
cover the whole thing and frisk it it's
actually<00:02:09.780> pretty<00:02:09.989> expensive<00:02:10.350> masking

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
actually pretty expensive masking

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.250 
actually pretty expensive masking
material<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.489> I'll<00:02:11.790> cover<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.660> first<00:02:12.900> little

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
material so I'll cover the first little

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.020 
material so I'll cover the first little
couple<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.709> inches<00:02:13.890> with<00:02:14.400> frisket

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
couple of inches with frisket

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.000 
couple of inches with frisket
cut<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.480> out<00:02:15.540> where<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.870> need<00:02:16.049> it<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.320> then<00:02:16.920> I'll

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
cut it out where I need it and then I'll

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.800 
cut it out where I need it and then I'll
lay<00:02:17.190> masking<00:02:17.700> tape<00:02:17.910> or<00:02:18.030> something<00:02:18.359> around<00:02:18.600> it

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
lay masking tape or something around it

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.650 
lay masking tape or something around it
and<00:02:18.989> use<00:02:19.290> my<00:02:19.440> arm<00:02:19.650> as<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.370> other<00:02:20.519> shield<00:02:20.850> it's

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
and use my arm as the other shield it's

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
and use my arm as the other shield it's
quick<00:02:21.950> saves<00:02:22.950> time<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:24.269> money<00:02:24.680> internal

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
quick saves time and the money internal

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:39.140 
quick saves time and the money internal
mixer<00:02:25.910> oh<00:02:26.989> yeah<00:02:27.989> love<00:02:28.470> it

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.880 

now<00:02:39.780> this<00:02:39.989> is<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.230> point<00:02:40.500> where<00:02:40.709> I'm<00:02:40.860> just

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
now this is the point where I'm just

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.399 
now this is the point where I'm just
putting<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.459> black<00:02:42.209> dark<00:02:42.629> background<00:02:43.230> in

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
putting that black dark background in

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:44.660 
putting that black dark background in
exactly<00:02:43.860> like<00:02:44.099> I<00:02:44.250> said

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
exactly like I said

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.250 
exactly like I said
and<00:02:44.849> once<00:02:45.000> we<00:02:45.150> peel<00:02:45.360> up<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.720> brisket<00:02:46.110> it's

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
and once we peel up that brisket it's

00:02:46.260 --> 00:03:02.180 
and once we peel up that brisket it's
going<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.620> reveal<00:02:46.980> those<00:02:47.280> red<00:02:47.519> hairs<00:03:00.650> ever<00:03:01.650> so

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
going to reveal those red hairs ever so

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.800 
going to reveal those red hairs ever so
gently<00:03:02.220> just<00:03:02.760> peeling<00:03:02.940> up<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.329> frisket

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
gently just peeling up that frisket

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.899

now<00:05:02.260> just<00:05:02.500> moving<00:05:02.770> on<00:05:02.890> to<00:05:03.040> the<00:05:03.130> other<00:05:03.370> side<00:05:03.700> of

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
now just moving on to the other side of

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.870 
now just moving on to the other side of
the<00:05:04.000> hair<00:05:05.220> again<00:05:06.220> we're<00:05:06.400> just<00:05:06.430> putting<00:05:06.670> down

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
the hair again we're just putting down

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.790 
the hair again we're just putting down
the<00:05:07.030> darkest<00:05:07.480> colors<00:05:07.780> first<00:05:08.020> because<00:05:08.620> we're

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
the darkest colors first because we're

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.800 
the darkest colors first because we're
going<00:05:08.920> to<00:05:09.070> be<00:05:09.160> using<00:05:09.490> transparent<00:05:10.330> paints

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
going to be using transparent paints

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.600 
going to be using transparent paints
over<00:05:11.170> the<00:05:11.290> top<00:05:11.500> so<00:05:11.890> it's<00:05:12.010> important<00:05:12.460> that<00:05:12.490> we

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
over the top so it's important that we

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:26.890 
over the top so it's important that we
put<00:05:12.790> down<00:05:12.940> our<00:05:13.000> darkest<00:05:13.690> colors<00:05:14.020> first

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.070

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
now check it out here I'm using a live

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.050 
now check it out here I'm using a live
stencil<00:05:30.590> for<00:05:30.770> the<00:05:30.860> hair<00:05:31.040> however<00:05:31.550> it's<00:05:31.820> not<00:05:32.000> a

stencil for the hair however it's not a

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.260 
stencil for the hair however it's not a
straight<00:05:32.450> edge<00:05:33.010> while<00:05:34.010> I<00:05:34.040> used<00:05:34.280> to<00:05:34.460> strive<00:05:34.910> to

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
straight edge while I used to strive to

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.690 
straight edge while I used to strive to
perfection<00:05:35.720> and<00:05:36.170> all<00:05:36.470> of<00:05:36.590> my<00:05:36.710> artworks<00:05:37.130> it<00:05:37.580> was

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
perfection and all of my artworks it was

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.820 
perfection and all of my artworks it was
actually<00:05:38.090> a<00:05:38.150> bit<00:05:38.270> of<00:05:38.300> a<00:05:38.390> downfall<00:05:38.680> you<00:05:39.680> would

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
actually a bit of a downfall you would

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.850 
actually a bit of a downfall you would
be<00:05:39.980> surprised<00:05:40.880> at<00:05:41.210> how<00:05:41.240> much<00:05:41.930> more<00:05:42.380> realism

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
be surprised at how much more realism

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.210 
be surprised at how much more realism
you<00:05:43.190> can<00:05:43.370> achieve<00:05:43.720> but<00:05:44.720> purposefully<00:05:45.590> messing

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
you can achieve but purposefully messing

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.120 
you can achieve but purposefully messing
