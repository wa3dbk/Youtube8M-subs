00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.870
 children's stories with animals 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.030
 and they are walking the elephant and his friend 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.760
 the monkey near a plantain 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.220
 seeing him provoked them with the cambur is 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.230
 but they were green and although the monkey 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.520
 I wanted to eat once the elephant told him 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.520
 that you had to wait for them to mature 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.489
 many of the words starts to 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.900
 paste from the banana plants 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.150
 looking to see if get some 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.760
 mature but did not get 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.710
 in one of those hand he came off 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.870
 kanoore is the one that hung the monkey and 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.850
 both the hand and the monkey fell to the floor 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.640
 the monkey happened to the hand of the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.010
 kangaroos but elephant told him monkey 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.780
 let's leave it here wrapped in sheets and 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.730
 within three days when they are mature 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.969
 and not green comunitat we return the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.969
 we eat 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.129
 the monkey not very convinced I accept 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.670
 the next day the monkey goes to check 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.130
 you change them and you see it a little less 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.990
 greens that provokes to prove even one 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.990
 but he knows he should not do it 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.650
 and the second day you see that the change 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.990
 They are almost mature so he decides to try 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.110
 one 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:36.329
 and suddenly without realizing it started to 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.329
 gobble the all all ate them 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.620
 even though they were not very good and 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.840
 who left the world like sticky mouth 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.350
 that he finished it until a 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.350
 stomachache 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.150
 for the pain the monkey went to bed 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.940
 the third day arrived and the monkey and the 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.190
 elephant is in place where 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.860
 they had left this the loops 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.440
 and when the elephant arrives it is surprised 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.980
 when not finding a model 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.180
 he explains with great sorrow friend of the 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.180
 cubes yesterday without realizing 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.810
 elephant a little annoying starts to 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:27.959
 retire and see below 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.959
 tree a good cambur 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.200
 he grabs him with his trunk the monkey looks at him 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:37.140
 thinking I ate all the cambures 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.730
 pintones and they did not know me very well 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.470
 I imagine that I will not be able to prove it 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.470
 because it belongs to the elephant 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.800
 but the elephant tells let's see 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.900
 eat this last change the two 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.650
 together so you can see what's good and what's left 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.650
 I feel I was going to be 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:02.390
 wow he was right the elephant says the monkey 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.250
 this is very good today you see monkey sometimes 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.140
 it is better to wait a bit to get 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.180
 something better than eating it all at once 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.180
 if the elephant is right 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.950
 and since then the monkey always waits 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.580
 to the changes are ripe before 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.580
 of shops 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.150
 but
