pull outta reach out of the extension

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.780 
pull outta reach out of the extension
now<00:02:38.520> in<00:02:39.120> some<00:02:39.420> cases<00:02:39.450> on<00:02:40.350> recons<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:43.790> this

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
now in some cases on recons the this

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.630 
now in some cases on recons the this
little<00:02:45.000> yellow<00:02:45.300> piece<00:02:45.770> those<00:02:46.770> talking<00:02:47.430> about

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
little yellow piece those talking about

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.160 
little yellow piece those talking about
its<00:02:47.880> glued<00:02:48.360> on<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.020> tube<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:50.459> happens

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
its glued on to the tube so that happens

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.870 
its glued on to the tube so that happens
you<00:02:52.170> can<00:02:52.320> also<00:02:54.530> lay<00:02:55.530> some<00:02:55.860> duct<00:02:56.190> tape<00:02:56.280> lay

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
you can also lay some duct tape lay

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.600 
you can also lay some duct tape lay
across<00:02:57.150> this<00:02:58.070> like<00:02:59.070> if<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.280> don't<00:02:59.400> want<00:02:59.550> to

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
across this like if you don't want to

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.860 
across this like if you don't want to
show<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.820> in<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.030> know<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.209> just<00:03:00.510> cut<00:03:00.660> along

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
show it in you know you just cut along

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.650 
show it in you know you just cut along
this<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.500> then<00:03:01.620> tape<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.340> down<00:03:02.550> on<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.390> around

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
this and then tape it down on and around

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.410 
this and then tape it down on and around
so<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.320> tube<00:03:04.530> will<00:03:04.709> lay<00:03:04.830> down<00:03:05.070> but<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.269> got

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
so the tube will lay down but I got

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.110 
so the tube will lay down but I got
lucky<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:06.989> might<00:03:07.170> just<00:03:07.380> slide<00:03:07.650> on<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.040> off<00:03:08.190> so

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
lucky it might just slide on and off so

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.880 
lucky it might just slide on and off so
you're<00:03:09.269> gonna<00:03:09.360> take<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.260> put<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.680> right

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
you're gonna take it and put it right

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.660 
you're gonna take it and put it right
back<00:03:11.250> together

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.570 

don't<00:03:15.360> add<00:03:15.630> like<00:03:16.260> it's<00:03:16.709> light<00:03:16.980> or<00:03:17.340> anything

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
don't add like it's light or anything

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.050 
don't add like it's light or anything
back<00:03:17.940> because<00:03:18.739> these<00:03:19.739> honestly<00:03:20.580> though

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
back because these honestly though

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.699 
back because these honestly though
they're<00:03:21.360> kind<00:03:21.570> of<00:03:21.660> stupid<00:03:22.079> on<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.590> then

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
they're kind of stupid on it and then

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.220 
they're kind of stupid on it and then
this<00:03:23.060> thing<00:03:24.060> doesn't<00:03:24.209> help<00:03:24.480> your<00:03:24.630> ass<00:03:24.780> anyway

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
this thing doesn't help your ass anyway

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.600

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
so I wouldn't even see the point in

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.220 
so I wouldn't even see the point in
putting<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.910> back<00:03:27.000> on<00:03:27.739> well<00:03:28.739> well<00:03:29.400> there<00:03:30.230> there

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
putting it back on well well there there

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.729
