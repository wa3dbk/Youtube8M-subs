00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
need for that type of thing is that like

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.740 
need for that type of thing is that like
this<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.640> everybody<00:01:39.060> doing<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.420> get<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
this is everybody doing that I get the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.539 
this is everybody doing that I get the
little<00:01:40.049> ones<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.320> do<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.560> they<00:01:40.950> do<00:01:41.009> starter

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
little ones to do that they do starter

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.950 
little ones to do that they do starter
from<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.759> six-year-olds<00:01:42.360> they<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.570> starting

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
from the six-year-olds they do starting

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.539 
from the six-year-olds they do starting
to<00:01:43.049> learn<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.320> basics<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.890> us<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.280> then<00:01:44.430> we

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
to learn the basics of us and then we

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.249 
to learn the basics of us and then we
progress<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.090> stunt<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.509> get<00:01:45.600> more<00:01:45.780> difficult

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
progress the stunt to get more difficult

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.810 
progress the stunt to get more difficult
as<00:01:46.380> they<00:01:46.530> go<00:01:46.680> up<00:01:46.740> through<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> age<00:01:47.189> age<00:01:47.549> groups

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
as they go up through the age age groups

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.850 
as they go up through the age age groups
so<00:01:48.299> obviously<00:01:48.659> they<00:01:48.869> need<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.200> be<00:01:49.290> doing<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.770> a

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
so obviously they need to be doing it a

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.950 
so obviously they need to be doing it a
