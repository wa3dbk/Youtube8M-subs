00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:09.059
 yes it is clear there is still much to work with 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.650
 the leg still obviously charging for 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.849
 I work because we have worked a lot 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.619
 we are always working on rhythms 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.439
 important and with important offices 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.539
 so it is clear that I did not expect a 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.730
 great commitment going to recognize 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.800
 certain tactical movements position e 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.289
 above all going to understand that too 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.830
 that they could possibly have incorporated 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.890
 there is newcomers in this sense 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.660
 yet to work we know but the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.890
 indications however are on the plan 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.629
 commitment and participation 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.230
 of the will to go and try 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.180
 there were certain solutions but maybe 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.219
 yes but because they are two guys who are 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.260
 arrived as early as your first day 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.940
 maybe other guys have arrived a little 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.210
 then so it is clear that they need 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.890
 of time and we know how we have seen 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.780
 even last year with new kids 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.670
 how important the work was 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.370
 then with time as we came out 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.530
 work and how they grew up 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.170
 a lot so we still have way to 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:14.060
 work on it and we are confident because they have 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.869
 all a right predisposition to want 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.000
 learn 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.700
 yes yes with then we'll go to work too 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.259
 on another tactical topic with the way done 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.420
 last year in short we must be in 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.280
 able to interpret more 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.720
 solutions because they can come back to us 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.080
 profits during the season 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.180
 and let's say 3 5 2 4 4 1 2 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.160
 over 41 where are modules in short that 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.940
 on which we are working more 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.220
 in short, we didn't ask for us 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.950
 when we sent the boys home 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.560
 they all had a work program 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:50.899
 we have already seen from the first training session 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.429
 observing the GPS instrumentalization 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.729
 tools the tools we have for 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.830
 short measure their state of their 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.289
 condition art that he had worked and 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.850
 so we talked to each other he had not 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.250
 we have a great deal accused 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.070
 preferred to let him do 25 minutes while 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.799
 we preferred to robin water and sleep 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.459
 let him do a running job and make them 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:16.239
 recover the physical work and therefore 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.239
 we monitor all day by day
