 occasion the video will try to how 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.259
 activate a battery saving mode 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.999
 our devices with this mode 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.670
 we will achieve to extend our battery 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:19.920
 enough time simply activating 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.630
 a very simple option where follows 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:32.850
 extract what it is about stay in this 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:34.620
 video and we start with this video this 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.900
 video is also very simple is very 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.620
 recommended is really a very tweet 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.710
 good 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.800
 it is very simple to activate this tweet is 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.150
 install already mind from cydia 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.880
 directly I had long ago had them 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.739
 brought a tutorial you can say a 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.050
 series of recommendations to achieve 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.370
 lengthen the life of our battery but 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.300
 through this tweet that I do not 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.520
 I knew what we can do 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.470
 just touching one on an option 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.480
 and automatically we will activate what 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.130
 is this battery saving mode of 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.899
 this way the and we have the 10 for 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.939
 we are going to extend it to 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.840
 one or two hours depending on the use that 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.210
 let's give him 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.130
 but if you have not been installed that 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.420
 is the one that we have here of all to be 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.219
 with the description of the video and in this 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.409
 part you see a window with the 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.359
 which will send you to the link of that video of 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.740
 the recommendations he gave them for 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:21.869
 increase your device's battery 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.700
 click on it is the box and it will send you 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.280
 that link and you can check it inditex 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.020
 install anything else simply by following 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.549
 what is this video that we have there what 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.140
 you will be able to activate but also what is 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.600
 a description of the I leave you the link 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.850
 if you have installed or do not have it 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.140
 so you want to add it is also very 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.149
 simple also here now they are 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.310
 appearing worth squares depending 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.420
 the version of aid you have 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.439
 select this option there is also no 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.119
 that download the video distribution you 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.369
 I leave the link so maybe that 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.750
 version decide the version of them 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.979
 I want you to have to install if it's a 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.409
 tutorial also very simple what 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.030
 I highly recommend that you install CIA and therefore 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.349
 it's all they have to do once 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.299
 they have installed and we are no longer 

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:59.459
 Iraqi to what is obviously the 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.039
 application of cydia here the application 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.060
 of cydia what we are going to do is go to 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.600
 the option d 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.369
 and here what we are going to do is write 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.290
 are you what I'm putting you in 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.290
 this part that is power 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.200
 we will wait for the option 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.730
 data once they recharge we can 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.730
 live to see 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.099
 like the one we have here takes remember 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.080
 that the text is appearing so that 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.060
 look for it and download it let's go 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.920
 download this that is power 6 mod if you 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.780
 you do not have to install it appears to you 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.209
 something what is this power 6 option 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.709
 mod none of the two options do not you 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.799
 worry what you're going to have to do 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.720
 is to add a tweet to a source that 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.980
 truth is very easy to do if we 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.840
 let's go to that this second option that 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.000
 we have here below in this second 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.120
 option we're going to add a network because it 's 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.980
 necessary so if you do not think so 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.900
 to the repo that we are going to add is the 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.879
 I'm leaving here in this part that is 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.720
 the new dot x aaron dot com 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.000
 simply to add we see them in 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.470
 edit we give here in add and we go 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.069
 to add this challenge that I leave here 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.269
 repeat rebounded x.com simply this in 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.310
 this direction it seems that the 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.989
 introduction in this part and give it here 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.519
 where it says add source so that it 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.159
 I add them they will wait to access a 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.900
 series of a series of processes and once 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.430
 that this process has been carried out 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.200
 in returning like this again 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.239
 this screen once is in our 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.060
 screen will obviously appear 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.920
 what is this tweet people carry for 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.150
 access without any problem and once 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.769
 let this tweet be what they are going to do 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.420
 is to give you the option to install later on 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.790
 confirm and are expected to be performed 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.829
 the process of unloading the load of 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.849
 data one more that this has been done we 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.200
 is going to request that the 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.940
 springboard just let it 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.739
 restart and ready is all they have 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.000
 what to do once they have done everything 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.409
 this is going to see that there is no crime 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.180
 your device 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.739
 but there is a pretty important option 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.690
 because if we are not here adjustments 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.909
 we go on this battery option that 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.280
 this option has just been added 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.490
 battery we have what is power 6 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.360
 so if we activate 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.610
 automatically what you are going to do is 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.430
 activate a series of options what is going 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.020
 to make our battery lengthen 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.790
 quite seriously if you notice quite the 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.260
 change is fine here we have some 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.730
 options in which he will give us 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.910
 how much battery use did you like 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.590
 how long have you been in mode 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.239
 rest we can see what are the 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.250
 applications that consume us the most 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.320
 battery then this information very 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.820
 good something that does not have I is installed 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.260
 and in this way we can access and go 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.270
 to realize what more we 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.730
 is spending battery if we do not give 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.190
 here to power saving option we are going to 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.960
 look like everything this tweet does for 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.240
 can configure the and lower what is the 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.890
 Battery spending as we can see 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.020
 we have since turn off the brightness 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.540
 automatic deactivate what are the 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.940
 downloads deactivate what are the 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.390
 data and wifi and all this does 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.830
 directly what is this this 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.300
 configuration whenever you turn off 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.490
 Something can be directly from 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.380
 here and then it's basically what 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.050
 we have here automatically your 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.729
 device when it reaches 20% 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.380
 unless you notice that out 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.580
 you have low battery you will add a 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.500
 option in which 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.509
 you can take there directly what is 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.780
 the power saving mode and in this way 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:14.039
 Well, you are going to lengthen your battery a lot 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.539
 interest a tweet as recommended and it's 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.879
 basic that they have it installed in their 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:20.129
 devices to be able to do that 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.419
 our battery lasts us much more 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.990
 time on all the expressions in 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:26.219
 we need to have a battery of that 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.889
 good friends this object for this video 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:30.719
 I remember this tweet is called power 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.370
 save mold everything if you want to leave the 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:34.229
 name to download it said 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.840
 it's very simple how they could see and in 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:39.030
 they really get improvements also remember 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.770
 that if you have no idea it can be everything 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.360
 this manually just here 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.009

 Your device's battery is 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.870
