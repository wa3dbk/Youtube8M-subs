last<00:00:13.170> week<00:00:17.119> the<00:00:18.119> first<00:00:18.359> thing<00:00:18.539> we<00:00:18.630> look<00:00:18.750> at<00:00:18.840> is

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
last week the first thing we look at is

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.230 
last week the first thing we look at is
how<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.109> calculate<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.740> estimated<00:00:19.859> points<00:00:20.550> we

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
how I calculate the estimated points we

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.670 
how I calculate the estimated points we
use<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> predictive<00:00:21.900> model<00:00:22.230> based<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
use a predictive model based on the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.769 
use a predictive model based on the
players<00:00:22.949> performances<00:00:23.699> split<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.240> then<00:00:24.660> add

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
players performances split and then add

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.300 
players performances split and then add
a<00:00:24.810> matchup<00:00:25.080> factor<00:00:25.619> for<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.859> upcoming<00:00:26.130> week

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310

thing<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.420> keep<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.720> mind<00:01:18.780> when<00:01:19.080> setting<00:01:19.380> your

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
thing to keep in mind when setting your

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.469 
thing to keep in mind when setting your
lineup<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.189> teams<00:01:20.430> who<00:01:20.670> win<00:01:20.939> score<00:01:21.360> on

average two to 2.5 times more points

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.749 
average two to 2.5 times more points
over<00:01:24.780> losing<00:01:25.200> teams<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.220> can<00:01:26.340> often<00:01:26.670> be

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
over losing teams so it can often be

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.700 
over losing teams so it can often be
better<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.150> start<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.600> winning<00:01:27.960> passive<00:01:28.470> player
