flash and what we have here is a library

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.970 
flash and what we have here is a library
of<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.580> whole<00:00:29.880> bunch<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.439> animation<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:31.769> if<00:00:31.890> I

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
of a whole bunch of animation so if I

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.450 
of a whole bunch of animation so if I
click<00:00:32.040> into<00:00:32.460> these<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.940> can<00:00:34.219> bring<00:00:35.219> up<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
click into these I can bring up the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.180 
click into these I can bring up the
timeline<00:00:35.730> here<00:00:39.170> and<00:00:40.170> they<00:00:40.320> have<00:00:40.500> animations

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
timeline here and they have animations

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.000 
timeline here and they have animations

actually select an item on the screen
and<00:01:05.150> there's<00:01:06.150> an<00:01:06.330> option<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:08.060> generate<00:01:09.060> sprite

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and there's an option to generate sprite

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.520 
and there's an option to generate sprite
sheet<00:01:10.080> which<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.470> not<00:01:10.650> showing<00:01:10.979> up<00:01:15.049> so<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.140> see

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
sheet which is not showing up so you see

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.999 
sheet which is not showing up so you see
if<00:01:16.650> they're<00:01:16.799> generate<00:01:17.310> sprite<00:01:17.610> sheet<00:01:18.290> so<00:01:19.290> if

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
if they're generate sprite sheet so if

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.420 
if they're generate sprite sheet so if
you<00:01:20.159> select<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.610> one<00:01:20.729> or<00:01:21.210> multiple<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:22.080> will

want so there's a lot of different
options<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.070> then<00:01:29.070> create<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.759> sprite<00:01:30.090> sheet

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
options to then create this sprite sheet

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.410 
options to then create this sprite sheet
here<00:01:31.520> what<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.610> want<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.880> do<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.240> actually

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
here what we want to do is actually

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.899 
here what we want to do is actually
select<00:01:33.930> starling<00:01:34.350> there's<00:01:34.530> also<00:01:34.710> another

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
select starling there's also another

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.069 
select starling there's also another
quite<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> few<00:01:36.150> different<00:01:36.450> frameworks<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.900> can

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
quite a few different frameworks you can

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.340 
quite a few different frameworks you can
select<00:01:37.380> surprised<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.189> generation<00:01:38.520> for

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
select surprised you generation for

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.240 
select surprised you generation for
automatic<00:01:40.350> size<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:41.040> play<00:01:41.159> with

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
automatic size so you can play with

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.770 
automatic size so you can play with
these<00:01:41.369> different<00:01:41.759> things<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:42.210> get<00:01:42.390> exactly

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780

what you want but basically it is a P&amp;G
with<00:01:47.280> all<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.149> different<00:01:48.420> frames<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.960> your

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
with all the different frames of your

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.069 
with all the different frames of your
animations<00:01:49.920> from<00:01:50.159> your<00:01:50.369> movie<00:01:50.579> clips<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.079> it

animations from your movie clips and it
will<00:01:52.229> create<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.649> texture<00:01:53.310> atlas<00:01:53.600> along<00:01:54.600> with

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
will create a texture atlas along with

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.260 
will create a texture atlas along with
that<00:01:54.869> set<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.140> tell<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.850> where<00:01:56.850> everything<00:01:57.149> is

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
that set to tell it where everything is

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.600 
that set to tell it where everything is
so<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.600> export<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.759> and<00:02:00.259> then<00:02:01.399> you're<00:02:02.399> ready

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
so you export this and then you're ready

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.929 
so you export this and then you're ready
to<00:02:02.729> go<00:02:02.850> there<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.540> what<00:02:03.689> we<00:02:03.810> need<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.020> do<00:02:04.170> now<00:02:04.530> is

to go there so what we need to do now is
actually<00:02:05.939> come<00:02:06.420> into<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.840> game<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.740> a

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
actually come into the game so this is a

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.230 
actually come into the game so this is a
starling<00:02:08.220> game<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.810> I've<00:02:09.810> downloaded

you can get starling off the open source
project<00:02:20.110> basically<00:02:21.110> i<00:02:21.140> create<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.620> normal

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
project basically i create a normal

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.710 
project basically i create a normal
sprite<00:02:22.520> and<00:02:22.700> then<00:02:22.790> i<00:02:22.850> set<00:02:23.060> up<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.180> Starling

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
sprite and then i set up the Starling

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.380 
sprite and then i set up the Starling
class<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:24.950> pass<00:02:25.190> in<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.520> game<00:02:25.910> class<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.330> I

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
class and pass in a game class that I

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.890 
class and pass in a game class that I
want<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:26.840> let<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.530> Starling<00:02:27.890> do<00:02:28.040> all<00:02:28.220> the

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
want and let the Starling do all the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.200 
want and let the Starling do all the
stage<00:02:29.900> 3d<00:02:30.110> stuff<00:02:30.350> under<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.740> hood<00:02:30.890> so<00:02:31.150> in<00:02:32.150> the

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
stage 3d stuff under the hood so in the

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.430 
stage 3d stuff under the hood so in the
game<00:02:32.390> class<00:02:32.630> what<00:02:32.990> I<00:02:33.050> want<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.260> do<00:02:33.410> is

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
game class what I want to do is

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.440 
game class what I want to do is
basically<00:02:33.860> create<00:02:34.460> a<00:02:34.640> texture<00:02:35.120> from<00:02:35.300> our

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
basically create a texture from our

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.110 
basically create a texture from our
bitmap<00:02:35.630> so<00:02:36.170> are<00:02:36.380> our<00:02:36.680> PNG<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.340> our<00:02:37.490> bitmap<00:02:37.730> and

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.210 

I'm<00:02:41.120> going<00:02:41.270> to<00:02:41.330> go<00:02:41.420> ahead<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.630> create<00:02:41.930> that

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
I'm going to go ahead and create that

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.440 
I'm going to go ahead and create that
and<00:02:43.220> i'm<00:02:43.370> going<00:02:43.460> to<00:02:43.550> reading<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.000> texture<00:02:44.360> out

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
and i'm going to reading the texture out

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.040 
and i'm going to reading the texture out
list<00:02:44.980> data<00:02:45.980> as<00:02:46.130> xml<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:46.790> then<00:02:47.240> this<00:02:47.990> is

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
list data as xml and then this is

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.990 
list data as xml and then this is
texture<00:02:48.470> atlas<00:02:48.620> class<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.430> Starling<00:02:49.820> that

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
texture atlas class and Starling that

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.180 
texture atlas class and Starling that
knows<00:02:50.180> how<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.420> apply<00:02:51.110> both<00:02:51.410> those<00:02:51.620> so<00:02:51.800> then<00:02:51.950> I

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
knows how to apply both those so then I

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.880 
knows how to apply both those so then I
can<00:02:52.670> come<00:02:52.850> in<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.300> ask<00:02:53.690> for<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.410> textures<00:02:54.770> I

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
can come in and ask for the textures I

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.740 
can come in and ask for the textures I
want<00:02:55.130> so<00:02:55.340> here's<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.120> name<00:02:56.270> of<00:02:56.390> my<00:02:56.480> movie

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
want so here's the name of my movie

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.000 
want so here's the name of my movie
clips<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:58.310> add<00:02:58.880> 200<00:02:59.470> to<00:03:00.470> make<00:03:00.590> sure<00:03:00.740> that<00:03:00.890> it's

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
clips and add 200 to make sure that it's

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.220 
clips and add 200 to make sure that it's
unique<00:03:01.310> so<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.820> direct<00:03:02.420> ask<00:03:02.630> doesn't<00:03:02.990> pick<00:03:03.110> up

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
unique so the direct ask doesn't pick up

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.870 
unique so the direct ask doesn't pick up
direct<00:03:03.560> SE<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:05.110> I<00:03:06.110> just<00:03:06.710> basically<00:03:07.130> pull<00:03:07.580> in

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
direct SE and I just basically pull in

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.170 
direct SE and I just basically pull in
the<00:03:08.060> texture<00:03:08.480> so<00:03:08.630> it<00:03:08.780> knows<00:03:08.960> by<00:03:09.920> this<00:03:10.730> class<00:03:10.970> is

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
the texture so it knows by this class is

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.550 
the texture so it knows by this class is
something<00:03:11.630> nice<00:03:11.780> so<00:03:11.990> it<00:03:12.110> pulls<00:03:12.290> in<00:03:12.470> the

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
something nice so it pulls in the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.450 
something nice so it pulls in the
texture<00:03:12.860> atlas<00:03:12.980> for<00:03:13.970> me<00:03:16.300> in<00:03:17.300> the<00:03:17.480> xml<00:03:17.900> file<00:03:18.460> by

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
texture atlas for me in the xml file by

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.280 
texture atlas for me in the xml file by
name<00:03:19.490> and<00:03:20.030> so<00:03:20.210> all<00:03:20.390> i<00:03:20.420> do<00:03:20.570> is<00:03:20.750> create<00:03:20.960> a<00:03:21.050> movie

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
name and so all i do is create a movie

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.970 
name and so all i do is create a movie
clip<00:03:23.350> add<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.800> movie<00:03:25.190> clip<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:26.030> stage<00:03:26.980> i'm

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
clip add the movie clip to the stage i'm

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:28.930 
clip add the movie clip to the stage i'm
not<00:03:28.100> going<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.250> make<00:03:28.340> them<00:03:28.430> all<00:03:28.550> visible<00:03:28.820> the

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
not going to make them all visible the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.580 
not going to make them all visible the
same<00:03:29.150> time<00:03:29.390> added<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:29.930> each<00:03:30.020> other<00:03:30.170> so<00:03:30.440> the

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
same time added to each other so the

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.580 
same time added to each other so the
animation<00:03:31.070> frames<00:03:31.910> get<00:03:32.240> moved<00:03:32.750> on<00:03:32.900> of<00:03:33.320> course

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
animation frames get moved on of course

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.700 
animation frames get moved on of course
i<00:03:33.710> stop<00:03:33.980> them<00:03:34.300> and<00:03:35.300> only<00:03:35.750> play<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.410> one<00:03:36.560> that<00:03:36.680> i

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.710 
i stop them and only play the one that i

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.220 
i stop them and only play the one that i
want<00:03:36.800> to<00:03:37.130> so<00:03:37.340> basically<00:03:37.790> then<00:03:38.540> once<00:03:38.780> this

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
want to so basically then once this

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.100 
want to so basically then once this
classes<00:03:39.710> out<00:03:39.800> of<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:39.950> stage<00:03:40.190> i<00:03:40.460> go<00:03:40.610> ahead<00:03:40.700> and

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
classes out of the stage i go ahead and

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.600 
classes out of the stage i go ahead and
push<00:03:42.110> all<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.710> movie<00:03:43.070> clips<00:03:43.280> in<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.460> right

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
push all the movie clips in the right

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.610 
push all the movie clips in the right
place<00:03:43.820> right<00:03:44.180> in<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:44.390> middle<00:03:44.570> add<00:03:45.290> a<00:03:45.350> touch

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
place right in the middle add a touch

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.320 
place right in the middle add a touch
event<00:03:45.800> and<00:03:46.280> then<00:03:46.490> listen<00:03:46.820> for<00:03:46.970> a<00:03:47.000> touch<00:03:47.150> event

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
event and then listen for a touch event

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.180 
event and then listen for a touch event
to<00:03:47.690> again<00:03:48.050> check<00:03:48.620> out<00:03:48.770> where<00:03:48.890> the<00:03:48.980> mouse<00:03:49.160> is

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
to again check out where the mouse is

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.570 
to again check out where the mouse is
and<00:03:49.730> define<00:03:50.210> which<00:03:51.170> one<00:03:51.440> is<00:03:51.590> visible<00:03:52.100> and<00:03:52.340> play

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
and define which one is visible and play

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.790 
and define which one is visible and play
that<00:03:52.760> animation<00:03:53.120> so<00:03:53.510> what<00:03:53.630> does<00:03:54.470> this<00:03:54.590> look

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
that animation so what does this look

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.600 
that animation so what does this look
like<00:03:56.080> so<00:03:57.080> we<00:03:57.200> here<00:03:57.440> we<00:03:57.560> have<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:57.830> animation<00:03:58.280> as

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
like so we here we have the animation as

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.760 
like so we here we have the animation as
I<00:03:58.790> move<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.030> mouse<00:03:59.210> around<00:03:59.390> there<00:04:00.290> is<00:04:00.500> a<00:04:00.620> Tway

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
I move the mouse around there is a Tway

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.260 
I move the mouse around there is a Tway
