00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
you'll notice in the timeline when you

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.849 
you'll notice in the timeline when you
start<00:01:55.880> capturing<00:01:56.479> that<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.169> keyframes<00:01:57.679> will

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 
start capturing that the keyframes will

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:59.169 
start capturing that the keyframes will
actually<00:01:58.159> be<00:01:58.249> added<00:01:58.609> down<00:01:58.700> here<00:01:58.969> to<00:01:59.090> the

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
actually be added down here to the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.859 
actually be added down here to the
timeline<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.499> let's<00:02:00.709> do<00:02:00.889> that<00:02:00.919> real<00:02:01.700> quick<00:02:01.999> so

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
timeline so let's do that real quick so

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.959 
timeline so let's do that real quick so
if<00:02:03.139> we<00:02:03.289> start<00:02:03.529> capturing<00:02:04.039> you'll<00:02:04.429> notice<00:02:04.729> the

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
if we start capturing you'll notice the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:06.749 
if we start capturing you'll notice the
keyframes<00:02:05.599> being<00:02:05.899> added<00:02:06.139> to<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.259> timeline

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
keyframes being added to the timeline

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.770 
keyframes being added to the timeline
and<00:02:07.759> we<00:02:07.909> can<00:02:08.030> rewind<00:02:08.360> that

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
and we can rewind that

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.160 
and we can rewind that
oh<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:09.140> also<00:02:09.429> allows<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:10.789> save<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.420> audio

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.550 
file the audio track too
the<00:02:15.219> place<00:02:16.219> that<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.579> specify<00:02:17.150> here<00:02:17.390> so<00:02:18.379> if<00:02:18.439> we

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
the place that you specify here so if we

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.670 
the place that you specify here so if we
save<00:02:18.799> that<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.430> if<00:02:19.790> we<00:02:20.030> rewind<00:02:20.840> over<00:02:21.200> here<00:02:21.469> and

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
save that and if we rewind over here and

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.879 
save that and if we rewind over here and
play<00:02:22.639> back<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:26.450> can<00:02:26.629> see<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:26.840> that's<00:02:27.139> that's

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:27.889 
play back you can see that that's that's

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:29.589 
play back you can see that that's that's
going<00:02:28.189> through<00:02:28.219> and<00:02:28.639> playing<00:02:28.969> back<00:02:29.180> just<00:02:29.450> what

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
going through and playing back just what

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.839 
going through and playing back just what
we<00:02:29.689> recorded<00:02:30.260> now<00:02:30.950> if<00:02:31.099> you<00:02:31.219> want<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.430> do<00:02:31.519> a<00:02:31.549> take

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
we recorded now if you want to do a take

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.849 
we recorded now if you want to do a take
two<00:02:32.060> on<00:02:32.239> this<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:32.719> simply<00:02:33.139> check<00:02:33.379> this<00:02:33.620> box

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
two on this you simply check this box

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.349 
two on this you simply check this box
and<00:02:34.329> as<00:02:35.329> you<00:02:35.659> rewind<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:37.010> start<00:02:37.670> capturing

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
and as you rewind and start capturing

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.300 
and as you rewind and start capturing
again<00:02:38.719> it<00:02:39.349> will<00:02:39.469> actually<00:02:39.859> clear<00:02:40.129> that

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
again it will actually clear that

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.720 
again it will actually clear that
animation<00:02:40.909> and<00:02:41.209> give<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:41.599> new<00:02:41.780> keyframes<00:02:42.319> so

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
animation and give you new keyframes so

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.759 
animation and give you new keyframes so
that's<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.849> nice<00:02:43.999> feature<00:02:44.239> for<00:02:44.530> being<00:02:45.530> able<00:02:45.620> to

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
that's a nice feature for being able to

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.699 
that's a nice feature for being able to
quickly<00:02:45.950> redo<00:02:46.519> and<00:02:46.849> do<00:02:47.810> take<00:02:48.230> after<00:02:48.409> take

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
quickly redo and do take after take

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.050 
quickly redo and do take after take
until<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.099> get<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.340> exactly<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.819> way<00:02:49.849> that

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
until you get it exactly the way that

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.839 
until you get it exactly the way that
you<00:02:50.150> want<00:02:50.359> now<00:02:51.260> if<00:02:51.439> you<00:02:51.590> select<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:52.069> playback

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
you want now if you select the playback

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.280 
you want now if you select the playback
audio<00:02:53.150> over<00:02:53.719> here<00:02:54.069> this<00:02:55.069> box<00:02:55.780> I'm<00:02:56.780> going<00:02:57.049> to<00:02:57.139> do

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
audio over here this box I'm going to do

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.689 
audio over here this box I'm going to do
this<00:02:57.439> but<00:02:57.709> it's<00:02:57.859> gonna<00:02:57.980> give<00:02:58.219> us<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.430> little<00:02:58.549> bit

00:02:58.689 --> 00:02:58.699 
this but it's gonna give us a little bit

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:01.509 
this but it's gonna give us a little bit
of<00:02:58.819> feedback<00:02:59.000> so<00:02:59.889> but<00:03:00.889> I<00:03:00.919> want<00:03:01.129> you<00:03:01.219> to<00:03:01.280> see

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
of feedback so but I want you to see

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.030 
of feedback so but I want you to see
what<00:03:01.669> happens<00:03:02.060> so<00:03:02.870> as<00:03:03.019> I<00:03:03.169> talk<00:03:03.439> you<00:03:03.889> can

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
what happens so as I talk you can

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.319 
what happens so as I talk you can
actually<00:03:04.189> hear<00:03:04.549> it<00:03:04.609> through<00:03:04.849> the<00:03:04.939> speaker's

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
actually hear it through the speaker's

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.449 
actually hear it through the speaker's
of<00:03:05.359> the<00:03:05.480> computer<00:03:05.959> but<00:03:06.739> this<00:03:06.889> is<00:03:07.040> really<00:03:07.189> good

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
of the computer but this is really good

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.209 
of the computer but this is really good
for<00:03:07.699> is<00:03:07.909> if<00:03:08.120> you're<00:03:08.439> doing<00:03:09.439> a<00:03:09.530> performance<00:03:09.859> or

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:10.219 
for is if you're doing a performance or

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:11.439 
for is if you're doing a performance or
something<00:03:10.549> where<00:03:10.669> you<00:03:10.790> want<00:03:10.969> to<00:03:11.060> have<00:03:11.209> the

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:11.449 
something where you want to have the

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:14.110 
something where you want to have the
live<00:03:11.949> talkback<00:03:12.949> live<00:03:13.189> interaction<00:03:13.849> with<00:03:14.000> an

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
live talkback live interaction with an

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.539 
live talkback live interaction with an
audience<00:03:14.560> it's<00:03:15.560> really<00:03:15.859> nice<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.069> be<00:03:16.310> able<00:03:16.400> to

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
audience it's really nice to be able to

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.140 
audience it's really nice to be able to
play<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:18.290> audio<00:03:19.220> live<00:03:19.639> what<00:03:20.000> you're

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
play the the audio live what you're

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.789 
play the the audio live what you're
doing<00:03:20.419> this<00:03:20.569> so<00:03:21.259> maybe<00:03:21.439> you're<00:03:21.560> doing<00:03:21.739> a

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
doing this so maybe you're doing a

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.740 
doing this so maybe you're doing a
little<00:03:21.919> spook<00:03:22.250> alley<00:03:22.459> or<00:03:22.729> a<00:03:22.759> haunt<00:03:23.359> show<00:03:23.569> or

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
little spook alley or a haunt show or

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.990 
little spook alley or a haunt show or
something<00:03:23.989> and<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.439> want<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.579> talk<00:03:25.759> and

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
something and you want to talk and

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.399 
something and you want to talk and
interact<00:03:26.299> with<00:03:26.419> your<00:03:26.629> audience<00:03:26.689> a<00:03:27.079> little<00:03:27.169> bit

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
interact with your audience a little bit

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.939 
interact with your audience a little bit
it<00:03:27.530> makes<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:27.799> really<00:03:27.919> nice<00:03:28.449> and<00:03:29.449> then<00:03:29.949> this

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:30.949 
it makes it really nice and then this

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:34.140 
it makes it really nice and then this
allows<00:03:31.340> you<00:03:31.549> to<00:03:31.759> save<00:03:32.000> where<00:03:32.479> you<00:03:32.629> want<00:03:32.840> that

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
allows you to save where you want that

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.080 
allows you to save where you want that
audio<00:03:35.150> track<00:03:35.449> to<00:03:35.479> be<00:03:36.109> saved<00:03:36.379> to<00:03:36.669> now<00:03:37.669> the<00:03:37.729> delay

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
audio track to be saved to now the delay

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.649 
audio track to be saved to now the delay
is<00:03:38.359> an<00:03:38.509> interesting<00:03:38.829> slider<00:03:39.829> here<00:03:40.329> the<00:03:41.329> delay

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
is an interesting slider here the delay

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.509 
is an interesting slider here the delay
actually<00:03:41.900> helps<00:03:42.439> your<00:03:42.560> computer<00:03:43.099> keep<00:03:43.340> up

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
actually helps your computer keep up

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.170 
actually helps your computer keep up
with<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:44.680> animation<00:03:45.680> so<00:03:46.040> if<00:03:46.459> we<00:03:46.669> delay<00:03:46.939> this<00:03:47.150> a

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
with the animation so if we delay this a

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.640 
with the animation so if we delay this a
little<00:03:47.449> bit<00:03:47.689> it<00:03:47.900> allows<00:03:48.169> you<00:03:48.379> to<00:03:48.500> have<00:03:48.620> a

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
little bit it allows you to have a

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.159 
little bit it allows you to have a
little<00:03:48.829> bit<00:03:48.979> more<00:03:49.099> processing<00:03:49.759> time<00:03:49.989> so<00:03:50.989> that

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
little bit more processing time so that

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:53.289 
little bit more processing time so that
the<00:03:51.349> facial<00:03:52.159> animations<00:03:52.819> can<00:03:52.970> be<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.120> little

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
the facial animations can be a little

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.420 
the facial animations can be a little
bit<00:03:53.479> more<00:03:53.629> accurate<00:03:53.870> and<00:03:54.319> this<00:03:54.949> is<00:03:55.129> something

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
bit more accurate and this is something

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.559 
bit more accurate and this is something
that<00:03:55.459> you'll<00:03:55.639> just<00:03:55.819> have<00:03:55.970> to<00:03:56.090> experiment<00:03:56.389> with

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
that you'll just have to experiment with

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.629 
that you'll just have to experiment with
to<00:03:56.840> get<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:58.310> characteristics<00:03:59.000> and<00:03:59.180> the

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
to get the the characteristics and the

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.129 
to get the the characteristics and the
accuracy<00:04:01.639> that<00:04:01.790> you<00:04:02.060> are<00:04:02.150> after<00:04:02.329> the

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
accuracy that you are after the

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.080 
accuracy that you are after the
animation<00:04:03.469> intervals<00:04:04.099> is<00:04:04.400> interesting<00:04:04.939> as

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
animation intervals is interesting as

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.619 
animation intervals is interesting as
well<00:04:05.299> if<00:04:05.509> we<00:04:05.629> bump<00:04:05.840> this<00:04:06.019> up<00:04:06.229> a<00:04:06.319> little<00:04:06.439> bit<00:04:06.590> and

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
well if we bump this up a little bit and

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.860 
well if we bump this up a little bit and
play<00:04:09.400> you'll<00:04:10.400> notice<00:04:10.729> that<00:04:10.969> some<00:04:11.239> of<00:04:11.539> the

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
play you'll notice that some of the

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.899 
play you'll notice that some of the
animations<00:04:12.709> are<00:04:12.799> a<00:04:12.859> little<00:04:13.159> bit<00:04:13.400> more<00:04:13.430> choppy

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
animations are a little bit more choppy

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:16.749 
animations are a little bit more choppy
so<00:04:14.419> the<00:04:14.719> these<00:04:15.289> are<00:04:15.500> both<00:04:15.769> in<00:04:16.009> milliseconds

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:16.759 
so the these are both in milliseconds

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:18.640 
so the these are both in milliseconds
both<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.239> delay<00:04:17.750> and<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:18.199> animation

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
both the delay and the animation

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.249 
both the delay and the animation
interval<00:04:19.039> are<00:04:19.310> in<00:04:19.549> milliseconds<00:04:20.329> so<00:04:21.019> if<00:04:21.109> you

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:21.259 
interval are in milliseconds so if you

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:22.570 
interval are in milliseconds so if you
delay<00:04:21.500> this<00:04:21.680> a<00:04:21.709> little<00:04:21.919> bit<00:04:22.159> you'll<00:04:22.340> get<00:04:22.550> a

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
delay this a little bit you'll get a

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.149 
delay this a little bit you'll get a
little<00:04:22.849> bit<00:04:22.940> more<00:04:23.419> choppy<00:04:23.750> results<00:04:24.349> it<00:04:24.979> might

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:25.159 
little bit more choppy results it might

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:26.440 
little bit more choppy results it might
be<00:04:25.279> something<00:04:25.699> that<00:04:25.729> you<00:04:25.909> have

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
be something that you have

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.250 
be something that you have
background<00:04:28.360> figure<00:04:29.360> and<00:04:29.660> you<00:04:29.780> don't<00:04:29.990> need<00:04:30.080> as

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
background figure and you don't need as

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.360 
background figure and you don't need as
much<00:04:30.710> accuracy<00:04:31.810> so<00:04:32.810> you<00:04:33.740> can<00:04:33.890> decide<00:04:34.160> how<00:04:34.190> to

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
much accuracy so you can decide how to

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.240 
much accuracy so you can decide how to
use<00:04:34.430> that<00:04:34.760> and<00:04:35.080> last<00:04:36.080> but<00:04:36.320> not<00:04:36.410> least<00:04:36.680> is<00:04:36.980> the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
use that and last but not least is the

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.460 
use that and last but not least is the
configuration<00:04:37.610> file<00:04:38.240> what<00:04:38.720> this<00:04:38.900> file<00:04:39.140> does

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
configuration file what this file does

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.000

these<00:04:40.280> are<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.550> DMC<00:04:41.030> files<00:04:41.330> and<00:04:41.690> this<00:04:42.620> helps

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
these are the DMC files and this helps

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.680 
these are the DMC files and this helps

the four figures that you're working on

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.860 
the four figures that you're working on
so<00:04:59.300> whether<00:04:59.510> it's<00:04:59.660> Victoria<00:05:00.080> 4<00:05:00.350> or<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:01.870> the

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
so whether it's Victoria 4 or the the

whatever<00:05:05.480> these<00:05:05.810> are<00:05:05.960> custom<00:05:06.680> for<00:05:06.980> those

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
whatever these are custom for those

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.760 
whatever these are custom for those
figures<00:05:07.550> and<00:05:07.820> and<00:05:08.690> you<00:05:09.290> can<00:05:09.440> experiment

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
figures and and you can experiment

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.230 
figures and and you can experiment
around<00:05:10.100> with<00:05:10.220> those<00:05:10.340> to<00:05:10.520> find<00:05:10.700> out<00:05:10.910> which<00:05:11.060> one

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
around with those to find out which one

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.230 
around with those to find out which one
works<00:05:11.480> very<00:05:12.020> best<00:05:12.320> for<00:05:12.500> you<00:05:12.760> so<00:05:13.760> hopefully

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
works very best for you so hopefully

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.790 
works very best for you so hopefully
you'll<00:05:14.360> enjoy<00:05:14.450> mimic<00:05:14.930> live<00:05:15.110> as<00:05:15.320> much<00:05:15.500> as<00:05:15.650> we

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
you'll enjoy mimic live as much as we

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.060 
you'll enjoy mimic live as much as we
are<00:05:15.830> and<00:05:16.220> we<00:05:17.180> look<00:05:17.360> forward<00:05:17.570> to<00:05:17.690> you<00:05:18.070> using
