openers first thing you want to know is
what<00:00:13.720> exactly<00:00:14.139> is<00:00:14.260> the<00:00:14.380> prisoner's<00:00:14.830> dilemma

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
what exactly is the prisoner's dilemma

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.089 
what exactly is the prisoner's dilemma
the<00:00:16.059> prisoner's<00:00:16.509> dilemma<00:00:16.630> is<00:00:17.050> a<00:00:17.080> problem<00:00:17.770> that

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099 
the prisoner's dilemma is a problem that

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.310 
the prisoner's dilemma is a problem that
mathematicians<00:00:18.460> have<00:00:18.849> faced<00:00:19.090> for<00:00:19.360> years<00:00:19.750> and

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
mathematicians have faced for years and

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.589 
mathematicians have faced for years and
here's<00:00:20.800> the<00:00:20.890> scenario<00:00:21.279> you<00:00:21.430> have<00:00:21.460> you<00:00:22.419> have

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:22.599 
here's the scenario you have you have

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.420 
here's the scenario you have you have
two<00:00:22.930> prisoners<00:00:23.290> both<00:00:23.649> have<00:00:23.829> been<00:00:23.950> arrested

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
two prisoners both have been arrested

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.790 
two prisoners both have been arrested
and<00:00:24.610> they're<00:00:25.599> each<00:00:25.810> given<00:00:26.110> the<00:00:26.169> opportunity

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
and they're each given the opportunity

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.120 
and they're each given the opportunity
to<00:00:27.689> rat<00:00:28.689> the<00:00:28.869> other<00:00:28.989> side<00:00:29.200> out<00:00:29.410> or<00:00:29.890> to<00:00:29.980> keep

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
to rat the other side out or to keep

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.490 
to rat the other side out or to keep
quiet<00:00:30.399> if<00:00:30.880> they<00:00:31.480> both<00:00:31.689> keep<00:00:31.930> quiet<00:00:32.230> they're

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
quiet if they both keep quiet they're

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.569 
quiet if they both keep quiet they're
both<00:00:32.649> cooperating<00:00:33.280> with<00:00:33.370> the<00:00:33.430> other

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
both cooperating with the other

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.849 
both cooperating with the other
prisoners<00:00:34.059> and<00:00:34.350> there<00:00:35.350> won't<00:00:35.530> be<00:00:35.649> good

00:00:35.849 --> 00:00:35.859 
prisoners and there won't be good

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:37.799 
prisoners and there won't be good
evidence<00:00:35.980> on<00:00:36.309> either<00:00:36.519> of<00:00:36.699> them<00:00:36.820> and<00:00:37.120> they'll

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
evidence on either of them and they'll

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.410 
evidence on either of them and they'll
both<00:00:37.929> get<00:00:38.140> out<00:00:38.289> fairly<00:00:38.620> quickly<00:00:38.940> if<00:00:39.940> one

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
both get out fairly quickly if one

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.229 
both get out fairly quickly if one
prisoner<00:00:41.379> rats<00:00:41.800> out<00:00:42.039> the<00:00:42.250> other<00:00:42.399> he's<00:00:43.030> not

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
prisoner rats out the other he's not

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.990 
prisoner rats out the other he's not
cooperating<00:00:43.600> and<00:00:44.260> he's<00:00:45.070> gonna<00:00:45.250> guarantee<00:00:45.519> the

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
cooperating and he's gonna guarantee the

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.299 
cooperating and he's gonna guarantee the
other<00:00:46.120> prisoner<00:00:46.899> goes<00:00:47.410> to<00:00:47.589> jail<00:00:47.769> for<00:00:47.980> a<00:00:48.039> longer

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
other prisoner goes to jail for a longer

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.950 
other prisoner goes to jail for a longer
time<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:49.570> best<00:00:49.839> situation<00:00:50.379> for<00:00:50.410> him<00:00:50.769> is<00:00:50.949> if<00:00:51.489> he

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
time the best situation for him is if he

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
time the best situation for him is if he
rats<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.170> other<00:00:53.289> one<00:00:53.410> out<00:00:53.559> and<00:00:53.679> the<00:00:53.739> other<00:00:53.859> one

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
rats the other one out and the other one

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.009 
rats the other one out and the other one
cooperates<00:00:54.579> that<00:00:55.089> is<00:00:55.239> doesn't<00:00:55.480> rat<00:00:55.780> them<00:00:55.929> out

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
cooperates that is doesn't rat them out

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.200 
cooperates that is doesn't rat them out
so<00:00:56.499> the<00:00:56.739> prosecution<00:00:57.399> needs<00:00:57.850> that<00:00:58.059> one

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
so the prosecution needs that one

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.899 
so the prosecution needs that one
witness<00:00:58.769> one<00:00:59.769> prisoner<00:01:00.129> goes<00:01:00.280> free<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:00.789> other

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
witness one prisoner goes free the other

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:03.360 
witness one prisoner goes free the other
one<00:01:01.059> stays<00:01:01.329> there<00:01:01.510> for<00:01:01.749> a<00:01:01.780> longer<00:01:02.079> time<00:01:02.379> the

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
one stays there for a longer time the

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.399 
one stays there for a longer time the
worse<00:01:03.579> situation<00:01:03.819> is<00:01:04.330> when<00:01:04.510> both<00:01:04.900> prisoners

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
worse situation is when both prisoners

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.830 
worse situation is when both prisoners
write<00:01:05.680> each<00:01:05.800> out<00:01:06.010> when<00:01:06.580> they<00:01:06.670> both<00:01:06.909> fail<00:01:07.689> to

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
write each out when they both fail to

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.719 
write each out when they both fail to
cooperate<00:01:08.049> and<00:01:08.619> then<00:01:09.250> instead<00:01:09.460> of<00:01:09.549> getting

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
cooperate and then instead of getting

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.460 
cooperate and then instead of getting
out<00:01:10.030> you<00:01:10.360> know<00:01:10.450> fairly<00:01:10.720> quickly<00:01:10.840> they<00:01:11.170> both<00:01:11.320> do

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
out you know fairly quickly they both do

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
out you know fairly quickly they both do
an<00:01:11.560> extended<00:01:11.829> period<00:01:12.100> of<00:01:12.130> time<00:01:12.189> because

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
an extended period of time because

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.800 
an extended period of time because
neither<00:01:12.820> of<00:01:12.909> them<00:01:13.030> is<00:01:13.210> essential<00:01:13.659> to<00:01:13.720> the

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
neither of them is essential to the

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.260 
neither of them is essential to the
prosecution<00:01:14.500> now<00:01:15.369> the<00:01:15.430> way<00:01:15.729> you<00:01:15.790> look<00:01:16.060> at<00:01:16.149> this

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
prosecution now the way you look at this

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.730 
prosecution now the way you look at this
problem<00:01:16.570> on<00:01:16.659> paper<00:01:16.930> is<00:01:17.229> your<00:01:17.350> career<00:01:17.560> what's

problem on paper is your career what's

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.859 
problem on paper is your career what's
called<00:01:17.920> a<00:01:18.009> payoff<00:01:18.399> chart<00:01:18.700> so<00:01:19.210> here<00:01:19.420> is<00:01:19.600> a

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
of the paradox if you in your if you

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.600 
of the paradox if you in your if you
knew<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.110> your<00:02:26.410> Co<00:02:27.040> prisoner<00:02:27.489> we're

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
knew you and your Co prisoner we're

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.580 
knew you and your Co prisoner we're
always<00:02:27.790> going<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.090> make<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.269> same<00:02:28.450> decision

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
always going to make the same decision

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.869 
always going to make the same decision
you<00:02:29.590> know<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:29.860> you've<00:02:29.980> had<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.220> choice<00:02:30.400> both

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
you know so you've had the choice both

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.420 
you know so you've had the choice both
of<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.150> cooperate<00:02:31.690> or<00:02:31.930> both<00:02:32.470> of<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:32.860> not

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
of you cooperate or both of you not

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.479 
of you cooperate or both of you not
cooperate<00:02:34.560> then<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.709> rational<00:02:36.130> decision

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
cooperate then the rational decision

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.490 
cooperate then the rational decision
changes<00:02:36.940> then<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.209> should<00:02:37.480> always<00:02:37.780> cooperate

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
changes then you should always cooperate

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.920 
changes then you should always cooperate
because<00:02:38.800> if<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:38.950> look<00:02:39.069> at<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.220> payoff<00:02:39.400> chart

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
because if you look at the payoff chart

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.539 
because if you look at the payoff chart
you'll<00:02:40.930> see<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.440> if<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:41.739> both<00:02:41.920> cooperate

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
you'll see that if you both cooperate

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.970 
you'll see that if you both cooperate
the<00:02:42.760> payoff<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:43.209> 0<00:02:43.500> vs<00:02:44.500> -1<00:02:45.130> if<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:45.370> both<00:02:45.610> fail

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
the payoff is 0 vs -1 if you both fail

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.009 
the payoff is 0 vs -1 if you both fail
so<00:02:47.980> if<00:02:48.099> you<00:02:48.190> trust<00:02:48.519> your<00:02:48.700> Co<00:02:49.180> prettier<00:02:49.540> cohort

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
so if you trust your Co prettier cohort

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.289 
so if you trust your Co prettier cohort
in<00:02:50.170> jail<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:51.250> cooperate<00:02:51.790> you're<00:02:52.120> always

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
in jail to cooperate you're always

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.640 
in jail to cooperate you're always
better<00:02:52.510> off<00:02:52.599> cooperating<00:02:53.459> now<00:02:55.650> scientists

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
better off cooperating now scientists

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.740 
better off cooperating now scientists
have<00:02:56.739> run<00:02:56.920> all<00:02:57.220> kinds<00:02:57.250> of<00:02:57.700> mathematical<00:02:58.299> tests

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
have run all kinds of mathematical tests

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.660 
have run all kinds of mathematical tests
seeing<00:02:59.140> what<00:02:59.829> types<00:03:00.130> of<00:03:00.280> long-term

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
seeing what types of long-term

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.759 
seeing what types of long-term
strategies<00:03:01.420> work<00:03:01.569> best<00:03:01.599> if<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.260> have<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.560> face

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
strategies work best if you have to face

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.920 
strategies work best if you have to face
the<00:03:02.920> prisoner's<00:03:03.220> dilemma<00:03:03.250> repeatedly<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.329> if

the prisoner's dilemma repeatedly and if

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
you have to face it repeatedly and you

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.600 
you have to face it repeatedly and you
you<00:03:08.290> know<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.650> lot<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:09.099> times<00:03:09.220> that<00:03:09.280> you'll<00:03:09.430> see

there will be backstabbing non

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.229 
there will be backstabbing non
cooperation<00:03:16.200> but<00:03:17.200> if<00:03:17.349> you<00:03:17.500> go<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:17.769> a<00:03:17.920> long-term

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
cooperation but if you go to a long-term

cooperation but if you go to a long-term
the<00:03:19.239> players<00:03:19.599> that<00:03:19.930> cooperate<00:03:20.620> will<00:03:20.980> do

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
the players that cooperate will do

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.440 
the players that cooperate will do
better<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:21.609> this<00:03:21.730> is<00:03:21.790> obvious<00:03:22.209> from<00:03:22.299> the

better and this is obvious from the

better and this is obvious from the
payout<00:03:22.750> chart<00:03:23.019> and<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:24.340> problem<00:03:24.730> isn't<00:03:25.090> just

a theoretical problem you have a

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.410 
a theoretical problem you have a
prisoner's<00:03:27.280> dilemma<00:03:27.340> in<00:03:27.700> all<00:03:27.880> kinds<00:03:28.359> of

different areas for instance you may

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.039 
different areas for instance you may

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
have OPEC countries cheating the oil

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.750 
have OPEC countries cheating the oil
quarters<00:03:32.470> obviously<00:03:33.250> if<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.370> sell<00:03:33.579> more<00:03:33.700> oil

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
quarters obviously if you sell more oil

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.370 
quarters obviously if you sell more oil
they're<00:03:34.090> gonna<00:03:34.180> make<00:03:34.420> more<00:03:34.569> money<00:03:34.630> but<00:03:35.260> if

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
they're gonna make more money but if

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.830 
they're gonna make more money but if

everyone does it the payout the supply

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.270 
everyone does it the payout the supply
goes<00:03:37.870> up<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.380> payout<00:03:38.650> goes<00:03:38.829> down<00:03:39.069> and

goes up the payout goes down and
