sweet<00:00:54.140> elderflower<00:00:55.140> liqueur<00:00:55.500> now<00:00:56.129> as<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.760> can

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
sweet elderflower liqueur now as you can

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.369 
sweet elderflower liqueur now as you can
see<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.000> haven't<00:00:57.270> used<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.629> lot<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.960> because

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
see I haven't used a lot of it because

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.729 
see I haven't used a lot of it because
it's<00:00:59.190> cutting<00:00:59.579> kind<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.879> potent<00:01:00.350> not<00:01:01.350> put<00:01:01.590> an

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
it's cutting kind of potent not put an

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.680 
it's cutting kind of potent not put an
alcohol<00:01:02.070> potent<00:01:02.670> with<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.300> sweet<00:01:03.570> flavor

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
alcohol potent with like a sweet flavor

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.440 
alcohol potent with like a sweet flavor
so<00:01:04.680> I'm<00:01:04.799> guessing<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.820> fact<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.270> only

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
so I'm guessing the fact that this only

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.510 
so I'm guessing the fact that this only
has<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:06.930> ounce<00:01:07.110> two<00:01:07.439> ounces<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.799> vodka<00:01:07.830> 1

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
has one ounce two ounces of vodka 1

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.100 
has one ounce two ounces of vodka 1
ounce<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.760> Cointreau<00:01:08.939> 1<00:01:09.720> ounce<00:01:09.869> of

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
ounce of Cointreau 1 ounce of

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.160

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.640 
which I think in this case you might be
because<00:03:24.980> it<00:03:25.430> doesn't<00:03:25.760> really<00:03:25.880> have<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.180> lot<00:03:26.570> of

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
because it doesn't really have a lot of

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.410 
because it doesn't really have a lot of
pizzazz<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.709> it<00:03:28.100> I<00:03:28.430> haven't<00:03:28.970> used<00:03:29.120> that<00:03:29.209> word
