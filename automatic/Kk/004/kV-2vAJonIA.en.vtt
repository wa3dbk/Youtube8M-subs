hasn't<00:01:19.560> broke<00:01:19.740> yet<00:01:19.820> yet<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.060> said<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.960> hope

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
hasn't broke yet yet I said that I hope

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.870 
hasn't broke yet yet I said that I hope
it<00:01:22.950> doesn't<00:01:23.210> because<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.600> reality<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.259> I

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
it doesn't because the reality is I

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.230 
it doesn't because the reality is I
haven't<00:01:26.880> seen<00:01:27.240> these<00:01:27.420> anywhere<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:29.790> purchase

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
haven't seen these anywhere to purchase

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.940 
haven't seen these anywhere to purchase
as<00:01:30.390> replacements<00:01:31.110> I'm<00:01:31.290> sure<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:31.829> get

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
as replacements I'm sure you can get

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.310 
as replacements I'm sure you can get
them<00:01:32.070> from<00:01:32.159> Saline<00:01:32.549> racing<00:01:33.170> but<00:01:34.170> they

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
them from Saline racing but they

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.499 
them from Saline racing but they
probably<00:01:34.650> are<00:01:35.040> very<00:01:35.369> expensive<00:01:35.759> from<00:01:36.150> saline

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
probably are very expensive from saline

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.660 
probably are very expensive from saline
racing<00:01:36.990> they<00:01:37.140> tend<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.470> be<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:38.189> much<00:01:38.430> more

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
racing they tend to be have much more

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.350 
racing they tend to be have much more
aggressive<00:01:39.180> margins<00:01:39.689> than<00:01:40.310> their<00:01:41.360> authorized

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
aggressive margins than their authorized

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.450 
aggressive margins than their authorized
dealers<00:01:42.780> view<00:01:43.020> but<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.680> haven't<00:01:43.979> seen<00:01:44.159> this

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
dealers view but I haven't seen this

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.420 
dealers view but I haven't seen this
anywhere<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.920> know<00:01:47.070> where<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.280> get

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
anywhere so if you know where to get

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.230 
anywhere so if you know where to get
these<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:47.970> comment<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:49.110> review<00:01:50.240> let

me know where you can get them let
everybody<00:01:52.950> know<00:01:53.130> who<00:01:53.369> has<00:01:53.520> one<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.729> these<00:01:53.790> cars

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
everybody know who has one of these cars

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.350 
everybody know who has one of these cars
where<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.240> can<00:01:54.360> get<00:01:54.450> them<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:56.460> superchargers

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
where you can get them the superchargers

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.920 
where you can get them the superchargers
fed<00:01:57.689> by<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:59.939> factory<00:02:00.509> airbox<00:02:02.509> this<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.689> kind

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
fed by the factory airbox this is kind

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.630 
fed by the factory airbox this is kind
of<00:02:03.990> unique<00:02:04.320> because<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.680> would<00:02:04.920> expect<00:02:05.399> a

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
of unique because you would expect a

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.690 
of unique because you would expect a
cold<00:02:05.850> air<00:02:06.060> intake<00:02:06.090> here<00:02:06.920> but<00:02:07.920> saline<00:02:08.369> does<00:02:08.550> not

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
cold air intake here but saline does not

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.180 
cold air intake here but saline does not
install<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.149> cold<00:02:09.450> air<00:02:09.569> intake<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.259> my<00:02:10.920> guess

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
install a cold air intake and my guess

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.800 
install a cold air intake and my guess
is

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
is

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.790 
is
it's<00:02:12.560> because<00:02:12.890> they're<00:02:13.069> overrated<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:15.590> I'm

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
it's because they're overrated and I'm

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.290 
it's because they're overrated and I'm
not<00:02:15.950> going<00:02:16.100> to<00:02:16.160> install<00:02:16.280> one<00:02:16.700> if<00:02:16.850> it<00:02:16.970> wasn't

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
not going to install one if it wasn't

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.670 
not going to install one if it wasn't
installed<00:02:17.690> by<00:02:17.870> them<00:02:18.110> I'm<00:02:18.290> not<00:02:18.440> going<00:02:18.620> to

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
installed by them I'm not going to

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.100 
installed by them I'm not going to
install<00:02:18.980> it<00:02:19.220> so<00:02:20.120> if<00:02:20.270> you<00:02:20.390> see<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.690> quart<00:02:20.990> air

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
install it so if you see a quart air

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.540 
install it so if you see a quart air
intake<00:02:21.440> on<00:02:21.590> one<00:02:21.740> of<00:02:21.830> these<00:02:21.920> cars<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.520> is

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
intake on one of these cars it is

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.770 
intake on one of these cars it is

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
see the insert is fiberglass and they do

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.670 
see the insert is fiberglass and they do
have<00:03:49.970> heat<00:03:50.450> extractors<00:03:51.609> the<00:03:52.609> heat<00:03:52.790> extractors

look really sweet on top of the hood and

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.720 
look really sweet on top of the hood and
they're<00:03:57.530> also<00:03:57.739> functional<00:03:58.459> you<00:03:58.579> can

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
they're also functional you can

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.690 
they're also functional you can
literally<00:03:59.390> see<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.380> heat<00:04:00.680> coming<00:04:00.920> out<00:04:01.459> of

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
literally see the heat coming out of

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.789 
literally see the heat coming out of
them<00:04:02.140> extracting<00:04:03.140> the<00:04:03.260> heat<00:04:03.440> from<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.769> engine

bay<00:04:04.190> I<00:04:04.220> mean<00:04:04.430> you<00:04:04.579> can<00:04:04.730> actually<00:04:04.910> see<00:04:05.359> it<00:04:05.480> if

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
bay I mean you can actually see it if

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.280 
bay I mean you can actually see it if
you<00:04:06.440> look<00:04:06.470> down<00:04:06.799> to<00:04:06.859> hood<00:04:07.190> you<00:04:07.340> can<00:04:07.400> see<00:04:07.730> the

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
you look down to hood you can see the

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.430 
you look down to hood you can see the

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
coming up out of there so it is

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
functional and it is lightweight because

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.229 
functional and it is lightweight because
