now<00:00:18.480> we<00:00:18.599> have<00:00:18.720> some<00:00:18.900> other<00:00:19.019> factors<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.560> are

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
now we have some other factors that are

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.859 
now we have some other factors that are
really<00:00:19.980> important<00:00:20.519> but<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.789> can't<00:00:21.029> measure

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:27.649 
broadhead steel is very very important

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.259 
broadhead steel is very very important
it's<00:00:28.649> going<00:00:28.919> to<00:00:29.039> determine<00:00:29.579> how<00:00:30.000> thin<00:00:30.239> and

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
it's going to determine how thin and

a little bit fine thin edges are

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.009 
a little bit fine thin edges are
important<00:00:34.579> but<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.670> also<00:00:35.820> affects<00:00:36.600> the

a really interesting experiment is to

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.280 
a really interesting experiment is to
take<00:00:53.369> a<00:00:53.400> fresh<00:00:53.909> pig<00:00:54.239> hide<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.720> been<00:00:54.869> walling

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
tissues the angle of attack is a really

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.660 
tissues the angle of attack is a really
important<00:01:40.260> one<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:41.100> hard<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.520> get

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
important one and it's hard to get

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.760 
important one and it's hard to get
people<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.000> understand<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.690> best<00:01:42.990> way<00:01:43.710> to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
people to understand the best way to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.710 
people to understand the best way to
think<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.340> I've<00:01:44.520> found<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.600> if

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
think of it that I've found is that if

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.320 
think of it that I've found is that if
you<00:01:45.900> put<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.409> stake<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:46.979> your<00:01:47.159> plate<00:01:47.400> and<00:01:47.700> you

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
you put a stake on your plate and you

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.670 
you put a stake on your plate and you
take<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.840> really<00:01:49.530> really<00:01:50.340> sharp<00:01:50.580> steak<00:01:50.909> knife

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
take a really really sharp steak knife

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.870 
take a really really sharp steak knife
and<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.799> start<00:01:53.040> trying<00:01:53.190> to<00:01:53.400> cut<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:53.820> way

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
and you start trying to cut it this way

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.810 
and you start trying to cut it this way
it's<00:01:54.330> pretty<00:01:54.479> hard<00:01:54.690> to<00:01:54.780> cut<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.049> steak<00:01:55.820> even

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
it's pretty hard to cut that steak even

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.219 
it's pretty hard to cut that steak even
if<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:56.970> put<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.299> knife<00:01:57.540> at<00:01:57.720> a<00:01:57.780> 45<00:01:58.200> degree

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
if you put that knife at a 45 degree

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.770 
if you put that knife at a 45 degree
angle<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.159> try<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.670> cut<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.030> steak<00:02:00.270> it's

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
angle and try to cut that steak it's

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.780 
angle and try to cut that steak it's
pretty<00:02:01.080> hard<00:02:01.290> takes<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.590> lot<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.740> effort<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.369> if

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
pretty hard takes a lot of effort but if

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.340 
pretty hard takes a lot of effort but if
you'll<00:02:02.909> more<00:02:03.210> than<00:02:03.240> sharpening<00:02:03.900> to<00:02:04.049> video

just<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.560> piece<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.860> butter<00:02:08.569> and<00:02:09.569> that's

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
just like a piece of butter and that's

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.750 
just like a piece of butter and that's
what<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.439> angle<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.830> attack<00:02:10.890> does<00:02:11.400> for<00:02:11.670> you

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
what the angle of attack does for you

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.309 
what the angle of attack does for you
the<00:02:12.120> lower<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.629> can<00:02:12.720> get<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:12.959> angle<00:02:13.260> of

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
the lower you can get that angle of

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.800 
the lower you can get that angle of
attack<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:14.430> better<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.269> cuts<00:02:15.510> through<00:02:15.720> the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
attack the better it cuts through the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.740 
attack the better it cuts through the
tissues<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:17.640> angle<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.180> inch<00:02:18.360> bevel

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
tissues the angle of the inch bevel

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.470 
tissues the angle of the inch bevel
itself<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.980> big<00:02:20.250> factor<00:02:20.549> because<00:02:21.269> that

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
itself is a big factor because that

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.229 
itself is a big factor because that
angle<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.349> edge<00:02:22.470> bevel<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.730> also<00:02:24.120> an

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
angle of the edge bevel is also an

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.809 
angle of the edge bevel is also an
inclined<00:02:25.170> plane<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.859> it<00:02:26.340> has<00:02:26.489> mechanical

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
inclined plane and it has mechanical

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.330 
inclined plane and it has mechanical
just<00:02:28.390> like<00:02:28.540> your<00:02:28.690> broad<00:02:28.840> head<00:02:29.080> does<00:02:29.350> what<00:02:30.160> that

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
just like your broad head does what that

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.890 
just like your broad head does what that
means<00:02:30.580> is<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.910> higher<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.480> mechanical

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
means is the higher that mechanical

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.990 
means is the higher that mechanical
advantage<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.500> edge<00:02:32.620> is<00:02:33.010> at<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.850> given

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
advantage of the edge is at a given

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.540 
advantage of the edge is at a given
level<00:02:34.330> of<00:02:34.480> sharpness<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.830> easier<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.370> is<00:02:36.400> for

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
level of sharpness the easier it is for

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.790 
level of sharpness the easier it is for
it<00:02:36.850> cut<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.090> tissue<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.660> less<00:02:37.930> force<00:02:38.290> is

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
it cut the tissue the less force is

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.010 
it cut the tissue the less force is
required<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:40.240> less<00:02:40.390> tension<00:02:40.720> that's

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
required the less tension that's

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.460 
required the less tension that's
required<00:02:41.440> by<00:02:42.160> between<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.790> tissues<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:43.989> the

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
required by between the tissues and the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.290 
required by between the tissues and the
edge<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:44.770> that<00:02:44.890> blade<00:02:45.130> so<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.850> just<00:02:46.000> makes<00:02:46.150> it

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
edge of that blade so it just makes it

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.270 
edge of that blade so it just makes it
very<00:02:46.360> easy<00:02:46.569> for<00:02:46.989> it<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.290> cut<00:02:47.500> with<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.040> higher

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
very easy for it to cut with a higher

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.690 
very easy for it to cut with a higher
mechanical<00:02:48.819> advantage<00:02:49.209> of<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.510> bell
