00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.220 
this so I've grown a bit tired of flying
so<00:02:54.109> I<00:02:54.170> just<00:02:54.319> let<00:02:54.530> go<00:02:54.560> of<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.829> frost<00:02:55.069> I<00:02:56.230> don't

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
so I just let go of the frost I don't

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.699 
so I just let go of the frost I don't
have<00:02:57.530> I<00:02:58.209> don't<00:02:59.209> have<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.659> rely<00:02:59.810> on<00:02:59.989> my<00:03:00.470> wings

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
have I don't have to rely on my wings

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.410 
have I don't have to rely on my wings
which<00:03:01.190> means<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.459> can<00:03:01.609> have<00:03:01.700> my<00:03:01.790> wings<00:03:01.970> shot<00:03:02.239> off

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
which means I can have my wings shot off

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.599 
which means I can have my wings shot off
I<00:03:02.690> do<00:03:02.930> slowly<00:03:03.409> descend<00:03:03.890> you<00:03:04.040> can<00:03:04.190> see<00:03:04.370> there

I do slowly descend you can see there
but<00:03:05.569> it<00:03:05.659> does<00:03:05.780> mean<00:03:05.930> that<00:03:05.989> I<00:03:06.379> can<00:03:06.799> position

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250
