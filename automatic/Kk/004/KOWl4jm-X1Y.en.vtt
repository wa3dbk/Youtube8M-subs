00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.400
 the pilot that compels the case numbers to levels of organization of the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.549
 voice services 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.549
 Let's see how this works. 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.189
 to be invited to a server for free 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.599
 molecules 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.329
 these molecules group together 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.109
 these women group together if they really should have a cellular structure 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.699
 so when I start from molecules the next book comes cell 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.960
 the session is formed by a set of organic and inorganic molecules 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.270
 when he opened with now 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.730
 multiple cells 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.690
 to perform a specific function a little 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.670
 this set of reserves now represents a new level known 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.350
 as the fabric 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.180
 so what is decisive 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.699
 is a set of stars organized in harmony between each other 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.160
 Brazil will have a specific role 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.190
 when we found several prisons 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.399
 to form a more complex structure 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:13.529
 We now have not seen of organization named 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.710
 then for example the heart the mamer 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.080
 on the stage the contractor is a set of fabric organized in a soft way for 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.940
 a specific function 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.800
 when we bring together various bodies 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.310
 it was a great pride and organization 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.360
 the environment and system 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.500
 digestive system the circulatory system if this year 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.030
 for example 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.550
 we overcome the various systems in a set we have the best time the video 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.179
 more complex organization referred to known as beetle 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.410
 body 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.460
 what is the body as a whole the club 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.549
 systems 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.620
 side with experienced players 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.130
 when I was a player 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.260
 various organisms 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.840
 of these bodies 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.120
 of the same species 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.509
 the government revealed a level of organization from brazil open 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:12.929
 provoked reaction 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:15.429
 with her own game of the same species 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:16.959
 population 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.879
 right now the population will count on the population of a 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.599
 population of cockroaches 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.639
 so when we get together 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:27.319
 population we remember 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.079
 these are individuals of the same species at the same time bluepharma 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.860
 when we are different 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.509
 populations 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:37.499
 of a kind of love 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:41.649
 following the same methodology of service organization 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:43.739
 known by his name 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:44.999
 I'm not going to get well 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:46.759
 heard in the south 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:51.549
 pay attention to the ceremony on the second day 05 same thing as 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.739
 community is good then to the set of 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.069
 community and the flight is ours. 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.629
 we took these promises communities when we took these communities 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:05.929
 the sum of these communities 

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:09.279
 will now represent a good opportunity to carry out the service 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:10.879
 known per year 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.749
 is the ecosystem 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:14.270
 so what is the system 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.270
 It's a moment of opportunity none associated 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.070
 to factors 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.509
 to Turkish Apo 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:24.859
 how luminosity temperature pressure came out of the water 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.579
 This set of factors 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.519
 with the communities that present the factors bill orcutt 

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:34.739
 that's what we know his name 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:35.869
 sr 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:37.319
 the series a 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.719
 then the wider concept for in the system and can dry yes it is accurate 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:44.779
 a jury formed by biological factors 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:46.839
 but abiotic factors 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:51.479
 but with the corrupt cycling of organic matter and bioenergy 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:54.749
 for example a mangrove forest 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:56.720
 is an ecosystem a wall 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.720
 is an artificial ecosystem system maladies 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:03.680
 When are we going to have fun with the system? 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.820
 considering that we know the system if we want the 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.069
 seminar street water 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.539
 the set of all ecosystems representing the major problem 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:14.990
 modernization has 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.479
 known as 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:22.590
 biosphere ok then the environment of the group since they formally assumed to get lost 

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:24.479
 the last years and are living beings
