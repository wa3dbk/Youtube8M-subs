minecraft<00:00:49.680> hardcore<00:00:49.829> anthem<00:00:50.399> because

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
minecraft hardcore anthem because

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.240 
minecraft hardcore anthem because
they've<00:00:51.239> built<00:00:51.539> cool<00:00:51.780> online<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.890> reason

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
they've built cool online the reason

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.470 
they've built cool online the reason
that<00:00:53.280> we're<00:00:53.520> doing<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.090> because<00:00:54.210> we're

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
that we're doing this is because we're

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.670 
that we're doing this is because we're
we're<00:00:54.719> not<00:00:54.809> very<00:00:54.899> good<00:00:55.020> at<00:00:55.230> keeping<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.590> with

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
we're not very good at keeping it with

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.470 
we're not very good at keeping it with
theory<00:00:55.949> then<00:00:56.250> we<00:00:56.340> don't<00:00:56.550> really<00:00:56.670> quantum

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
theory then we don't really quantum

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.389 
theory then we don't really quantum
conundrum<00:00:59.000> yeah<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.960> make<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.440> ok<00:01:02.129> have<00:01:02.370> it

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
conundrum yeah to make that ok have it

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.429 
conundrum yeah to make that ok have it
ok<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.359> because<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:03.960> not<00:01:04.049> very<00:01:04.140> good<00:01:04.350> at

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
ok and because it's not very good at

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.649 
ok and because it's not very good at
finishing<00:01:04.680> things<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.970> basically<00:01:06.360> we're<00:01:06.570> not

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
finishing things so basically we're not

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.120 
finishing things so basically we're not
very<00:01:06.780> good<00:01:06.900> finish<00:01:07.290> thing<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.590> what<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:07.799> can<00:01:07.890> do

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
very good finish thing so what we can do

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.609 
very good finish thing so what we can do
we're<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.520> play<00:01:08.729> game<00:01:09.060> very<00:01:09.720> carefully
