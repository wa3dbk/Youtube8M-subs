00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.100
 welcome aboard the renault space la 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.920
 fifth generation of the minivan 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.680
 tricolor finally we do not say more monospace 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.090
 now but we say crossover then 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.070
 why simply because the 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.349
 minivans so no longer the rating 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.910
 whereas on the contrary the crossover and 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.240
 the issues and got beating have the wind in 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.850
 stern 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.580
 we are exactly on the same 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.789
 dimensions that the older generation of 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.190
 space ie 4 86 only there 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.340
 where before there were two jigs 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.710
 available there is more than that 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.470
 said it will not change fundamentally 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.199
 great thing because livability is 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.699
 always at the rendezvous we have for example 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.070
 a third seat that is 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.290
 available as an option 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.839
 the second behind-the-scenes wing of some 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.070
 centimeters back and forth 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.600
 precisely it frees up the 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.330
 place and for the third row and 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.199
 even to have legroom for 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:05.379
 the second and unlike the 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.659
 older generations the seats are not 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.570
 the steps but this time he 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.500
 retract completely into the 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.820
 floor and we can do it from 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.920
 of a key that is located in the 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.750
 chest wall it is very convenient 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.060
 on the other hand 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.550
 still not very relieved using this 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.360
 system there is also this screen of 9 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.130
 inches this erm2 system is very intuitive 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.740
 and especially in fact we can scroll a 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.650
 little bit like on an ipad to that answers 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.680
 on your finger 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.560
 instantly and most importantly we have a 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.800
 multi sense system ie we 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.190
 pressing here we can set the 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.100
 controlled suspension but also direction 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.610
 the respondent of the gearbox 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.600
 here and frankly in neutral mode 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.000
 it's a comfort but amazing 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.780
 it's so flexible game it's done 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.110
 a bit of a liner what's that very 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.730
 very soft very very soft 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.700
 but if you do not have it at all 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:13.700
 well if you prefer red cars 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.340
 go your way if you have 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.620
 now they bounce and it was 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.190
 frankly it's super nice and for 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.910
 a family 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:27.650
 it's ideal so we can set 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.340
 as one wants his fashion by just putting 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.410
 maybe the suspension piloted in mode 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.930
 dynamic here we come a compromise 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.910
 which is in perfect wash we also have the 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.870
 strong control system that does syria on 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.150
 this high-end finish that allows 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.760
 in fact to steer to rotate the wheels 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.590
 back and frankly we can say to each other 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.510
 here it is super interesting because 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.180
 it's a dynamic driving and so on 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.739
 yes that's true but it's 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.380
 especially nice in town because 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.200
 Well here we can turn almost 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.610
 like a clio and then to park 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.770
 here is sitting in a pocket square 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.930
 it is frankly a facility 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.030
 baffling 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.480
 we also find all 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.070
 dead equipment to driving and 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.209
 especially the head-up display 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.200
 more after all that is at the time of 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.500
 regulator crossing 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.150
 adaptive 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.390
 Too much viewfinder 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.860
 Blind spot detection cases etc. 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.019
 will go quickly done on the 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.689
 engines there I am with the diesel 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.909
 of 160 horses associated with a box 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.159
 double clutch EDC 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:39.280
 good it still misses a little bit of 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:43.260
 fishing is a bit heavy 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.340
 little clumsy a little shoe box 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.519
 so we will leave and perhaps deserve 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.530
 I do not know maybe that blood 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:55.269
 because good once launched on the on 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:59.040
 the road there is this diesel engine has 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.040
 also a very very big defect 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:05.220
 in fact as soon as you have a red light 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.720
 that we have stopped trembling is 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.180
 incredible we feel vibrations 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.310
 in the seat you feel like you're undergoing 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.330
 a mini earthquake is very 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.280
 very very unpleasant and frankly I 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.070
 do not even understand that we let pass 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.989
 that when it was presented to the last 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.190
 Paris fair in October I admit that 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:29.430
 I had trouble identifying this vehicle already 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.460
 his line finally or get done 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.290
 I still find a little back 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.850
 almond taste times and me the sale 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.460
 times I see there I think it was 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.160
 still a concept totally 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.660
 wacky but that I like it is true 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.770
 however, I was marked by 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.100
 finish that was still a 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.830
 huge progress is here in in this high 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.230
 initial range paris frankly y'a 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.120
 nothing to say there are always some 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.370
 little criticisms that can be made here 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.590
 and there but frankly it's a 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.080
 little bit to look for the little beast is to 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.190
 always want to compare them to 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.570
 German vehicles 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.390
 in fact it is a vehicle that is 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.700
 discovers little by little and finally at 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.900
 as we drive with and there 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.790
 we are really good in this vehicle 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.169
 it's true we're sitting at it 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.999
 it was always called 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:22.969
 but here we still have a feeling 

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:22.969
 on board
