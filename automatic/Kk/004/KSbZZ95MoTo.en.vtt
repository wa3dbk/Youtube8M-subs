00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
taking a look at an application for

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.419 
taking a look at an application for
android<00:00:09.420> of<00:00:09.510> course<00:00:09.540> called<00:00:10.469> swype<00:00:10.830> pad<00:00:11.130> and

android of course called swype pad and

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.129 
android of course called swype pad and
it's<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.730> really<00:00:11.940> neat<00:00:12.120> application<00:00:12.780> it's<00:00:12.960> not

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
it's a really neat application it's not

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.930 
it's a really neat application it's not
a<00:00:13.170> home<00:00:13.440> screen<00:00:13.769> replacement<00:00:13.799> but<00:00:14.429> it's<00:00:14.580> very

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
a home screen replacement but it's very

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.849 
a home screen replacement but it's very
similar<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.450> one<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:15.990> actually<00:00:16.379> allows<00:00:16.680> you

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
similar to one that actually allows you

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.500 
similar to one that actually allows you
to<00:00:16.980> drag<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.460> from<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.760> side<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.180> screen<00:00:18.449> and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
look alright guys so taking a look at

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.540 
look alright guys so taking a look at
the<00:00:33.989> application<00:00:34.140> itself<00:00:34.649> like<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.309> said

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
the application itself like I said

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.920 
the application itself like I said
before<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:36.149> doesn't<00:00:36.450> take<00:00:36.600> up<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.780> much

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
before it doesn't take up that much

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.930 
before it doesn't take up that much
battery<00:00:37.410> life<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.890> just<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.370> prove<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.760> to

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
battery life so just to prove that to

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.119 
battery life so just to prove that to
you<00:00:38.969> i<00:00:39.059> guess<00:00:39.360> i'll<00:00:39.840> go<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.110> about<00:00:40.350> phone<00:00:40.410> and

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
you i guess i'll go to about phone and

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.520 
you i guess i'll go to about phone and
go<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.460> status<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.570> see<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:43.260> one's

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
go to status so you can see this one's

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.560 
go to status so you can see this one's
