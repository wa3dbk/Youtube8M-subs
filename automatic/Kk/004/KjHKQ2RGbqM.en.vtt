00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.780 

pretty<00:02:10.569> simple<00:02:11.080> but<00:02:11.230> overall<00:02:12.220> really<00:02:12.340> neat

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
pretty simple but overall really neat

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:23.580 
pretty simple but overall really neat
effect<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:21.760> also<00:02:22.060> have<00:02:22.209> different<00:02:22.590> functions

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
effect you also have different functions

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.220 
effect you also have different functions
as<00:02:24.010> far<00:02:24.250> as<00:02:24.400> how<00:02:24.970> you<00:02:25.030> can<00:02:25.330> light<00:02:25.510> things<00:02:25.810> up<00:02:26.020> so

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
as far as how you can light things up so

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.690 
as far as how you can light things up so
this<00:02:26.380> is<00:02:26.530> just<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.830> standard<00:02:27.220> one<00:02:27.370> without<00:02:27.640> the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
this is just a standard one without the

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.960 
this is just a standard one without the
function<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.540> number<00:02:28.870> keys<00:02:29.050> that<00:02:29.350> up<00:02:29.970> and

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
function and the number keys that up and

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.850 
function and the number keys that up and
then<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.300> can<00:02:31.510> do<00:02:31.990> it<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.260> where<00:02:32.380> it's<00:02:32.590> fully

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
then you can do it to where it's fully

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.880 
then you can do it to where it's fully
lit<00:02:33.100> up<00:02:33.750> one<00:02:34.750> of<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.930> other<00:02:34.990> things<00:02:35.110> too<00:02:35.560> is

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
lit up one of the other things too is

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.059 
lit up one of the other things too is
that<00:02:36.100> you<00:02:36.280> can<00:02:36.510> have<00:02:37.510> custom<00:02:37.930> profiles<00:02:38.650> this

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
that you can have custom profiles this

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.000 
that you can have custom profiles this
is<00:02:39.220> what<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.459> made<00:02:39.760> where<00:02:40.090> it's<00:02:40.239> just<00:02:40.390> every

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
is what I made where it's just every

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.920 
is what I made where it's just every
every<00:02:42.010> other<00:02:42.130> key<00:02:42.520> now<00:02:43.450> if<00:02:43.600> you're<00:02:43.720> really

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
every other key now if you're really

reds and you can see that the typing
noise<00:04:14.760> isn't<00:04:15.760> really<00:04:16.090> as<00:04:16.239> loud<00:04:16.570> as<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.900> blues

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
noise isn't really as loud as the blues

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
else it's still going to be just a bit

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.650 
else it's still going to be just a bit
loud<00:04:24.669> so<00:04:25.210> i<00:04:25.919> hope<00:04:26.919> you<00:04:26.949> have<00:04:27.789> enjoyed<00:04:28.180> watching
