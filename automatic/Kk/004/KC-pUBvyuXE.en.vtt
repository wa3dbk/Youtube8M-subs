we've<00:00:11.750> been<00:00:11.930> using<00:00:12.080> tablet<00:00:12.530> PCs<00:00:13.099> and

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
we've been using tablet PCs and

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.179 
we've been using tablet PCs and
field-based<00:00:13.610> classes<00:00:14.389> since<00:00:14.690> 2004<00:00:15.680> when

an HD technology for teaching award we

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.130 
an HD technology for teaching award we
got

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
got

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.080 
got
a<00:00:25.170> blitz<00:00:25.470> since<00:00:26.369> then<00:00:26.550> we've<00:00:26.730> been<00:00:26.880> using

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
a blitz since then we've been using

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.020 
a blitz since then we've been using
tablets<00:00:27.960> in

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.030 
tablets in

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.780 
tablets in
base<00:00:29.210> classes<00:00:29.750> I<00:00:30.280> think<00:00:31.280> anything<00:00:31.610> that<00:00:31.640> gets

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
base classes I think anything that gets

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.460 
base classes I think anything that gets
you<00:00:31.940> out<00:00:32.000> in<00:00:32.150> the<00:00:32.210> field<00:00:32.240> there's<00:00:32.780> great<00:00:32.990> as

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
you out in the field there's great as

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.720 
you out in the field there's great as
opposed<00:00:33.800> to<00:00:33.860> being<00:00:34.010> in<00:00:34.100> the<00:00:34.130> classroom<00:00:34.280> you

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
opposed to being in the classroom you

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.300 
opposed to being in the classroom you
know<00:00:34.850> it<00:00:35.810> is<00:00:36.230> kind<00:00:36.350> of<00:00:36.470> ironic<00:00:36.560> that<00:00:36.950> we<00:00:37.070> spend

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:37.310 
know it is kind of ironic that we spend

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.880 
know it is kind of ironic that we spend
so<00:00:37.430> much<00:00:37.550> time<00:00:37.610> in<00:00:38.060> classes<00:00:38.660> when<00:00:39.440> you<00:00:39.770> know

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
so much time in classes when you know

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.200 
so much time in classes when you know
even<00:00:40.070> when<00:00:40.190> we<00:00:40.280> take<00:00:40.400> environmental<00:00:40.670> studies

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
even when we take environmental studies

very<00:02:02.530> much<00:02:02.710> more<00:02:02.920> sophisticated<00:02:03.130> than<00:02:03.670> they

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
very much more sophisticated than they

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.380 
very much more sophisticated than they
were<00:02:04.350> centuries<00:02:05.350> ago<00:02:05.380> and<00:02:05.910> we<00:02:06.910> try<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.120> keep

the<00:02:07.900> full<00:02:08.200> range<00:02:08.500> of<00:02:09.060> sophisticated<00:02:10.060> tools<00:02:10.960> in

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
the full range of sophisticated tools in

the full range of sophisticated tools in
the<00:02:11.410> hands<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.770> our<00:02:11.860> students<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.840> tablet

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
the hands of our students so the tablet

actually application for all the fury
and<00:02:23.500> information<00:02:24.100> that<00:02:24.220> we<00:02:24.340> learn<00:02:24.550> in<00:02:24.850> a

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
and information that we learn in a

and information that we learn in a
setting<00:02:25.240> right<00:02:25.330> master<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:25.990> love<00:02:26.710> being

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
setting right master I love being

setting right master I love being
outside<00:02:27.250> I<00:02:28.590> mean<00:02:29.590> if<00:02:29.770> you<00:02:29.980> can<00:02:30.130> find<00:02:30.280> any

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
outside I mean if you can find any

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.390 
outside I mean if you can find any
excuse<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:30.970> get<00:02:31.150> outside<00:02:31.540> I<00:02:31.600> say<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.590> use<00:02:33.250> the

excuse to get outside I say you use the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.900 
excuse to get outside I say you use the
tablet<00:02:33.640> so<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.600> get<00:02:34.720> there

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910
