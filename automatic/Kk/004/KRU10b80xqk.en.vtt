this<00:01:16.869> time<00:01:16.930> frame<00:01:17.619> is<00:01:17.770> absolutely<00:01:18.579> messed<00:01:19.030> up

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
this time frame is absolutely messed up

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.850 
this time frame is absolutely messed up
completely<00:01:20.200> messed<00:01:20.439> up<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:22.470> I'm<00:01:23.470> gonna<00:01:23.619> try

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
completely messed up so I'm gonna try

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.980 
completely messed up so I'm gonna try
and<00:01:23.920> build<00:01:24.460> a<00:01:24.729> decent<00:01:25.240> distance<00:01:25.479> away

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.240 

probably<00:01:28.990> one<00:01:29.350> of<00:01:29.380> these<00:01:29.530> they<00:01:29.950> don't<00:01:30.100> really

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
probably one of these they don't really

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.020 
probably one of these they don't really
matter

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.340 

later<00:01:37.030> I<00:01:37.240> guess<00:01:39.330> and<00:01:40.330> since<00:01:40.780> this<00:01:40.900> isn't<00:01:41.110> all

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
later I guess and since this isn't all

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.030 
later I guess and since this isn't all
lame<00:01:41.530> you<00:01:41.680> don't<00:01:41.860> really<00:01:42.160> need<00:01:42.370> a<00:01:43.410> nerd<00:01:44.410> you
