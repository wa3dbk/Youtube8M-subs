00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.519
 on the fifth night of the fair 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.670
 Tamaulipas band traca losa de monterrey 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.230
 filled the village theater thousands of 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.210
 followers gathered for 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.240
 interpret their themes that have 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.630
 positioned in important lists of 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.630
 popularity 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.090
 d 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.519
 do not 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.519
 now 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.650
 to me 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.719
 at a press conference the vocalist and 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.320
 director of the band edwin luna mentioned 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:03.710
 feel happy to have more than 50 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.409
 million visits with his drunk subject 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.970
 of love good father today I saw the 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.580
 publication that made the office of make 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.229
 music for having exceeded 50 million and 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.490
 that's good because I think it's a song 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.100
 that will continue adding and adding and 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.350
 adding a very good theme and that people 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.610
 he has identified enough with him 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.380
 they mentioned that they are preparing for 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.280
 his presentation in the monterrey arena 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.770
 this November 29 in the war event 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.100
 of bands where they will share the stage 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.630
 with bata xerez and sacred earth band I 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.190
 I think the simple fact that it's from 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.690
 monterrey people turn to see no 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.270
 because the first band that comes out of 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.369
 monterrey with a disc with this theme to 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.590
 national and international level but what 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.209
 difference then the style I think 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.789
 of simply having a low current 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:48.730
 sex to make a band the most 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.300
 the soloists 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.790
 they handle the big northern but a band 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.780
 of if they had not managed as such 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.490
 part of the style that we have wanted 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.550
 give that it's a little different to handle 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.350
 real issues maybe a little bit 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.550
 strong for people a kind of 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.950
 musical arrangements also a little bit 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.960
 different than even at the beginning this one 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.850
 it was a little bit complicated that people 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.610
 will not accept the people where the band 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.320
 Guadalajara of Sinaloa from those directions 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.240
 they said today this band is leaving 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.820
 totally the context that is band no 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.410
 It sounds to us as a band but people the 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.650
 public what is accepted I think that what 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.430
 it has helped us to add 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.430
 popularity 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.890
 i 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.890
 living 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.080
 yes the truth yes yes what happens is that 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.540
 when we recorded the I imagine the devil 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.460
 We had doubts that people would accept it 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.650
 because we did not want to interpret has 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.840
 happened and on the other hand they wanted 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.030
 censor him even though he does not talk about 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.680
 no violence and that's thanks I do not 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.110
 censored precisely for the same reason 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.030
 We do not need anything, I think it's 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.680
 how is a surreal story like 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.200
 any movie anything you 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.970
 you see that talk like demons or things 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.400
 those not us what we know how to do 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.050
 music and we liked this run and so 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.790
 good since the people accepted it we have 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.500
 I have been asking for more of this 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.000
 then we have been looking 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.260
 theme I think the next album 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.840
 should come something like that and to be able to 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.360
 send Carlos to Victoria City and 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.490
 I want to emphasize that there is a total 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.110
 the tamaulipas fair we follow 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.330
 inviting them to come and enjoy 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.820
 the great artists who perform in 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.530
 this fairground and send until 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.540
 us playing 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.090
 followed that has had along that 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.480
 small time it should be stressed that in a 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.550
 of the most bands 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.740
 from Monterrey 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.810
 for a good way to ham black 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.350
 take to the plate names new lion or 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.350

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.010
