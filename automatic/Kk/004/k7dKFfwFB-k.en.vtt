okay<00:00:02.070> in<00:00:02.190> this<00:00:02.250> tutorial<00:00:02.490> we'll<00:00:02.970> be<00:00:03.149> adding<00:00:03.899> a

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
okay in this tutorial we'll be adding a

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.710 
okay in this tutorial we'll be adding a
punto<00:00:04.710> database<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.460> system<00:00:05.790> and<00:00:06.000> signing

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
punto database to the system and signing

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.980 
punto database to the system and signing
it<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.319> button<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.510> you'll<00:00:09.510> notice<00:00:09.660> where

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
it to a button and you'll notice where

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.419 
it to a button and you'll notice where
you<00:00:10.110> install<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.800> software<00:00:10.950> there's<00:00:11.400> a

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
you install the software there's a

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.629 
you install the software there's a
folder<00:00:11.610> called<00:00:11.849> databases<00:00:13.009> inside<00:00:14.009> there<00:00:14.309> you

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
folder called databases inside there you

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.240 
folder called databases inside there you
can<00:00:14.820> place<00:00:15.089> your<00:00:15.420> backed<00:00:15.960> up<00:00:16.199> pronto<00:00:16.590> database

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
can place your backed up pronto database

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.840 
can place your backed up pronto database
in<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:17.640> case<00:00:17.820> I've<00:00:18.000> got<00:00:18.180> for<00:00:18.449> databases<00:00:19.170> here

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
in this case I've got for databases here

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.519 
in this case I've got for databases here
and<00:00:20.850> then<00:00:21.150> within<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.570> software<00:00:21.750> if<00:00:22.350> you

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
and then within the software if you

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.870 
and then within the software if you
choose<00:00:22.890> any<00:00:23.310> device<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.750> go<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.880> predefined

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
choose any device and go to predefined

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.859 
choose any device and go to predefined
commands<00:00:27.980> it<00:00:28.980> lists<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.550> databases<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:30.810> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
commands it lists the databases on the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.580 
commands it lists the databases on the
left<00:00:31.109> hand<00:00:31.260> side<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.880> can<00:00:32.880> open<00:00:33.120> up<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.590> folders

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
left hand side I can open up the folders

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.479 
left hand side I can open up the folders
and<00:00:34.829> navigate<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.120> particular<00:00:37.100> device<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
and navigate to a particular device and

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.360 
and navigate to a particular device and
here<00:00:39.480> we<00:00:39.570> can<00:00:39.660> see<00:00:39.870> all<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.079> individual<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.160> our
