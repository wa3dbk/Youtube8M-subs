00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
natural scent in it and you can increase

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.760 
natural scent in it and you can increase
that<00:00:16.740> by<00:00:16.949> puncture<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.260> that<00:00:19.260> gets<00:00:19.590> out

stiff<00:02:03.390> mix<00:02:04.880> some<00:02:05.880> not<00:02:06.539> going<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.780> overdo<00:02:07.079> it

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
stiff mix some not going to overdo it

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:13.759 
stiff mix some not going to overdo it
straightaway<00:02:09.110> right<00:02:10.110> that's<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.470> bit<00:02:10.590> dry

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:19.910 

bit<00:02:14.769> more<00:02:14.950> water<00:02:15.190> now<00:02:15.569> if<00:02:16.569> I<00:02:16.690> was<00:02:16.870> doing<00:02:17.019> this

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.289 

when<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:20.950> know<00:02:21.099> there's<00:02:21.459> a<00:02:21.549> huge<00:02:21.760> amount<00:02:22.120> of

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
when I know there's a huge amount of

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.930 
when I know there's a huge amount of
prey<00:02:22.540> fish<00:02:22.780> about<00:02:23.140> I'd<00:02:23.950> probably<00:02:24.250> put<00:02:24.549> in<00:02:24.700> some

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
prey fish about I'd probably put in some

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.369 
prey fish about I'd probably put in some
mix<00:02:25.180> particles<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.959> bit<00:02:26.170> of<00:02:26.290> hemp<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:28.379> because

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
mix particles a bit of hemp and because

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.380 
mix particles a bit of hemp and because
it's<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.160> good<00:02:30.340> idea<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.849> draw<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.120> prey

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
it's a good idea to draw the prey

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.210 
it's a good idea to draw the prey
fishing<00:02:31.810> as<00:02:32.019> well<00:02:32.080> because<00:02:32.620> obviously<00:02:32.799> they

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
fishing as well because obviously they

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.339 
fishing as well because obviously they
will<00:02:33.400> attract<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.540> attention<00:02:34.959> of<00:02:35.049> the<00:02:35.110> pike

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
will attract the attention of the pike

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.360 
will attract the attention of the pike
and<00:02:38.349> the<00:02:38.500> reason<00:02:38.799> I'm<00:02:38.860> trying<00:02:39.099> to<00:02:39.190> get<00:02:39.280> it

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
and the reason I'm trying to get it

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.770 
and the reason I'm trying to get it
quite<00:02:39.579> stiff<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.060> that<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.390> way<00:02:40.480> I'm<00:02:40.599> going<00:02:40.750> to

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
quite stiff is that the way I'm going to

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.940 
quite stiff is that the way I'm going to
put<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.019> into<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.349> swim<00:02:41.590> is<00:02:41.739> with<00:02:41.920> a

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
put it into the swim is with a

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.220 
put it into the swim is with a
groundbait<00:02:42.670> catty<00:02:45.569> right<00:02:46.569> that's<00:02:46.810> feeling

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
groundbait catty right that's feeling

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.119 
groundbait catty right that's feeling
quite<00:02:47.410> good<00:02:48.870> now<00:02:49.870> that's<00:02:50.319> a<00:02:50.440> really<00:02:50.650> sticky

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
quite good now that's a really sticky

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.319 
quite good now that's a really sticky
method<00:02:51.579> mix<00:02:53.069> that's<00:02:54.069> going<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.280> really<00:02:54.910> go<00:02:55.150> out

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
method mix that's going to really go out

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.940 
method mix that's going to really go out
as<00:02:55.660> far<00:02:55.900> as<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:56.049> want<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:56.379> go<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.530> probably<00:02:56.799> be

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
as far as I want it to go I probably be

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.119 
as far as I want it to go I probably be
able<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.129> fire<00:02:57.400> those<00:02:57.609> balls<00:02:57.910> 40<00:02:58.359> yards<00:02:58.660> and

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
able to fire those balls 40 yards and

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.309 
able to fire those balls 40 yards and
they'll<00:03:00.129> land<00:03:00.310> on<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.549> bottom<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:02.140> what's

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
they'll land on the bottom and what's

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.569 
they'll land on the bottom and what's
going<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.470> happen<00:03:02.769> is<00:03:02.890> all<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.069> prey<00:03:03.310> fish

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
going to happen is all the prey fish

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:04.830 
going to happen is all the prey fish
will<00:03:03.730> come<00:03:03.910> in<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.269> they'll<00:03:04.390> start<00:03:04.599> pecking

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
will come in and they'll start pecking

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.849 
will come in and they'll start pecking
away<00:03:05.280> setting<00:03:06.280> up<00:03:06.370> a<00:03:06.459> big<00:03:06.640> cloud<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.590> big<00:03:08.590> cloud

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
away setting up a big cloud a big cloud

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.190 
away setting up a big cloud a big cloud
around<00:03:09.040> it<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.640> then<00:03:09.849> the<00:03:10.569> currents<00:03:10.989> in<00:03:11.079> the

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
around it and then the currents in the

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.930 
around it and then the currents in the
lake<00:03:11.379> will<00:03:11.680> pick<00:03:11.829> up<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.129> scent<00:03:12.310> trail<00:03:12.640> and

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
lake will pick up the scent trail and

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.979 
lake will pick up the scent trail and
take<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.049> central<00:03:14.470> away<00:03:15.420> from<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.569> bait<00:03:16.750> and

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
take the central away from the bait and

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.009 
take the central away from the bait and
the<00:03:17.049> pipe<00:03:17.230> will<00:03:17.440> home<00:03:17.620> in<00:03:17.769> on<00:03:17.889> this<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.840> by<00:03:19.989> the

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
the pipe will home in on this and by the

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.449 
the pipe will home in on this and by the
time<00:03:20.290> they<00:03:20.440> come<00:03:20.620> in<00:03:20.799> hopefully<00:03:21.010> this<00:03:21.340> is

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
time they come in hopefully this is

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.370 
time they come in hopefully this is
broken<00:03:21.700> down<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.269> there's<00:03:22.419> a<00:03:22.480> few<00:03:22.720> chunks<00:03:23.230> of

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
broken down and there's a few chunks of

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.460 
broken down and there's a few chunks of
fish<00:03:23.709> on<00:03:23.919> the<00:03:24.040> bottom<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.840> prize<00:03:26.109> fish<00:03:26.319> will

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
fish on the bottom the prize fish will

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.020 
fish on the bottom the prize fish will
see<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.769> pike<00:03:26.980> coming<00:03:27.370> they'll<00:03:27.549> get<00:03:27.730> out<00:03:27.760> of

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
see the pike coming they'll get out of

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.870 
see the pike coming they'll get out of
the<00:03:28.150> way<00:03:28.299> and<00:03:28.660> what's<00:03:28.870> left<00:03:29.250> is<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.310> big<00:03:30.609> smelly

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.699 
the way and what's left is a big smelly
pilot<00:03:31.359> bay<00:03:31.510> with<00:03:31.720> some<00:03:31.840> nice<00:03:32.049> tasty<00:03:32.380> little

chunks<00:03:33.190> of<00:03:33.310> fish<00:03:33.910> in<00:03:34.060> it<00:03:34.209> and<00:03:36.030> believe<00:03:37.030> me<00:03:37.209> I

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
chunks of fish in it and believe me I

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.420 
chunks of fish in it and believe me I
know<00:03:37.359> this<00:03:37.630> work<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.410> pike<00:03:38.919> will<00:03:39.160> start

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
know this work the pike will start

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.370 
know this work the pike will start
picking<00:03:39.579> these<00:03:39.910> up<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.359> I<00:03:40.870> know<00:03:40.930> this<00:03:41.200> is<00:03:41.349> a

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
picking these up and I know this is a

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.140 
picking these up and I know this is a
fact<00:03:41.650> because<00:03:41.859> when<00:03:42.130> I've<00:03:42.250> caught<00:03:42.459> pike<00:03:42.730> over

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
fact because when I've caught pike over

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.390 
fact because when I've caught pike over
this<00:03:43.239> bait<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:44.290> back<00:03:44.470> of<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.680> throat<00:03:44.950> is<00:03:45.130> full

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
this bait the back of the throat is full

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.159 
this bait the back of the throat is full
of<00:03:45.519> all<00:03:45.639> these<00:03:45.819> chunks<00:03:46.329> so<00:03:48.690> all<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:49.840> need<00:03:49.989> to

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
of all these chunks so all you need to

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.349 
of all these chunks so all you need to
do<00:03:50.319> is<00:03:50.560> just<00:03:50.799> cast<00:03:51.040> your<00:03:51.340> regular<00:03:51.940> dead<00:03:52.120> bait

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
do is just cast your regular dead bait

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:53.970 
do is just cast your regular dead bait
into<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:53.019> area<00:03:53.349> where<00:03:53.560> you<00:03:53.680> put<00:03:53.889> your

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
into the area where you put your

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.390 
into the area where you put your
groundbait<00:03:54.450> but<00:03:55.650> because<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.769> pie<00:03:56.950> get<00:03:57.190> used

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
groundbait but because the pie get used

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.009 
groundbait but because the pie get used
to<00:03:57.519> picking<00:03:57.790> up<00:03:57.849> these<00:03:58.060> little<00:03:58.599> bits<00:03:58.900> and

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
to picking up these little bits and

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.729 
to picking up these little bits and
pieces<00:03:59.609> I'll<00:04:00.609> often<00:04:00.849> just<00:04:01.030> fish<00:04:01.389> on<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.709> hook

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
pieces I'll often just fish on the hook

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.030 
pieces I'll often just fish on the hook
a<00:04:03.160> little<00:04:03.760> chunk<00:04:04.150> of<00:04:04.299> bait<00:04:04.530> I'll<00:04:05.530> probably

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
a little chunk of bait I'll probably

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.409 
a little chunk of bait I'll probably
float<00:04:06.370> fish<00:04:06.609> it<00:04:06.760> for<00:04:07.690> sensitivity<00:04:09.030> or<00:04:10.030> I<00:04:10.090> might

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
float fish it for sensitivity or I might

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.809 
float fish it for sensitivity or I might
use<00:04:10.629> the<00:04:10.810> old<00:04:10.959> kebab<00:04:11.290> rig<00:04:11.560> which<00:04:11.769> is<00:04:11.919> basically

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
use the old kebab rig which is basically

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.560 
use the old kebab rig which is basically
just<00:04:12.970> multiple<00:04:13.569> chunks<00:04:13.930> of<00:04:14.079> bait<00:04:14.260> on<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:15.280> hook

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
just multiple chunks of bait on the hook

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.509 
just multiple chunks of bait on the hook
so<00:04:16.570> so<00:04:17.349> that's<00:04:17.500> ground<00:04:17.829> baiting<00:04:18.220> for<00:04:18.250> pike

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
so so that's ground baiting for pike

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.959 
so so that's ground baiting for pike

doesn't<00:04:25.419> work<00:04:25.659> so<00:04:25.840> good<00:04:25.930> when<00:04:26.110> it's<00:04:26.229> true

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
doesn't work so good when it's true

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.970 
doesn't work so good when it's true
cold<00:04:26.770> as<00:04:26.889> it<00:04:27.010> is<00:04:27.040> today<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:28.470> if<00:04:29.470> you<00:04:29.620> do<00:04:29.740> get<00:04:29.950> a

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
cold as it is today and if you do get a

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.890 
cold as it is today and if you do get a
bite<00:04:30.220> if<00:04:30.400> your<00:04:30.520> flow<00:04:30.700> goes<00:04:31.000> strike<00:04:31.570> pretty

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
bite if your flow goes strike pretty

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.660 
bite if your flow goes strike pretty
quick<00:04:32.200> because<00:04:32.560> once<00:04:33.040> they<00:04:33.190> go<00:04:33.340> into<00:04:33.550> these

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
quick because once they go into these

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.440 
quick because once they go into these
chunks<00:04:34.150> they'll<00:04:34.810> start<00:04:35.110> bolting<00:04:35.350> them<00:04:35.590> down

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
chunks they'll start bolting them down

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.580 
chunks they'll start bolting them down
so<00:04:37.450> I'll<00:04:37.510> give<00:04:37.690> it<00:04:37.780> a<00:04:37.840> try<00:04:37.990> I<00:04:38.080> think<00:04:38.380> you'll<00:04:38.470> be

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590

so I'll give it a try I think you'll be
quite<00:04:38.800> surprised<00:04:39.220> how<00:04:39.669> effective<00:04:39.820> it<00:04:40.240> can<00:04:40.360> be
