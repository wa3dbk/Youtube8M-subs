 in a few minutes the system your pc 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.010
 then how is it wrong if you 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.140
 I would solve it but there is your something because 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.140
 many people have done this 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:27.680
 this is what I am doing this error 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.910
 another mistake that I do not know for example from 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.160
 installed program good as has 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.690
 I decide to do this is wrong 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.180
 because this worked for this error 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.640
 but when updating it does not work for another 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.740
 error so he warned because I do not want 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.340
 nothing else cryptic line like that 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.100
 a position would have in its standard role and 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.990
 they could even play but you will have to 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.970
 be all right and this may have 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.560
 liked the video I promise your videos more 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.640
