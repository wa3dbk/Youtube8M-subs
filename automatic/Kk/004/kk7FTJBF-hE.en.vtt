00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
but you know the one issue I've had with

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.259 
but you know the one issue I've had with
the<00:00:41.640> Dell<00:00:41.850> has<00:00:42.239> been<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:43.050> pen<00:00:43.640> so<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.879> you

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
the Dell has been the pen so that you

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:47.060 
the Dell has been the pen so that you
they<00:00:45.540> have<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.900> availability<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.620> what<00:00:46.979> they

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
they have the availability of what they

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.390 
they have the availability of what they
call<00:00:47.250> an<00:00:47.400> active<00:00:47.809> capacitive<00:00:48.809> stylus<00:00:49.280> what<00:00:50.280> it

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
call an active capacitive stylus what it

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.979 
call an active capacitive stylus what it
actually<00:00:50.610> does<00:00:50.909> is<00:00:50.970> break<00:00:51.330> the<00:00:51.479> magnetic

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
actually does is break the magnetic

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.840 
actually does is break the magnetic
field<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> capacitive<00:00:53.190> screen<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.699> way

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
field of the capacitive screen in a way

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.240 
field of the capacitive screen in a way
that<00:00:54.150> makes<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.870> much<00:00:55.049> more<00:00:55.290> like<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> digitizer

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
that makes it much more like a digitizer

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.660 
that makes it much more like a digitizer
or<00:00:56.460> that's<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.690> goal<00:00:57.900> of<00:00:58.110> it<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:59.040> the<00:00:59.400> past

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
or that's the the goal of it in the past

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.890 
or that's the the goal of it in the past
when<00:01:00.510> I've<00:01:00.690> written<00:01:01.589> however<00:01:02.220> it<00:01:02.699> often<00:01:03.690> times

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
when I've written however it often times

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.070 
when I've written however it often times
would<00:01:04.199> leave<00:01:04.530> artifacts<00:01:05.369> as<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.790> neared<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
would leave artifacts as I neared the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.510 
would leave artifacts as I neared the
interface<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.750> just<00:01:09.750> applied<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.399> like<00:01:11.399> I

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
interface but just applied the like I

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.539 
interface but just applied the like I
said<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.850> a4<00:01:12.479> BIOS<00:01:13.469> I<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:14.070> all<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.399> other

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
said the a4 BIOS I have all the other

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.789 
said the a4 BIOS I have all the other
updates<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.420> place<00:01:15.840> I'll<00:01:16.109> post<00:01:16.409> links<00:01:16.770> to

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
updates in place I'll post links to

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.990 
updates in place I'll post links to

start a writing this is me writing on my

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.889 
start a writing this is me writing on my
machine<00:01:41.420> no<00:01:42.420> accounting<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:44.270> my<00:01:45.270> penmanship

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899

I will tell you one little trick I saw
when<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.899> first<00:01:49.159> fired<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.340> up<00:01:50.460> everything

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
when I first fired it up everything

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.090 
when I first fired it up everything
worked<00:01:51.479> great<00:01:51.810> second<00:01:52.380> time<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.560> went<00:01:52.859> after

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
worked great second time I went after

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.550 
worked great second time I went after
having<00:01:53.609> already<00:01:53.909> used<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.600> started<00:01:55.409> having

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
having already used it I started having

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.529 
having already used it I started having
some<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.069> artifacting<00:01:56.789> again<00:01:56.999> I<00:01:57.210> actually

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
some of the artifacting again I actually

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.160 
some of the artifacting again I actually
clicked<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.549> back<00:01:59.549> part<00:01:59.999> and<00:02:00.659> then<00:02:00.780> started

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
clicked this back part and then started

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.330 
clicked this back part and then started
writing<00:02:01.530> again<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.130> no<00:02:03.060> issue<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:04.069> it<00:02:05.069> does

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
writing again and no issue so it does

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.940 
writing again and no issue so it does
appear<00:02:05.639> to<00:02:05.759> have<00:02:05.880> fixed<00:02:06.569> that<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.200> also<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
appear to have fixed that I also the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.460 
appear to have fixed that I also the
other<00:02:08.100> thing<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.490> I've<00:02:08.789> noticed<00:02:09.319> since<00:02:10.319> I

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
other thing that I've noticed since I

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.100 
other thing that I've noticed since I
fired<00:02:10.740> it<00:02:10.950> up<00:02:11.100> is<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.610> typing<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.360> was<00:02:12.810> getting

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
fired it up is in typing I was getting

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.530 
fired it up is in typing I was getting
some<00:02:13.410> multiple<00:02:13.980> letters<00:02:14.299> previously<00:02:15.299> after

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
some multiple letters previously after

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.770 
some multiple letters previously after
the<00:02:16.379> a3<00:02:17.040> update<00:02:17.580> which<00:02:17.970> was<00:02:18.150> attempted

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
the a3 update which was attempted

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.330 
the a3 update which was attempted
correct<00:02:19.049> some<00:02:19.230> things

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
correct some things

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.660 
correct some things
that<00:02:20.850> seemed<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.420> have<00:02:21.510> gone<00:02:21.720> away<00:02:21.930> so

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
that seemed to have gone away so

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.970 
that seemed to have gone away so
performance<00:02:23.670> much<00:02:24.000> smoother<00:02:24.600> on<00:02:24.810> my<00:02:25.200> favorite

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
performance much smoother on my favorite

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.550 
performance much smoother on my favorite
machine<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:27.120> Dell<00:02:27.330> Venue<00:02:27.360> 8<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:28.200> can<00:02:28.350> pick
