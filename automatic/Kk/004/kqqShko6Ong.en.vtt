00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.310
 hi friends now we are here with the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.290
 damn lasers mission and this mission is 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.820
 by madínzo is one of the new 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.010
 let's say that of the two new missions 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.050
 that they just put just a few ago 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.580
 days and then this mission is about 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.579
 basically going to destroy some 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.829
 planes then here only you 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:22.169
 can with two people we have to get on 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:23.519
 let's say here one laser and the other 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.380
 person the other friend who is 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.929
 helping then it will go up to the other 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.640
 laser and here we are going to divide one is 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.229
 will go to the city and bring down the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.210
 planes that are around the city 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:35.430
 here on the left and the other person 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.830
 that in this case I'm going to do, I'm going to 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.710
 direct to the right to shoot down the plane 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.180
 that is here in the mountains 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.000
 let's say it's an easy mission is a 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.500
 simple mission compared to the other 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.590
 chop chop new controlled mission 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.260
 that is that mission if it is difficult is 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.390
 is let's say in a degree of difficulty 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.500
 much smaller here nothing else is basically 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.870
 identify where the enemies are 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.790
 first enemy is here 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.670
 approximate let's say to have it 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.500
 in front of him shoot two missiles and with 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.920
 that's enough however to do 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.450
 shoot a third because there are times that 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.280
 does not impart the second very well or the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.770
 first that we win when the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.930
 distance from the plane was greater sometimes 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.820
 very impact and is nothing more and 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.830
 in the smoke and then we have to launch 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.280
 a third missile here we already saw that 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.840
 we have another one on the right we're going to turn 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.400
 let's turn to have it at two in 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.520
 point and when we have them at twelve in 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.380
 social point we shot two missiles and 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.570
 if possible we raise a third to 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.509
 make sure we're here and we're heading towards 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.050
 another one that we have here we have it as a 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.050
 the 11 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.710
 already with all a good military language 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.750
 here we have it at one to two what 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.510
 we have two then we are going to 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.520
 direct us to make a turn here to the 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.890
 right and be able to locate the two in 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.260
 point and being able to knock it down we're going to be 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.660
 anointed we have more rp e 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.070
 we increase the level of that is good and 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.470
 let's make the equipment to have it 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.270
 in front and here we have it in front 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.430
 now let's wait for it to appear 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.050
 a red let's say our radar so that 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.120
 I want it and that's where I've given it and 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.400
 let's go we shoot him two and we're going to 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.870
 hold to shoot a third in 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.340
 third and we go the path 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.500
 because if there's no we were also 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.700
 with the remains of the plane now nothing 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.370
 there are two more left, we have to wait 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.380
 our friend knocks down those two who are 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.910
 they find in the city ​​and once they 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.830
 knock down those who are in the 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.020
 city then you have to retrace bullfighting course 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.430
 essen airport now that 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.810
 find here because there they will appear 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.790
 some helicopters 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.100
 let's say that here the fun is not yet 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.420
 ends here tells us martina grasso that 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.460
 then you have to shoot down others 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.990
 helicopters that appear on the map and 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.240
 Well, you have to start walking to 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.940
 knock them down we started with this first 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.920
 we launch the missiles if it does not impact or 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.300
 we are going to continue on track 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.520
 to bring down those who are 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.530
 go ahead to see them face to face 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.450
 we grabbed it in front of this one he shot 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.700
 two missiles to this century with its impact 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.650
 let's see another one that we have here not 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.690
 there was nothing already my friend francisco knocks down 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.070
 the two that we had here let's say 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.860
 then we must return to 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.450
 impact the one that remains and only 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.760
 we need one 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.290
 let's say the one here and this 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.180
 nothing else becomes a little complicated 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.739
 let's say when a helicopter hits 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.110
 when when we are two people 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.670
 close because as it is what the 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.680
 helicopter flip side boat 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.230
 towards the other and as it takes 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.730
 trajectories so that we are not seeing 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.980
 here he shot two and both the 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.750
 primers before is let's say this 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.330
 suddenly frustrating that the two 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.760
 Well, the Chihuahua mode has been 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.190
 to go back again to get away and take 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.650
 a trajectory towards him there like that 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.450
 is impacting us tornado here where 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.250
 It is where militancy is said 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.110
 students but let's say that nothing else is 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.640
 if they run with the luck of knocking it down 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.370
 The principle of cepes is no longer complicated by 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.900
 if they are left with the bad luck of 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.940
 just keep one until the end 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.319
 is when you can complicate a bit 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.819
 but there is nothing else that is going to 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.849
 lengthen the mission in what they are 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.319
 let's say here taking trajectories for 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.750
 knock down the last the director what 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.549
 is missing because already knocking down this because 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.799
 the mission is finished practically let's say 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.260
 that we derive this helicopter and nothing 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.480
 more we have to land the lasers and 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
 the francisco mission is already over 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.570
 beautiful 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.910
 already francisco our friend knocked down this 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.250
 already knocked it down and then we're going to 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.630
 land let's do it here at half 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.870
 track to see if we have not put us 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.790
 we crash before a pretty landing 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.650
 bad and everyone bouncing with ball but 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.710
 Well, we 're going to land this laser 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.800
 we're headed here does this part 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.229
 and then we have finished the mission 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.030
 is mission I did not have it either until 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.949
 that a friend of mine was playing vi 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.320
 what was he playing he threw a 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:47.600
 invitation and I got this friend who got 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.699
 called infra my friend infra was the one who 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.100
 I pass it because I did not have it then 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.410
 Well, thanks to her I got her 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.419
 this mission and already play it well 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.340
 friends this was the mission of damn 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.340
 laser bye goodbye 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.189
 and good
