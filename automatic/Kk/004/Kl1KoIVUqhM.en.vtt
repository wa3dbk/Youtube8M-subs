00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.580
 hello friends and youtube subscribers to 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.310
 then I bring you some tricks and 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.100
 magic tips and this time they 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.250
 I will teach other ways to make the 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:16.129
 False cut well the first false cut 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.429
 it will be the next one we will take the deck 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:23.190
 with the right hand in this way and what 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:25.550
 What we will do is raise a first heap 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.429
 and with the left hand 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.509
 we will take it between the index finger and the 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:34.490
 thumb okay now we will raise a 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.400
 second heap 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.470
 but at the time of raising the second 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.050
 what we will do with our hands 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.620
 left will hold the pile that 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.040
 we have with the ring and middle finger and the 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.040
 index finger 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.840
 we will climb it over that heap 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.480
 all right 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.270
 how can you see now what we will do 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.120
 will be going to take another bunch of the hand 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.190
 right but this time we will take 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.400
 the heap from the bottom 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.290
 and at the same time we will hold the heap 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.500
 that we have in the left hand 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.370
 thus 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.550
 all right 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.800
 then what we will do is turn the heap 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.420
 that we have over the hand 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.790
 right 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.680
 and finally we will place the last 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.680
 heap in this way 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.890
 let's do it one more time but 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.040
 we will put a letter over to see 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.650
 what happens well we will take the first 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.150
 bunch and we hold it by hand 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.090
 left in this way when 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.010
 let's pick up the second pile we carry the 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.220
 index finger to the top of the other 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.160
 heap 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.460
 we hold the pile of the bottom of the hand 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.760
 right and we leave the pile that we have 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.220
 in the left hand well now we turn 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.750
 this pile placing it to the side 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.370
 top and finally the last heap 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.960
 well that as you can see is a cut 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:12.770
 totally false the next cut or 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.500
 fake mix is used more when 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.630
 We need to always keep in mind the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.760
 letter from the viewer in this case 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.180
 we have the viewer's letter above 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.330
 of the deck and what we will do is take 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.610
 the mallet of this position and pull the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.180
 letters giving the impression that we are 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.480
 mixing if we mix all except 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.080
 of the viewer's letter again if 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.120
 we want to return the letter to first 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.540
 position what we have to do is what 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.519
 pull cards 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.439
 and when we are reaching the end what 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.439
 what we will do is peel one by one 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.240
 and again we have the letter from 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.240
 viewer in first position 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.710
 and finally I'll show you a cut 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.320
 false suppose we have the letter 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.500
 of the viewer in last position and 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.510
 we want to pretend we mix them 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.640
 carrying the mallet feed 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.640
 in this way well 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.569
 what happens is only that we will take 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.300
 letters before you get to the end of this 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:30.480
 way we can see that there are letters 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.620
 there but how we have it in this 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.620
 position is not noticeable 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.400
 and we will always have the letter from 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.650
 viewer in last good position 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.709
 friends I hope you serve them these tricks 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.840
