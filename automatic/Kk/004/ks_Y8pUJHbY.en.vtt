00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.800 
you this design of the package in here
you<00:00:17.250> can<00:00:17.400> see<00:00:17.550> while<00:00:17.760> we're<00:00:17.880> designed<00:00:18.270> written

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
you can see while we're designed written

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.019 
you can see while we're designed written
on<00:00:18.900> there<00:00:19.109> got<00:00:19.320> p8<00:00:19.619> on<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.949> top<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.369> kind<00:00:20.939> of

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
on there got p8 on the top I kind of

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.179 
on there got p8 on the top I kind of
reminds<00:00:21.390> me<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.689> Porsche<00:00:21.960> sort<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.890> design

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
reminds me of the Porsche sort of design

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
that you get with the blackberry p 881 I

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.460 
that you get with the blackberry p 881 I
think<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.029> but<00:00:27.599> never<00:00:27.779> mind<00:00:27.960> when<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.260> had<00:00:28.410> to

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
sides your volume rocker at your power

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.020 
sides your volume rocker at your power
button<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.680> your<00:01:55.890> SIM<00:01:56.100> card<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.579> your

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030

microSD<00:01:57.719> card<00:01:58.500> tray<00:01:59.159> as<00:01:59.399> well<00:01:59.790> let's<00:02:00.119> just

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
microSD card tray as well let's just

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.130 
microSD card tray as well let's just
power<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:00.810> quickly<00:02:02.329> so<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.540> runs<00:02:03.840> our

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
power this on quickly so this runs our

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.380 
power this on quickly so this runs our
64-bit<00:02:04.740> octa-core<00:02:04.829> processor<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:06.119> think

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
64-bit octa-core processor and I think

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.830 
64-bit octa-core processor and I think
they're<00:02:06.479> using<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.899> Kyrie<00:02:07.469> nor<00:02:07.799> ki-rin<00:02:08.160> 930

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
they're using the Kyrie nor ki-rin 930

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.479 
they're using the Kyrie nor ki-rin 930
processor<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:09.989> now<00:02:10.170> which<00:02:10.890> means<00:02:11.129> we<00:02:11.340> should

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
processor in now which means we should

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.240 
processor in now which means we should
get<00:02:11.580> snappy<00:02:12.030> response<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.720> should<00:02:12.900> be

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
get snappy response you should be

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.520 
get snappy response you should be
quick<00:02:13.520> when<00:02:14.150> you're<00:02:14.300> playing<00:02:14.480> game<00:02:14.750> when

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
quick when you're playing game when

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.870 
quick when you're playing game when
you're<00:02:15.650> watching<00:02:15.770> movies<00:02:16.310> whatever<00:02:16.610> you're

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
you're watching movies whatever you're

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.710 
you're watching movies whatever you're
doing<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:17.120> should<00:02:17.180> be<00:02:17.330> able<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.540> do<00:02:17.630> that

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
doing you should be able to do that

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.440 
doing you should be able to do that
pretty<00:02:18.590> snappy<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:19.190> quickly<00:02:19.760> as<00:02:19.820> well<00:02:20.000> still

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
pretty snappy and quickly as well still

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
pretty snappy and quickly as well still
powering<00:02:20.690> on<00:02:20.990> and<00:02:21.170> this<00:02:21.710> is<00:02:21.860> got<00:02:22.600> 2680<00:02:23.600> mah

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
powering on and this is got 2680 mah

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.900 
powering on and this is got 2680 mah
battery<00:02:24.950> so<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.250> battery<00:02:25.550> life<00:02:25.640> should<00:02:25.880> be

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
battery so the battery life should be

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.020 
battery so the battery life should be
good<00:02:26.090> as<00:02:26.240> well<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:26.630> with<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.170> new<00:02:27.200> big<00:02:27.590> little

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
good as well and with the new big little

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.010 
good as well and with the new big little
technology<00:02:29.030> in<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.150> processor<00:02:29.630> it<00:02:29.810> means

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
technology in the processor it means

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.750 
technology in the processor it means
that<00:02:30.230> it<00:02:30.350> should<00:02:30.500> manage<00:02:30.830> your<00:02:31.310> battery<00:02:31.730> life

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
that it should manage your battery life

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.910 
that it should manage your battery life
a<00:02:32.120> lot<00:02:32.300> better<00:02:32.360> than<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:33.380> would<00:02:33.500> normally<00:02:33.530> in

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
a lot better than you would normally in

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.820 
a lot better than you would normally in
the<00:02:33.980> old<00:02:34.130> version<00:02:34.970> as<00:02:35.240> well<00:02:35.270> so<00:02:36.260> let's<00:02:36.680> just

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
the old version as well so let's just

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.440 
the old version as well so let's just
wait<00:02:36.950> for<00:02:37.070> this<00:02:37.130> to<00:02:37.220> power<00:02:37.430> see<00:02:38.000> what<00:02:38.150> else<00:02:38.300> is

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
wait for this to power see what else is

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.560 
wait for this to power see what else is
