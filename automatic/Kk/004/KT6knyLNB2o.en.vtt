00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.339 
still kind of half-baked and I'm

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.009 
still kind of half-baked and I'm
recommending<00:00:39.550> to<00:00:39.999> a<00:00:40.120> lot<00:00:40.300> of<00:00:40.329> people<00:00:40.659> to<00:00:40.809> just

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
recommending to a lot of people to just

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.009 
recommending to a lot of people to just
wait<00:00:41.230> for<00:00:41.829> what<00:00:42.489> they<00:00:42.579> call<00:00:42.789> Service<00:00:43.420> Pack<00:00:43.690> 1

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
wait for what they call Service Pack 1

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.130 
wait for what they call Service Pack 1
and<00:00:44.589> a<00:00:45.219> service<00:00:45.550> pack<00:00:45.789> in<00:00:46.140> Microsoft's

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
and a service pack in Microsoft's

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.059 
and a service pack in Microsoft's
terminology<00:00:48.069> is<00:00:48.269> essentially<00:00:49.269> a<00:00:50.069> cavalcade

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:51.069 
terminology is essentially a cavalcade

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:54.270 
terminology is essentially a cavalcade
of<00:00:51.579> updates<00:00:52.420> whether<00:00:53.050> they're<00:00:53.289> security<00:00:53.859> or

gone<00:01:00.879> through<00:01:01.089> two<00:01:01.449> service<00:01:02.170> packs<00:01:02.440> although

gone through two service packs although
some<00:01:03.399> would<00:01:03.519> argue<00:01:03.549> that<00:01:03.819> there<00:01:04.059> should<00:01:04.420> have

Windows XP each service pack added a

Windows XP each service pack added a

the first year of vistas release and

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.139 
the first year of vistas release and
that's<00:01:38.170> really<00:01:38.530> what<00:01:38.829> led<00:01:39.490> me<00:01:39.729> to<00:01:40.000> believe

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
that's really what led me to believe

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.789

that<00:01:40.679> Vista<00:01:41.679> was<00:01:41.859> more<00:01:43.259> I'm<00:01:44.259> not<00:01:44.350> gonna<00:01:44.619> okay

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
that Vista was more I'm not gonna okay

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.880 
that Vista was more I'm not gonna okay
it<00:01:45.340> feels<00:01:45.700> more<00:01:45.939> like<00:01:46.000> beta<00:01:46.329> software<00:01:46.840> than<00:01:47.020> it

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
it feels more like beta software than it

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.550 
it feels more like beta software than it
should<00:01:48.249> be<00:01:48.429> and<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.659> fact<00:01:49.869> that<00:01:49.990> Microsoft's

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
should be and the fact that Microsoft's

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.200 
should be and the fact that Microsoft's

reference<00:04:12.970> to<00:04:13.030> it<00:04:13.240> at<00:04:13.330> the<00:04:13.420> end<00:04:13.540> of<00:04:13.570> the<00:04:13.660> video

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
reference to it at the end of the video

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.420 
reference to it at the end of the video
so<00:04:15.160> I<00:04:15.520> would<00:04:15.940> say<00:04:16.230> when<00:04:17.230> Microsoft<00:04:18.160> releases

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
so I would say when Microsoft releases

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.390 
so I would say when Microsoft releases
Vista<00:04:18.940> Service<00:04:19.210> Pack<00:04:19.390> 1<00:04:19.650> then<00:04:20.650> I<00:04:20.680> think<00:04:21.130> I

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
Vista Service Pack 1 then I think I

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.150 
Vista Service Pack 1 then I think I
would<00:04:21.549> be<00:04:21.820> more<00:04:22.440> confident<00:04:23.440> or<00:04:23.650> more<00:04:23.830> inclined

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
would be more confident or more inclined

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.800 
would be more confident or more inclined
to<00:04:24.340> recommend<00:04:24.760> that<00:04:24.850> people<00:04:25.150> get<00:04:25.300> Vista<00:04:25.690> over

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
to recommend that people get Vista over

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.220 
to recommend that people get Vista over
XP<00:04:26.380> a<00:04:26.590> lot<00:04:27.220> of<00:04:27.340> the<00:04:27.400> bugs<00:04:27.640> are<00:04:27.850> just<00:04:27.880> I<00:04:28.750> think

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
XP a lot of the bugs are just I think

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.890 
XP a lot of the bugs are just I think
just<00:04:29.590> detrimental<00:04:30.400> some<00:04:30.669> people<00:04:30.970> blame<00:04:31.210> third

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
just detrimental some people blame third

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.650 
just detrimental some people blame third
vendor's<00:04:32.380> I<00:04:32.889> just<00:04:33.759> think<00:04:33.970> that<00:04:34.120> there<00:04:34.330> wasn't

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
vendor's I just think that there wasn't

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.780 
vendor's I just think that there wasn't
a<00:04:34.690> lot<00:04:34.870> of<00:04:34.990> fit<00:04:35.199> and<00:04:35.229> finish<00:04:35.520> placed<00:04:36.520> on

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
a lot of fit and finish placed on

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.770 
a lot of fit and finish placed on
Windows<00:04:37.240> Vista<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.810> like<00:04:38.410> I<00:04:38.500> said<00:04:38.699> everything

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
Windows Vista and like I said everything

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.930 
Windows Vista and like I said everything
that's<00:04:40.780> happened<00:04:41.259> since<00:04:41.500> I've<00:04:41.830> you<00:04:42.460> know<00:04:42.580> come

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
that's happened since I've you know come

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.090 
that's happened since I've you know come
with<00:04:43.120> to<00:04:43.330> this<00:04:43.449> assessment<00:04:43.889> has<00:04:44.889> only

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
with to this assessment has only

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.770 
with to this assessment has only
strengthened<00:04:45.970> my<00:04:46.090> arguments

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
strengthened my arguments

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.620 
strengthened my arguments
so<00:04:47.410> yeah<00:04:48.130> when<00:04:48.520> service<00:04:48.820> pack<00:04:49.030> one<00:04:49.240> comes<00:04:49.449> out

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
so yeah when service pack one comes out

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.050 
so yeah when service pack one comes out
then<00:04:50.289> it's<00:04:50.470> a<00:04:50.530> good<00:04:50.680> time<00:04:50.919> to<00:04:50.949> likely<00:04:51.729> upgrade

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
then it's a good time to likely upgrade

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.600 
then it's a good time to likely upgrade
to<00:04:52.210> Windows<00:04:52.509> Vista<00:04:52.919> most<00:04:53.919> likely<00:04:54.280> they<00:04:54.400> will

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
to Windows Vista most likely they will

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.270 
to Windows Vista most likely they will
have<00:04:54.820> a<00:04:54.850> had<00:04:55.120> a<00:04:55.150> chance<00:04:55.509> to<00:04:55.780> flesh<00:04:56.199> out<00:04:56.440> the

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
have a had a chance to flesh out the

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.180 
have a had a chance to flesh out the
bugs<00:04:57.520> that<00:04:57.759> have<00:04:57.940> been<00:04:58.090> reported<00:04:58.479> over<00:04:59.190> months

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
bugs that have been reported over months

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.330 
bugs that have been reported over months

recorded<00:05:03.880> bugs<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:04.330> bugs<00:05:04.660> that<00:05:04.840> they<00:05:04.900> uncover

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
recorded bugs and bugs that they uncover

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.159 
recorded bugs and bugs that they uncover
Vista<00:05:06.639> will<00:05:06.760> be<00:05:06.880> a<00:05:06.910> better<00:05:07.240> operating<00:05:07.810> system

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
Vista will be a better operating system

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.740 
Vista will be a better operating system
I'm<00:05:08.289> sure<00:05:08.530> when<00:05:08.889> service<00:05:09.220> pack<00:05:09.400> 1<00:05:09.430> is<00:05:09.880> released

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
I'm sure when service pack 1 is released

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.110 
I'm sure when service pack 1 is released
