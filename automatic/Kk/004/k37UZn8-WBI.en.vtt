00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
to lay like a ruler across here so you

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:22.569 
to lay like a ruler across here so you
got<00:03:21.349> it<00:03:21.439> you<00:03:21.560> have<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.889> look<00:03:22.010> at<00:03:22.189> this<00:03:22.340> where

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
got it you have to look at this where

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.300

bit that way because my hand is now
ahead<00:05:21.480> of<00:05:21.600> it<00:05:21.780> I<00:05:21.930> never<00:05:22.440> I<00:05:22.500> always<00:05:22.860> want<00:05:23.070> to

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
ahead of it I never I always want to

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.520 
ahead of it I never I always want to
feel<00:05:23.310> like<00:05:23.790> the<00:05:23.970> ball<00:05:24.210> I<00:05:24.480> might<00:05:25.140> call<00:05:25.290> that<00:05:25.350> a

tee from my vision the ball is sitting

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.710 
tee from my vision the ball is sitting
in<00:05:27.720> this<00:05:27.810> teeth<00:05:28.140> okay<00:05:29.100> now<00:05:29.670> notice<00:05:29.880> how<00:05:30.150> it

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
in this teeth okay now notice how it

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.560 
in this teeth okay now notice how it
keeps<00:05:31.050> my<00:05:31.290> left<00:05:31.530> arm<00:05:31.770> in<00:05:32.370> shaft<00:05:33.090> in<00:05:33.360> line

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
keeps my left arm in shaft in line

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.090 
keeps my left arm in shaft in line
relatively<00:05:34.200> straight<00:05:34.440> line<00:05:34.620> all<00:05:34.830> the<00:05:34.920> way<00:05:34.950> up

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
relatively straight line all the way up

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.230 
relatively straight line all the way up
as<00:05:35.250> straight<00:05:35.490> as<00:05:35.610> you<00:05:35.670> can<00:05:35.850> possibly<00:05:35.970> see

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
as straight as you can possibly see

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.090 
as straight as you can possibly see
because<00:05:36.690> I<00:05:36.810> said<00:05:36.990> with<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.230> fact<00:05:37.440> of<00:05:37.620> how<00:05:38.040> we

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
because I said with the fact of how we

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.750 
because I said with the fact of how we
got<00:05:38.340> different<00:05:39.980> sizes<00:05:40.980> of<00:05:41.130> our<00:05:41.310> ROM<00:05:41.520> and

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
got different sizes of our ROM and

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.700 
got different sizes of our ROM and
thickness<00:05:42.330> in<00:05:42.600> circumference

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
thickness in circumference

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.640 
thickness in circumference
okay<00:05:44.430> or<00:05:45.300> diameter<00:05:45.870> if<00:05:46.080> you<00:05:46.170> want<00:05:46.320> to<00:05:46.380> go<00:05:46.440> that

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
okay or diameter if you want to go that

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.440 
okay or diameter if you want to go that
point<00:05:46.920> okay<00:05:47.310> so<00:05:47.790> you<00:05:47.850> see<00:05:48.000> the<00:05:48.120> difference

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
point okay so you see the difference

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.000 
point okay so you see the difference
here<00:05:50.240> my<00:05:51.240> hands<00:05:51.450> don't<00:05:51.660> move<00:05:51.840> as<00:05:52.080> my<00:05:52.530> body<00:05:52.740> goes

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
here my hands don't move as my body goes

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.710 
here my hands don't move as my body goes
back<00:05:53.190> because<00:05:53.430> the<00:05:53.550> ball<00:05:53.700> goes<00:05:53.940> forward<00:05:54.300> my

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
back because the ball goes forward my

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.330 
back because the ball goes forward my
hands<00:05:55.020> my<00:05:55.200> right<00:05:55.410> hand<00:05:55.590> always<00:05:55.890> stays<00:05:56.130> here

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
hands my right hand always stays here

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.620 
hands my right hand always stays here
and<00:05:56.430> then<00:05:56.550> the<00:05:56.610> swing<00:05:56.850> starts<00:05:57.030> the<00:05:57.240> same<00:05:57.450> way

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
and then the swing starts the same way

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.080 
and then the swing starts the same way
so<00:05:58.140> yes<00:05:58.350> that<00:05:58.620> was<00:05:58.800> absolutely<00:05:59.370> a<00:05:59.640> great<00:05:59.880> piece

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
so yes that was absolutely a great piece

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.590 
so yes that was absolutely a great piece
of<00:06:00.120> advice<00:06:00.360> as<00:06:01.310> we<00:06:02.310> believed<00:06:02.670> the<00:06:03.090> setup<00:06:03.420> must

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
of advice as we believed the setup must

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.940 
of advice as we believed the setup must
be<00:06:03.750> for<00:06:03.960> a<00:06:03.990> peak<00:06:04.140> performance<00:06:04.260> golf<00:06:04.740> swing

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
be for a peak performance golf swing

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.750 
be for a peak performance golf swing
okay<00:06:05.910> so<00:06:06.330> from<00:06:06.510> there<00:06:07.280> again<00:06:08.280> hidden<00:06:08.640> here

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
okay so from there again hidden here

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.730 
okay so from there again hidden here
with<00:06:08.910> a<00:06:08.940> 7-iron<00:06:09.360> when<00:06:09.960> she<00:06:10.140> here<00:06:10.410> then<00:06:10.650> we

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
with a 7-iron when she here then we

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.960 
with a 7-iron when she here then we
always<00:06:10.890> start<00:06:11.250> in<00:06:11.430> the<00:06:11.460> catcher's<00:06:11.790> mitt

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
always start in the catcher's mitt

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.030 
always start in the catcher's mitt
enough<00:06:12.180> fatigue<00:06:12.480> putting<00:06:13.380> the<00:06:13.440> club<00:06:13.620> lifting

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
enough fatigue putting the club lifting

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.350 
enough fatigue putting the club lifting
the<00:06:14.100> club<00:06:14.310> into<00:06:14.610> the<00:06:14.670> catcher's<00:06:14.940> mitt<00:06:15.060> toe<00:06:15.210> up

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
the club into the catcher's mitt toe up

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.820 
the club into the catcher's mitt toe up
and<00:06:15.540> up<00:06:15.600> to<00:06:15.630> three<00:06:15.930> into<00:06:16.560> the<00:06:16.650> forward

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
and up to three into the forward

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.380 
and up to three into the forward
catcher's<00:06:17.190> mitt<00:06:17.370> and<00:06:17.400> up<00:06:17.640> the<00:06:17.790> tree<00:06:17.970> that's

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
catcher's mitt and up the tree that's

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.370 
catcher's mitt and up the tree that's
why<00:06:18.600> we<00:06:18.750> have<00:06:18.870> to<00:06:18.990> have<00:06:19.080> the<00:06:19.170> pawns

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
why we have to have the pawns

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.320 
why we have to have the pawns
perpendicular<00:06:20.010> grip<00:06:20.220> and<00:06:20.550> we<00:06:20.790> always<00:06:20.940> start

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
perpendicular grip and we always start

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.880 
perpendicular grip and we always start
in<00:06:21.420> the<00:06:21.450> same<00:06:21.510> place<00:06:21.930> and<00:06:22.140> my<00:06:22.500> goal<00:06:22.680> is<00:06:22.800> always

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890 
in the same place and my goal is always

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.230 
in the same place and my goal is always
to<00:06:23.130> get<00:06:23.310> the<00:06:23.460> club<00:06:23.670> moving<00:06:23.940> first<00:06:25.940> do<00:06:26.940> that<00:06:27.120> and

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
to get the club moving first do that and
