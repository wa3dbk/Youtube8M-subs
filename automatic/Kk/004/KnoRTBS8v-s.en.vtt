00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
of these ideals of what it would be like

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.459 
of these ideals of what it would be like
-<00:01:39.179> what<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.479> would<00:01:39.569> be<00:01:39.719> like<00:01:39.750> -<00:01:40.079> what<00:01:40.289> it<00:01:40.380> would

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
- what it would be like - what it would

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:42.109 
- what it would be like - what it would
be<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:40.619> -<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.399> thing<00:01:41.609> that<00:01:41.759> never<00:01:41.880> goes

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
be like - and the thing that never goes

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.800 
be like - and the thing that never goes
away<00:01:42.530> at<00:01:43.530> least<00:01:43.710> from<00:01:44.189> my<00:01:44.670> experience<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:45.420> that

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
away at least from my experience is that

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.319 
away at least from my experience is that
what<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.890> would<00:01:46.979> be<00:01:47.130> like<00:01:47.159> -<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.700> just<00:01:47.969> evolves

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
what it would be like - it just evolves

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.469 
what it would be like - it just evolves
and<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.020> I'm<00:01:49.319> still<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.069> sky<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.670> my<00:01:50.850> skin<00:01:51.240> and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
and so I'm still the sky in my skin and

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.539 
and so I'm still the sky in my skin and
now<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.649> I've<00:01:52.770> seen<00:01:53.039> what<00:01:53.219> it<00:01:53.310> would<00:01:53.399> be<00:01:53.520> like

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
now that I've seen what it would be like

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.940 
now that I've seen what it would be like
to<00:01:53.880> do<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> handful<00:01:54.539> of<00:01:54.600> things<00:01:54.869> it's<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:55.679> like

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
to do a handful of things it's just like

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.499 
to do a handful of things it's just like
the<00:01:56.310> wood<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.609> would<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:57.060> -<00:01:57.240> keeps

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
the wood it would be like - keeps

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.599 
the wood it would be like - keeps
evolving<00:01:57.840> as<00:01:58.200> well<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.490> are

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
evolving as well and so you are

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:01.990 
evolving as well and so you are
constantly<00:01:59.840> looking<00:02:00.840> for<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.409> next

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
constantly looking for that next

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.719 
constantly looking for that next
experience<00:02:03.000> or<00:02:03.209> that<00:02:03.390> next<00:02:03.890> song<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.579> you

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
experience or that next song that you

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.339 
experience or that next song that you

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
last 10 years I mean I think the only

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.000 
last 10 years I mean I think the only
things<00:03:10.930> that<00:03:10.989> have<00:03:11.109> changed<00:03:11.260> really<00:03:11.769> are<00:03:11.920> the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
things that have changed really are the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.470 
things that have changed really are the
techniques<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:12.549> the<00:03:12.670> brushstrokes<00:03:13.180> like<00:03:13.389> I

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
techniques and the brushstrokes like I

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.940 
techniques and the brushstrokes like I
think<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.840> actual<00:03:14.319> art<00:03:14.530> that's<00:03:14.709> being

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
think the actual art that's being

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.800 
think the actual art that's being
presented<00:03:15.430> is<00:03:15.549> still<00:03:15.819> in<00:03:16.000> line<00:03:16.239> with<00:03:16.540> what's

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
presented is still in line with what's

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.979 
presented is still in line with what's
necessary<00:03:17.470> for<00:03:17.560> for<00:03:18.489> what<00:03:18.669> this<00:03:19.299> music<00:03:19.629> needs

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
necessary for for what this music needs

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.929 
necessary for for what this music needs

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
level so wherever our earth is that you

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.680 
level so wherever our earth is that you
know<00:04:14.379> what<00:04:14.470> I<00:04:14.530> mean<00:04:14.709> and<00:04:14.859> and<00:04:15.150> but<00:04:16.150> but<00:04:16.389> really

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
the energy the movement is still the

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.029 
the energy the movement is still the
same<00:04:18.820> it's<00:04:19.150> nothing<00:04:19.870> is<00:04:20.079> that<00:04:20.560> I<00:04:20.590> can<00:04:20.859> tell

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
same it's nothing is that I can tell

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.830 
same it's nothing is that I can tell
it's<00:04:21.220> changed<00:04:21.609> and<00:04:21.759> not<00:04:21.880> just<00:04:22.120> even<00:04:22.330> an<00:04:22.570> indie

it's changed and not just even an indie
rap<00:04:22.960> but<00:04:23.199> just<00:04:23.380> to<00:04:23.560> hip-hop<00:04:24.400> in<00:04:24.580> general<00:04:24.970> you

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
rap but just to hip-hop in general you

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.550 
rap but just to hip-hop in general you
know<00:04:25.270> it's<00:04:25.509> like<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:26.199> only<00:04:26.349> thing<00:04:26.440> that's

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
know it's like the only thing that's

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.620 
know it's like the only thing that's
changed<00:04:26.860> is<00:04:26.949> the<00:04:27.039> tree<00:04:27.310> grew<00:04:27.580> and<00:04:27.880> grew<00:04:28.389> more

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
changed is the tree grew and grew more

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.029 
changed is the tree grew and grew more
branches<00:04:29.139> and<00:04:29.289> so<00:04:29.409> now<00:04:29.500> you<00:04:29.560> have<00:04:29.680> a<00:04:29.770> branch

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
branches and so now you have a branch

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.189 
branches and so now you have a branch
for<00:04:30.280> people<00:04:30.520> like<00:04:30.639> me<00:04:30.880> and<00:04:31.090> you<00:04:31.150> still<00:04:32.050> have<00:04:32.169> a
