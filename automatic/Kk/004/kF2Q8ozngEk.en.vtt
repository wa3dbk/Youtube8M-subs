00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.640
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.990
 Another video review of the block pilots 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.900
 I really wanted to give you a few 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.240
 single star wars video reviews show 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.769
 but I thought hey the super pack 3 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:33.239
 1 1 you can show it quietly contains 36 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.760
 the internet 2013 by lego star wars and 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.820
 I just want to show you how 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.520
 that looks like I have to beat 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.910
 toys 'r' us i just believe it 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.469
 exclusive to troyes at others 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.940
 So I think a lot more expensive than that 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.969
 they really ought to be 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.670
 had luck with toys 'r' us were 20 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.670
 percent have for Easter just before easter 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:02.370
 instead of 80 euros, I believe only 262 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:06.090
 euro paid in lego star was awesome 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.140
 pack 3 in 1 number 6 64 49 are 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:15.060

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:17.430
 the 750 14 battle on photos private yes there 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.869

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:25.590
 pack 75,000 dreary politicians and 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.509
 the aws may continue 75 003 yes and as 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.680
 has always asked how should 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:36.600
 super pac 3 in 1 looks inside 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:38.380
 I will help now so that's how it is 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.270
 a great pac 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:47.770
 a set from the big one the battle on the 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:54.640
 is not a carton are here 123 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:57.149
 a slaughtered towntown offer that 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.659
 you have to reassemble first 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:08.319
 underneath unique number then have 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:13.630
 here are a few thicker the battle pack that 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:15.700
 looks pretty tiny as well 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.780
 video I complain that the way so 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.400
 big because in the other 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.900
 I I resist the too small very 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.950
 is small but there you at least see 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.610
 in content, however, may continue 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.670
 not necessarily my favorite but you 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:35.049
 Of course everything has to do three too 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:42.970
 There are millions here 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:44.170
 the instructions for the battle of road and the 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.739
 It was already that is now 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.739
 here an empty carton 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.990
 pack 3 1 1 So I do not know what you are 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:00.490
 otherwise i will think that grafings 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:04.820
 must then that costs 30 euros 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:11.650
 the battle pack 17 euro list price and 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:20.390
 begs 0 50 euro always together at 67 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:23.030
 97 eur 97 eur 85 euro not again 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.280
 Saved 18 eur 62 euro I think is one 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.390
 great price if he, of course 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.740
 then want to do such bargains 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.690
 you look at blogs blog.com 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.740
 We always have the best ones over there 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.480
 Prices from so many shops so enough 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.180
 that same advertising I will now 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.100
 each set will build up gradually 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.960
 Of course, then individually, then the video 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.590
