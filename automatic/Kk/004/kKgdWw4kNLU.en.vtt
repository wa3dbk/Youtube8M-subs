often if when you do that this moves
over<00:02:40.500> let's<00:02:41.310> cut<00:02:42.030> all<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.940> do<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.000> again<00:02:47.450> then

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
over let's cut all that do it again then

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.810 
over let's cut all that do it again then
you<00:02:48.570> just<00:02:48.720> cut<00:02:50.060> just<00:02:51.060> make<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:51.590> so<00:02:52.590> it's<00:02:52.820> level

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
you just cut just make it so it's level

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.470 
you just cut just make it so it's level
and<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.840> get<00:02:54.989> some<00:02:55.290> tape

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.400 

and<00:02:59.989> a<00:03:00.110> tape<00:03:00.410> that<00:03:02.620> then<00:03:03.620> once<00:03:04.010> you<00:03:04.250> do<00:03:04.459> that

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
and a tape that then once you do that

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
you get more tape and tape this little

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.280 
you get more tape and tape this little
line<00:03:11.239> right<00:03:11.690> here<00:03:12.610> flip<00:03:13.610> it<00:03:13.819> over<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.569> more

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
line right here flip it over and more

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:23.770 
line right here flip it over and more
tape<00:03:17.110> fold<00:03:18.110> this<00:03:18.819> side<00:03:19.819> over<00:03:20.209> here<00:03:20.360> I<00:03:22.780> might

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
tape fold this side over here I might

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:31.240 
tape fold this side over here I might
wanna<00:03:24.019> put<00:03:24.349> tape<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.400> other<00:03:25.459> side<00:03:25.880> too<00:03:30.250> and

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
wanna put tape the other side too and

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.759 
wanna put tape the other side too and
then<00:03:32.560> once<00:03:33.560> you<00:03:33.709> do<00:03:33.860> that<00:03:34.450> your<00:03:35.450> thing<00:03:36.410> will<00:03:36.620> be

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
then once you do that your thing will be

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.410 
then once you do that your thing will be
like<00:03:36.799> moving<00:03:37.780> so<00:03:38.780> put<00:03:39.260> it<00:03:39.380> back<00:03:39.590> in<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:41.209> then

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
like moving so put it back in and then

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.089 
like moving so put it back in and then
on<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.810> back<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.950> need<00:03:43.040> more<00:03:43.489> tape<00:03:44.799> tape<00:03:45.799> it
