herbivore borders what I can do now if

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.680 
herbivore borders what I can do now if
we<00:03:46.660> select<00:03:46.810> all<00:03:47.140> your<00:03:47.350> layers<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:48.040> hit<00:03:48.880> ctrl<00:03:49.420> G

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
we select all your layers and hit ctrl G

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.070 
we select all your layers and hit ctrl G
that<00:03:50.620> will<00:03:50.739> rule<00:03:51.010> them<00:03:51.190> all<00:03:51.370> up<00:03:51.580> and<00:03:51.930> what<00:03:52.930> we

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
that will rule them all up and what we

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.770 
that will rule them all up and what we
can<00:03:53.110> do<00:03:53.440> to<00:03:53.620> see<00:03:53.830> before<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:54.220> after<00:03:54.790> so<00:03:55.209> if<00:03:55.630> i

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
can do to see before and after so if i

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.140 
can do to see before and after so if i
take<00:03:55.959> this<00:03:56.140> I<00:03:56.410> that's<00:03:57.220> before

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.420 

and<00:04:00.629> that's<00:04:00.840> after<00:04:01.049> I<00:04:01.530> think<00:04:02.040> that's<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.310> very
