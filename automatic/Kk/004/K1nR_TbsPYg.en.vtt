little bit on the end of it which just

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.350 
little bit on the end of it which just
fits<00:02:22.420> next<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.540> logic<00:02:23.900> board<00:02:25.240> put<00:02:26.240> that

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
fits next to the logic board put that

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.650 
fits next to the logic board put that
down<00:02:26.540> too

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.600 

now<00:02:30.660> where<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.960> problem<00:02:31.200> will<00:02:31.350> be<00:02:31.590> it's<00:02:32.370> this

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
now where the problem will be it's this

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.320 
now where the problem will be it's this
little<00:02:32.870> this<00:02:33.870> little<00:02:34.110> connector<00:02:34.320> here

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
little this little connector here

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.450 
little this little connector here
it's<00:02:36.330> just<00:02:36.540> popped<00:02:36.810> off<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.260> popped<00:02:38.250> off<00:02:38.430> the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
it's just popped off the popped off the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.540 
it's just popped off the popped off the
logic<00:02:38.850> board<00:02:39.320> so

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.949 

I'm<00:02:45.850> gonna<00:02:46.030> move<00:02:46.270> it<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:46.630> it's

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.410 

that's<00:02:51.500> directly<00:02:51.980> over<00:02:52.459> the<00:02:52.610> over<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.180> board

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
that's directly over the over the board

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.780 
that's directly over the over the board
connector<00:02:57.400> chuckling<00:02:58.400> over<00:02:58.549> the<00:02:58.640> wall

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
connector chuckling over the wall

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.539 
connector chuckling over the wall
connector<00:02:59.120> there<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.950> then<00:03:01.220> you<00:03:01.370> want<00:03:01.519> to

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
connector there and then you want to

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.929 
connector there and then you want to
push<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:01.879> down<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.420> it'll<00:03:02.840> it'll<00:03:03.290> make<00:03:03.620> a<00:03:03.939> it

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
push it down and it'll it'll make a it

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.740 
push it down and it'll it'll make a it
will<00:03:05.060> make<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.209> click<00:03:05.599> as<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:05.900> as<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:06.739> press<00:03:06.980> it

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
will make a click as you as you press it

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.360 
will make a click as you as you press it
lift<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:08.900> off<00:03:09.019> again

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.550 

so<00:03:14.970> if<00:03:15.060> it's<00:03:15.180> off<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.959> see<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.379> board

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
so if it's off and see that board

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.720 
so if it's off and see that board
connector<00:03:16.980> there

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.750 

it<00:03:24.210> has<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.600> be<00:03:24.980> in<00:03:25.980> line<00:03:26.400> over<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:28.730> over<00:03:29.730> the

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.710 
connector you don't want to you don't
want<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.590> press<00:03:31.800> it<00:03:31.830> down<00:03:32.100> if<00:03:32.310> it's<00:03:32.459> not<00:03:32.720> in

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
want to press it down if it's not in

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.990 
want to press it down if it's not in
line<00:03:33.920> but<00:03:34.920> when<00:03:35.069> it<00:03:35.190> is<00:03:35.310> in<00:03:35.490> line<00:03:35.700> like<00:03:35.970> that

line but when it is in line like that

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.449 
line but when it is in line like that
just<00:03:36.930> maneuver<00:03:37.260> it<00:03:37.350> in<00:03:37.530> place<00:03:37.740> with<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.130> with

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
just maneuver it in place with it with

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.510 
just maneuver it in place with it with
the<00:03:38.550> screwdriver<00:03:39.500> then<00:03:43.010> should<00:03:44.010> make<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.220> firm

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
the screwdriver then should make a firm

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.150 
the screwdriver then should make a firm
click<00:03:44.910> as<00:03:45.150> it's<00:03:45.709> because<00:03:46.709> it's<00:03:46.890> seated

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
click as it's because it's seated

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.210 
click as it's because it's seated
properly<00:03:48.860> so<00:03:49.860> let's<00:03:50.100> give<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.580> a<00:03:50.610> go

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
properly so let's give that a go

00:03:52.220 --> 00:04:04.040 
properly so let's give that a go
next<00:03:53.220> up<00:03:53.750> put<00:03:54.750> this<00:03:54.870> bit<00:03:55.080> back<00:03:55.260> in<00:04:02.900> goes<00:04:03.900> in

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
next up put this bit back in goes in

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.010 
next up put this bit back in goes in
like<00:04:04.230> that

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.990

you get the one screw that was holding

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:24.740 
you get the one screw that was holding
in<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.360> battery<00:04:15.360> connector

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
tight put it back on is to so it fits in

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.590

with these screws you probably want to

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.260 
with these screws you probably want to
put<00:04:52.639> the<00:04:52.759> screw

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
put the screw

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.939 
put the screw
on<00:04:54.750> to<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:54.990> screwdriver<00:04:55.500> like<00:04:55.740> that

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.839

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849 
just screw it in a bit and then screw it

just screw it in a bit and then screw it
up<00:05:03.909> tight<00:05:04.919> the<00:05:05.919> threads<00:05:06.310> on<00:05:06.490> these<00:05:06.639> screws<00:05:07.030> are

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
up tight the threads on these screws are

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.770 
up tight the threads on these screws are
pretty<00:05:08.039> or<00:05:09.039> the<00:05:09.250> head<00:05:10.150> on<00:05:10.300> them<00:05:10.449> is<00:05:10.599> pretty

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
pretty or the head on them is pretty

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.209 
pretty or the head on them is pretty
easy<00:05:10.990> to<00:05:11.139> strip<00:05:11.530> so<00:05:11.710> you<00:05:11.800> don't<00:05:11.919> want<00:05:12.039> to<00:05:12.129> put

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
tightening it just a bit of force should

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:23.779 
tightening it just a bit of force should
should<00:05:17.199> do

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.120

batteries install correctly and it
should<00:06:02.319> find<00:06:02.650> Network<00:06:03.389> pretty<00:06:04.389> much<00:06:04.569> straight

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
should find Network pretty much straight

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:13.340 
should find Network pretty much straight
away<00:06:08.580> searching

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:20.150 

that's<00:06:14.350> found<00:06:14.620> Network<00:06:15.210> sir<00:06:16.210> so<00:06:16.900> good
