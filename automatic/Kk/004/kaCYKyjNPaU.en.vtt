00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.730
 Hi I hope you're fine 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.220
 today I would like to propose to you 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.070
 an activity to do with a child from 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.349
 the age of 6 and we have recently made 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.860
 a piñata for are then those who me 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.210
 follow 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.789
 they will find that a lot 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.359
 piñata right now but it's true 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.400
 we made a piñata shaped 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.580
 flower a line is rocket-shaped 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.890
 today I present you the piñata 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.289
 informs of fish and in a few 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.170
 weeks I will be able to introduce you 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.380
 also a shapeless piñata of beard to 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.230
 mom so how did we do our 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.329
 job line are therefore first the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.789
 material needed to make the pinata 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.300
 you need an inflated balloon and paper 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.730
 newspaper 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.700
 a measure of flour 2 water measurements in 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.579
 pole a pair of scissors 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.890
 so I first placed the inflated balloon 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.149
 on the containers in the form of final 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.820
 to keep it standing 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.340
 we made a mixture with 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.610
 flour no measure of flour for two 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.320
 water measurements then simply he 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.659
 must make paper mache ie 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.610
 that 30 of the strips of newspaper 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.200
 in the mixture of flour and water and 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.200
 in place by two on bullets 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.540
 so we were three do that so me 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.700
 even my big 6 year old daughter and then the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.080
 p tite who will soon be two years old eh 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.520
 well I can tell you that even the little 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.420
 to responsiveness 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.299
 you just have to predict unfit sirea for 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.700
 do not be afraid to dirty as you 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.250
 apply three layers of newspaper 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.950
 cheated in the flour 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.130
 and water is expected about 24 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.170
 drying hours between two layers and 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.840
 you have to think about drying the 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.530
 piñata in both directions, that is to say 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.030
 allowed to dry in the direction for 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.590
 a few hours and then after the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.990
 go back to the top 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.940
 since in fact the part that is in 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.470
 the container will not be able to dry 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:05.500
 others then for decoration we 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.190
 needed decopatch paper varnish 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.230
 stick a box an egg of the patafix of 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.209
 acrylic painting of crepe paper 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:19.270
 we lose 2.6 we watch good streets 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.920
 first we did the fins but 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.320
 they have small pieces of cardboard 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.260
 corrugated 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.390
 so we drew a curve that follows at 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.700
 about the curve of the balloon so we have 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.130
 drawn to his ear because even though 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.209
 the yard does not exactly fit this 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.050
 is not very serious 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.820
 so here we cut out the look of the 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.790
 placement and then the fin from above 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.180
 below 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.890
 then we cut an opening on 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.360
 the belly of the fish ie the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.380
 part that will be below who is it 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.480
 fills with confidence 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.799
 there we made a chocolate piñata 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.030
 because we did it for someone who 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.630
 love chocolate a lot but that can 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.150
 to be little gifts or so 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:06.030
 sweets for the kids then we 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:09.780
 fixed the fins with with 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.130
 adhesive tape sorry and then we broke through 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:17.070
 the piñata in two places 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.860
 here and there to pass a ribbon that will 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.910
 allow to give birth to the fish and we have 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.280
 closed the piñata using the part 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.200
 that had previously been cut into 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.230
 lace cotton with adhesive tape 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.610
 very strong in its place so and then 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:39.220
 then we put the 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:42.040
 the fin we used a box 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.870
 to make bulging eyes that you 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.390
 see here 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.900
 and then patafix to form a 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.900
 layer 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.390
 then we used the technique 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.340
 cutting to decorate the head of the 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.080
 fish as well as fins 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.890
 we used acrylic paint 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.830
 to paint the mouth a red eyes 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.250
 in white and then with paint 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.870
 black 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:13.930
 we finished painting the eyes and then 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.940
 inside the mouth then we 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.000
 cut out paper fringes 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.560
 crepon there you see we're in the process of 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.270
 cut out the fringes and then we got them 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.580
 stuck on the fish 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.040
 be careful the fringes have to 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.830
 go back open there only fish 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.460
 since a fish age advancing 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.860
 so the ol will push back so he 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.290
 the fringes must be oriented 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.680
 towards the back of the fish so we 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.479
 sticks like this site around the fish 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:48.700
 we also stick the fins on the 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:53.410
 sides like this and then we finished from 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:56.160
 sticking the fringes plays what will have to 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.720
 so here is our fish pinta is ready 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.400
 it only remains to shoot at 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.770
 strings we placed underneath 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.710
 so most strings are fixed 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.780
 simply with a band of 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.330
 so they will leave very easily 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.900
 there is only one girl who has 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.750
 been fixed that passes through the hull of the 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.810
 fish and that we have therefore made a 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.700
 knot well and so this string there 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.430
 when we shoot well afraid of leaks to her 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.300
 will break the pinata and the chocolates that 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.820
 are inside 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.180
 wang so here I hope our 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.740
