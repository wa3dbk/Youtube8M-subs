down<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.360> point<00:02:30.450> where<00:02:30.980> these<00:02:31.980> peppers

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
down to the point where these peppers

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.800 
down to the point where these peppers
are<00:02:32.549> starting<00:02:32.820> turning<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.209> minced<00:02:33.450> meat<00:02:33.480> for

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
are starting turning the minced meat for

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.840 
are starting turning the minced meat for
slugs<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.650> stuff<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.040> it's<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.220> lot<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.549> foliage

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
slugs and stuff so it's a lot of foliage

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.080 
slugs and stuff so it's a lot of foliage
is<00:02:36.180> starting<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.480> die<00:02:36.630> off<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:38.160> these

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
is starting to die off and and these

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.210 
is starting to die off and and these
peppers<00:02:39.420> somehow<00:02:39.750> made<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.410> through<00:02:41.100> that

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
peppers somehow made it through that

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.420 
peppers somehow made it through that
entire<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.900> entire<00:02:43.230> period<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.739> time<00:02:43.950> where

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
entire the entire period of time where

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.670 
entire the entire period of time where
we<00:02:44.820> were<00:02:45.060> getting<00:02:45.150> Frost's<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:45.959> now<00:02:46.500> they're

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
we were getting Frost's and now they're

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.620 
we were getting Frost's and now they're
starting<00:02:46.769> to<00:02:46.950> get<00:02:47.070> hit<00:02:47.280> up<00:02:47.430> by

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
starting to get hit up by

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.740 
starting to get hit up by
by<00:02:48.870> slugs<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.680> things<00:02:50.520> just<00:02:50.820> are<00:02:50.970> not<00:02:51.450> looking

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
by slugs and things just are not looking

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.390 
by slugs and things just are not looking
up<00:02:51.870> for<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.170> pepper<00:02:52.350> plants<00:02:52.830> or<00:02:53.070> at<00:02:53.160> least<00:02:53.280> the

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
up for the pepper plants or at least the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
fruit the pepper plants themselves are

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.370 
fruit the pepper plants themselves are
still<00:02:55.710> producing<00:02:56.450> but<00:02:57.450> they<00:02:57.660> will<00:02:57.870> they<00:02:58.260> won't

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
still producing but they will they won't

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.050 
still producing but they will they won't
have<00:02:58.560> enough<00:02:58.710> time<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:59.010> produce<00:02:59.100> another<00:02:59.430> crop

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
have enough time to produce another crop

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.270 
have enough time to produce another crop
of<00:03:00.210> peppers<00:03:00.570> but<00:03:01.110> I'm<00:03:01.350> good<00:03:01.650> I'm<00:03:01.770> definitely

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
of peppers but I'm good I'm definitely

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.590 
of peppers but I'm good I'm definitely
the<00:03:02.310> green<00:03:02.610> one<00:03:02.730> on<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.120> give<00:03:03.240> them<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.390> chance

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
the green one on to give them a chance

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.150 
the green one on to give them a chance
to<00:03:03.720> ripen<00:03:03.960> up<00:03:05.030> but<00:03:06.030> as<00:03:06.270> far<00:03:06.510> as<00:03:06.860> as<00:03:07.860> far<00:03:08.070> as

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
to ripen up but as far as as far as

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
to ripen up but as far as as far as
actual<00:03:08.580> pepper<00:03:09.270> production<00:03:09.840> goes<00:03:10.250> I<00:03:11.250> think

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
actual pepper production goes I think

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.120 
actual pepper production goes I think
they're<00:03:12.450> probably<00:03:12.660> about<00:03:12.840> done<00:03:13.170> but<00:03:13.830> we're

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
they're probably about done but we're

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.730 
they're probably about done but we're
still<00:03:14.370> getting<00:03:14.490> lots<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:15.990> lots<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.350> peppers

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.610 
improved and my my public speaking has
definitely<00:06:05.270> improved<00:06:05.330> as<00:06:05.720> well<00:06:05.750> which

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
definitely improved as well which

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.680 
definitely improved as well which
obviously<00:06:07.310> comes<00:06:07.550> along<00:06:07.789> with<00:06:07.940> experience<00:06:08.479> so

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
obviously comes along with experience so

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.279 
obviously comes along with experience so
back<00:06:09.350> then<00:06:09.590> the<00:06:10.340> idea<00:06:10.699> wasn't<00:06:11.240> wrong<00:06:11.660> it<00:06:12.050> was

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:12.289 
back then the idea wasn't wrong it was

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:16.180 
back then the idea wasn't wrong it was
just<00:06:12.530> the<00:06:12.800> the<00:06:13.639> vocab<00:06:14.090> was<00:06:14.389> was<00:06:15.110> way<00:06:15.410> off<00:06:15.680> hand

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
just the the vocab was was way off hand

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.279 
just the the vocab was was way off hand
and<00:06:16.729> yeah<00:06:17.240> so<00:06:17.389> I<00:06:17.419> might<00:06:17.570> be<00:06:17.630> redoing<00:06:18.080> that

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
and yeah so I might be redoing that

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:21.460 
and yeah so I might be redoing that
video<00:06:18.590> but<00:06:19.190> as<00:06:19.550> far<00:06:19.910> as<00:06:20.060> I'm<00:06:20.180> concerned<00:06:20.660> it's

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
video but as far as I'm concerned it's

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.810 
video but as far as I'm concerned it's
always<00:06:21.710> been<00:06:21.830> kind<00:06:22.010> of<00:06:22.039> a<00:06:22.130> fun<00:06:22.340> thing<00:06:22.370> to<00:06:22.700> do

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
always been kind of a fun thing to do

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.850 
always been kind of a fun thing to do
especially<00:06:23.360> with<00:06:23.870> peppers<00:06:24.289> I've<00:06:24.650> never

really tried it too much with tomatoes

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.190 
really tried it too much with tomatoes
just<00:06:26.210> because<00:06:26.450> I<00:06:26.510> like<00:06:26.720> to<00:06:26.840> stick<00:06:27.050> to

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.200 
just because I like to stick to

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.310 
just because I like to stick to
heirlooms<00:06:27.590> and<00:06:27.800> and<00:06:28.729> I<00:06:29.060> actually<00:06:29.360> care<00:06:29.960> to<00:06:30.139> get

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
heirlooms and and I actually care to get

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.050 
heirlooms and and I actually care to get
something<00:06:30.710> when<00:06:30.889> it<00:06:30.979> comes<00:06:31.160> to<00:06:31.310> tomatoes<00:06:31.639> but

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
something when it comes to tomatoes but

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.580 
something when it comes to tomatoes but
peppers<00:06:32.419> is<00:06:32.570> just<00:06:32.780> kind<00:06:32.930> of<00:06:32.990> fun<00:06:33.200> I<00:06:33.229> never

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
peppers is just kind of fun I never

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.460 
peppers is just kind of fun I never
really<00:06:33.950> we<00:06:34.220> don't<00:06:34.400> really<00:06:34.580> consume<00:06:34.910> that<00:06:35.060> many

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
really we don't really consume that many

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.810 
really we don't really consume that many
so<00:06:36.470> if<00:06:36.560> I<00:06:36.590> get<00:06:36.650> something<00:06:37.130> that's<00:06:37.310> great<00:06:37.580> but

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:37.820 
so if I get something that's great but

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.150 
so if I get something that's great but
if<00:06:37.910> not<00:06:37.970> it's<00:06:38.780> really<00:06:39.169> no<00:06:39.260> loss<00:06:39.470> to<00:06:39.740> me<00:06:39.860> so

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
if not it's really no loss to me so

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.560 
if not it's really no loss to me so
that's<00:06:40.699> kind<00:06:40.910> of<00:06:40.940> why<00:06:41.060> I<00:06:41.090> choose<00:06:41.330> to<00:06:41.419> do<00:06:41.479> with

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.570 
that's kind of why I choose to do with

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.170 
that's kind of why I choose to do with
peppers<00:06:41.930> just<00:06:42.139> because<00:06:42.500> it's<00:06:43.430> not<00:06:43.669> really<00:06:44.060> at

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
peppers just because it's not really at

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.790 
peppers just because it's not really at
a<00:06:44.210> loss<00:06:44.300> if<00:06:44.780> I<00:06:44.840> don't<00:06:45.050> get<00:06:45.229> anything<00:06:45.470> or<00:06:45.710> if

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
a loss if I don't get anything or if

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.060 
a loss if I don't get anything or if
it's<00:06:45.889> a<00:06:45.949> total<00:06:46.220> failure<00:06:46.449> and<00:06:47.449> and<00:06:48.199> there's
