 events and won seven gold medals 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.090
 in the 200 meter butterfly his strength was 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.619
 incomparable the red line shows the 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.800
 world record that he set himself 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:34.600
 seven months before 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.789
 he improved it in 1.71 seconds 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.070
 took 3 seconds before the next 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.470
 swimmer 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.480
 then in the 200 meters freestyle 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.420
 phelps revealed his next feat of 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.519
 strength and speed 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.170
 10 meters from the exit the others 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.629
 swimmers had already left the 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.250
 surface but phelps was still out 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.250
 the view without even splashing 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:02.060
 13 meters came to the surface with a 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.060
 half body advantage 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.980
 on the return to 50 meters he loses his 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.730
 advantage but phelps is still submerged 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.730
 for more time 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.640
 and appears far ahead of the others 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.640
 competitors 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.890
 the underwater side 11 meters more than 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.479
 double than the other swimmers and pulled one 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.220
 great advantage over the competitor who 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.730
 I was coming back 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.460
 and he made it look easy 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.430
 he trained 365 days a year 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.320
 for 5 years in a row is one of the 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.930
 most motivated athletes of all 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.150
 sports around the world 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.720
 phelps accepted that his technique be 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.720
 studied 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.740
 first the freestyle with the 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.690
 that phelps won the world record the 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.360
 test follows phelps since its inception 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.360
 until the return to 50 meters 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.360
 prepared 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.900
 after a deep dive he throws 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.420
 his body like a torpedo 15 meters 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.200
 before going to the surface 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.200
 but not 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.090
 their movements are more similar to those of 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.090
 a fish that to those of a man 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.290
 phelps reveals the factor that makes him 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.550
 one of the fastest swimmers in the 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.560
 world 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.560
 his powerful dolphin kick 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.520
 scientists study the physicist's 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.560
 felt to determine the elements that 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.560
 they make it the fastest swimmer in the world 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.920
 as most swimmers are tall 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.220
 and lightweight measures one meter 93 and weighs 90 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.220
 kilos 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.030
 the extent of your extended arms in 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.270
 cross is 201 centimeters 8 more than its 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.270
 height 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.120
 your flexible joints give your 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.859
 arms an even greater reach michael 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.200
 phelps has another great advantage over 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.280
 other swimmers has a double 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.530
 joint 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.860
 You can bend your body and swim like a 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.860
 Dolphin 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.010
 honduras his body of double articulation 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.010
 from the chest 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.620
 Most swimmers bend 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.310
 from the hip the cameras reveal 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.310
 other surprises 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.620
 his head and torso are right and 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.950
 still, reducing resistance 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.930
 his hands are also still phelps 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:43.110
 focuses its strength only on what it needs 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.110
 for propulsion nothing more and nothing less 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.360
 comparing phelps with the winner of the 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.630
 chris olympic bronze medal 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.840
 thompson this ripples - the body but 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.320
 more lower arms push higher 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.320
 acceleration 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.800
 phelps is an incomparable teacher 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.600
 butterfly and in the 200 meters and 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.880
 surprised everyone with his back style 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.880
 where he uses more technique and less force 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.980
 he improved his own previous world record 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.720
 in 0.3 seconds and it is the third best 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.090
 history time 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.290
 always competitive wants to achieve 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.290
 also that record 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.430
 the images show an arrow up and 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.820
 down they were der kay 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.010
 good 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.690
 after plunging it will fall 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.990
 five kicks before going out to the 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.990
 surface 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:49.469
 10 kicks and kept under water 

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:49.469
 twice as long 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.990
 the next winning factor is the return 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:58.990
 of fells 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.949
 the depth and distance under the 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.190
 water of the two swimmers is very 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.190
 different 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.680
 vanderkaay swims near the surface 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.169
 after turning around 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.190
 flaps with the legs and goes out in the 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.190
 8 meters mark 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.960
 but phelps does not go up it goes down 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:31.290
 point to your body at an angle of 45 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.910
 degrees and it gives dolphin kicks to a 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.910
 1 meter depth 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.910
 Y 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.340
 stays under the water until the mark of 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.849
 the 13 meters 5 meters more than 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.849
 vanderkaay 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.110
 in the 200 meters freestyle in the 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:57.229
 2007 world championship 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.569
 phelps swam 46 meters underwater almost 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:03.440
 a quarter of the race and it came 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:05.660
 with 20 meters difference from the second 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.420
 with a body made to swim him 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.700
 It is also made to compete 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.860
 refuses to lose 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.230
 like other athletes with bodies 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.760
 miraculous the success of phelps comes from 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:21.880
 a great mental concentration 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.770
 is the difference between winning and losing 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.380
 his training to manifest his 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:29.610
 dedication and effort training using a 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.610
 belt 8 kilos 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:37.539
 floats for 40 seconds only with the 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.539
 power of his legs 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.610
 and then jump in the water 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.580
 one meter is thrown up from the 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.580
 Pool background 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:06.349
 at 22, wells just feels the 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.349
 need to compete 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:14.750
 phelps is at the top but at 22 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:16.569
 years keeps growing by learning and 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.479
 perfecting hedges 

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:23.039
 in his miraculous body is a factor his 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:23.039
 need to win is another 

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:32.830
 is equal to other athletes who push their 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:36.070
 bodies without giving them respite in sports 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.810
 where every fraction of a second counts the 

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:42.190
 science proved that it's not just the 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:45.340
 body that determines who will lose and 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:49.530
 who will win to be a champion too 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.530
 the power of the mind is needed
