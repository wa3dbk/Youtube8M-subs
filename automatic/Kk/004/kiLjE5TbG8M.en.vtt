gonna go it's not gonna go all around
this<00:03:53.790> way<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.120> then<00:03:54.510> around<00:03:54.840> cuz<00:03:55.170> obviously

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
this way and then around cuz obviously

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.710 
this way and then around cuz obviously
that<00:03:56.459> takes<00:03:56.700> longer<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.090> why<00:03:57.329> would<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:57.599> go

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
that takes longer and why would you go

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.599 
that takes longer and why would you go
that<00:03:57.870> way<00:03:58.049> so<00:03:58.130> you<00:03:59.130> know<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.280> got<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.489> use<00:03:59.579> a

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
that way so you know you got to use a

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.789 
that way so you know you got to use a
common<00:03:59.970> sense<00:04:00.180> too<00:04:00.420> but<00:04:01.049> it's<00:04:01.260> gonna<00:04:01.410> go<00:04:01.620> from

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
common sense too but it's gonna go from

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.030 
common sense too but it's gonna go from
Salt<00:04:02.280> Lake<00:04:02.310> City<00:04:02.579> to<00:04:02.910> Tokyo<00:04:03.690> this<00:04:04.500> works<00:04:04.739> with
