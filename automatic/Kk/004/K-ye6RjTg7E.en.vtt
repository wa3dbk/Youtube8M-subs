animation<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.660> lot<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.840> ways<00:01:01.050> animation<00:01:01.770> is

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
animation in a lot of ways animation is

animation in a lot of ways animation is
essentially<00:01:02.370> acting<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:02.940> pencil<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.510> I

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
essentially acting with pencil and I

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.990 
essentially acting with pencil and I
learned<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.960> lot<00:01:04.080> about<00:01:04.489> expressions<00:01:05.489> and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
learned a lot about expressions and

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.539 
learned a lot about expressions and
story<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.080> staging<00:01:07.680> through<00:01:07.979> acting<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.490> I

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
story and staging through acting that I

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.609 
story and staging through acting that I
can<00:01:08.700> actually<00:01:08.970> put<00:01:09.180> into<00:01:09.570> animation<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.290> it

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
can actually put into animation so it

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.260 
can actually put into animation so it
