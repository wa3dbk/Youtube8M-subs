00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.189
 Welcome to acta with the wood I have 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:12.030
 you the flight mode trick with hd here 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:15.690
 probably there is such a 50 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.420
 actions about any free 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.720
 gully like for example building material or 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.970
 Seen or land or whatever 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:29.400
 more for example 50 fields from wheat 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.740
 reaping or in the mill writer there 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.860
 different doctors or rarely times 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.540
 you usually get a diamond 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.329
 then usually not what you really are 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.239
 looks and there would be such a kind reset 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.670
 button 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:48.300
 maybe nice if it just 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.140
 could try the whole thing 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.140
 only works sensibly in a wlan 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.469
 because you have to enter the flight mode and 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.890
 turn off relatively quickly and for that 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.600
 is it normal telephone network too slow 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.090
 I have started hey diets now 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.760
 I switch the flight mode 1 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:18.390
 that means you have no connection with 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:23.159
 servers has wheat fields here i see 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.830
 other customers come in the case 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.060
 but do not want to have that 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.240
 finally, it would have gone completely too 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.780
 the task bar gives the settings 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.980
 I'm on the flight mode 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.820
 again in one 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:46.380
 wlan at home a pity haye again 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.670
 rather problem that sometimes was there 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.320
 probably not fast if still 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.790
 in the net are registered 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.070
 but like you see it again and again 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.800
 my wheat has not been harvested yet 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.590
 what I just did now 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:08.970
 I can reapply here and 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:11.930
 leading perhaps out so this 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.960
 I also do not want wood panels 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.820
 then I turn off for the flight mode 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:22.200
 finished and starts again from the beginning 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.080
 or I'll keep it now and it 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.470
 everything stays as it is 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:33.540
 the whole works well for example 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.520
 when surfing in the mine then often so 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.280
 long until I found a diamond 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.280
 for example, or at 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.840
 sending bread away you can see now 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.820
 Immediately what's next for me 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.320
 that pleases well and state stop 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:53.360
 just good that is their flight mode 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.360
 trick with hd much fun
