them and stealing the van but they most

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.760 
them and stealing the van but they most
likely<00:01:48.180> will<00:01:48.509> shoot<00:01:48.780> at<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.020> right<00:01:49.259> away<00:01:49.530> and

likely will shoot at you right away and
you<00:01:49.890> will<00:01:50.100> probably<00:01:50.340> die<00:01:50.700> because<00:01:50.939> there's<00:01:51.180> a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
you will probably die because there's a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.940 
you will probably die because there's a
lot<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.600> them<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:51.930> one<00:01:52.170> little<00:01:52.380> area<00:01:52.619> I

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
lot of them in this one little area I

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.010 
lot of them in this one little area I
have<00:01:53.759> seen<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> person<00:01:54.299> come<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.840> with<00:01:54.990> a

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
have seen a person come in with a

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.660 
have seen a person come in with a
cargobob<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.829> hitch<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.100> onto<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
cargobob and hitch it onto that and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.800 
cargobob and hitch it onto that and
managed<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.000> get<00:01:57.180> away<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:57.540> it

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
managed to get away with it

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.149 
managed to get away with it
if<00:01:57.869> that's<00:01:58.229> something<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.649> want<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.890> try<00:01:59.040> you

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
if that's something you want to try you

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.440 
if that's something you want to try you
could<00:01:59.340> try<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.549> out<00:01:59.850> but<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.270> probably

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
could try that out but this is probably

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.420 
could try that out but this is probably
your<00:02:00.840> best<00:02:01.020> method<00:02:01.469> just<00:02:01.799> completing<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
your best method just completing the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.590 
your best method just completing the
gang<00:02:02.610> attack<00:02:02.909> they're<00:02:03.090> not<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.360> difficult

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
gang attack they're not that difficult

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.510 
gang attack they're not that difficult
and<00:02:03.960> once<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:04.740> complete<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.310> should

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
and once you do complete it you should

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.429 
and once you do complete it you should
have<00:02:05.670> no<00:02:05.880> problems<00:02:06.270> getting<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.630> lost<00:02:06.840> MC<00:02:07.229> van

just be careful when you're killing the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.100 
just be careful when you're killing the
enemies<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.479> don't<00:02:09.629> shoot<00:02:09.840> out<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
enemies that you don't shoot out the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.300 
enemies that you don't shoot out the

tires or anything like that

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.100 
tires or anything like that
because<00:02:11.849> like<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.180> said<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.420> can't<00:02:12.810> bring<00:02:13.020> this

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
because like I said you can't bring this

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.520 
because like I said you can't bring this
into

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530

santos customs and repair at all and the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.180 
santos customs and repair at all and the
first<00:02:16.290> thing<00:02:16.470> you're<00:02:16.560> probably<00:02:16.800> going<00:02:17.100> to

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
first thing you're probably going to

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.830 
first thing you're probably going to
notice<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.580> those<00:02:17.760> back<00:02:18.000> doors<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.600> stay

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
notice is those back doors that stay

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.510 
notice is those back doors that stay
open<00:02:19.230> that's<00:02:19.380> because<00:02:19.709> when<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.069> stumbled

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
open that's because when you stumbled

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.130 
open that's because when you stumbled
upon<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.850> lost<00:02:21.060> MC<00:02:21.420> crew<00:02:21.630> they<00:02:21.810> were<00:02:21.840> most

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
upon the lost MC crew they were most

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.570 
upon the lost MC crew they were most
likely<00:02:22.200> loading<00:02:22.830> this<00:02:22.920> vehicle<00:02:23.310> up<00:02:23.430> with

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
likely loading this vehicle up with

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.699 
likely loading this vehicle up with
drugs<00:02:23.850> those<00:02:24.330> back<00:02:24.540> doors<00:02:24.569> do<00:02:25.050> stay<00:02:25.260> open<00:02:25.560> and

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
drugs those back doors do stay open and

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.650 
drugs those back doors do stay open and
you<00:02:25.800> can't<00:02:26.010> really<00:02:26.190> get<00:02:26.370> them<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.670> close<00:02:26.910> but

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
you can't really get them to close but

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.000 
you can't really get them to close but
if<00:02:27.750> they're<00:02:27.900> really<00:02:28.080> annoying<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.650> too<00:02:28.830> much

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
if they're really annoying you too much

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.590 
if they're really annoying you too much
you<00:02:29.160> can<00:02:29.310> just<00:02:29.340> run<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.730> car<00:02:30.000> into<00:02:30.239> them<00:02:30.390> and

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
you can just run a car into them and

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.050 
you can just run a car into them and
knock<00:02:30.750> them<00:02:30.959> off<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.290> vehicle<00:02:31.620> all<00:02:31.770> together

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
knock them off the vehicle all together

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.640 
knock them off the vehicle all together
so<00:02:33.060> this<00:02:33.209> van<00:02:33.390> has<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.690> lot<00:02:33.989> of<00:02:34.020> cool<00:02:34.230> features

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
so this van has a lot of cool features

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.900 
so this van has a lot of cool features
the<00:02:34.800> first<00:02:35.010> things<00:02:35.220> you'll<00:02:35.310> probably<00:02:35.340> notice

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
the first things you'll probably notice

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.150 
the first things you'll probably notice
