in the damaged section of the store so I

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.240 
in the damaged section of the store so I
just<00:00:27.539> went<00:00:27.689> back<00:00:27.900> there<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.170> actually<00:00:28.859> have

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
original lenses but I did end up getting

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.330 
original lenses but I did end up getting
them<00:00:34.440> just<00:00:34.620> because<00:00:34.710> their<00:00:34.950> route<00:00:35.130> they<00:00:35.280> were

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
them just because their route they were

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.360 
them just because their route they were
super<00:00:35.730> sweet<00:00:36.739> so<00:00:37.739> go<00:00:38.010> ahead<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.219> get<00:00:38.280> started

what<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:38.910> have<00:00:39.090> today<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.800> called<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
what I have today is called the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.360 
what I have today is called the
propaganda<00:00:41.640> hijinks<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.350> polished<00:00:44.160> white

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
propaganda hijinks it's a polished white

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.700 
propaganda hijinks it's a polished white
frame<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.969> it's<00:00:45.420> supposed<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> black

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
frame and it's supposed to have a black

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.709 
frame and it's supposed to have a black
iridium<00:00:47.010> lens<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.579> there<00:00:47.760> but<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.539> actually

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
iridium lens in there but it actually

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.920 
iridium lens in there but it actually
just<00:00:49.079> has<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> warm<00:00:49.710> gray<00:00:50.070> lens<00:00:50.780> for<00:00:51.780> some

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
just has a warm gray lens for some

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.600 
just has a warm gray lens for some
reason<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.379> guess<00:00:52.559> they<00:00:52.739> didn't<00:00:53.039> they<00:00:53.309> didn't

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
reason I guess they didn't they didn't

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.750 
reason I guess they didn't they didn't
ship<00:00:54.199> they<00:00:55.199> didn't<00:00:55.590> ship<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.100> sunglasses

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
ship they didn't ship the sunglasses

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.180 
ship they didn't ship the sunglasses
with<00:00:57.570> lenses<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.379> they<00:00:58.590> were<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.890> damaged

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
with lenses so they were in the damaged

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.830 
with lenses so they were in the damaged
section<00:00:59.340> but<00:00:59.670> personally<00:01:00.090> I'm<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.449> didn't<00:01:00.660> care

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
section but personally I'm I didn't care

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.349 
section but personally I'm I didn't care
so<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.280> box<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.640> really<00:01:02.879> cool<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.149> probably

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
so the box is really cool it's probably

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.950 
so the box is really cool it's probably
one<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> cooler<00:01:04.409> boxes<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.129> have<00:01:05.960> I'm

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
one of the cooler boxes that I have I'm

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.719 
one of the cooler boxes that I have I'm
not<00:01:07.110> not<00:01:07.439> particularly<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.979> high<00:01:08.189> jinks<00:01:08.520> fan

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
not not particularly a high jinks fan

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.670 
not not particularly a high jinks fan
I'm<00:01:09.540> more<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:11.090> antics<00:01:12.090> person<00:01:12.450> but<00:01:13.170> it's

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
I'm more of a a antics person but it's

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.929 
I'm more of a a antics person but it's
just<00:01:13.830> they're<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.100> too<00:01:14.369> sweet<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.640> couldn't

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
just they're just too sweet I couldn't

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.289 
just they're just too sweet I couldn't
pass<00:01:15.030> up<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.299> reason<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.110> high<00:01:16.350> jinks<00:01:17.299> are

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
pass up the reason that high jinks are

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.910 
pass up the reason that high jinks are
the<00:01:18.420> reason<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.780> they<00:01:19.200> may<00:01:19.409> actually<00:01:19.590> made

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
the reason that they may actually made

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.460 
the reason that they may actually made
this<00:01:20.130> particular<00:01:20.729> pair<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.780> sunglasses<00:01:21.990> was
