00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.000
 or the networks as you are welcome to 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.320
 fifth chapter of android advanced today 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.719
 I 'm going to teach you how to modify a 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.970
 system parameter that will improve a lot 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.460
 the user experience with our 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.560
 mobile is a number which is 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.820
 flame of the density of the screen that 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.859
 now I will explain what is 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.210
 First of all, do not confuse 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.519
 with pixel density per inch 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.349
 in which we can not modify since 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.899
 is the relationship between the resolution of the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.910
 screen and the size of this the tension 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.820
 of the screen refers to the size 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.610
 of the elements of the titles 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.250
 of the buttons and now I will explain 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.110
 why it is useful before size the video 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.670
 of the screens that used android 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.649
 was 3.7 inches 4 and now I 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.750
 screen is 5 inches or even more 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.160
 it has happened that all the elements are 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.140
 have climbed 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.850
 and take advantage of the screens and this has 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.160
 been an error but thanks to this what 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.379
 we will be able to correct for example if 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.050
 There is s4000 zoom of a screen of 4 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.790
 peak and 13 inches and you see any 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.620
 application for example that of the settings 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.050
 you will realize that there are the same 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.820
 elements that simply here are more 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.290
 great and we do not buy screens 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.300
 because we are older cats but 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.790
 basically because we want to take advantage 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.130
 a larger screen so it's 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.469
 what I am going to teach you to do today 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.210
 He wants to see light and can do both 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.539
 Factory rice as in any 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.360
 Market Stall 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.140
 so it's definitely going to serve us all 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.939
 basically 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.310
 will go very well with those who have a 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.049
 4.5 inch screen or higher already 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.820
 which is where you are going to notice the change and if 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.159
 are you going to be able to really take advantage now 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.689
 yes the size of the screens so 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.759
 let's see how it is done 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.250
 modify this number is very simple 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.979
 once we have our mobile rooteado and 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.319
 whatever our rom we go to our 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.090
 file browser preferably in 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.490
 my case I will do it with is fair 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.530
 explorer which is the most complete that 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.750
 It is free once we're inside 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.009
 that go to the system folder that is in 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.830
 the root of the system 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.539
 in this case we will press here and here there is 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.479
 all folders not only those of 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.640
 external storage usb card here 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.730
 we will navigate to the folder that is called 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.950
 system then here there will be several 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.950
 folders and we'll look at the 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.680
 file called prop point build and 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.750
 we will open it with the editor there is 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.010
 I will surely do another chapter on 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.900
 this file which contains 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.790
 information about the device and that 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.980
 you can change that the truth is very 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.310
 useful but now we 're going to look at that 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.640
 number 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.260
 oslo approached a little so you see 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.900
 we will have to navigate down to 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.719
 that we find we will begin here 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.400
 until we find this row in the 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:49.359
 that says r 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:53.980
 I will leave it to you in writing ro punto sf 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:55.450
 point lfp low density equals and here the 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.060
 default number of your 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.150
 device in the case of not three to 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.340
 principle was 480 then so that it 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.769
 do you tell me if you want to 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.150
 example make and take better advantage of 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.519
 screen you will have to do the 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.950
 smaller elements then this 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.769
 number will be smaller let's change 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.730
 this number for example here and if at 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.919
 principle I had 480 I put for example 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.919
 420 now to change it I'll put 45 I'm going to 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:25.180
 put it as it was before 480 and once 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:27.260
 we have modified it 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.510
 We give you here to save 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.250
 says the file was saved so 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.739
 we just go out and so that 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.959
 changes take effect let's restart 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.510
 the device as you see now things 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.640
 they are much older as you see now is 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.470
 this is the default, this is good 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.420
 tonight on a motorbike 11 but the aroma is 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.970
 all the elements are of this same 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.019
 size now I'm going to put it here the 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.090
 right and left 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.069
 you are going to see it as I had it before 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.829
 a pixel density 60 points 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.079
 inferior as you see is extremely 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.659
 sad how big are the titles 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.159
 for a screen of this size as 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:04.250
 you see on the left you take advantage 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.720
 much better the size and so much in 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.459
 this application as in any other 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.290
 for example open in the two tweeters 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.819
 look here is the size of the bars 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.280
 higher by default with this 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.019
 application and the tweets do not fit 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.690
 not three tweets and on the left as 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.090
 You can fit between 4 and 5 so we go back 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.979
 here is a pretty abysmal difference 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.900
 and as you see edit it is very simple 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.669
 As I say, I do not recommend changing 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.500
 drastically the number but little by little 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.870
 so you can see how they are changing 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.760
 the elements and well this has been 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.930
 basically today's chapter I hope 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.759
 that have been of great help 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.130
 and as you will see, reducing that 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.479
 number what is the performance that 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.000
 you will have with your device 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.830
 it will increase quite a lot I hope that I have 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.780
 liked and as I say you are going to continue 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.550
 Now this series of android has advanced 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.840
 with more rhythm than before since I've had 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.729
 some problems but good is already 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.199
 everything solved so I hope that if 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.030
 you liked the video do not forget to give it 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.800
 a good like to help the community 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.810
 but android to keep growing day after 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.810
 day until next androids
