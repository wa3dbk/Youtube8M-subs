it's<00:03:22.079> all<00:03:22.349> smoke<00:03:22.739> and<00:03:22.949> mirrors<00:03:23.069> folks<00:03:23.729> but<00:03:24.470> my

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:26.419 
it's all smoke and mirrors folks but my

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:29.449 
it's all smoke and mirrors folks but my
guess<00:03:27.419> because<00:03:28.409> that's<00:03:28.620> what<00:03:28.799> we've<00:03:28.979> got<00:03:29.220> is

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
guess because that's what we've got is

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.210 
guess because that's what we've got is
that<00:03:30.239> we<00:03:30.689> are<00:03:30.959> doing<00:03:31.470> this<00:03:31.739> spike<00:03:32.009> is

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
that we are doing this spike is

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.110 
that we are doing this spike is
obviously<00:03:32.609> from<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.989> US<00:03:33.989> job<00:03:34.229> market<00:03:34.669> etc<00:03:35.669> is

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
obviously from the US job market etc is

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.270 
obviously from the US job market etc is
extra<00:03:36.419> spice<00:03:36.720> like<00:03:36.959> this<00:03:37.139> they<00:03:37.439> look<00:03:37.769> great<00:03:38.099> on

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280
