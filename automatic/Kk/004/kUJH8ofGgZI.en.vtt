know<00:01:42.210> maybe<00:01:42.359> I<00:01:42.479> put<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.719> secondary<00:01:43.079> on<00:01:43.229> I

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
know maybe I put the secondary on I

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.480 
know maybe I put the secondary on I
might<00:01:43.439> have<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.679> come<00:01:43.829> back<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.159> change<00:01:44.280> that

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
might have to come back and change that

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.590 
might have to come back and change that
later<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:44.850> we'll<00:01:44.939> see<00:01:45.090> what<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.299> looks<00:01:45.420> like

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
later but we'll see what that looks like

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.099 
later but we'll see what that looks like

xenon lights always look great horn just

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.690 
xenon lights always look great horn just
to<00:01:49.259> be<00:01:49.350> different<00:01:49.770> I'll<00:01:49.890> use<00:01:50.039> jasmine<00:01:50.490> one

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
to be different I'll use jasmine one

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.789 
to be different I'll use jasmine one
this<00:01:50.880> time<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.600> loop<00:01:51.780> oh<00:01:52.020> yeah<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.679> already

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
this time so the loop oh yeah I already

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.620 
this time so the loop oh yeah I already
did<00:01:52.950> lights<00:01:53.310> plate<00:01:53.670> yellow<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.090> black<00:01:54.270> love

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
there is a new metal as you guys see

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.539 
there is a new metal as you guys see
there<00:02:01.020> we<00:02:01.109> got<00:02:01.200> pure<00:02:01.469> gold<00:02:01.679> and<00:02:01.920> brushed<00:02:02.310> gold

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
there we got pure gold and brushed gold

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.730 
there we got pure gold and brushed gold
I<00:02:02.850> think<00:02:03.179> I<00:02:03.299> might<00:02:03.539> use<00:02:03.749> this<00:02:03.960> these<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.590> this

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
I think I might use this these on this

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.249 
I think I might use this these on this
car<00:02:04.979> these<00:02:05.429> look<00:02:05.640> awesome<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.240> pure<00:02:06.780> gold<00:02:07.020> if

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
car these look awesome so pure gold if

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.330 
car these look awesome so pure gold if
you're<00:02:07.380> wondering<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.799> difference<00:02:08.130> pure

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
you're wondering the difference pure

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.340 
you're wondering the difference pure
gold<00:02:08.550> looks<00:02:08.759> all<00:02:08.880> shiny<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.270> reflective<00:02:09.450> then

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
gold looks all shiny and reflective then

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.890 
gold looks all shiny and reflective then
when<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.560> see<00:02:10.740> it<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:10.979> switch<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.840> when<00:02:12.840> I

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
when you see it I switch it to when I

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.540 
when you see it I switch it to when I
switch<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.290> brushed<00:02:13.710> gold<00:02:13.950> it's<00:02:14.220> more<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.490> a

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
switch it to brushed gold it's more of a

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.160 
switch it to brushed gold it's more of a
matte<00:02:14.819> finish<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.510> which<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:15.750> actually<00:02:15.840> like

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
matte finish on it which I actually like

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.110 
matte finish on it which I actually like
a<00:02:16.200> lot<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.740> looks<00:02:16.920> really<00:02:17.280> really<00:02:17.490> nice<00:02:17.640> just

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
a lot that looks really really nice just

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.430 
a lot that looks really really nice just
like<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.360> other<00:02:18.480> brushed<00:02:18.810> medals<00:02:19.140> up<00:02:19.290> here

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
like the other brushed medals up here

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.750 
like the other brushed medals up here
they<00:02:19.530> all<00:02:19.650> kind<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.920> have<00:02:20.280> like<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.490> matte

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
they all kind of have like a matte

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.100 
they all kind of have like a matte
finish<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.150> them<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:21.510> definitely<00:02:21.630> brushed

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
finish to them so definitely brushed

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.850

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
their yo you see a pinstripe down the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.930 
their yo you see a pinstripe down the
middle<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.050> looks<00:02:40.170> good<00:02:40.440> um<00:02:41.160> now<00:02:41.670> for

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940

secondary<00:02:42.330> color<00:02:42.599> here's<00:02:42.870> oops<00:02:43.080> my<00:02:43.290> bad

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
secondary color here's oops my bad

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.990 
secondary color here's oops my bad
didn't<00:02:43.770> mean<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.950> back<00:02:44.130> of<00:02:44.340> there<00:02:44.580> now<00:02:44.910> we

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
didn't mean the back of there now we

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.600 
didn't mean the back of there now we
need<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> secondary<00:02:45.480> color<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.400> classics<00:02:47.400> I'm

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
need a secondary color so classics I'm

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.300 
need a secondary color so classics I'm
thinking<00:02:48.569> just<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.170> simple<00:02:49.560> gray<00:02:49.920> might<00:02:50.160> look

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
thinking just a simple gray might look

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.850 
thinking just a simple gray might look
nice<00:02:50.519> or<00:02:50.819> like<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.000> graphite<00:02:51.599> like<00:02:51.840> this<00:02:52.110> it's

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
nice or like a graphite like this it's

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.350 
nice or like a graphite like this it's
not<00:02:53.040> really<00:02:53.310> noticeable<00:02:53.670> but<00:02:53.819> it<00:02:53.970> does<00:02:54.150> get

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
not really noticeable but it does get

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.150 
not really noticeable but it does get
that<00:02:54.390> nice<00:02:54.750> gold<00:02:55.110> pearlescent<00:02:55.830> that's<00:02:55.980> on<00:02:56.069> the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
that nice gold pearlescent that's on the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.949 
that nice gold pearlescent that's on the
rest<00:02:56.370> of<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.580> car<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.000> it's<00:02:57.420> not<00:02:57.480> like<00:02:57.840> you

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
rest of the car and it's not like you

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.600 
rest of the car and it's not like you
know<00:02:58.080> making<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.440> whole<00:02:58.620> car<00:02:58.950> gold<00:02:59.220> actually

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
know making the whole car gold actually

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.320 
know making the whole car gold actually
that<00:02:59.730> looks<00:02:59.880> pretty<00:03:00.000> good

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330
