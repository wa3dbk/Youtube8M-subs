00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.619
 hello hello girl is today les 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.220
 I bring a makeup inspired by 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.420
 Jennifer Lopez in the Golden Globes or 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.270
 More or less toned makeup 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.860
 gray and lips nude but it is also 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.230
 ideal to use on any occasion 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.090
 so today we are going to see how 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.660
 this makeup is recreated so that 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.270
 you can also use it 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.860
 and we started immediately my loves the day 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.870
 today I used three pallets to 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.730
 create this group the first of it was 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.830
 the chocolate bar and I'm going to use this 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.900
 everything up here that is white or matt 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.120
 and it's called white college 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.280
 basically it's a chest and we're going to 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.290
 put on everything and winston the eyebrows to 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.190
 tap my loves and you to him 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.190
 more or less comfortable 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.640
 d 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.450
 the second was the expression of Kate and 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.390
 I will use the first one is the pp efe 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.990
 is a mauve brown with the brush 30 of 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.990
 sign 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.320
 and this is not going to be put in the way of 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.600
 transition in the eye socket in the 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.179
 high part of the achievement account we are going to 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.340
 blur this tone pretty well both 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:30.670
 in the lacrimal as in the external part 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.670
 Of the eye 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.000
 the next tone will be this dark gray 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.680
 that is called revolver also of lava 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.580
 stress and I'll use it with the brush 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.760
 and 25 stigma very similar to the 217 vimac 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.860
 and we're going to start blurring this tone 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.570
 already in the part of the eye socket in 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.910
 the central part and also in the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.460
 ends both on the outer end 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.580
 as also in the animal we pass it in 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.770
 shape of a forming more or less a 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.630
 circle around the eye this is not going 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.000
 to be very careful to be able to do what 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.010
 let's blur it pretty well because 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.130
 basically it's the total part of this 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.130
 material a pretty precise side 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.870
 the third palette will be the naked 1 the 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.340
 original and I will use this tone of 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.160
 the corner that is called 'the mental ' u 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.160
 which is a metallic or silver gray 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.200
 and we're going to put it in the same center 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.860
 of the mobile eyelid only in the center 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.860
 little touches 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.209
 more or less like that now with the brush 224 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.760
 of soeva let's use the same tone 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.620
 stir the dark gray and we're going to 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.410
 put on the two ends of the eye to 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.120
 further deepen this brush this 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.100
 precision was going to help the color get 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.650
 Concentrate exactly where we are 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.410
 putting and we get in all the eyelid 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.120
 that is not what we have 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.120
 then the final touches 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.200
 and now that we combine if it were 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.270
 necessary remember with smoking my 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.450
 loves is precisely mink of 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.890
 blur the tones very well 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.319
 now I'm going to use a black pencil 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.160
 pretty creamy this is glued and what 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.540
 I'm going to put both on the lacrimal of the eye 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.239
 without much care because this we are going to 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.840
 blur and also on the eyelashes 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.840
 higher 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.380
 with a pen brush then we go to 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.380
 blur the top 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.120
 I will be more or less a delineated 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.120
 vanished 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.250
 now then I'm going to prepare the skin 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.629
 I have a video about that is the one that 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.849
 I will leave in the information box 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.920
 that you have not seen it today 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.329
 using the order base but the 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.030
 used products will be all in the 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:09.930
 information box and if it is 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.359
 always with powder 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.989
 serious the skin list we continue with the 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:18.570
 eyes can use a tea tone of his 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.160
 for smoking a little longer part of 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.870
 the outer tabs that this step what 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.750
 You can do as much as you do 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.340
 want in the photo because I already had a balance 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.620
 enough in commission I will be more 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.560
 or less cautious and now I will use 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.940
 the tone stir in the part the 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.780
 eyelashes and on the upper lashes 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:42.170
 to finish deepening 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.170
 and the final details 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:48.760
 Now I'm going to use the virgin lathe 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.730
 the naked 1 in the lacrimal by way of 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.320
 dim lighting I do not think the 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.180
 makeup will carry a very illumination 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.270
 strong and also a little bit in the 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.590
 tabs in the dating box and in 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.970
 the tabs that I'm going to use are the 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:06.760
 of 6 thousand 523 this can not be left with 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.360
 a look like this eyelashes in mega 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.360
 tabs 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.630
 and we also clean then and for 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.180
 end with what the eyes are 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.830
 and then a little mask for 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.820
 Unify especially when the eyelashes 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.820
 new like this 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.200
 use as much mask as you want in this 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:32.289
 look is about made of some eyes 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.899
 powerless missing 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.430
 more or less like that we are now inhabited 

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:38.289
 we go to the face and it takes a very contour 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.599
 strong be used and dried nix 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.219
 for this purpose you can use any 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.930
 control or you have and do not forget 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:47.469
 of course the forehead already have a 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.879
 very good face itself in the color that 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:51.219
 than to use the reporter too 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:53.169
 others called telf and because already 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:55.770
 I had a steady tanned miles 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:59.550
 actually 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:02.009
 and illuminator of course that ice glow 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.470
 can not miss using the sofa feels 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:07.319
 more than the upper part of the grids 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.539
 you already know how this is going and in the 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:13.020
 jacket do not forget about flavors this 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:14.970
 look is about a lot of brightness in the 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.530
 upper and central part of the nose and with 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.759
 the rest of the brochita then we go to 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.979
 put a little on the chin and 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:23.810
 to blur the nose and in the central part 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.810
 of the SLR 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.520
 now then we go with the lips already 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.490
 they wear a nude tone so I use 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:35.620
 this pencil does not exceed you use one that 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.620
 be similar to your lips 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:42.270
 and as a labial I will use blanchett and 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:42.270
 of mac 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.590
 I'm going to put this lip a little bit 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:50.210
 touches more or less to cover a 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.210
 little lips basically 

00:06:53.809 --> 00:07:02.179
 and how will I use the turkish delight 

00:06:57.749 --> 00:07:04.469
 of maps I love your intro quote 

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:06.419
 the club always in the center of the 

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:08.369
 lips and in the cupid's arch part 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:10.229
 in the heart of the key then there 

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:12.359
 to lift the sides nicer 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:16.500
 and that's basically all my loves 

00:07:12.359 --> 00:07:20.120
 this is the look that has ended 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.120
 and that's what it looks like 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:26.169
 Y 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.169
 no no 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.240
 do not 

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:33.539
 remember that the lips can 

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:40.740
 use any color with these 

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:41.939
 eyes because they are neutral and that's how it has 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.919
 I hope you liked it 

00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:46.249
 what they put into practice and it will be 

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:48.079
 thing until next time if gentlemen 

00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:50.359
 do not forget to follow me also in mysteries 

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:51.919
 social in my other channels and that will be 

00:07:50.359 --> 00:07:54.069
 until next time 

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:54.069
 bye
