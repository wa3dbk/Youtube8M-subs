is<00:02:09.530> stuck<00:02:09.950> in<00:02:10.069> my<00:02:10.099> hair<00:02:10.429> there<00:02:10.610> we<00:02:10.700> go<00:02:10.819> and

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
is stuck in my hair there we go and

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.470 
is stuck in my hair there we go and
we're<00:02:11.900> going<00:02:12.080> to<00:02:12.170> be<00:02:12.260> making<00:02:12.439> these<00:02:12.769> adorable

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
we're going to be making these adorable

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.559 
we're going to be making these adorable
cute<00:02:14.480> polymer<00:02:15.050> clay<00:02:15.380> little<00:02:15.980> watermelon

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
cute polymer clay little watermelon

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.460 
cute polymer clay little watermelon
charms<00:02:17.740> they're<00:02:18.740> fun

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
charms they're fun

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.030 
charms they're fun
can<00:02:19.620> make<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.800> lot<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.160> them<00:02:20.550> at<00:02:20.790> once<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:22.040> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
can make a lot of them at once and the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.970 
can make a lot of them at once and the
technique<00:02:23.550> is<00:02:23.760> really<00:02:24.630> really<00:02:25.200> simple<00:02:25.590> we're

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
technique is really really simple we're

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.060 
technique is really really simple we're
going<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.430> be<00:02:26.550> using<00:02:26.820> let<00:02:27.690> me<00:02:27.870> show<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.590> here

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
going to be using let me show you here

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.070 
going to be using let me show you here
i'm<00:02:29.700> using<00:02:29.760> polymer<00:02:30.450> clay<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:30.810> i've<00:02:30.900> already

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
i'm using polymer clay and i've already

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.680 
i'm using polymer clay and i've already
conditioned<00:02:31.680> my<00:02:31.800> clay<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:33.420> we're<00:02:33.540> going<00:02:33.660> to

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
conditioned my clay and we're going to

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.360 
conditioned my clay and we're going to
using<00:02:33.990> what<00:02:34.080> we<00:02:34.170> call<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.380> skinner<00:02:34.740> blend<00:02:34.920> if

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
using what we call a skinner blend if

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.430 
using what we call a skinner blend if
you're<00:02:35.940> familiar<00:02:36.120> with<00:02:36.420> polymer<00:02:37.080> clay<00:02:37.110> you're

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
you're familiar with polymer clay you're

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.650 
you're familiar with polymer clay you're
familiar<00:02:37.650> with<00:02:37.920> Skinner<00:02:38.310> blends<00:02:38.610> if<00:02:38.880> not<00:02:39.270> this

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
familiar with Skinner blends if not this

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.660 
familiar with Skinner blends if not this
is<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.900> great<00:02:40.200> opportunity<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:41.070> take<00:02:41.340> one<00:02:41.550> of

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
is a great opportunity to take one of

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.790 
is a great opportunity to take one of
the<00:02:41.760> craft<00:02:41.970> Tech<00:02:42.150> University<00:02:42.300> classes<00:02:42.960> but

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
the craft Tech University classes but

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.260 
the craft Tech University classes but
with<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.100> skinner<00:02:44.400> blend<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.820> can<00:02:44.850> see<00:02:45.240> that

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
with the skinner blend you can see that

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.750 
with the skinner blend you can see that
it's<00:02:45.690> dark<00:02:46.080> on<00:02:46.380> one<00:02:46.470> end<00:02:46.950> it's<00:02:47.160> actually

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
it's dark on one end it's actually

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.340 
it's dark on one end it's actually
blending<00:02:48.150> two<00:02:48.360> colors<00:02:48.660> of<00:02:48.810> clay<00:02:49.020> together

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
blending two colors of clay together

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.670 
blending two colors of clay together
that<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.710> red<00:02:50.240> kind<00:02:51.240> of<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.450> cherry<00:02:51.930> red<00:02:52.020> color

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
that a red kind of a cherry red color

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.490 
that a red kind of a cherry red color
here<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.420> I've<00:02:54.420> blended<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:54.990> with<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.260> white

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
here and I've blended it with the white

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.270 
here and I've blended it with the white
so<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:55.950> grades<00:02:56.520> so<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:57.390> goes<00:02:57.540> from<00:02:57.720> white<00:02:58.280> clear

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
so it grades so it goes from white clear

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.920 
so it grades so it goes from white clear
down<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.700> read<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.270> this<00:03:00.390> is<00:03:00.510> what<00:03:00.600> we<00:03:00.690> call<00:03:00.840> it

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
down to read and this is what we call it

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.590 
down to read and this is what we call it
Skinner<00:03:01.170> blood<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.740> I<00:03:02.610> rolled<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.420> through

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
Skinner blood and I rolled it through

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.270 
Skinner blood and I rolled it through
the<00:03:03.720> pasta<00:03:03.900> machine<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.590> made<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.709> really<00:03:05.010> long

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
the pasta machine and made a really long

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.420 
the pasta machine and made a really long
sheet<00:03:05.760> oh<00:03:06.410> my<00:03:07.410> camera<00:03:07.680> up<00:03:07.770> just<00:03:08.070> a<00:03:08.250> little<00:03:08.340> bit

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
sheet oh my camera up just a little bit

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.340 
sheet oh my camera up just a little bit
more<00:03:08.670> so<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:08.880> can<00:03:09.030> see<00:03:09.209> this<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.720> what<00:03:10.260> I'm

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
more so you can see this and what I'm

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.440 
more so you can see this and what I'm
going<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.590> do<00:03:10.920> is<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.730> sheet<00:03:11.940> is<00:03:12.060> probably

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
going to do is the sheet is probably

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.960 
going to do is the sheet is probably
about<00:03:12.630> six<00:03:13.170> seven<00:03:13.470> inches<00:03:13.709> long<00:03:13.980> I'm<00:03:14.730> going<00:03:14.880> to

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
about six seven inches long I'm going to

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.330 
about six seven inches long I'm going to
take<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.240> light<00:03:15.450> in<00:03:15.660> here<00:03:16.050> and<00:03:16.320> I'm<00:03:17.190> just

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
take the light in here and I'm just

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.860 
take the light in here and I'm just
going<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.550> roll<00:03:17.730> this<00:03:17.880> up<00:03:18.090> like<00:03:18.330> you<00:03:18.480> would<00:03:18.690> if

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
going to roll this up like you would if

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.870 
going to roll this up like you would if
you<00:03:18.900> are<00:03:19.050> making<00:03:19.230> cinnamon<00:03:19.830> rolls<00:03:20.130> or<00:03:20.430> jelly

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
you are making cinnamon rolls or jelly

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.900 
you are making cinnamon rolls or jelly
or<00:03:21.480> jelly<00:03:21.840> roll<00:03:22.050> and<00:03:23.010> it's<00:03:23.220> actually<00:03:23.610> what<00:03:23.760> we

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
or jelly roll and it's actually what we

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.580 
or jelly roll and it's actually what we
what<00:03:24.360> we<00:03:24.390> call<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.720> jelly<00:03:25.019> roll<00:03:25.110> so<00:03:25.380> this<00:03:25.500> is

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
what we call a jelly roll so this is

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.780 
what we call a jelly roll so this is
going<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.739> go<00:03:25.860> out<00:03:25.920> of<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.100> camera<00:03:26.459> here<00:03:26.640> and

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
going to go out of the camera here and

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.430 
going to go out of the camera here and
we<00:03:26.850> pull<00:03:27.060> this<00:03:27.150> back<00:03:27.360> and<00:03:27.690> I'm<00:03:28.080> just<00:03:28.200> rolling

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
we pull this back and I'm just rolling

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.110 
we pull this back and I'm just rolling
it<00:03:28.769> from<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.130> light<00:03:29.459> edge<00:03:30.350> to<00:03:31.580> the<00:03:32.580> dark<00:03:32.850> edge

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
it from the light edge to the dark edge

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.259 
it from the light edge to the dark edge
and<00:03:33.590> it<00:03:34.590> just<00:03:34.769> simply<00:03:34.920> makes<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.519> log<00:03:35.820> you<00:03:36.090> can

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
and it just simply makes a log you can

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.140 
and it just simply makes a log you can
see<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.840> center<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.500> lighter<00:03:37.890> and<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.790> kind<00:03:39.060> of

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
see the center is lighter and it kind of

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.720 
see the center is lighter and it kind of
gets<00:03:39.300> a<00:03:39.510> light<00:03:40.140> pink<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.709> then<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.280> goes<00:03:41.430> all

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
gets a light pink and then it goes all

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.900 
gets a light pink and then it goes all
the<00:03:41.760> way<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.269> red<00:03:42.530> so<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.620> complete<00:03:44.070> this<00:03:44.550> I

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
the way to the red so to complete this I

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.570 
the way to the red so to complete this I
have<00:03:45.239> another<00:03:45.830> sheet<00:03:46.830> of<00:03:46.860> clay<00:03:47.190> here<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.550> I

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
have another sheet of clay here that I

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.009 
have another sheet of clay here that I
rolled<00:03:47.790> out<00:03:47.940> on<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.120> pasta<00:03:48.480> machine<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:48.959> I

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
rolled out on the pasta machine and I

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.840 
rolled out on the pasta machine and I
tend<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.320> roll<00:03:49.500> my<00:03:49.650> sheets<00:03:49.950> pretty<00:03:50.310> thin<00:03:50.610> it

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
tend to roll my sheets pretty thin it

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.900 
tend to roll my sheets pretty thin it
just<00:03:51.060> kind<00:03:51.269> of<00:03:51.299> depends<00:03:51.630> on<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:52.680> size<00:03:52.860> of<00:03:53.250> the

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
just kind of depends on the size of the

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.050 
just kind of depends on the size of the
cane<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:55.380> we're<00:03:55.590> making<00:03:55.739> this<00:03:56.700> is<00:03:56.880> rolled

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
cane that we're making this is rolled

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.509 
cane that we're making this is rolled
out<00:03:57.209> on<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.390> number<00:03:57.780> or<00:03:57.930> two<00:03:58.200> on<00:03:58.530> an<00:03:58.680> amicus<00:03:59.340> to

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
out on a number or two on an amicus to

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.100 
out on a number or two on an amicus to
machine<00:03:59.850> which<00:04:00.060> means<00:04:00.330> it's<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.690> second

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
machine which means it's the second

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.440 
machine which means it's the second
thinnest<00:04:01.440> setting<00:04:01.769> and<00:04:02.160> I'm<00:04:02.970> just<00:04:03.120> going<00:04:03.239> to

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
thinnest setting and I'm just going to

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:11.120 
thinnest setting and I'm just going to
wrap<00:04:03.720> this<00:04:04.049> around<00:04:05.540> my<00:04:06.620> log<00:04:09.320> and<00:04:10.320> as<00:04:10.950> I<00:04:11.070> was

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
wrap this around my log and as I was

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.949 
wrap this around my log and as I was
saying<00:04:11.400> earlier<00:04:11.580> this<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.209> project<00:04:12.840> was

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
saying earlier this and project was

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.840 
saying earlier this and project was
inspired<00:04:13.530> by<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.739> road<00:04:14.010> trip<00:04:14.190> we<00:04:14.400> happened<00:04:14.820> to

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
back to the project I wrapped the white

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.810 
back to the project I wrapped the white
sheet<00:04:45.600> of<00:04:45.720> clay<00:04:45.870> around<00:04:46.380> my<00:04:47.040> skinner<00:04:47.640> blend

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
sheet of clay around my skinner blend

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.330 
sheet of clay around my skinner blend
log<00:04:48.180> and<00:04:48.510> now<00:04:49.170> i'm<00:04:49.440> going<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:49.740> put<00:04:49.980> the<00:04:50.130> green

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
log and now i'm going to put the green

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.980 
log and now i'm going to put the green
i'm<00:04:50.580> going<00:04:50.700> to<00:04:50.760> do<00:04:50.820> this<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:51.180> exact<00:04:51.540> same<00:04:51.780> way

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
i'm going to do this the exact same way

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.210 
i'm going to do this the exact same way
so<00:04:52.350> see<00:04:52.950> there's<00:04:53.160> nothing<00:04:53.430> difficult<00:04:53.670> about

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
so see there's nothing difficult about

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.970 
so see there's nothing difficult about
this<00:04:56.690> it's<00:04:57.690> kind<00:04:57.900> of<00:04:58.020> like<00:04:58.200> putting<00:04:58.470> pieces<00:04:58.740> of

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
this it's kind of like putting pieces of

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.170 
this it's kind of like putting pieces of
a<00:04:59.160> puzzle<00:04:59.340> together<00:05:00.200> and<00:05:01.910> where<00:05:02.910> the<00:05:03.030> two

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
a puzzle together and where the two

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.240 
a puzzle together and where the two
pieces<00:05:03.390> of<00:05:03.660> clay<00:05:03.870> come<00:05:04.140> together<00:05:04.560> then<00:05:04.830> I<00:05:04.950> just

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
pieces of clay come together then I just

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.310 
pieces of clay come together then I just
trim<00:05:05.790> them<00:05:05.850> off<00:05:06.030> I<00:05:06.390> need<00:05:06.630> to<00:05:06.750> turn<00:05:06.960> this<00:05:07.080> off<00:05:07.290> a

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
trim them off I need to turn this off a

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.990 
trim them off I need to turn this off a
little<00:05:07.500> bit<00:05:07.650> more<00:05:12.680> all<00:05:13.680> right<00:05:13.890> so<00:05:14.850> you<00:05:14.910> get

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
little bit more all right so you get

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.870 
little bit more all right so you get
something<00:05:15.300> that<00:05:15.390> looks<00:05:15.450> like<00:05:15.720> this<00:05:16.010> okay<00:05:17.010> most

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
something that looks like this okay most

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.340 
something that looks like this okay most
important<00:05:18.330> thing<00:05:18.480> is<00:05:18.690> when<00:05:18.870> you<00:05:18.960> when<00:05:19.320> you

slices so pretty easy and to put the
seeds<00:06:03.090> on<00:06:03.360> we<00:06:03.810> can<00:06:03.930> actually<00:06:04.110> you<00:06:04.500> can<00:06:04.650> you<00:06:05.040> can

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
seeds on we can actually you can you can

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.550 
seeds on we can actually you can you can
actually<00:06:05.490> gain<00:06:05.880> the<00:06:06.090> seeds<00:06:06.360> inside<00:06:06.960> the<00:06:07.290> clay
