00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.290
 and 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.090
 equal to all simple south welcome guy 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.010
 we are going with a new online combat and this 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.080
 Once I am going to introduce my second 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.900
 physical sweeper we've talked about 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.970
 very much of prime but until then 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.160
 until today, it had not yet been 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.750
 seen at least bluntly shine 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.510
 a little bit more to my second physics the 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.640
 sweater that is bone falan this pokemon 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.410
 it's very shaded by taurus since 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.330
 It has more speed and acts better 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.710
 physics say the sweater but I 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.050
 the truth is that it is euros I like 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.760
 much worried that hair has been what 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.100
 make forum is that pokemon that 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.930
 physically it looks like a bestiality of 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.790
 Pokemon has a lot of strength in itself 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.739
 I like that pokemon so big and it hits 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.690
 a lot with my tiny and so 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.159
 harmless as it seems and I picked it up as 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.110
 second physical sweeper because also 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:51.150
 I covered what was not covered by prime aid 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.150
 therefore in this combat you will see 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.129
 how between eden and bufa land can 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.500
 do a lot of damage because they should can 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.960
 make up for what he lacks buff alan that 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.510
 it's a bit of speed and if you put a 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.460
 Boyfriend paralysis can go out and do 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.799
 a lot of pupil so guys in this 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.960
 combat I will present to buffon before the 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.330
 barbarian and I hope you like it as much as 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.220
 to me this second 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.440
 let's go with the guys I get my first 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.450
 pokemon that is in the harmless sweet 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.700
 of harmless poison has nothing and 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.560
 minimal removes saber and I'm calm 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.940
 because it is not the first time which is 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.590
 has faced look at found some 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.570
 saber and uses trick 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.760
 look very very attentive to what happens 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.920
 between nobody and saber and it happens to me happens to me 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.380
 the star toxin and so it remains to me 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.880
 bible the two stars act upside down 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.080
 what remains instead of giving me life what 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.540
 does is remove one-eighth of my 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.640
 ps used static cheeks what paralyzed him 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.410
 but she goes bible what she does is 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.150
 activate fixes is activated and lose the 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.979
 object very attentive to this and about the 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.330
 physical defense why because I 've 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.009
 stuck static moffett which is an attack 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.810
 physical and the then star I started to 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.270
 hurt me, they lower my mix a little 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.680
 ps I understand fire fatuo the keyword 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.930
 thank goodness that makes me count more 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.360
 and he used charm because you think he does not 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.950
 they must to have saber and to dodge 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.660
 some mockery has to have at least one 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.610
 attack that takes off and most normally 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.530
 It's usually disarming, as is the case with me 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.479
 saber and the two stars returns to 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.280
 hurting me is paralyzed and this 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.620
 makes me give me a turn that I do 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.090
 guys load remember boy this one yes 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.950
 which is defensive disdain 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.670
 this one is the defensive had more life 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.340
 can not fix 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.870
 how fast is 104 and 3 and this has 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.880
 173 64 dps 174 pss is the defensive 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.800
 I use cargo I get special defense and 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.030
 this time it does give me the will to fire and 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.500
 the fire star cough facto go to 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.120
 start getting dizzy enough I thought that 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.310
 under the physical attack I have to 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.690
 try to start hitting like this with load 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.489
 for a ball he puts a load for now 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.410
 what is not wrong is not for nothing 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.360
 wrong the life that took him away and I make me 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.590
 cure a little more of my ps if you 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.150
 you fix I do not take it off so much because this one 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.489
 defensive denzel like I said but 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.519
 well I can hold on and it seems that 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.739
 is stable and full is in life 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.170
 and in physical defense he has done it very 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.630
 tank I will use cargo I get on the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.090
 special defense again is worth one and 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.890
 or the same charge for ball I know that 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.130
 give you not the time that attention is paid to 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.540
 these guys disarm disarm is supposed 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.430
 that has to have the object takes away 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.340
 the fire for your life but fixed guys 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.000
 latok crashes does not have it again 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.280
 the latok crashes if the carrier that 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.230
 I had it, I had it, I had it 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.660
 it happened to me at first and my opponent 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.110
 uses a contact attack is removed 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.360
 life up there all good 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.190
 if he does not already have the object 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.110
 transfer again as you have spent the 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.370
 berry bible that was for me the spent 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.530
 in the beginning after same dt 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.350
 static what it does is that cough and 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.530
 star returns to him and his same medicine 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.230
 guys it ends with him the same neighbor that 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.300
 I try to put my top for you and the 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.310
 two to star ends with his saber since 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.710
 percent boy knows he was a pixel 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.660
 of life fixes alex flinn according 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.100
 because a flying ghost and he did 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.690
 both ship freight super effective and 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.450
 very intelligent he paralyzed But look 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.000
 what makes guys active is activated 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.350
 the insurance very dangerous weakness is 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.720
 the attack goes up a lot and the attack 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.400
 special a lot and usually dribling 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.600
 luck in the light skill that 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.880
 it would also increase the speed a 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.709
 lots but thank goodness I've been ready 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.260
 and I did not put a load for ball I put a 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.790
 static freight and this is worth a lot 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.579
 it's going to save my life 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.169
 notice that pokemon comes out then go back to 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.430
 the cndh the barbarian 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.320
 the incredible will return that is 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.480
 in love with the sunken a cruel point 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.490
 I have the audacious ability that goes up a 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.710
 20% of that force of attacks that 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.270
 receives the record and is not less guys not 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.510
 receive but receive skill bowles 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.910
 of skill 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.250
 hey, he has put buff alan 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.840
 it was just a blow send to dribling 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.760
 directly home that is very effective from 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.980
 cruel vote beat more skill the more the 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.160
 beast force that has that buff alan 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.810
 outside and attention titans fight 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.610
 rodrigones a bit very similar in being 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.890
 to buchanan pretty defense pretty 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.500
 Special strawberry pretty attack but little 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.930
 fixed speed that ram lmt of land 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.570
 pokÃ©mon that has little to nothing 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.910
 physical defense leaves him just one hit 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.890
 makes an air strike this is not 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.660
 enough to take down the beast of 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.040
 balls that I have leftovers for you 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.720

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.610
 to be seen a little more and thanks to that 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.650
 endured several times in combat 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.140
 again used the second ram that's going 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:17.940
 straight to the head of dragon and guys
