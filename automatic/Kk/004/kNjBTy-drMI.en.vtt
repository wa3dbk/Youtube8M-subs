00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.610
 Hello, how are you? 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.490
 better and so good the extra a 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.830
 tutorial you can say that apart is 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.300
 say without prior in any way or anything 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.180
 but this tutorial has asked me 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.250
 enough people and enough times 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.930
 because many people believe him to 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.580
 that would be the menca force already 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.980
 many people like the mantra force by 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.900
 that unfortunately many of the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.090
 good modes use this minecraft 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.379
 force so they can work and then 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.360
 a lot of you stay watching and says 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.580
 It's not that I do not, I do not know that I failed but 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.370
 you believe me and minecraft the truth then 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.019
 I do not know what happened but one decided 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.000
 do for that an individual tutorial of 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.640
 how to install minecraft force already for the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.979
 version 1.5 and here on this page that 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.540
 they come 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:00.220
 all versions as you can see and 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.979
 there are many, this is practically 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.870
 they are taking everything that goes on being 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.850
 Minecraft force and van Stride 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.800
 releasing version by version every time 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.270
 the update bring out a new 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.980
 and this is the best page for 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.140
 find me in kfor for my point of 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.700
 seen as you can see it just came out 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.630
 version 1.5 and look at all there 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.740
 all of these are 1.5 obviously the one 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.600
 is up is the most updated 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.430
 the one that is down to the bottom was the one that 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.710
 a first take two and in order 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.330
 and I even think that here is the dates and 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.290
 here is the date for you 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.360
 go see and 7-6 if you are watching the 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.330
 date and everything is very good the first thing that 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.630
 let's do as you can see there are three 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.270
 things to download universal src and 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.740
 taken then simply 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.720
 I recommend the universal not because the 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.800
 version that comes complete and that does not 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.740
 they have to have failures with this one 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.260
 then we click here Universal 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.520
 its version in my case 1.5 and the one that is 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.490
 up if you have the 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.259
 version 1.4 points 7 then they were in 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.399
 which is up to the 1.4 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.500
 7 points of life that is the most 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.619
 updated and the one with the least book 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.450
 ximena less complications not then 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.910
 Well, in our case, it's going to be this 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.830
 universal do not give here to fly 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.090
 it's just a page where 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.400
 we have to wait 5 seconds of 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.750
 advertising do not give this case anymore 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.970
 experience five seconds here up to 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.130
 the right as you can see and throw alter 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.660
 advertising is automatically going to 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.990
 start to download your main card force 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.370
 in a zip file 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.100
 all we have to do is 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.660
 extract it and put it in our folder 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.180
 but I do not know much of you misfortune 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.640
 I will not tell you what they need 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.530
 do so you do not believe them then 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.240
 then good because to me almost never of 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.460
 create the mods with minecraft force 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.020
 but very much you and and as I say no 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.050
 so then we are not want home 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.090
 we put percent app data percent 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.920
 for users who use windows 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.960
 xp here side you have to appear 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.760
 execute and there you put the percent 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.740
 pp-a percent is not going to the 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.880
 folder roaming the folder point 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.290
 minecraft here is in the bean folder 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.810
 minecraft right click to open with 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.930
 windows archiver have to have a 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.320
 extractor like winrar or seven sheet 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.090
 then they just open it with winrar 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.410
 and we can close everything besides anything else you 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.480
 we need this minecraft folder 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.490
 hard background as a folder is found 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.650
 it takes years that are capital letters these are 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.810
 they have to make sure to eliminate it 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.460
 limina and ready that is not there because if 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.890
 not because it is one of the reasons why 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.610
 why they create the minecraft when 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.350
 you put a mod 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.660
 so then we also open here force 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.810
 As it is considered, many will come 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.670
 records 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.170
 similar to those that are here within the 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.670
 heart point sleeve that are class point 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.709
 then what we have to do with 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.020
 these files is to pass all those that 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.760
 have in and copy them to the bank 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.890
 he aimed hard since the mind point garden 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.959
 ours as our main crown or itself 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.940
 then we simply select 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.060
 everything to select everything in a way 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.920
 easier they can press Control more 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.390
 this one select all this way since 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.590
 so selected does not matter if 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.569
 you are selecting that folder from the 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.250
 little dots nothing happens we spent 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.989
 minecraft hard point of preference here 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.780
 down and every day you can enter a 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:09.049
 folder and we'll accept it let's wait 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.910
 so everything happens and we can 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.319
 tool force as they realize 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.700
 well, there would not be ballads here 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.620
 teach them something like this in mind 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.320
 has a new meta folder report 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.750
 what force is this and automatically 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.310
 it was passed to here for that meta folder 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.620
 says it's different from the first one 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.750
 we eliminate carry that here is the 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.550
 minecraft force not but still this is 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.250
 optional they can not erase it or they can 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.010
 leave but I prefer to delete the by itself 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.570
 the doubts then that is optional not 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.569
 it makes them what kind but I always the 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.210
 erased in case the doubts 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.770
 obviously there are many ways to 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.309
 many many things that happen when 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.569
 creation mode is that automatically 

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:47.900
 it may be that your 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:49.910
 Java 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.490
 and that with these bikes can happen that 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.650
 as you can see there is loading this 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.729
 little window left there has the cup of 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.490
 tea 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:01.189
 from the java obviously then you can 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.479
 be something of that may be that you are 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:04.370
 well gotten some way that is not 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.020
 compatible with banking force there is also 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.460
 modes that are not compatible then 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.419
 make sure you wanted to install menca 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.909
 force 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:13.580
 has a clean minecraft folder 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:16.669
 that has nothing in any way or anything 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.770
 that everything is as it normally is and 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.419
 they install first traffic lights and since 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.979
 install the minecraft force van first 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.229
 to install later the mossos that 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.360
 you want but make sure that 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.249
 first be minecraft force and this one 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.990
 Minecraft force universal brings the module 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:32.300
 of the then do not come to put the module of 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.039
 the part of life that they get module of 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.870
 limancar force can also create 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.729
 because the minecraft force already comes with 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.149
 mother does not need to be put two 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:43.699
 Sometimes then, as you can see, there is 

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:45.499
 loading we have to wait for that to 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:49.830
 load this bar so that our 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:51.540
 minecraft and start and everything is fine 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.580
 and obviously they also have to 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.380
 install the most recent version as 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.720
 I tell them the one that is up to the top because 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.960
 that is the one that has fewer books and the one that 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.750
 can you create less then not here 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.970
 it is as you can see it is already according to this 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.400
 active of our minecraft force we give 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:12.070
 click here we already have it we have not created 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.210
 nothing can we create a world as it is 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.220
 and there does not have to be any problem 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.230
 true and any way that requires 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.420
 minecraft force put it after and not 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:22.900
 there have to be failures here we are like 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.940
 if nothing new problems a pum pum pum and 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.370
 Well, if this tutorial I wanted to do it 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.870
 individual for those people who 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.100
 every time the scratch is likely has 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.940
 helped 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.550
 here we can close our minecraft 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.110
 for that it is because it is like ensure 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.449
 leave a like a comment and a 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.740
 favorite if I help them 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:42.150
 and also the descriptions of 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.620
 secondary communicators my twitter and 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.650
 facebook that follow me there 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.120
 want and that has been all as they were 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:51.740
 I had said is because they liked us 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.740
 let's go to the next one and goodbye
