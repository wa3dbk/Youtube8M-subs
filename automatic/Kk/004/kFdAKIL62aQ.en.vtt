 with cerebral palsy 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.809
 the struggle to live well has been so successful 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.670
 that she became a photographic model 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.010

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.120
 five years is an example of overcoming 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.390

 desire to walk the routine of nicole

 creativity in the family finds 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.380
 needed to follow here in 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:17.540

 chaco is emma including one thing that 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.030
 stimulates the therapists themselves who 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.189
 they take care of her because it's a job 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.439
 can also have other 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.119
 they come at will determination and Nicole 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.090
 he reconciled he just wanted to do more and 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.430
 more for her every new gesture she makes 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.990
 it is very gratifying that we see that 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.159
 the rest will have to give 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.250
 result right 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.320
 and activities do not stop there and with 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.939
 he was always determined and part of the 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.860
 development is due to 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.540
 equine therapy is an activity that she 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.090
 started with only one year and four months 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.890
 and is part of the routine until today is a 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.170
 therapy that uses the horse to 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.950
 develop the posture and balance of the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.340
 student 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:03.060
 the results are amazing 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.430
 from the beginning she had a 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.979
 very significant improvement in the 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.950
 balance motor coordination strength 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.480
 and it is an activity that it has 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.879
 or bring to make nicole does not stop 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.980
 to dream and fulfill dreams for two 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.950
 months she was invited to make a 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.040
 photoshoot the photos were 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:29.920

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.909

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.610
 for more flashes more challenges and the mother 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:49.299
 who is always there together does not think 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:54.280
 only on success but on treatment 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:56.140
 I am quite sure that despite the 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.599
 doctors say that cerebral palsy does not 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.459
 There is healing but I'm sure God 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.040
 God will move mountains will do 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.620
 something that comes here really 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.940
 come and bring her with a better life 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.940
 and that it will give really 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.140
 That's cute, of course, it's all going to work. 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.880
