00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.449 
that we're gonna look at here is the
value<00:02:17.130> for<00:02:17.370> dollars<00:02:18.980> because<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.130> could<00:02:20.310> get

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
value for dollars because I could get

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.620 
value for dollars because I could get
I'm<00:02:20.670> pretty<00:02:20.850> sure<00:02:20.940> they<00:02:21.060> had<00:02:21.209> something

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
I'm pretty sure they had something

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.110 
I'm pretty sure they had something
special<00:02:21.780> two<00:02:22.470> four<00:02:22.680> four<00:02:22.890> crew<00:02:23.519> sandwich<00:02:23.970> so

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
special two four four crew sandwich so

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.690 
special two four four crew sandwich so
you<00:02:24.209> actually<00:02:24.329> get<00:02:24.570> two<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:24.810> them<00:02:25.079> for<00:02:25.579> $4<00:02:26.579> so

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
you actually get two of them for $4 so

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.430 
you actually get two of them for $4 so
it's<00:02:26.790> almost<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.030> same<00:02:27.180> price<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.260> think

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
it's almost the same price and I think

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.050 
it's almost the same price and I think
there's<00:02:28.590> sausage<00:02:28.769> croutons<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.700> everything

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
there's sausage croutons and everything

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.890 
there's sausage croutons and everything
so<00:02:30.799> whether<00:02:31.799> I<00:02:32.239> think<00:02:33.239> that's<00:02:33.540> probably<00:02:33.840> a

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
so whether I think that's probably a

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.960 
so whether I think that's probably a
better<00:02:34.019> deal<00:02:34.489> but<00:02:35.489> then<00:02:35.610> again<00:02:35.730> you're

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
better deal but then again you're

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.830 
better deal but then again you're
missing<00:02:36.209> out<00:02:36.299> on<00:02:36.329> the<00:02:36.540> bacon<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.049> the<00:02:37.170> ham<00:02:38.840> we

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
missing out on the bacon and the ham we

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.890 
missing out on the bacon and the ham we
do<00:02:39.989> put<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> lot<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.500> cheese<00:02:40.530> on<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.040> one<00:02:41.340> I
