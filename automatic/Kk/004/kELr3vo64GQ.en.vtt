in a Nissan Murano the first step before
you<00:00:16.980> start<00:00:17.310> installing<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.910> very<00:00:18.180> important

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
you start installing is very important

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.270 
you start installing is very important
we<00:00:18.810> want<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.140> make<00:00:19.289> sure<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.860> headrest

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:20.280 
we want to make sure that the headrest

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.609 
we want to make sure that the headrest
monitor<00:00:20.789> will<00:00:21.000> fit<00:00:21.359> within<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.960> vehicle<00:00:22.439> and

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
monitor will fit within the vehicle and

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.870 
monitor will fit within the vehicle and
so<00:00:23.340> there's<00:00:23.580> two<00:00:23.640> things<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.539> want<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.929> check

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
so there's two things you want to check

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.609 
so there's two things you want to check
the<00:00:26.880> first<00:00:27.179> thing<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.599> want<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.869> check<00:00:27.929> is<00:00:28.349> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the first thing you want to check is the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.840 
the first thing you want to check is the
distance<00:00:29.189> between<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.910> two<00:00:30.089> posts<00:00:31.850> because

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
distance between the two posts because

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.300 
distance between the two posts because
every<00:00:33.270> vehicle<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.990> slightly<00:00:34.410> different<00:00:34.860> this

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.310 
every vehicle is slightly different this

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.010 
every vehicle is slightly different this
is<00:00:35.430> important<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.030> want<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.300> make<00:00:36.450> sure<00:00:36.480> that

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
is important we want to make sure that

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.560 
is important we want to make sure that
ours<00:00:37.260> will<00:00:37.560> adjust<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.670> fit<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:39.090> distance

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
ours will adjust to fit this distance

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.020 
ours will adjust to fit this distance
and<00:00:39.720> for<00:00:40.380> this<00:00:40.500> vehicle<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> distance<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.670> six

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
and for this vehicle the distance is six

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.080 
and for this vehicle the distance is six
inches<00:00:42.180> apart<00:00:42.630> Center<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.530> Center<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
inches apart Center to Center and the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.180 
inches apart Center to Center and the
headrest<00:00:45.540> monitors<00:00:46.140> we're<00:00:46.350> going<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.740> install

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
headrest monitors we're going to install

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.400 
headrest monitors we're going to install
today<00:00:47.610> will<00:00:48.210> adjust<00:00:48.600> from<00:00:48.930> four<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.380> half

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
today will adjust from four and a half

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.380 
today will adjust from four and a half
inches<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.250> seven<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.790> three-quarters

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
inches to seven and three-quarters

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.200 
inches to seven and three-quarters
inches<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.900> six<00:00:52.230> inches<00:00:52.590> works<00:00:52.950> perfect<00:00:53.850> works

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
inches so six inches works perfect works

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.500 
inches so six inches works perfect works
great<00:00:54.830> okay<00:00:55.830> the<00:00:56.430> second<00:00:56.880> thing<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:57.210> want<00:00:57.240> to

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
see before installing these is how the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.380 
see before installing these is how the
color<00:01:00.810> looks<00:01:01.230> will<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> color<00:01:01.980> match<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.150 
ordering we will ship you a material
sample<00:01:11.940> if<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:13.050> that<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:13.920> check

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
sample if you like so that you can check

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.980 
sample if you like so that you can check
it<00:01:14.370> to<00:01:14.550> see<00:01:14.580> if<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.940> matches<00:01:15.120> your<00:01:15.450> vehicle

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
it to see if it matches your vehicle

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.680 
it to see if it matches your vehicle
because<00:01:16.530> once<00:01:17.340> these<00:01:17.520> are<00:01:17.730> open<00:01:18.150> it's<00:01:18.270> really

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
because once these are open it's really

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.600 
because once these are open it's really
hard<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.140> do<00:01:19.290> anything<00:01:19.500> about<00:01:19.740> replacing<00:01:20.490> them

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
hard to do anything about replacing them

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.910 
hard to do anything about replacing them
so<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.850> want<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> material<00:01:22.409> sample

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
so you want to get a material sample

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.770 
so you want to get a material sample
before<00:01:23.490> ordering<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.300> you're<00:01:24.450> concerned

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
before ordering if you're concerned

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.620 
before ordering if you're concerned
about<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.140> but<00:01:25.890> looking<00:01:26.250> at<00:01:26.370> this<00:01:26.630> color

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
about that but looking at this color

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.830 
about that but looking at this color
from<00:01:28.380> our<00:01:28.860> headrest<00:01:29.220> monitors<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.120> the<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
from our headrest monitors to the the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.020 
from our headrest monitors to the the
Nissan<00:01:31.260> they<00:01:31.590> look<00:01:31.770> pretty<00:01:31.980> darn<00:01:32.280> good<00:01:32.490> that's

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
Nissan they look pretty darn good that's

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.790 
Nissan they look pretty darn good that's
a<00:01:33.150> good<00:01:33.330> match<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.260> think<00:01:34.440> we're<00:01:34.650> going<00:01:34.740> to

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
a good match so I think we're going to

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.660 
a good match so I think we're going to
continue<00:01:35.330> installing<00:01:36.330> these<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> vehicle

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
continue installing these in the vehicle

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.899 
continue installing these in the vehicle
okay

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
okay

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.940 
okay
the<00:01:39.270> first<00:01:39.630> step<00:01:40.050> to<00:01:40.260> install<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.830> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the first step to install in the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.040 
the first step to install in the
headrest<00:01:41.280> monitors<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.940> to<00:01:42.300> remove<00:01:42.690> the

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
headrest monitors is to remove the

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.560 
headrest monitors is to remove the
existing<00:01:43.370> headrests<00:01:44.370> from<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.940> vehicle<00:01:45.420> and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
existing headrests from the vehicle and

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.990 
existing headrests from the vehicle and
to<00:01:46.229> make<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.560> easier<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.220> tipped<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.760> seats

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
to make this easier we tipped the seats

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.300 
to make this easier we tipped the seats
back<00:01:48.330> so<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.990> there<00:01:49.260> was<00:01:49.380> more<00:01:49.710> Headroom<00:01:50.159> on

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
back so that there was more Headroom on

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.340 
back so that there was more Headroom on
this<00:01:50.549> on<00:01:50.760> this<00:01:50.880> vehicle<00:01:51.330> but<00:01:51.780> basically

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
this on this vehicle but basically

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.310 
this on this vehicle but basically
pushing<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.130> clip<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.170> pulling<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
pushing that clip in and pulling the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.100 
pushing that clip in and pulling the
headrest<00:01:55.710> up<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.130> you're<00:01:56.940> actually<00:01:57.120> done<00:01:57.540> the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
headrest up and you're actually done the

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.080 
headrest up and you're actually done the
headrest<00:01:58.470> is<00:01:58.620> already<00:01:58.950> removed<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.940> we're

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
headrest is already removed so we're

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.149 
headrest is already removed so we're
going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.330> remove<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:01.110> existing<00:02:01.470> headrest

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
going to remove the existing headrest

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.450 
going to remove the existing headrest
from<00:02:03.060> both<00:02:03.299> sides<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.650> we<00:02:04.830> can<00:02:05.040> put<00:02:05.250> the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
from both sides so that we can put the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.960 
from both sides so that we can put the
headrest<00:02:06.090> monitors<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.470> next<00:02:07.830> step<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.280> to

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
headrest monitors in the next step is to

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.969 
headrest monitors in the next step is to
prepare<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.599> headrest<00:02:10.049> so<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:10.860> be

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
prepare the headrest so that it can be

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.800 
prepare the headrest so that it can be
installed<00:02:11.190> it's<00:02:11.549> very<00:02:11.760> simple<00:02:12.180> all<00:02:12.390> we<00:02:12.599> need

installed it's very simple all we need
to<00:02:12.959> do<00:02:13.109> is<00:02:13.349> untie<00:02:13.529> the<00:02:13.739> wires<00:02:14.069> that<00:02:14.400> came<00:02:14.609> with

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
to do is untie the wires that came with

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.880 
to do is untie the wires that came with
headrest<00:02:15.390> they're<00:02:15.569> tied<00:02:16.050> pretty<00:02:16.380> nicely<00:02:16.590> for

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
headrest they're tied pretty nicely for

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.380 
headrest they're tied pretty nicely for

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
whenever you're just as a tip whenever

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.160 
whenever you're just as a tip whenever
you<00:02:43.860> are<00:02:44.010> adjusting<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.819> head<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.209> posts<00:02:45.750> as

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
you are adjusting the head the posts as

you are adjusting the head the posts as
you<00:02:46.319> can<00:02:46.440> see<00:02:46.560> they<00:02:46.680> move<00:02:46.890> right

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
you can see they move right

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.710 
you can see they move right
whenever<00:02:47.730> you're<00:02:47.880> adjusting<00:02:48.060> them<00:02:48.360> use<00:02:48.510> two

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
whenever you're adjusting them use two

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.509 
whenever you're adjusting them use two
hands<00:02:48.989> don't<00:02:49.440> ever<00:02:49.620> move<00:02:49.890> these<00:02:50.130> with<00:02:50.310> one

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
hands don't ever move these with one

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.400 
hands don't ever move these with one
hand<00:02:50.760> because<00:02:51.390> it's<00:02:51.750> possible<00:02:52.019> you<00:02:52.380> could

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
hand because it's possible you could

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.800 
hand because it's possible you could
bend<00:02:52.830> or<00:02:53.010> break<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.459> so<00:02:53.910> always<00:02:54.090> use<00:02:54.360> two<00:02:54.569> hands

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
bend or break it so always use two hands

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.229 
bend or break it so always use two hands
whenever<00:02:55.170> adjusting<00:02:55.830> but<00:02:56.310> just<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.819> confirm

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
whenever adjusting but just to confirm

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.390 
whenever adjusting but just to confirm
we<00:02:57.810> can<00:02:57.989> tell<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.500> these<00:02:58.709> are<00:02:58.950> going<00:02:59.069> to<00:02:59.160> fit

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
installed so they're ready to go so the

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.290 
installed so they're ready to go so the
first<00:05:25.630> thing<00:05:25.840> to<00:05:25.870> do<00:05:26.080> is<00:05:26.260> to<00:05:26.410> fish<00:05:26.620> the<00:05:26.830> wires

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
first thing to do is to fish the wires

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.660 
first thing to do is to fish the wires
through<00:05:28.300> the<00:05:29.130> holes<00:05:30.130> in<00:05:30.550> the<00:05:30.700> seat<00:05:32.610> so<00:05:33.610> that

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
through the holes in the seat so that

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.200 
through the holes in the seat so that
they<00:05:33.910> can<00:05:34.060> be<00:05:35.160> gathered<00:05:36.160> at<00:05:36.280> the<00:05:36.400> bottom<00:05:36.790> it

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
they can be gathered at the bottom it

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.000 
they can be gathered at the bottom it
almost<00:05:37.570> gone<00:05:37.810> fishing<00:05:38.380> that<00:05:38.500> all<00:05:38.770> the<00:05:38.890> way

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
almost gone fishing that all the way

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.700 
almost gone fishing that all the way
through<00:05:39.420> then<00:05:40.420> we<00:05:40.630> got<00:05:40.780> to<00:05:40.900> do<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.170> other<00:05:41.380> side

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
through then we got to do the other side

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.850 
through then we got to do the other side
which<00:05:41.980> is<00:05:42.160> shorter<00:05:42.640> so<00:05:42.880> a<00:05:42.910> little<00:05:43.150> bit<00:05:43.330> easier

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
which is shorter so a little bit easier

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.410 
which is shorter so a little bit easier

once you have the wires all the way in

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.080 
once you have the wires all the way in
it's<00:05:46.660> time<00:05:46.720> to<00:05:47.020> push<00:05:47.200> the<00:05:47.230> post<00:05:47.770> in<00:05:48.040> and<00:05:48.310> you
