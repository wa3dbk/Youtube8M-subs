00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.510
 in three sessions 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.510
 I am first and then I am in Switzerland

 selected projects blocked past 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.990
 you need polygamy 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.630

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.630
 the best friend the best group siemens will hang on 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.700

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.319
 and this to this project that goes 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.969
 two senses of the ice rink of the docks 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.969
 to get closer to the corpses 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.519
