tendencies<00:03:52.690> one<00:03:53.019> more<00:03:53.200> time<00:03:54.840> by<00:03:55.840> Sandro<00:03:56.409> I

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
tendencies one more time by Sandro I

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.110 
tendencies one more time by Sandro I
know<00:03:57.400> it's<00:03:57.639> horrible

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
know it's horrible

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.670 
know it's horrible
but<00:03:58.420> I<00:03:58.690> just<00:03:58.900> think<00:03:59.170> it's<00:03:59.319> quite<00:03:59.500> beautiful

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
but I just think it's quite beautiful

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.460 
but I just think it's quite beautiful
and<00:04:00.099> really<00:04:00.730> it<00:04:01.599> seems<00:04:01.810> like<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:01.989> silly<00:04:02.230> piece

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
and really it seems like a silly piece

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.039 
and really it seems like a silly piece
it<00:04:02.829> seems<00:04:03.040> like<00:04:03.190> a<00:04:03.310> kind<00:04:03.459> of<00:04:03.609> extra<00:04:04.120> but<00:04:04.449> if<00:04:04.900> you

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
it seems like a kind of extra but if you

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.659 
it seems like a kind of extra but if you
had<00:04:05.169> that<00:04:05.349> you<00:04:06.010> just<00:04:06.160> wear<00:04:06.310> that<00:04:06.340> with<00:04:06.519> black

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:06.669 
had that you just wear that with black

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:07.860 
had that you just wear that with black
trousers<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:07.150> she<00:04:07.239> looked<00:04:07.419> brilliant<00:04:07.720> all

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
trousers and she looked brilliant all

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.430 
trousers and she looked brilliant all
the<00:04:07.989> time<00:04:08.199> especially<00:04:08.859> on<00:04:09.129> a<00:04:09.220> cruise<00:04:09.400> ship
