come<00:00:26.830> on<00:00:27.039> in<00:00:27.220> and<00:00:27.430> you<00:00:28.269> know<00:00:28.359> what's<00:00:28.570> promising

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
come on in and you know what's promising

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.380 
come on in and you know what's promising
about<00:00:29.320> that<00:00:29.650> is<00:00:29.830> you<00:00:30.429> know<00:00:30.519> 50<00:00:30.820> years<00:00:31.029> ago<00:00:31.150> this

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
about that is you know 50 years ago this

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.820 
about that is you know 50 years ago this
probably<00:00:31.779> likely<00:00:31.990> wouldn't<00:00:32.320> have<00:00:32.439> happened

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:32.830 
probably likely wouldn't have happened

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.350 
probably likely wouldn't have happened
because<00:00:32.949> we<00:00:33.220> would<00:00:33.340> have<00:00:33.400> had<00:00:33.610> these<00:00:33.760> mature

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
because we would have had these mature

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.060 
because we would have had these mature
habitats<00:00:34.989> that<00:00:35.140> we<00:00:35.199> have<00:00:35.470> now<00:00:35.680> that<00:00:35.739> can

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
habitats that we have now that can

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.640 
habitats that we have now that can
support<00:00:36.460> and<00:00:36.640> sustain<00:00:36.760> bears<00:00:37.299> now<00:00:38.140> currently

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
support and sustain bears now currently

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.320 
support and sustain bears now currently
how<00:00:38.799> many<00:00:38.979> bears<00:00:39.250> do<00:00:39.430> we<00:00:39.489> have<00:00:39.670> in<00:00:39.970> Kentucky

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
how many bears do we have in Kentucky

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.560 
how many bears do we have in Kentucky
that<00:00:40.420> that<00:00:40.809> have<00:00:40.989> collars<00:00:41.979> in<00:00:42.370> from<00:00:42.610> 34<00:00:43.269> right

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
that that have collars in from 34 right

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.560 
that that have collars in from 34 right
now<00:00:43.750> they're<00:00:44.170> constantly<00:00:44.890> sending<00:00:45.280> out<00:00:45.430> a<00:00:45.570> VHF

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
now they're constantly sending out a VHF

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.810 
now they're constantly sending out a VHF
beacon<00:00:47.019> a<00:00:47.140> pulse<00:00:47.500> that<00:00:47.979> we<00:00:48.100> can<00:00:48.280> use<00:00:48.430> to<00:00:48.460> track

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
beacon a pulse that we can use to track

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.729 
beacon a pulse that we can use to track
the<00:00:48.970> Bears<00:00:49.180> and<00:00:49.869> you<00:00:49.960> know<00:00:50.080> at<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.229> same<00:00:50.440> time

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
the Bears and you know at the same time

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.410 
the Bears and you know at the same time
these<00:00:51.010> particular<00:00:51.280> collars<00:00:51.790> are<00:00:51.909> sending<00:00:52.239> on

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
these particular collars are sending on

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.780 
these particular collars are sending on
a<00:00:52.479> schedule<00:00:53.080> that<00:00:53.170> we<00:00:53.320> determined<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:54.400> GPS

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
a schedule that we determined the GPS

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.130 
a schedule that we determined the GPS
unit<00:00:55.089> in<00:00:55.180> that<00:00:55.299> collar<00:00:55.479> is<00:00:55.659> linking<00:00:55.989> up<00:00:56.110> with

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
unit in that collar is linking up with

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.500 
unit in that collar is linking up with

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
where this bear is it yields some

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.070 
where this bear is it yields some
incredible<00:01:06.189> data<00:01:06.430> especially<00:01:06.930> among<00:01:07.930> the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
incredible data especially among the

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.280 
incredible data especially among the
females<00:01:08.560> and<00:01:08.950> those<00:01:09.190> are<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.430> information

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
females and those are the information

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.690 
females and those are the information
factors<00:01:11.290> that<00:01:11.470> we<00:01:11.650> use<00:01:11.890> to<00:01:12.100> help<00:01:12.130> manage<00:01:12.400> the

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
factors that we use to help manage the

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.400 
factors that we use to help manage the
population<00:01:13.240> now<00:01:13.690> what<00:01:13.870> we've<00:01:13.990> got<00:01:14.020> is<00:01:14.200> a

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
population now what we've got is a

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.780 
population now what we've got is a
situation<00:01:14.560> up<00:01:15.070> on<00:01:15.220> this<00:01:15.340> hill<00:01:15.490> we<00:01:15.580> know<00:01:15.700> the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
situation up on this hill we know the

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.370 
situation up on this hill we know the
Bears<00:01:16.000> there<00:01:16.270> in<00:01:16.540> this<00:01:16.750> case<00:01:16.960> we're<00:01:17.200> going<00:01:17.290> to

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
Bears there in this case we're going to

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.080 
Bears there in this case we're going to
have<00:01:17.470> a<00:01:17.500> female<00:01:17.950> here<00:01:18.160> she's<00:01:18.490> probably<00:01:18.760> gonna

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
have a female here she's probably gonna

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.720 
have a female here she's probably gonna
have<00:01:19.300> some<00:01:19.330> new<00:01:19.720> cubs<00:01:20.020> and<00:01:20.410> so<00:01:21.370> she's<00:01:21.520> gonna<00:01:21.670> be

have some new cubs and so she's gonna be

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.520 
have some new cubs and so she's gonna be
relatively<00:01:22.240> inactive<00:01:22.660> and<00:01:22.990> those<00:01:23.110> Cubs<00:01:23.350> are

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
relatively inactive and those Cubs are

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.830 
relatively inactive and those Cubs are
going<00:01:23.650> to<00:01:23.710> be<00:01:23.800> nursing<00:01:24.280> with<00:01:25.090> her<00:01:25.270> inside<00:01:25.690> of

groggy<00:01:33.430> and<00:01:33.850> sort<00:01:34.060> of<00:01:34.150> lethargic<00:01:34.800> when<00:01:35.800> we<00:01:35.920> go

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
groggy and sort of lethargic when we go

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.490 
groggy and sort of lethargic when we go
into<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.460> den<00:01:36.700> but<00:01:37.060> nevertheless<00:01:37.480> we'll<00:01:38.409> need

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.060 
a tranquilizer in order to change her
radio<00:01:40.720> collar<00:01:41.050> out<00:01:41.350> so<00:01:41.680> that<00:01:41.830> we<00:01:41.920> could

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
radio collar out so that we could

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.440 
radio collar out so that we could
continue<00:01:42.340> to<00:01:42.460> monitor<00:01:42.730> her

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.139 

first<00:01:46.229> time<00:01:46.439> yeah<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.189> was<00:01:47.460> certainly<00:01:47.969> nervous

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
first time yeah I was certainly nervous

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.920 
first time yeah I was certainly nervous
but<00:01:48.600> uh<00:01:48.829> we've<00:01:49.829> done<00:01:49.979> maybe<00:01:50.700> 40<00:01:51.090> these<00:01:51.270> we're

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
but uh we've done maybe 40 these we're

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.060 
but uh we've done maybe 40 these we're
coming<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.409> interrupting<00:01:52.680> their

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
coming in and interrupting their

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.459 
coming in and interrupting their
hibernation<00:01:53.659> they're<00:01:54.659> not<00:01:54.810> expecting<00:01:55.259> us<00:01:55.350> to

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
hibernation they're not expecting us to

there's really no foods available in the

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.680 
there's really no foods available in the
dead<00:04:18.669> of<00:04:18.789> winter<00:04:18.820> in<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:19.329> middle<00:04:19.419> of

dead of winter in the middle of

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.070 
dead of winter in the middle of
mountains<00:04:19.989> so<00:04:20.260> there's<00:04:21.070> no<00:04:22.080> adaptive

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
mountains so there's no adaptive

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.990 
mountains so there's no adaptive
advantage<00:04:23.169> for<00:04:23.620> them<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:23.919> feed<00:04:24.160> so<00:04:24.669> the<00:04:24.820> best

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
advantage for them to feed so the best

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.940 
advantage for them to feed so the best
thing<00:04:25.150> they<00:04:25.300> can<00:04:25.360> do<00:04:25.630> in<00:04:25.900> order<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.289> survive<00:04:26.680> at

they<00:04:39.310> don't<00:04:39.460> defecate<00:04:39.930> so<00:04:40.930> they're<00:04:41.080> just

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
they don't defecate so they're just

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.659 
they don't defecate so they're just
literally<00:04:41.560> living<00:04:42.070> and<00:04:42.190> consuming

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
literally living and consuming

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.190 
literally living and consuming
everything<00:04:43.060> they<00:04:43.240> take<00:04:43.450> with<00:04:43.630> them<00:04:43.690> into<00:04:43.870> the

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
everything they take with them into the

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.670 
everything they take with them into the
den<00:04:44.380> so<00:04:44.770> that's<00:04:45.310> why<00:04:45.720> their<00:04:46.720> metabolism<00:04:47.380> is<00:04:47.470> it

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
den so that's why their metabolism is it

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.370 
den so that's why their metabolism is it
at<00:04:47.890> half<00:04:48.190> less<00:04:48.580> than<00:04:48.789> a<00:04:48.820> half<00:04:48.970> oh<00:04:49.330> gosh<00:04:49.990> I'd<00:04:50.200> say

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
at half less than a half oh gosh I'd say

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.580 
at half less than a half oh gosh I'd say
it's<00:04:50.530> a<00:04:51.250> lot<00:04:51.910> much<00:04:52.060> less<00:04:52.240> than<00:04:52.390> half<00:04:52.630> of<00:04:52.990> what

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
it's a lot much less than half of what

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.200 
it's a lot much less than half of what
it<00:04:53.620> would<00:04:53.830> be<00:04:53.950> in<00:04:54.039> a<00:04:54.130> normal<00:04:54.160> active<00:04:54.700> state<00:04:55.000> at

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
it would be in a normal active state at

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.580 
it would be in a normal active state at
least<00:04:55.390> or<00:04:55.539> the<00:04:55.570> summer<00:04:55.870> so<00:04:56.140> that's<00:04:56.229> how<00:04:56.440> they

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
least or the summer so that's how they

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.380 
least or the summer so that's how they
survive<00:04:56.919> throughout<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.370> my<00:04:57.490> story<00:04:57.700> I'm

ecosystem here in southern Ontario this

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.580 
ecosystem here in southern Ontario this
is<00:06:00.450> probably<00:06:00.780> one<00:06:00.990> of<00:06:01.020> the<00:06:01.110> most<00:06:01.290> interesting

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
is probably one of the most interesting

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.020 
is probably one of the most interesting
things<00:06:01.830> I've<00:06:02.130> ever<00:06:02.160> done<00:06:02.370> because<00:06:02.910> it

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
things I've ever done because it

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.290 
things I've ever done because it
involves<00:06:03.510> a<00:06:03.750> part<00:06:04.740> of<00:06:04.800> nature<00:06:04.979> that<00:06:05.760> you<00:06:05.970> just

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
involves a part of nature that you just

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.320 
involves a part of nature that you just
don't<00:06:06.750> get<00:06:07.260> to<00:06:07.320> see<00:06:07.610> the<00:06:08.610> next<00:06:08.760> step<00:06:08.910> today<00:06:09.270> is

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
don't get to see the next step today is

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.120
