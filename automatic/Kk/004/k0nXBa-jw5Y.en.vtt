shipped<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.130> me<00:00:32.279> since<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:33.149> basically<00:00:33.600> came

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989

right through the country it right
across<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.090> country<00:00:36.469> so<00:00:37.469> when<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.710> first<00:00:37.920> took

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
across the country so when I first took

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.889 
across the country so when I first took
them<00:00:38.280> out<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.460> its<00:00:38.610> packaging<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.239> was<00:00:39.719> actually

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
them out of its packaging I was actually

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.479 
them out of its packaging I was actually
really<00:00:40.140> discouraged<00:00:40.770> because<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.280> delayed

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
really discouraged because the delayed

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.119 
really discouraged because the delayed
texts<00:00:41.879> weren't<00:00:42.090> tacky<00:00:42.420> at<00:00:42.750> all<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.290> tried

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
texts weren't tacky at all I tried

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.830 
texts weren't tacky at all I tried
dragging<00:00:44.309> from<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.700> ball<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.450> grip<00:00:45.629> was

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
dragging from the ball and the grip was

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.660 
dragging from the ball and the grip was
terrible<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.190> lot<00:00:47.280> different<00:00:47.460> from

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
terrible and it's a lot different from

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.700 
terrible and it's a lot different from
any<00:00:47.879> other<00:00:47.969> nike<00:00:48.270> gloves<00:00:48.660> because<00:00:48.989> those

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
any other nike gloves because those

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.260 
any other nike gloves because those
gloves<00:00:50.039> are<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> lot<00:00:50.370> more<00:00:50.399> techie<00:00:50.969> right<00:00:51.120> out

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
gloves are a lot more techie right out

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.350 
gloves are a lot more techie right out
of<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.449> box<00:00:52.489> despite<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.640> southern<00:00:53.940> sack<00:00:54.149> bag

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
of the box despite the southern sack bag

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.790 
of the box despite the southern sack bag
I<00:00:54.510> gave<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.870> gloves<00:00:55.050> another<00:00:55.289> chance<00:00:55.590> and

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
I gave the gloves another chance and

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.619 
I gave the gloves another chance and
wash<00:00:55.980> them<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.699> let<00:00:56.910> them<00:00:57.030> drive<00:00:57.270> her<00:00:57.420> about

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
wash them and I let them drive her about

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.660 
wash them and I let them drive her about
a<00:00:57.780> day<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.109> tried<00:00:58.469> them<00:00:58.649> again<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.609> time

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
a day and tried them again and this time

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.849 
a day and tried them again and this time
the<00:00:59.969> grip<00:01:00.149> was<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> lot<00:01:00.600> better<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.739> was

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
the grip was a lot better it was

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.950 
the grip was a lot better it was
actually<00:01:02.160> much<00:01:02.309> much<00:01:02.520> better<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.750> short

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
actually much much better so in short

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.960 
actually much much better so in short
these<00:01:04.320> gloves<00:01:04.830> aren't<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.519> best<00:01:05.640> pair<00:01:05.939> of

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
these gloves aren't the best pair of

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.090 
these gloves aren't the best pair of
gloves<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.360> born<00:01:06.689> but<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.350> think<00:01:07.710> they<00:01:07.860> get<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
gloves I born but I think they get the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.219 
gloves I born but I think they get the
job<00:01:08.310> done<00:01:08.340> pretty<00:01:08.850> well<00:01:08.970> for<00:01:09.390> for<00:01:09.869> its<00:01:09.990> price

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
job done pretty well for for its price

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.370 
job done pretty well for for its price
and<00:01:10.700> I<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:12.119> four<00:01:12.390> reasons<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.960> present<00:01:13.260> to

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
and I have four reasons to present to

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.039 
and I have four reasons to present to
you<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.830> first<00:01:13.979> reason<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.720> it's<00:01:15.720> all<00:01:15.810> about

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
you the first reason is it's all about

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.940 
you the first reason is it's all about
the<00:01:16.229> fit<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.280> if<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.610> are<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.689> usual<00:01:19.320> size<00:01:19.590> 8

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the fit and so if you are a usual size 8

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.969 
the fit and so if you are a usual size 8
on<00:01:20.310> Nike<00:01:20.939> or<00:01:21.180> adidas<00:01:21.270> gloves<00:01:21.840> I'd<00:01:22.170> say<00:01:22.439> go<00:01:22.680> for

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
on Nike or adidas gloves I'd say go for

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.920 
on Nike or adidas gloves I'd say go for
size<00:01:23.250> eight<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.759> half<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:24.240> these<00:01:24.420> gloves<00:01:24.720> if

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
size eight and a half on these gloves if

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.539 
size eight and a half on these gloves if
you<00:01:25.259> want<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.680> keep<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.950> fingers<00:01:26.280> safe

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
you want to keep the fingers safe

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.789

protection<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.750> gloves<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.530> don't

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
really have an effect in my game like it

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.949 
really have an effect in my game like it
hasn't<00:02:10.280> like<00:02:11.330> significantly<00:02:12.330> improved<00:02:12.720> the

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
hasn't like significantly improved the

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.260 
hasn't like significantly improved the
grid

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
grid

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.270 
grid
but<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.570> hasn't<00:02:14.050> like<00:02:14.290> failed<00:02:14.620> me<00:02:14.830> yet<00:02:14.860> so

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
but it hasn't like failed me yet so

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.730 
but it hasn't like failed me yet so
that's<00:02:15.430> it's<00:02:16.120> an<00:02:16.240> average<00:02:16.570> grip<00:02:16.840> glove<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.650> I

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
that's it's an average grip glove and I

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.830 
that's it's an average grip glove and I
think<00:02:17.800> that's<00:02:17.950> pretty<00:02:18.190> good<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.660> since<00:02:19.660> the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
think that's pretty good and since the

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.660 
think that's pretty good and since the
grips<00:02:20.050> are<00:02:20.320> just<00:02:20.560> average<00:02:20.740> of<00:02:21.040> durable<00:02:21.430> he's

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
grips are just average of durable he's

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.100 
grips are just average of durable he's
actually<00:02:21.880> really<00:02:22.240> good<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:22.750> give<00:02:22.930> these

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
actually really good and I give these

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.830 
actually really good and I give these
gloves<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:23.590> 9<00:02:23.680> out<00:02:23.770> of<00:02:23.860> 10<00:02:24.070> for<00:02:24.130> durability<00:02:24.840> I

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
gloves and 9 out of 10 for durability I

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.590 
gloves and 9 out of 10 for durability I
take<00:02:26.770> really<00:02:27.340> good<00:02:27.520> care<00:02:27.580> of<00:02:27.790> my<00:02:28.000> gloves<00:02:28.300> and

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
take really good care of my gloves and

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.650 
take really good care of my gloves and
assuming<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.170> these<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:30.820> seeming<00:02:31.540> that

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
assuming that these that seeming that

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.580 
assuming that these that seeming that
these<00:02:31.810> aren't<00:02:32.430> teared<00:02:33.430> up<00:02:34.110> or<00:02:35.110> there<00:02:35.260> aren't<00:02:35.500> a

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
these aren't teared up or there aren't a

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.230 
these aren't teared up or there aren't a
lot<00:02:35.620> of<00:02:35.830> tears<00:02:36.160> on<00:02:36.340> these<00:02:36.490> guys<00:02:36.670> yet<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:36.970> think

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
lot of tears on these guys yet I think

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.910 
lot of tears on these guys yet I think
that<00:02:37.330> variability<00:02:37.600> is<00:02:37.930> quite<00:02:38.140> good<00:02:38.350> and<00:02:38.800> on

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
that variability is quite good and on

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.560 
that variability is quite good and on
top<00:02:39.130> of<00:02:39.160> that<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.610> foam<00:02:39.820> padding<00:02:40.210> on<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.390> palm

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
top of that the foam padding on the palm

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.480 
top of that the foam padding on the palm
is<00:02:40.780> actually<00:02:41.170> all<00:02:41.290> latex<00:02:41.740> so<00:02:42.010> even<00:02:42.280> if<00:02:42.370> the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
is actually all latex so even if the

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.950 
is actually all latex so even if the
gloves<00:02:42.700> you<00:02:42.850> tear<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.300> whole<00:02:43.450> palm<00:02:43.720> will

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
gloves you tear the whole palm will

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.260 
gloves you tear the whole palm will
remain<00:02:44.260> sticky<00:02:44.880> compared<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:46.000> like<00:02:46.090> other

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
remain sticky compared to like other

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.110 
remain sticky compared to like other
gloves<00:02:46.870> from<00:02:47.050> like<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.260> yes<00:02:47.710> or<00:02:47.890> Nike<00:02:48.820> there

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
gloves from like a yes or Nike there

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.570 
gloves from like a yes or Nike there
it's<00:02:49.870> actually<00:02:50.320> a<00:02:50.710> lot<00:02:50.890> better<00:02:50.950> in<00:02:51.280> terms<00:02:51.400> of

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
it's actually a lot better in terms of

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.360 
it's actually a lot better in terms of
durability<00:02:52.140> offer<00:02:53.140> protection<00:02:53.740> I<00:02:53.950> give<00:02:54.130> these

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
durability offer protection I give these

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.250 
durability offer protection I give these
gloves<00:02:54.640> a<00:02:54.790> 7<00:02:55.060> out<00:02:55.150> of<00:02:55.210> 10<00:02:55.420> so<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:55.750> really<00:02:56.020> didn't

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
gloves a 7 out of 10 so I really didn't

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.810 
gloves a 7 out of 10 so I really didn't
think<00:02:56.290> I'd<00:02:56.620> really<00:02:56.980> didn't<00:02:57.250> like<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.550> finger

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
think I'd really didn't like the finger

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.700 
think I'd really didn't like the finger
safe<00:02:58.030> systems<00:02:58.480> because<00:02:58.990> they're<00:02:59.200> too<00:02:59.410> rigid

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
safe systems because they're too rigid

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.230 
safe systems because they're too rigid
for<00:02:59.890> me<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.130> I<00:03:00.190> felt<00:03:00.430> like<00:03:00.550> my<00:03:00.610> hands<00:03:00.940> were<00:03:01.060> too

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
for me and I felt like my hands were too

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.180 
for me and I felt like my hands were too
restricted<00:03:01.810> but<00:03:02.530> once<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:02.770> picked<00:03:02.950> them<00:03:03.070> out

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
restricted but once I picked them out

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.070 
restricted but once I picked them out
the<00:03:03.400> fit<00:03:03.640> was<00:03:03.850> much<00:03:04.150> better<00:03:04.390> and<00:03:04.690> i<00:03:04.750> think<00:03:04.780> the

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
the fit was much better and i think the

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.330 
the fit was much better and i think the
protection<00:03:05.500> on<00:03:05.590> these<00:03:05.740> gloves<00:03:05.950> is<00:03:06.130> just

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
protection on these gloves is just

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.060 
protection on these gloves is just
average<00:03:06.900> for<00:03:07.900> harder<00:03:08.200> shots<00:03:08.380> you<00:03:08.590> definitely

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
average for harder shots you definitely

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.770 
average for harder shots you definitely
will<00:03:09.250> feel<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.580> impact<00:03:09.940> of<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.150> shop<00:03:10.390> but<00:03:10.690> it

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
will feel the impact of the shop but it

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.130 
will feel the impact of the shop but it
won't<00:03:11.020> stay<00:03:11.350> as<00:03:11.560> so<00:03:12.220> that's<00:03:12.400> good<00:03:13.050> well<00:03:14.050> the

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
won't stay as so that's good well the

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.990 
won't stay as so that's good well the
final<00:03:14.440> verdict<00:03:14.740> is<00:03:14.860> these<00:03:15.130> gloves<00:03:15.400> are<00:03:15.520> solid

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
final verdict is these gloves are solid

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.460
