00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
we suggest kimra here and stand 11 is

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.410 
we suggest kimra here and stand 11 is
i'm<00:00:33.719> floating<00:00:34.290> bridge<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.940> got<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> dimarzio

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
i'm floating bridge I got a dimarzio

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.700 
i'm floating bridge I got a dimarzio
evolution<00:00:37.140> humbucker<00:00:38.040> down<00:00:38.219> here<00:00:38.430> and

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
evolution humbucker down here and

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.160 
evolution humbucker down here and
there's<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.800> dimarzio<00:00:41.100> chopper<00:00:41.690> so<00:00:42.690> stacked

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
there's a dimarzio chopper so stacked

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.450 
there's a dimarzio chopper so stacked
humbucker<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:43.860> essentially<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.309> same

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
humbucker so it's essentially the same

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.950 
humbucker so it's essentially the same
as<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.820> but<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:45.780> finalized<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.870> there's<00:00:48.870> a

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
as that but it's finalized and there's a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.600 
as that but it's finalized and there's a
Fernandez<00:00:49.649> sustainer<00:00:51.199> and<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.860> fretboard

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
Fernandez sustainer and in the fretboard

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.720 
Fernandez sustainer and in the fretboard
my<00:00:54.090> custom<00:00:54.660> inlay<00:00:55.190> had<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.309> done<00:00:56.489> by

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
my custom inlay had it done by

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.619 
my custom inlay had it done by
Christopher<00:00:57.390> would<00:00:58.940> get<00:00:59.940> LEDs<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
Christopher would get LEDs in the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.729 
Christopher would get LEDs in the
fretboard<00:01:00.899> as<00:01:01.230> well<00:01:01.579> my<00:01:02.719> custom<00:01:03.719> logo<00:01:04.589> up

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
fretboard as well my custom logo up

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.539 
fretboard as well my custom logo up
there<00:01:05.659> there<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.810> go<00:01:07.159> just<00:01:08.159> say<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.460> I

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
there there you go just say that I

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.630 
there there you go just say that I
believe<00:01:08.610> his<00:01:09.000> doc

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.880 

so<00:01:12.180> what<00:01:12.360> makes<00:01:12.479> us<00:01:12.690> special<00:01:12.810> as<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.380> paint

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
so what makes us special as the paint

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.410 
so what makes us special as the paint
changes<00:01:14.340> color<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.030> see<00:01:15.180> from<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
changes color you can see from the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.740 
changes color you can see from the
single<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:15.900> kind<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.490> Goldie<00:01:17.490> orange<00:01:17.970> and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
single it's kind of Goldie orange and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.780 
single it's kind of Goldie orange and
then<00:01:19.140> from<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.530> angle<00:01:19.800> it's<00:01:20.220> kind<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
then from this angle it's kind of a

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.780 
then from this angle it's kind of a
purpley<00:01:21.420> color<00:01:22.070> but<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.220> sort<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.550> green

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
purpley color but it's sort of green

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.430 
purpley color but it's sort of green
there<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.690> depends<00:01:25.080> how<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.200> light

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
there so it just depends how the light

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.050 
there so it just depends how the light
hits<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:28.490> it's<00:01:29.490> got<00:01:29.580> a<00:01:29.640> whole<00:01:29.820> bunch<00:01:29.910> of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
hits it it's got a whole bunch of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.310 
hits it it's got a whole bunch of
switches<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.509> obviously<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:30.930> as<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.259> know

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
switches to obviously this as you know

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.520 
switches to obviously this as you know
pickup<00:01:31.650> selector<00:01:32.479> volume<00:01:33.479> tone<00:01:34.080> you<00:01:34.409> know

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
pickup selector volume tone you know

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.999 
pickup selector volume tone you know
this<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> sustainer<00:01:35.610> intensity<00:01:36.300> knob

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
this as a sustainer intensity knob

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.330 
this as a sustainer intensity knob
basically<00:01:38.009> just<00:01:38.250> as<00:01:38.430> adjust<00:01:39.210> how<00:01:39.720> I'm<00:01:40.340> intent

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
basically just as adjust how I'm intent

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.540 
basically just as adjust how I'm intent
of<00:01:41.490> visitors<00:01:41.820> at<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.090> sustainers<00:01:42.659> how<00:01:43.550> long

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
of visitors at the sustainers how long

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.120 
of visitors at the sustainers how long
it<00:01:44.670> sustains<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.240> for<00:01:45.450> now<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.289> the<00:01:46.770> mix

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
it sustains it for now this is the mix

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.690 
it sustains it for now this is the mix
which<00:01:47.550> has<00:01:48.210> its<00:01:48.479> normal<00:01:48.810> sustained<00:01:49.140> mode

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
which has its normal sustained mode

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.830 
which has its normal sustained mode
mixed-mode<00:01:51.740> harmonic<00:01:52.740> mode<00:01:53.270> this<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.390> often

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
mixed-mode harmonic mode this is often

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.669 
mixed-mode harmonic mode this is often
it<00:01:54.960> on<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.979> nurse<00:01:56.160> which<00:01:56.399> here<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.910> for<00:01:57.679> the

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
it on the nurse which here is for the

LEDs

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.520 

okay<00:02:05.890> this<00:02:06.100> is<00:02:06.370> my<00:02:07.210> guitar<00:02:07.630> clean<00:02:08.080> without<00:02:08.259> the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
okay this is my guitar clean without the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:26.470 
okay this is my guitar clean without the
sustainer<00:02:08.950> on<00:02:09.750> system<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.020> humbucker

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:03:01.559 

you

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:14.250 

you

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:26.930 

this<00:03:15.260> is<00:03:15.440> a<00:03:15.590> dimarzio<00:03:16.240> evolution<00:03:17.470> Britvic

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.660 

a<00:03:29.720> chopper<00:03:30.720> here<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:32.010> middle<00:03:32.280> physically

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
a chopper here the middle physically

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:48.430 
a chopper here the middle physically
sick<00:03:33.180> humbucker

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.750 

now<00:03:49.440> they<00:03:49.650> are<00:03:49.769> cool<00:03:50.220> thing<00:03:50.370> about<00:03:50.459> the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
now they are cool thing about the

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.750 
now they are cool thing about the
sustainer<00:03:51.450> but<00:03:52.019> as<00:03:52.170> I've<00:03:52.349> seen<00:03:52.650> before<00:03:53.010> the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
sustainer but as I've seen before the

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.570 
sustainer but as I've seen before the
switch<00:03:54.060> here<00:03:54.360> obviously<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:54.930> sustains<00:03:55.349> an

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
switch here obviously it sustains an

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.640 
switch here obviously it sustains an
open<00:03:56.580> these<00:03:56.670> objects<00:03:57.120> types<00:03:57.390> of<00:03:57.540> battery<00:03:57.840> them

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
open these objects types of battery them

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.670 
open these objects types of battery them
such<00:03:59.519> as<00:03:59.730> flick<00:04:00.299> it<00:04:00.420> on<00:04:00.510> in<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:01.049> center<00:04:01.470> notes

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
such as flick it on in the center notes

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.039 
such as flick it on in the center notes
so<00:04:01.950> what<00:04:02.099> this<00:04:02.280> does<00:04:02.340> here<00:04:02.879> is<00:04:03.510> it<00:04:03.629> basically

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
so what this does here is it basically

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.259 
so what this does here is it basically
is<00:04:04.170> a<00:04:04.260> pulsing<00:04:04.799> maintenance<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.879> pulsing

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
is a pulsing maintenance and the pulsing

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.149 
is a pulsing maintenance and the pulsing
magnet<00:04:06.569> calls<00:04:06.810> of<00:04:06.959> strings<00:04:07.349> to<00:04:07.470> continuously

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
magnet calls of strings to continuously

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.970 
magnet calls of strings to continuously
vibrate<00:04:08.670> so<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.599> notice<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:10.140> friggin<00:04:10.590> until

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
vibrate so the notice a friggin until

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:23.410 
vibrate so the notice a friggin until
the<00:04:11.069> battery<00:04:11.370> run<00:04:11.549> down<00:04:11.930> now<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.079> will<00:04:13.260> play

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.760 

the<00:04:23.810> one<00:04:23.960> whom<00:04:24.170> anyway

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
the one whom anyway

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.320 
the one whom anyway
Oh

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.970 

no<00:04:27.900> it's<00:04:28.080> a<00:04:28.530> roll

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.600 

no<00:04:31.520> you<00:04:31.580> didn't<00:04:32.000> really

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.620 

why's<00:04:35.479> it<00:04:35.659> up<00:04:35.780> whoever<00:04:36.259> i<00:04:36.349> won

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.740 

no<00:04:40.260> no<00:04:40.440> we'll<00:04:40.620> just<00:04:40.650> keep<00:04:40.860> holding<00:04:41.360> if<00:04:42.360> I<00:04:42.480> put

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
no no we'll just keep holding if I put

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.430 
no no we'll just keep holding if I put
into<00:04:43.230> mixed<00:04:43.860> mode<00:04:44.010> where<00:04:44.310> Adam<00:04:45.320> turns<00:04:46.320> the

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
into mixed mode where Adam turns the

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:54.880 
into mixed mode where Adam turns the
note<00:04:46.620> into<00:04:46.950> a<00:04:46.980> harmonic<00:04:47.550> one<00:04:48.300> off

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:07.820

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:11.379 
then as a harmonic mode which is two

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:40.750 
then as a harmonic mode which is two
octaves<00:05:11.740> up<00:05:11.889> to<00:05:12.039> natural<00:05:12.429> notes
