00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.090
 he heard when I was very young then I am something new again 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.090
 became champion 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:21.989
 mulder in helmond 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.789
 he wants 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.619
 the Vatican once 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.109
 a 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.279
 for some reason 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.540
 2 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.380
 in addition, order wants 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.380
 it seems so 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.450
 ado the hague consumers know 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.399
 therefore order becomes when I was in the team ahead when I was young 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.399
 that has only been champion once since then 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.090
 that is the oldest he would have fallen in slow motion abroad 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.110
 it is no different, because there are real finals there too, a slow percentage 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.010
 the world championship in slow motion 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.160
 with a tracking dog counted the comment 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.270
 bizarre end of the lake that is in the final of what I do 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.260
 this is a difficult start in slow motion 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
 the uni 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.440
 good evening welcome 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.380
 in the vlissingse 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.730
 this moment to be mentally somewhat greater than champion 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.340
 like site lotte van dijck 3 the foreman of the current and of course 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.480
 youth champion 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.890
 that allowed the palace to come lodiers 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.260
 because the man on 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.520
 it's not that 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.750
 there you wanted to, but yes, she was playing a disco 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.750
 start but then but it is my wife 2 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.310
 of course, a discussion involving the llamas and the zoom in business and that 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.780
 we do to zoom in on the scene and this one that played such a terrible sin 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.280
 young and not the band 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.110
 and I really want to 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.500
 for this second 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.500
 just a location 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:15.289
 only half a year 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:27.309
 the minds 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:30.829
 what do you think 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.369
 the taxes 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:36.369
 but I don't want to see it 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.959
 what do you do that 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:48.229
 what is that able to donate 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.989

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:07.629
 the hagenaar 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.629
 Wednesday and Thursday Thursday it is dry 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.559
 who is no longer here and no less 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:19.530
 Belgium 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.530
 no, I think we wanted to build 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.259
 considering this 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.259
 the youth 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.659
 another way 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.669
 hendriks 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.289

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.289
 click here 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.620
 what do you see 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:39.110
 the Chinese 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.819
 8 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:43.819
 41 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.749
 this week is not that resistant to bart language 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:58.709
 I don't think so but at the deaf interpreter of the lamas we are going to 

00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:01.919
 cover up and this time jeroen van koningsbrugge is the deaf interpreter 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.879
 and the mike live goes ruben van der meer interview 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:08.020
 but i'm still looking for a bystander who has ears 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.589
 beh 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:14.050
 save photos from the fair 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.050
 pictures of knowledge of 

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:21.939
 ridiculous that you are therefore became one 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.639
 all over again 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:25.710
 well let it be heard 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.099
 the frogs toad pictures 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:30.749
 we can see 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:32.889
 from whom we know them 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:34.499
 currently is one 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:37.409
 of my knowledge but I am 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.789
 no plan is a beautiful image from the audience 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:45.159
 the recordings became people with an average family and the recordings 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:48.159
 pleaded for this performance with all that knowledge 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.509
 here a piece of last 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:59.129
 nice then again 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:02.129
 that is still there for a while 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.039
 44 from 31 countries that participated 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:19.199
 the superpower the youngsters themselves, but what is that really? 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:23.509
 whatever ground 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:25.569
 they must then be in the bank 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:27.360
 good initiative 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.190
 hilversum anp 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.190
 the man is still waiting 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:37.229
 however, it appears that this year fifty yes 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.860
 and yes 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.860
 the thirteenth always show the same yes 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:46.689
 otherwise I think a lot 

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:49.749
 what do you think 

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:52.749
 that can boast 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.520
 Hey 

00:07:48.819 --> 00:07:51.999
