00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.460
 there you have four balloons touching the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.220
 balloon called the breath that will be 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.100
 scored in the three goals kiala and 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.810
 each goal wins 10 points after there 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.580
 has three others that are actually the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.010
 same bullet called the asshole and 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.630
 it's the players who's called and 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.910
 drummer who are actually in charge of 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.090
 defend their own team by throwing 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.710
 the slugger on the opposing team all 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.899
 right out of the harry potter universe 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.910
 Quidditch has been around for three years 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.950
 years at all here no magic or 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.440
 spells of strict rules 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.399
 a good-natured atmosphere of the material made 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.920
 house and a bit of imagination 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.510
 are sufficient provided they do not spare 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.879
 his efforts just need it anyway 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.530
 have a good physical condition but 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.050
 still be able to hold a 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.699
 steady pace because it's true 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.559
 competitions went back and forth on 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.939
 can be counted we can all this with a 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.770
 dozens of teams throughout France 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.600
 a cup of Europe and even a cup of 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.520
 organized world in the united states the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.560
 quidditch is gradually imposing on the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.760
 collective sports environment 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.380
 the goal being to get closer to 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.799
 closer to jk's rules of the game 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.409
 rowling 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.850
 the broom flying under the steering wheel 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.070
 it's a little dream like I 'll be a 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.180
 jetpack staff finally all that to 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.500
 from science fiction 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.549
 yes I imagine it should be limited to a 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.860
 certain height also for reasons 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.180
 safe and yes that would be are very 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.890
 not taking what we had balls 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.049
 with twigs problem is that 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.340
 it leaves very quickly the hand 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.979
 frankly if it's not bad 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.210
 be a little avenged 3 yesterday for the sport 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.640
 like that it would then be rather 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.829
 little light not the official ballet 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.950
 does not abuse 2000 replicas of movies actually 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:51.450
 is totally unusable on your 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:53.729
 question I do not know that sometimes that I 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.850
 think confess these business the sort of 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.890
 noise behind it is a little 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.939
 surprising sometimes 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.109
 all that remains is to fine-tune 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.429
 techniques and continue 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:03.819
 trainings every Sunday at 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.590
 argoulets 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.310
 after all the world cup is 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.310
 maybe not so far
