00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:04.390
 good we went to talk about the crawls on the plant 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.510
 per cent the drag in the tango in arising onmpri were invented 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.660
 percent by how much the instrument endoscopic system was finding 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.710
 his way of that more than to this sector 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.099
 the world pulls a hundred a note 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:21.930
 and here it starts with a sound 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.310
 nor piano to go growing 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.400
 and defining up to an accented note 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.520
 in general there are strong times 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.610
 or so is a brainless group 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.720
 on the first note that appears 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.110
 These advances are what they use as a way of emphasizing the city to these times 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.000
 powerful 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.210
 it is known that it happens that 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.020
 percent and we have to look for his way of joining the cities that 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.580
 they are from the typical orchestra 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.160
 what the Argentines can hear them made by string instruments 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.460
 on the double bass that the violins 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.130
 that's what they do 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.040
 using part of the arch fence 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.209
 and generating that sound that ends up exploding 

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:06.209
 then on the flute the effect that 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.900
 it occurred to me to look for iii 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.120
 in italy to get to that sound was 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.270
 if we listen to this same melody without drag we can see how we have the 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.270
 sounds that starts in a stable way 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.310
 then the drag 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.560
 it is something that generate attention 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.550
 towards that point of the pp force 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.850
 per hundred the flute we have to look for this effect generating it 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.920
 with them a small opening between the tongue in the teeth 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.189
 generating that the air passes between the day plus the tongue and the palate 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.010
 that flat with a pianissimo sound at the beginning 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.299
 I'll let that air 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.780
 do not generate any particular sound 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.470
 but simply cut says the flute in this way 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.249
 It would be like making a date 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:19.470
 the one with the tongue very relaxed to defend that no sound is generated 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.200
 where in this way we begin to blow pianisimos without 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.339
 attack 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:29.599
 let's understand more and more strong attack we leave a coup in the 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.959
 moment when it is necessary that the note 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.959
 begin 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.979
 yes then again now with the rhythm that I was playing before 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.559
 I hope that you are interested in the effect very funny drag 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.329
 and that were 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.989
 very good with the new way of enjoying tango 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.570
 and I hope that this town can practice 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.570
 in the book of the flute in the tango they will see that there are exercises and more 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.959
 explanations on how to approach this and other effects 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.269
 of the extended techniques applied to tango 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.360
 i good send you a greeting from Buenos Aires 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.200
 in Argentina 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.680
 to cabral
