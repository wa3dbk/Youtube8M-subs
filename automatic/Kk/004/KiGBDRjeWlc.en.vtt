00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
is one of the more risky maps to

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.380 
is one of the more risky maps to
actually<00:02:08.069> go<00:02:08.220> for<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.429> hatchery<00:02:08.610> first<00:02:09.030> on<00:02:09.239> I

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
actually go for a hatchery first on I

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.140 
actually go for a hatchery first on I
decide<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.110> go<00:02:10.379> for<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.649> hatchery<00:02:10.860> into<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.849> gas

decide to go for a hatchery into a gas
geyser<00:02:12.510> into<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.379> spawner

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
geyser into a spawner

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.850 
geyser into a spawner
now<00:02:15.569> what<00:02:15.900> I'm<00:02:15.990> going<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.170> do<00:02:16.319> is<00:02:16.500> actually<00:02:16.680> a

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
now what I'm going to do is actually a

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.230 
now what I'm going to do is actually a
little<00:02:17.010> bit<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.340> timing<00:02:17.700> attack<00:02:17.970> with

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
little bit of a timing attack with

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.580 
little bit of a timing attack with
certain<00:02:18.569> there<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.930> actually<00:02:19.170> could<00:02:19.319> see<00:02:19.470> me

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
certain there you actually could see me

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.620 
certain there you actually could see me
pretty<00:02:19.770> 4<00:02:20.069> drums<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.490> gas<00:02:20.730> not<00:02:21.000> realizing<00:02:21.600> that

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
pretty 4 drums of gas not realizing that

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.690 
pretty 4 drums of gas not realizing that
until<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.020> couple<00:02:22.260> seconds<00:02:22.709> later<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.130> little

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
until a couple seconds later so little

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.150 
until a couple seconds later so little
sloppy<00:02:24.090> mistakes<00:02:24.660> like<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:24.959> just<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:25.950> could

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
sloppy mistakes like that just I could

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.559 
sloppy mistakes like that just I could
actually<00:02:26.280> obviously<00:02:26.910> see<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.270> i'm<00:02:27.390> not

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
completely with my head in the game I do

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.210 
completely with my head in the game I do
way<00:02:30.290> by<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.350> way<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.590> case<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.860> only<00:02:32.070> one

the gas timing that actually went for

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.820 
the gas timing that actually went for

paints at home just for defensive

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.580 
paints at home just for defensive
purposes<00:05:47.069> and<00:05:47.699> if<00:05:47.759> you<00:05:47.849> can<00:05:48.029> see<00:05:48.210> my<00:05:49.199> little

timing<00:05:50.099> push<00:05:50.279> right<00:05:50.460> here<00:05:50.699> actually<00:05:50.940> was

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:51.719 
timing push right here actually was

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:54.379 
timing push right here actually was
worth<00:05:52.020> the<00:05:52.259> risk<00:05:52.500> by<00:05:53.009> going<00:05:53.039> for<00:05:53.669> a<00:05:53.699> gas<00:05:54.029> before

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389 
worth the risk by going for a gas before

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.269 
worth the risk by going for a gas before
