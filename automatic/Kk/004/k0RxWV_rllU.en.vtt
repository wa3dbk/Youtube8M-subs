themselves now I like to do my fusing in
this<00:00:48.739> side<00:00:48.920> of<00:00:49.040> l-shape<00:00:49.579> form<00:00:50.440> this<00:00:51.440> fusing

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
this side of l-shape form this fusing

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.759 
this side of l-shape form this fusing
here<00:00:52.159> is<00:00:52.399> for<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:52.970> vent<00:00:53.149> itself<00:00:53.540> and<00:00:54.409> this<00:00:54.620> is

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769

much<00:01:12.770> hem<00:01:13.250> you're<00:01:13.550> going<00:01:13.789> to<00:01:13.909> have<00:01:14.179> now<00:01:14.539> for

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
much hem you're going to have now for

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.410 
much hem you're going to have now for
mine<00:01:15.409> I'm<00:01:15.740> going<00:01:16.159> to<00:01:16.250> have<00:01:16.520> a<00:01:16.729> five<00:01:17.030> centimeter

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
mine I'm going to have a five centimeter

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.340 
mine I'm going to have a five centimeter
hem<00:01:18.399> so<00:01:19.399> that<00:01:20.179> means<00:01:20.420> it's<00:01:20.720> going<00:01:20.929> to<00:01:21.050> be<00:01:21.170> a

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
hem so that means it's going to be a

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.990 
hem so that means it's going to be a
five<00:01:21.649> centimeter<00:01:22.009> turn<00:01:22.399> back<00:01:22.670> like<00:01:22.909> this<00:01:23.149> and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
five centimeter turn back like this and

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.190 
five centimeter turn back like this and
what<00:01:26.000> you<00:01:26.119> do<00:01:26.390> because<00:01:26.869> it's<00:01:27.020> five

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
what you do because it's five

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.560 
what you do because it's five
centimeters<00:01:27.500> we<00:01:28.040> always<00:01:28.310> double<00:01:28.460> it<00:01:28.700> so

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
centimeters we always double it so

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.510 
centimeters we always double it so
whatever<00:01:30.409> your<00:01:30.560> hem<00:01:30.710> is<00:01:30.890> if<00:01:31.040> it's<00:01:31.159> 4<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:31.460> 1/2

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
whatever your hem is if it's 4 and 1/2

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.969 
whatever your hem is if it's 4 and 1/2
then<00:01:31.939> it<00:01:32.030> will<00:01:32.119> be<00:01:32.210> 9<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:32.720> like<00:01:33.200> mine<00:01:33.439> is<00:01:33.740> going

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
then it will be 9 and like mine is going

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.440 
then it will be 9 and like mine is going
to<00:01:34.070> be<00:01:34.159> 10<00:01:34.399> so<00:01:34.670> what<00:01:34.820> you<00:01:34.939> do<00:01:35.060> is<00:01:35.180> you<00:01:35.299> measure

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
to be 10 so what you do is you measure

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.920 
to be 10 so what you do is you measure
from<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:36.320> edge<00:01:36.640> here<00:01:37.640> of<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:38.000> hem<00:01:38.240> you

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.889 
from the edge here of the hem you
measure<00:01:39.170> up<00:01:39.409> 10<00:01:39.920> centimeters<00:01:40.700> put<00:01:41.360> a<00:01:41.390> pin<00:01:41.689> in

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
measure up 10 centimeters put a pin in

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.590 
measure up 10 centimeters put a pin in
there<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.670> first<00:01:43.850> thing<00:01:44.030> what<00:01:44.299> you<00:01:44.420> need
