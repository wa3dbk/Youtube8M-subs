question<00:00:15.170> they<00:00:16.170> used<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.500> be<00:00:16.590> made<00:00:16.770> out<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:17.039> a

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
question they used to be made out of a

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.160 
question they used to be made out of a
leather<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.460> chamois<00:00:17.789> leather<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.390> so<00:00:18.810> what<00:00:19.050> we

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
leather a chamois leather and so what we

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.349 
leather a chamois leather and so what we
did<00:00:19.320> at<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.500> time<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:20.250> we<00:00:20.580> had<00:00:20.939> these<00:00:21.060> pads

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
did at that time is we had these pads

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.390 
did at that time is we had these pads
made<00:00:21.689> out<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.930> leather<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.560> we<00:00:22.680> would<00:00:22.980> put

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
made out of leather and we would put

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.740 
made out of leather and we would put
them<00:00:23.490> in<00:00:23.609> our<00:00:23.670> bike<00:00:23.880> shorts<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.390> we<00:00:24.480> would

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
them in our bike shorts and we would

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.599 
them in our bike shorts and we would
create<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.410> slip<00:00:25.890> with<00:00:26.130> some<00:00:26.369> kind<00:00:26.550> of

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
create a slip with some kind of

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.210 
create a slip with some kind of
lubricant<00:00:27.119> like<00:00:27.269> Vaseline<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.800> problem

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
lubricant like Vaseline and the problem

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.310 
lubricant like Vaseline and the problem
with<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.699> leather<00:00:30.029> chamois<00:00:30.359> pad<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.990> over

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
with a leather chamois pad is that over

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.470 
with a leather chamois pad is that over
time<00:00:31.529> they<00:00:31.710> would<00:00:31.859> start<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.250> get<00:00:32.430> dry<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.940> so

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
time they would start to get dry and so

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.660 
time they would start to get dry and so
what<00:00:33.660> we<00:00:33.780> did<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.230> we<00:00:34.260> evolved<00:00:35.100> into<00:00:35.600> a

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
what we did is we evolved into a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.880 
what we did is we evolved into a
synthetic<00:00:38.670> material<00:00:39.170> similar<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
synthetic material similar to this and

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.440 
synthetic material similar to this and
we<00:00:40.950> started<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.370> add<00:00:41.489> these<00:00:41.670> synthetics<00:00:42.270> to

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
we started to add these synthetics to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.959 
we started to add these synthetics to
the<00:00:42.540> front<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.870> modesty<00:00:43.350> panel<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:43.920> men<00:00:44.430> but

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
the front a modesty panel for men but

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.610 
the front a modesty panel for men but
the<00:00:45.090> problem<00:00:45.390> with<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.600> pad<00:00:45.870> was<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.410> this

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the problem with this pad was that this

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.650 
the problem with this pad was that this
seam<00:00:46.950> was<00:00:47.129> right<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.789> nerve<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.450> there

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
seam was right on the nerve and there

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.569 
seam was right on the nerve and there
was<00:00:48.780> some<00:00:48.930> abrasion<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.559> seams<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.100> we<00:00:50.399> had

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
was some abrasion on the seams so we had

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.569 
was some abrasion on the seams so we had
to<00:00:50.850> take<00:00:51.600> some<00:00:52.129> enhancements<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.250> one<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
to take some enhancements and one of the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.889 
to take some enhancements and one of the
things<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.969> we<00:00:54.090> did<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.329> prevent<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.870> from

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
things that we did to prevent it from

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.720 
things that we did to prevent it from
being<00:00:55.170> dries<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:55.800> started<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.250> use<00:00:56.460> these

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
being dries we started to use these

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.700 
being dries we started to use these
high-end<00:00:57.120> materials<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.870> an<00:00:58.320> ultra

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
high-end materials this is an ultra

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.920 
high-end materials this is an ultra
suede<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.399> simulates<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.149> weather<00:01:00.480> it's<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
suede it simulates the weather it's the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.959 
suede it simulates the weather it's the
color<00:01:01.140> color<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.829> leather<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.370> then<00:01:02.820> these

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
color color of leather and then these

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.390 
color color of leather and then these
wicking<00:01:03.359> materials<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.530> as<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:05.070> started

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
wicking materials and so as we started

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.120 
wicking materials and so as we started
to<00:01:05.549> take<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.119> into<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.600> next<00:01:06.750> generation<00:01:07.130> we

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
to take this into the next generation we

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.530 
to take this into the next generation we
started<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.549> create<00:01:08.790> these<00:01:08.909> kind<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.299> pads

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
started to create these kind of pads

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.690 
started to create these kind of pads
like<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> pro<00:01:10.680> pad<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> little

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
like this is a pro pad so it's a little

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.609 
like this is a pro pad so it's a little
bit<00:01:11.880> thicker<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.570> center<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.320> thinner

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
bit thicker in the center it's thinner

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.230 
bit thicker in the center it's thinner
on<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.920> side<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.310> you're<00:01:14.460> not<00:01:14.520> chafing<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
on the side so you're not chafing on the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.240 
on the side so you're not chafing on the
side<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.689> fits<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.080> anatomy<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.040> body

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
side it fits the anatomy of the body

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.950 
side it fits the anatomy of the body
this<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.549> an<00:01:17.759> anti<00:01:18.090> chafe<00:01:18.390> pad<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:18.750> still

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
this is an anti chafe pad it's still

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.420 
this is an anti chafe pad it's still
very<00:01:19.140> popular<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> lot<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.009> loyal<00:01:20.250> customers

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
very popular a lot of loyal customers

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.719 
very popular a lot of loyal customers
love<00:01:21.180> our<00:01:21.420> Pro<00:01:21.780> pad<00:01:22.049> from<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> pro<00:01:23.310> pad<00:01:23.549> we

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
love our Pro pad from the pro pad we

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.520 
love our Pro pad from the pro pad we
started<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> get<00:01:24.210> into<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.570> seamless<00:01:24.869> ID<00:01:25.259> and

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
started to get into the seamless ID and

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.140 
started to get into the seamless ID and
so<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> idea<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.310> if<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.610> eliminate<00:01:27.119> all

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
so the idea is that if you eliminate all

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.660 
so the idea is that if you eliminate all
the<00:01:27.509> seams<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:28.200> your<00:01:28.350> saddle<00:01:28.770> area<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.340> starts

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the seams in your saddle area it starts

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.190 
the seams in your saddle area it starts
to<00:01:29.820> prevent<00:01:30.210> some<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.540> chafing<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.079> you

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
to prevent some of the chafing but you

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.960 
to prevent some of the chafing but you
can<00:01:31.350> see<00:01:31.530> there's<00:01:31.710> no<00:01:31.890> real<00:01:32.130> definition<00:01:32.820> it's

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
can see there's no real definition it's

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.840 
can see there's no real definition it's
just<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.329> foam<00:01:33.540> pad<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.979> next<00:01:35.280> generations

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
just a foam pad so the next generations

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.920 
just a foam pad so the next generations
