00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
lighting system this isn't really part

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.980 
lighting system this isn't really part
of<00:00:10.200> it<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.160> full<00:00:11.490> mains<00:00:11.849> light<00:00:12.240> it's

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
of it this is a full mains light it's

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.919 
of it this is a full mains light it's
like<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> security<00:00:13.559> light<00:00:13.889> but<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.780> showed<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:15.900> to

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
like a security light but I showed it to

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.380 
like a security light but I showed it to
my<00:00:16.529> builder<00:00:16.830> who's<00:00:16.980> been<00:00:17.130> making<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.150> deck

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
my builder who's been making the deck

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.210 
my builder who's been making the deck
and<00:00:18.570> he's<00:00:19.020> not<00:00:19.230> happy<00:00:19.439> with<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.740> quality<00:00:19.890> of

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
and he's not happy with the quality of

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.429 
and he's not happy with the quality of
this<00:00:20.689> he<00:00:21.689> knows<00:00:21.840> what<00:00:21.990> he's<00:00:22.080> talking<00:00:22.380> about

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
this he knows what he's talking about

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.859 
this he knows what he's talking about
there's<00:00:22.859> no<00:00:23.010> there's<00:00:23.670> no<00:00:23.730> seals<00:00:24.119> inside<00:00:24.630> here

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
there's no there's no seals inside here

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.460 
there's no there's no seals inside here
so<00:00:25.050> water<00:00:25.230> could<00:00:25.439> leak<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:26.300> there<00:00:27.470> there's

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
so water could leak in there there's

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.410 
so water could leak in there there's
also<00:00:28.680> no<00:00:28.980> sealant<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.550> these<00:00:29.849> little<00:00:30.179> cracks

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
also no sealant and these little cracks

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.720 
also no sealant and these little cracks
there<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.080> also<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:31.740> noticed<00:00:32.040> if<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.579> see

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
there and also we noticed if you see

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.360 
there and also we noticed if you see
this<00:00:32.880> label<00:00:33.300> here<00:00:33.540> if<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.590> turn<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.950> around<00:00:35.010> it

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
this label here if you turn it around it

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.360 
this label here if you turn it around it
this<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.450> must<00:00:36.719> face<00:00:36.930> down<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:38.190> when<00:00:38.280> you

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
this is this must face down but when you

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.010 
this is this must face down but when you
turn<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.579> around<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.030> can<00:00:39.059> see<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.510> this

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
turn it around you can see that this

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.750 
turn it around you can see that this
would<00:00:40.260> just<00:00:40.410> collect<00:00:40.920> as<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> gully<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.550> water

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
would just collect as a gully of water

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.819 
would just collect as a gully of water
and<00:00:41.969> eventually<00:00:42.329> fill<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.750> hole<00:00:42.989> with<00:00:43.230> with

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
and eventually fill that hole with with

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.920 
and eventually fill that hole with with
it<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.100> what<00:00:44.219> I'm<00:00:44.309> going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.489> do<00:00:44.640> today<00:00:44.930> I'm

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
it so what I'm going to do today I'm

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.290 
it so what I'm going to do today I'm
just<00:00:46.140> going<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.379> take<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.649> apart<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.670> couldn't

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
just going to take this apart I couldn't

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.270 
just going to take this apart I couldn't
find<00:00:48.539> any<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.260> liked<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.829> were<00:00:49.980> better

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
find any that I liked that were better

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.779 
find any that I liked that were better
quality<00:00:50.820> than<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.230> in<00:00:52.230> plastic<00:00:53.160> or<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.520> metal

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
quality than this in plastic or in metal

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.490 
quality than this in plastic or in metal
though<00:00:54.270> if<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.660> was<00:00:54.750> mental<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.110> was<00:00:55.230> afraid<00:00:55.410> of

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
though if it was mental I was afraid of

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.680 
though if it was mental I was afraid of
rust<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.489> I've<00:00:56.579> got<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> plastic<00:00:57.420> one<00:00:57.539> it

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
rust so I've got a plastic one it

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.540 
rust so I've got a plastic one it
doesn't<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.109> PIR<00:00:58.440> sensor<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.489> I

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
doesn't have a PIR sensor on it but I

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.979 
doesn't have a PIR sensor on it but I
reckon<00:00:59.910> I<00:00:59.969> can<00:01:00.030> hack<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.690> make<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.870> better

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
reckon I can hack it to make it better

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.750 
reckon I can hack it to make it better
so<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.530> would<00:01:01.920> make<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.100> little<00:01:02.309> bitty<00:01:02.460> out<00:01:02.609> of

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
so that would make a little bitty out of

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.479 
so that would make a little bitty out of
it<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.470> I'll<00:01:04.470> join<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.070> again<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.460> few

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
it for you I'll join you again in a few

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.910 
it for you I'll join you again in a few
minutes<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.330> I've<00:01:06.420> opened<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.840> up<00:01:06.930> now<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
minutes so I've opened it up now the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.980 
minutes so I've opened it up now the
first<00:01:08.070> thing<00:01:08.189> I've<00:01:08.340> done<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.640> I've<00:01:08.729> taken

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
first thing I've done is I've taken

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.289 
first thing I've done is I've taken
these<00:01:09.990> connectors<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.100> can<00:01:11.250> see<00:01:11.460> here<00:01:12.180> it

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
these connectors and you can see here it

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.100 
these connectors and you can see here it
says<00:01:12.330> el<00:01:13.260> for<00:01:13.530> live<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.890> n<00:01:13.979> for<00:01:14.010> neutral<00:01:15.110> so

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
says el for live and n for neutral so

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.550 
says el for live and n for neutral so
those<00:01:17.040> are<00:01:17.070> there<00:01:17.310> I've<00:01:17.850> taken<00:01:18.090> those<00:01:18.270> out<00:01:18.560> and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
those are there I've taken those out and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.649 
those are there I've taken those out and
removed<00:01:20.130> one<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.030> lights<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.509> can

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
removed one of the lights but you can

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.200 
removed one of the lights but you can
see<00:01:21.840> that's<00:01:22.229> what<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.470> light<00:01:22.619> looked<00:01:22.799> like

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
see that's what the light looked like

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.550 
see that's what the light looked like
this<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.360> what<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.600> looks<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:24.900> when<00:01:25.380> it's

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
this is what it looks like when it's

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.590 
this is what it looks like when it's
assembled<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.670> other<00:01:26.850> one<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.030> here<00:01:27.360> so

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
assembled and the other one is here so

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.640 
assembled and the other one is here so
this<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.710> first<00:01:28.950> part<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.000> joint<00:01:30.650> and

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
this is the first part of the joint and

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.069 
this is the first part of the joint and
I've<00:01:31.799> removed<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.369> from<00:01:32.549> there<00:01:32.700> I've<00:01:32.880> also

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
I've removed that from there I've also

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.050 
I've removed that from there I've also
taken<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.350> part<00:01:34.650> off<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.820> see

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
taken this part off and you can see

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.580 
taken this part off and you can see
they've<00:01:36.210> kind<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.630> tried<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.900> waterproof<00:01:37.380> it

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
they've kind of tried to waterproof it

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.020 
they've kind of tried to waterproof it
with<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:39.350> that<00:01:40.350> bit<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.100> heat<00:01:41.340> shrink<00:01:41.640> that

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
with that that bit of heat shrink that

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.300 
with that that bit of heat shrink that
they've<00:01:42.240> put<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.930> screw<00:01:43.649> there<00:01:43.829> but<00:01:44.220> they

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
they've put on that screw there but they

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.380 
they've put on that screw there but they
haven't<00:01:44.460> done<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.820> all<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.030> way<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.360> top

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
haven't done it all the way to the top

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.800 
haven't done it all the way to the top
so<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:45.899> kind<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.200> pointless<00:01:47.180> and<00:01:48.180> then<00:01:48.600> what

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
so it's kind of pointless and then what

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.120 
so it's kind of pointless and then what
I've<00:01:48.930> done<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.320> I've<00:01:49.700> got<00:01:50.700> my<00:01:51.619> own<00:01:52.619> ring<00:01:52.860> set

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
I've done is I've got my own ring set

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.520 
I've done is I've got my own ring set
and<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.880> found<00:01:54.060> one<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.509> fits<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.409> I'm<00:01:55.470> going

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
and I found one that fits so I'm going

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.050 
and I found one that fits so I'm going
to<00:01:55.649> stick<00:01:55.890> one<00:01:57.049> like<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.320> on<00:01:58.710> there<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.939> I'll

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
to stick one like this on there and I'll

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.340 
to stick one like this on there and I'll
tighten<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.420> backup<00:02:00.689> which<00:02:01.020> should<00:02:01.170> water

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
tighten that backup which should water

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.160 
tighten that backup which should water
proof<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.740> I'll<00:02:02.430> find<00:02:02.670> another<00:02:02.790> one<00:02:03.270> for

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
proof that I'll find another one for

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.469 
proof that I'll find another one for
this<00:02:04.619> connection<00:02:05.210> here<00:02:06.210> which<00:02:06.360> would

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
this connection here which would

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.210 
this connection here which would
probably<00:02:06.930> be<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.380> one<00:02:07.590> may<00:02:07.799> be<00:02:07.829> slightly

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
probably be that one may be slightly

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.870 
probably be that one may be slightly
bigger<00:02:08.520> than<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.759> one

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
bigger than that one

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.410 
bigger than that one
I'll<00:02:11.880> get<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.240> sorted<00:02:12.660> out<00:02:12.780> ah<00:02:13.710> and<00:02:14.420> I've

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
I'll get that sorted out ah and I've

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.140 
I'll get that sorted out ah and I've
also<00:02:15.510> got<00:02:15.960> a<00:02:16.770> little<00:02:17.400> bit<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.610> heat<00:02:17.910> shrink

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
also got a little bit of heat shrink

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.500 
also got a little bit of heat shrink
tube<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.540> have<00:02:19.040> which<00:02:20.040> I'll<00:02:20.250> put<00:02:21.180> over<00:02:21.300> the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
tube that I have which I'll put over the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.450 
tube that I have which I'll put over the
top<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.020> screw<00:02:22.290> head<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.740> make<00:02:23.430> sure

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
top of that screw head and make sure

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.050 
top of that screw head and make sure
it's<00:02:23.760> it's<00:02:24.330> nice<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.720> sealed<00:02:25.460> and<00:02:26.460> noticed

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
it's it's nice and sealed and noticed

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.090 
it's it's nice and sealed and noticed
I've<00:02:27.150> taken<00:02:27.360> that<00:02:27.570> out<00:02:27.600> for<00:02:27.900> now<00:02:27.990> well<00:02:28.860> just

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
I've taken that out for now well just

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.430 
I've taken that out for now well just
started<00:02:29.370> putting<00:02:29.460> my<00:02:29.930> my<00:02:30.930> pieces<00:02:31.170> back

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
started putting my my pieces back

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.260 
started putting my my pieces back
together<00:02:31.710> here<00:02:33.260> taking<00:02:34.260> taking<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.490> out<00:02:35.550> was

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
together here taking taking that out was

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.630 
together here taking taking that out was
a<00:02:36.300> pain<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:37.140> me<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.350> good<00:02:37.980> 10<00:02:38.160> minutes<00:02:38.190> just<00:02:38.550> to

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
a pain to me a good 10 minutes just to

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.730 
a pain to me a good 10 minutes just to
get<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.850> bed<00:02:39.030> back<00:02:39.270> in<00:02:39.480> I've<00:02:40.230> already<00:02:40.380> got<00:02:40.590> my

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
get that bed back in I've already got my

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.120 
get that bed back in I've already got my
piece<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:42.050> ice<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.320> see<00:02:43.500> if<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.650> can<00:02:43.800> get<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:44.010> I'm

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
piece of ice to see if I can get it I'm

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.550 
piece of ice to see if I can get it I'm
done<00:02:44.310> here<00:02:44.520> so<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.700> can<00:02:44.790> show<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.410> already<00:02:46.410> got

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
done here so I can show you already got

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.340 
done here so I can show you already got
the<00:02:46.920> piece<00:02:47.130> in<00:02:48.090> there<00:02:48.540> if<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.810> can<00:02:48.900> see<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.170> the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
the piece in there if you can see it the

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.120 
the piece in there if you can see it the
little<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.990> right<00:02:52.170> touch<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.710> all

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
little it is the right touch to that all

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.370 
little it is the right touch to that all
right<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.550> this<00:02:54.480> next<00:02:54.720> one<00:02:54.900> is<00:02:54.930> proving<00:02:55.320> a

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
right this this next one is proving a

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.620 
right this this next one is proving a
little<00:02:55.590> bit<00:02:55.710> tricky<00:02:56.180> this<00:02:57.180> at<00:02:57.450> this

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
little bit tricky this at this

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.540 
little bit tricky this at this
connection<00:02:58.050> here<00:02:58.290> just<00:02:58.890> because<00:02:59.100> I<00:02:59.190> need<00:02:59.370> to

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
connection here just because I need to

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.130 
connection here just because I need to
make<00:02:59.880> sure<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.210> stretch<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.570> out<00:03:00.750> over<00:03:00.990> the

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
make sure that I stretch it out over the

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.820 
make sure that I stretch it out over the
two<00:03:01.470> little<00:03:01.740> ridges<00:03:02.250> as<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.300> comes<00:03:03.540> together

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
two little ridges as it comes together

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.730 
two little ridges as it comes together
so<00:03:04.830> it<00:03:04.920> doesn't<00:03:05.160> doesn't<00:03:05.910> get<00:03:06.090> too<00:03:06.210> tight<00:03:06.390> and

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
so it doesn't doesn't get too tight and

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.020 
so it doesn't doesn't get too tight and
here's<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:07.980> little<00:03:08.130> screw<00:03:08.520> that<00:03:08.730> I've<00:03:08.850> just

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
here's the little screw that I've just

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.050 
here's the little screw that I've just
shoot<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:10.020> shrink-wrapped<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:11.490> head<00:03:11.640> of<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:11.820> I

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
shoot a shrink-wrapped the head of it I

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.170 
shoot a shrink-wrapped the head of it I
think<00:03:12.600> I've<00:03:12.690> done<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.840> pretty<00:03:13.280> good<00:03:14.280> job<00:03:14.550> there

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
think I've done a pretty good job there

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.560 
think I've done a pretty good job there
even<00:03:15.450> by<00:03:15.540> my<00:03:15.690> own<00:03:15.810> standards<00:03:17.270> I've<00:03:18.270> only<00:03:18.390> done

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
even by my own standards I've only done

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.020 
even by my own standards I've only done
the<00:03:18.750> top<00:03:18.930> just<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:19.350> it<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:20.190> creates<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.730> nice

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
the top just so it it creates that nice

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.210 
the top just so it it creates that nice
seal<00:03:21.360> I<00:03:21.390> don't<00:03:21.750> want<00:03:22.080> any<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:22.860> seal<00:03:23.040> to

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
seal I don't want any of the seal to

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.630 
seal I don't want any of the seal to
pass<00:03:23.510> into<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.630> holes<00:03:24.870> i<00:03:25.200> think<00:03:25.410> that<00:03:25.530> would

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
pass into the holes i think that would

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.620 
pass into the holes i think that would
undo<00:03:26.640> any<00:03:26.820> of<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.060> benefits<00:03:28.010> so<00:03:29.630> yeah

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
undo any of the benefits so yeah

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.800 
undo any of the benefits so yeah
basically<00:03:32.000> it's<00:03:33.000> time<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.300> start<00:03:33.480> putting<00:03:33.630> it

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
basically it's time to start putting it

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:41.970 
basically it's time to start putting it
back<00:03:33.989> together

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:50.449 

you

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.800 

so<00:03:51.459> I'm<00:03:51.549> just<00:03:51.730> moving<00:03:51.819> into<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.269> final<00:03:52.420> stages

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
so I'm just moving into the final stages

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.000 
so I'm just moving into the final stages
here<00:03:53.170> I've<00:03:53.950> done<00:03:54.189> both<00:03:54.459> sides<00:03:54.849> now<00:03:55.090> I<00:03:55.299> you<00:03:55.930> can

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
here I've done both sides now I you can

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.899 
here I've done both sides now I you can
probably<00:03:57.010> can't<00:03:57.310> see<00:03:57.370> there's<00:03:57.640> a<00:03:57.730> little

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
probably can't see there's a little

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:58.949 
probably can't see there's a little
rubber<00:03:58.120> seal<00:03:58.299> in<00:03:58.450> there<00:03:58.599> there's<00:03:58.840> a<00:03:58.870> little

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
rubber seal in there there's a little

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.250 
rubber seal in there there's a little
rubber<00:03:59.170> seal<00:03:59.409> in<00:03:59.530> here<00:03:59.769> these<00:04:00.760> have<00:04:01.060> been

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
rubber seal in here these have been

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.170 
rubber seal in here these have been
shrink-wrapped<00:04:02.260> that<00:04:03.189> one's<00:04:03.370> not<00:04:03.730> quite<00:04:03.790> as

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
shrink-wrapped that one's not quite as

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.690 
shrink-wrapped that one's not quite as
tidy<00:04:04.420> as<00:04:04.510> that<00:04:04.750> one<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:05.019> but<00:04:05.230> all<00:04:05.409> the<00:04:06.159> same<00:04:06.370> and

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
tidy as that one is but all the same and

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:14.210 
tidy as that one is but all the same and
now<00:04:06.879> I'm<00:04:07.000> just<00:04:07.950> bundling<00:04:08.950> these<00:04:09.159> cables<00:04:09.640> up

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.599 

and<00:04:16.169> going<00:04:17.169> to<00:04:17.229> put<00:04:17.380> this<00:04:17.470> together<00:04:17.650> I<00:04:17.919> one

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
and going to put this together I one

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.129 
and going to put this together I one
thing<00:04:18.789> I<00:04:18.880> did<00:04:19.090> just<00:04:19.120> want<00:04:19.389> to<00:04:19.479> notice<00:04:19.720> it<00:04:19.900> does

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
thing I did just want to notice it does

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.950 
thing I did just want to notice it does
have<00:04:20.380> a<00:04:20.410> rubber<00:04:20.769> seal<00:04:21.070> on<00:04:21.250> it<00:04:21.330> in<00:04:22.330> there<00:04:22.630> so<00:04:22.840> I'm

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
have a rubber seal on it in there so I'm

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.930 
have a rubber seal on it in there so I'm
not<00:04:25.020> completely<00:04:26.020> reinventing<00:04:26.800> the<00:04:26.889> wheel

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
not completely reinventing the wheel

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.249 
not completely reinventing the wheel
just<00:04:27.940> taking<00:04:28.360> something<00:04:28.900> that's<00:04:28.990> a<00:04:29.169> little

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
just taking something that's a little

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:35.600 
just taking something that's a little
bit<00:04:29.470> low<00:04:29.650> quality<00:04:29.979> and<00:04:32.639> just<00:04:33.639> making<00:04:33.940> it

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
bit low quality and just making it

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.339 
bit low quality and just making it
making<00:04:36.610> it<00:04:36.669> better<00:04:36.820> in<00:04:37.180> fact<00:04:37.570> I<00:04:37.840> think<00:04:38.020> I'm

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
making it better in fact I think I'm

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:40.379 
making it better in fact I think I'm
actually<00:04:38.680> making<00:04:39.039> it<00:04:39.310> usable<00:04:39.820> because<00:04:40.210> if<00:04:40.300> I

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
actually making it usable because if I

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.689 
actually making it usable because if I
didn't<00:04:40.660> do<00:04:40.750> this<00:04:41.639> Steve<00:04:42.639> wouldn't<00:04:44.699> wouldn't

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
didn't do this Steve wouldn't wouldn't

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.270 
didn't do this Steve wouldn't wouldn't
let<00:04:45.849> me<00:04:45.970> use<00:04:46.150> it<00:04:46.180> oh<00:04:46.800> sure<00:04:47.800> I'm<00:04:47.889> still<00:04:48.099> not<00:04:48.190> sure

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
let me use it oh sure I'm still not sure

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.920 
let me use it oh sure I'm still not sure
if<00:04:48.430> he's<00:04:48.550> going<00:04:48.639> to<00:04:48.699> let<00:04:48.820> me<00:04:48.940> use<00:04:49.030> it

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.559

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
nice and perfect if it's not perfect do

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.719 
nice and perfect if it's not perfect do
it<00:05:16.199> again<00:05:16.319> and<00:05:16.770> if<00:05:17.039> it's<00:05:17.249> still<00:05:17.520> not<00:05:17.669> perfect

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
it again and if it's still not perfect

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:26.179 
it again and if it's still not perfect
do<00:05:18.509> it<00:05:18.629> again<00:05:23.569> it's<00:05:24.569> done<00:05:24.689> properly<00:05:24.899> now<00:05:25.349> so

00:05:26.179 --> 00:05:26.189 
do it again it's done properly now so

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:28.820 
do it again it's done properly now so
it's<00:05:26.369> supposed<00:05:26.459> to<00:05:26.639> look<00:05:26.789> like<00:05:27.439> and<00:05:28.439> then<00:05:28.649> this

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
it's supposed to look like and then this

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.920 
it's supposed to look like and then this
one<00:05:28.939> blue<00:05:29.939> return

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.990 

there<00:05:33.930> was<00:05:34.110> if<00:05:34.800> there<00:05:34.860> wasn't<00:05:35.370> more<00:05:35.520> expensive

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
there was if there wasn't more expensive

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.210 
there was if there wasn't more expensive
easier<00:05:36.960> version<00:05:37.230> I<00:05:37.560> totally<00:05:37.830> would<00:05:38.100> have<00:05:38.130> gone

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
easier version I totally would have gone

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
easier version I totally would have gone
for<00:05:39.500> hacking<00:05:40.500> things<00:05:40.800> to<00:05:41.040> make<00:05:41.190> them<00:05:41.250> slightly

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
for hacking things to make them slightly

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:49.220 
for hacking things to make them slightly
better<00:05:42.600> is<00:05:44.120> is<00:05:45.120> a<00:05:45.750> patient<00:05:46.290> sport<00:05:47.720> but<00:05:48.720> you

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
better is is a patient sport but you

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.100 
better is is a patient sport but you
know<00:05:49.610> if<00:05:50.610> you<00:05:50.760> can't<00:05:51.120> get<00:05:51.540> what<00:05:51.750> you<00:05:51.870> want

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110
