whole line even the walls are maxed at

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.900 
whole line even the walls are maxed at
least<00:00:25.050> more<00:00:25.800> than<00:00:26.010> half<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.340> them<00:00:26.550> are<00:00:26.580> Macs

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
and as you can see fee doesn't have a

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.939 
and as you can see fee doesn't have a
BBQing<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.330> an<00:00:30.570> upgrade<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.500> gonna<00:00:31.679> tree

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
BBQing is an upgrade and is gonna tree

BBQing is an upgrade and is gonna tree
star<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.369> base<00:00:32.579> without<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.660> king<00:00:34.309> so<00:00:35.309> let's

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
star this base without a king so let's

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.569 
star this base without a king so let's
analyze<00:00:36.120> why<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:36.989> base<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.800> good<00:00:38.129> for<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> go

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
analyze why this base is good for a go

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.520 
analyze why this base is good for a go
hog<00:00:38.790> attack<00:00:38.940> he's<00:00:39.450> gonna<00:00:39.629> use<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.140> troop

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
hog attack he's gonna use this troop

combination with a golem in the clan

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.900 
combination with a golem in the clan
castle<00:00:48.500> so<00:00:49.500> if<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.100> take<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> level<00:00:50.640> 5

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
castle so if you can take a level 5

castle so if you can take a level 5
golem<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.449> clan<00:00:51.660> castle<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.289> would<00:00:52.500> be

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
golem in the clan castle that would be

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.569 
golem in the clan castle that would be
the<00:00:52.739> best<00:00:53.239> so<00:00:54.500> why<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.739> base<00:00:55.980> good<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.550> a

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the best so why is this base good for a

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.220 
the best so why is this base good for a
go<00:00:56.760> hog<00:00:56.940> attack<00:00:57.239> first<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.719> all<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.020> clan

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
your main threat but if you can't take

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.200 
your main threat but if you can't take
out<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.680> King<00:01:16.920> as<00:01:17.100> well<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.640> even<00:01:17.820> better

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
out the King as well it's even better

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.710 
out the King as well it's even better
and<00:01:18.509> as<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.290> both<00:01:19.890> heroes<00:01:20.549> are<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.450> a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
and as you can see both heroes are in a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.690 
and as you can see both heroes are in a
very<00:01:22.020> good<00:01:22.259> location<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.979> if<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.159> take<00:01:23.369> enough

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
very good location so if you take enough

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.420 
very good location so if you take enough
wizards<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.570> your<00:01:25.380> queen<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.009> if<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.250> had

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
wizards and your queen and if you had

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.060 
wizards and your queen and if you had
the<00:01:26.549> King<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:27.000> would<00:01:27.180> be<00:01:27.330> even<00:01:27.570> easier<00:01:27.890> you<00:01:28.890> can

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
the King it would be even easier you can

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.880 
the King it would be even easier you can
take<00:01:29.250> out<00:01:29.490> both<00:01:30.180> heroes<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.409> case<00:01:31.680> he

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
take out both heroes so in this case he

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.710 
take out both heroes so in this case he
is<00:01:31.950> taking<00:01:32.310> 9<00:01:32.549> wizards<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:35.299> that's<00:01:36.299> a

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
is taking 9 wizards and that's a

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.870 
is taking 9 wizards and that's a
compensation<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:40.200> king<00:01:40.470> because<00:01:41.220> if<00:01:41.520> you

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
compensation for the king because if you

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.730 
compensation for the king because if you
don't<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.479> King<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:43.110> need<00:01:43.320> some<00:01:43.530> more

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
don't have the King you need some more

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.499 
don't have the King you need some more
power<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.759> take<00:01:44.909> out<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:46.590> heroes<00:01:47.149> so<00:01:48.149> he's

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
power to take out the heroes so he's

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.039 
power to take out the heroes so he's
taking<00:01:48.869> few<00:01:49.110> wizards<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.799> cover<00:01:50.040> for<00:01:50.369> that

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
taking few wizards to cover for that

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.490 
taking few wizards to cover for that
next<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.290> wanna<00:01:52.850> make<00:01:53.850> sure<00:01:54.259> there<00:01:55.259> are<00:01:55.350> no

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
next you wanna make sure there are no

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.709 
next you wanna make sure there are no
double<00:01:55.860> bombs<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:56.969> there<00:01:57.210> are<00:01:57.270> double

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
double bombs and if there are double

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.170 
double bombs and if there are double
bombs<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.229> can<00:01:58.439> detonate<00:01:58.770> them<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.939> this

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
bombs you can detonate them and in this

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.910 
bombs you can detonate them and in this
case<00:02:00.450> if<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.899> look<00:02:00.930> at<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.320> locations

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
case if you look at the locations

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.810 
case if you look at the locations
remember<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.119> double<00:02:03.479> bomb

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.240 

that<00:02:05.940> the<00:02:06.060> giant<00:02:06.420> bump<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.840> two<00:02:07.590> tiles<00:02:07.860> and

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
that the giant bump is two tiles and

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.980 
that the giant bump is two tiles and
this<00:02:09.240> is<00:02:09.479> for<00:02:09.899> example<00:02:10.380> three<00:02:10.860> tiles<00:02:11.600> so<00:02:12.600> he

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
this is for example three tiles so he

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.140 
this is for example three tiles so he
can<00:02:13.170> put<00:02:13.380> only<00:02:13.860> one<00:02:14.070> bomb<00:02:14.370> over<00:02:14.580> here<00:02:14.910> for

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
can put only one bomb over here for

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.360 
can put only one bomb over here for
example<00:02:15.660> if<00:02:15.959> that<00:02:16.680> guy<00:02:16.890> was<00:02:17.300> smart<00:02:18.300> he<00:02:18.630> would

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
example if that guy was smart he would

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.730 
example if that guy was smart he would
make<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.580> base<00:02:20.880> this<00:02:21.360> way<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.590> would

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
make this base this way and you would

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.920 
make this base this way and you would
think<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:23.340> there<00:02:23.730> are<00:02:23.760> two<00:02:24.030> bombs<00:02:24.360> over<00:02:24.600> here

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
think that there are two bombs over here

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.880 
think that there are two bombs over here
but<00:02:25.140> he<00:02:25.980> didn't<00:02:26.340> make<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.610> this<00:02:26.970> way<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.890> you

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
but he didn't make it this way and you

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.400 
but he didn't make it this way and you
know<00:02:29.100> there's<00:02:29.400> one<00:02:29.760> bomb<00:02:30.270> there<00:02:30.750> can<00:02:31.020> be<00:02:31.050> one

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
know there's one bomb there can be one

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.949 
know there's one bomb there can be one
bomb<00:02:31.680> over<00:02:32.010> here<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.700> can<00:02:33.000> be<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.180> Tesla<00:02:33.630> as<00:02:33.690> well

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
bomb over here it can be a Tesla as well

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.580 
bomb over here it can be a Tesla as well
but<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.920> can<00:02:35.220> be<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.430> bump<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:37.170> possible

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
but it can be a bump so the possible

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.640 
but it can be a bump so the possible
location<00:02:38.100> for<00:02:38.130> bumps<00:02:38.970> are<00:02:39.150> over<00:02:39.840> here<00:02:40.110> only<00:02:40.320> a

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
location for bumps are over here only a

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.920 
location for bumps are over here only a
single<00:02:40.980> bump<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:42.120> shouldn't<00:02:42.540> bother<00:02:42.750> you

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
single bump and it shouldn't bother you

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.199 
single bump and it shouldn't bother you
at<00:02:43.170> all<00:02:43.350> if<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.739> drop<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.130> hill<00:02:44.310> spells<00:02:44.640> in

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
at all if you drop the hill spells in

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.229 
at all if you drop the hill spells in
the<00:02:45.480> right<00:02:45.660> timing<00:02:45.959> in<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.530> right<00:02:46.680> place<00:02:47.239> you

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
the right timing in the right place you

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.040 
the right timing in the right place you
can<00:02:48.420> get<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:48.840> very<00:02:49.080> easily<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:50.700> can<00:02:51.660> put

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
can get that very easily and you can put

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.550 
can get that very easily and you can put
double<00:02:52.440> bombs<00:02:52.680> over<00:02:53.340> here<00:02:53.840> one<00:02:54.840> bump<00:02:55.110> only

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
double bombs over here one bump only

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.070 
double bombs over here one bump only
over<00:02:55.830> here<00:02:56.160> that's<00:02:56.700> one<00:02:57.060> here<00:02:57.570> you<00:02:57.690> can<00:02:57.720> put

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
over here that's one here you can put

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.050 
over here that's one here you can put
you<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.670> here<00:02:59.670> he<00:02:59.940> can<00:03:00.150> put<00:03:00.390> you<00:03:01.110> as<00:03:01.260> well<00:03:01.560> and

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
you and here he can put you as well and

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.560 
you and here he can put you as well and
here<00:03:03.060> we<00:03:03.180> can<00:03:03.360> put<00:03:03.570> only<00:03:03.930> one<00:03:04.110> so<00:03:05.300> there<00:03:06.300> too

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
here we can put only one so there too

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.520 
here we can put only one so there too
there<00:03:07.290> are<00:03:07.380> two<00:03:07.500> possibilities<00:03:08.450> one<00:03:09.450> is<00:03:09.959> that

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
there are two possibilities one is that

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.890 
there are two possibilities one is that
there<00:03:11.160> Tesla's<00:03:11.840> in<00:03:12.840> those<00:03:13.230> locations<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:14.900> the

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
there Tesla's in those locations and the

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.090 
there Tesla's in those locations and the
bombs<00:03:16.140> are<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.250> core<00:03:18.410> so<00:03:19.410> for<00:03:19.739> Tesla's

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
bombs are in the core so for Tesla's

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.539 
bombs are in the core so for Tesla's
over<00:03:20.370> here<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:21.350> bombs<00:03:22.350> in<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.709> core<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.100> the

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
over here and bombs in the core and the

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.640 
over here and bombs in the core and the
other<00:03:23.700> possibility<00:03:23.940> is<00:03:24.420> that<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:25.110> Tesla's

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
other possibility is that the Tesla's

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.240 
other possibility is that the Tesla's
are<00:03:25.980> in<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.940> core<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:27.989> bombs<00:03:28.200> are<00:03:28.620> single

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
are in the core and the bombs are single

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.620 
are in the core and the bombs are single
bumps<00:03:29.640> are<00:03:29.930> on<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.230> middle<00:03:31.530> ring<00:03:31.820> so<00:03:32.820> you

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
bumps are on the middle ring so you

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.750 
bumps are on the middle ring so you
should<00:03:33.840> plan<00:03:34.110> your<00:03:34.140> attack<00:03:34.410> well<00:03:34.829> and<00:03:35.070> use

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
should plan your attack well and use

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.530 
should plan your attack well and use
your<00:03:36.329> heels<00:03:37.010> wisely<00:03:38.010> most<00:03:38.430> chances<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.269> if

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
your heels wisely most chances that if

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.840 
your heels wisely most chances that if
there<00:03:39.989> are<00:03:40.019> bombs<00:03:40.290> in<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.980> core<00:03:41.250> it's<00:03:41.579> gonna

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
there are bombs in the core it's gonna

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.440 
there are bombs in the core it's gonna
be<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.329> bit<00:03:42.630> harder<00:03:43.049> to<00:03:43.230> get<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:45.120> will<00:03:45.269> have

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
be a bit harder to get and you will have

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.160 
be a bit harder to get and you will have
to<00:03:45.660> drop<00:03:46.040> your<00:03:47.040> heels<00:03:47.370> well<00:03:47.810> somewhere<00:03:48.810> here

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
to drop your heels well somewhere here

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.080 
to drop your heels well somewhere here
so<00:03:49.410> you<00:03:49.470> can<00:03:49.739> cover<00:03:50.299> the<00:03:51.299> we<00:03:51.510> stour<00:03:51.780> as<00:03:52.019> well

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
so you can cover the we stour as well

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.970 
so you can cover the we stour as well
but<00:03:54.090> if<00:03:54.390> you<00:03:54.600> notice<00:03:54.810> that<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.530> bombs<00:03:55.739> are<00:03:55.950> in

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
but if you notice that the bombs are in

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.460 
but if you notice that the bombs are in
the<00:03:56.220> middle<00:03:56.489> ring<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:57.060> will<00:03:57.750> be<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:57.930> bit<00:03:58.200> easier

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
the middle ring it will be a bit easier

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.410 
the middle ring it will be a bit easier
and<00:03:59.720> you<00:04:00.720> can<00:04:00.930> drop<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.290> heel<00:04:01.500> spell<00:04:01.829> in<00:04:02.420> this

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
and you can drop the heel spell in this

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.740 
and you can drop the heel spell in this
way<00:04:03.690> for<00:04:03.750> example<00:04:04.280> so<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.310> can<00:04:05.519> cover<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.420> wiz

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
way for example so you can cover a wiz

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.190 
way for example so you can cover a wiz
tower<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.890> bump<00:04:08.130> together<00:04:08.760> so<00:04:09.750> those

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
tower and the bump together so those

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.809 
tower and the bump together so those
will<00:04:10.530> be

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
will be

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.970 
will be
your<00:04:12.450> heels<00:04:12.749> while<00:04:12.989> he's<00:04:13.170> taking<00:04:13.349> three<00:04:13.739> heels

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
your heels while he's taking three heels

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.300 
your heels while he's taking three heels
policy<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.459> gotta<00:04:14.640> pick<00:04:15.120> three<00:04:15.569> spots<00:04:15.870> but<00:04:16.709> it

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
policy you gotta pick three spots but it

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.969 
policy you gotta pick three spots but it
doesn't<00:04:17.579> really<00:04:17.759> matter<00:04:17.970> notice<00:04:18.570> that<00:04:18.979> this

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
doesn't really matter notice that this

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.009 
doesn't really matter notice that this
whist<00:04:20.370> hour<00:04:20.609> is<00:04:20.940> not<00:04:21.209> gonna<00:04:21.449> bother<00:04:21.690> you

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
whist hour is not gonna bother you

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.879 
whist hour is not gonna bother you
because<00:04:23.030> he's<00:04:24.030> gonna<00:04:24.240> take<00:04:24.509> it<00:04:24.660> out<00:04:24.810> with<00:04:25.740> the

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
because he's gonna take it out with the

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.860 
because he's gonna take it out with the
Wizards<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:27.570> Queen<00:04:27.870> so<00:04:28.970> pick<00:04:29.970> the<00:04:30.630> rest

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
Wizards and the Queen so pick the rest

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.129 
Wizards and the Queen so pick the rest
of<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.199> three<00:04:31.349> spots<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:32.479> make<00:04:33.479> sure<00:04:33.690> you<00:04:33.870> let

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
of the three spots and make sure you let

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.700 
of the three spots and make sure you let
you<00:04:34.650> put<00:04:34.889> your<00:04:34.919> heels<00:04:35.400> in<00:04:36.270> place<00:04:36.599> so<00:04:36.930> this<00:04:37.530> is

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
you put your heels in place so this is

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.680 
you put your heels in place so this is
something<00:04:38.009> you<00:04:38.160> need<00:04:38.310> to<00:04:38.550> decide<00:04:39.120> during<00:04:39.509> the

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
something you need to decide during the

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.629 
something you need to decide during the
attack<00:04:39.960> if<00:04:40.259> no<00:04:40.590> one<00:04:40.740> attack<00:04:41.009> this<00:04:41.190> base<00:04:41.250> I'm

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
attack if no one attack this base I'm

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.060 
attack if no one attack this base I'm
not<00:04:41.940> sure<00:04:42.210> I<00:04:42.479> don't<00:04:42.960> remember<00:04:43.259> if<00:04:43.650> someone

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
not sure I don't remember if someone

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.120 
not sure I don't remember if someone
attacked<00:04:44.400> this<00:04:44.550> base<00:04:44.789> before<00:04:45.060> we<00:04:45.660> did<00:04:46.130> that's

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
attacked this base before we did that's

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.999 
attacked this base before we did that's
a<00:04:47.250> possibility<00:04:47.699> but<00:04:48.030> I<00:04:48.630> have<00:04:49.500> no<00:04:49.680> idea<00:04:50.009> so<00:04:52.009> he

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
a possibility but I have no idea so he

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.159 
a possibility but I have no idea so he
attack<00:04:53.280> this<00:04:53.460> base<00:04:53.520> and<00:04:54.060> you<00:04:54.449> will<00:04:54.630> see<00:04:54.900> where

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
attack this base and you will see where

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
he drops the heal spells and I guess we

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.900 
he drops the heal spells and I guess we
can<00:04:59.009> see<00:04:59.160> the<00:04:59.340> attack<00:04:59.580> now<00:05:01.099> so<00:05:02.099> let's<00:05:02.639> start
