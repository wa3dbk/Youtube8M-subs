200 and something they're not even at
issue<00:04:18.449> 100<00:04:19.079> yet<00:04:19.260> I<00:04:19.289> don't<00:04:19.500> think<00:04:20.060> so<00:04:21.060> yeah<00:04:21.919> they

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
issue 100 yet I don't think so yeah they

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.330 
issue 100 yet I don't think so yeah they
already<00:04:23.250> announced<00:04:23.460> his<00:04:23.940> death<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:26.190> where

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
already announced his death to where

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.800 
already announced his death to where
with<00:04:26.729> voting

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
with voting

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.210 
with voting
least<00:04:27.930> it's<00:04:28.169> like<00:04:28.350> well<00:04:28.680> you<00:04:28.919> have<00:04:28.950> the

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
least it's like well you have the

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.980 
least it's like well you have the
uncertainty<00:04:29.760> of<00:04:29.790> if<00:04:30.150> they're<00:04:30.360> gonna<00:04:30.510> die<00:04:30.810> or

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
uncertainty of if they're gonna die or

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.400 
uncertainty of if they're gonna die or
not

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
not

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.360 
not
and<00:04:31.500> so<00:04:31.919> it's<00:04:32.040> like<00:04:32.100> like<00:04:32.400> I'd<00:04:32.550> I<00:04:32.669> think<00:04:32.910> I<00:04:33.060> died

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
and so it's like like I'd I think I died

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.740 
and so it's like like I'd I think I died
something<00:04:35.370> that<00:04:35.520> was<00:04:35.610> pretty<00:04:35.820> cool<00:04:36.000> that<00:04:36.090> DC

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
something that was pretty cool that DC

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.570 
something that was pretty cool that DC
did<00:04:36.990> that<00:04:37.200> even<00:04:37.650> if<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.919> voting<00:04:38.130> didn't

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
did that even if the voting didn't

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.129 
did that even if the voting didn't
matter<00:04:38.730> at<00:04:38.970> all<00:04:39.000> at<00:04:39.389> least<00:04:39.419> they<00:04:39.780> gave<00:04:39.960> an

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
matter at all at least they gave an

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.980 
matter at all at least they gave an
illusion<00:04:40.770> so<00:04:40.980> not<00:04:41.639> everyone<00:04:42.000> was<00:04:42.060> 100%<00:04:42.690> sure

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
illusion so not everyone was 100% sure

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.240 
illusion so not everyone was 100% sure
if<00:04:43.230> he's<00:04:43.380> gonna<00:04:43.500> die<00:04:43.740> or<00:04:43.889> not

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
if he's gonna die or not

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.150 
if he's gonna die or not
I<00:04:44.750> think<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.840> voting<00:04:46.050> was<00:04:46.320> legit<00:04:46.740> though<00:04:46.950> I

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
I think the voting was legit though I

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.720 
I think the voting was legit though I
don't<00:04:47.340> I<00:04:47.610> don't<00:04:48.120> think<00:04:48.450> it<00:04:48.600> was<00:04:48.720> a<00:04:48.780> faked<00:04:49.350> I

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
don't I don't think it was a faked I

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.950 
don't I don't think it was a faked I
don't<00:04:50.730> think<00:04:50.880> there<00:04:51.000> just<00:04:51.030> did<00:04:51.480> it<00:04:51.630> to<00:04:51.780> make

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
don't think there just did it to make

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.470 
don't think there just did it to make
people<00:04:52.280> believe<00:04:53.280> that<00:04:53.820> oh<00:04:53.880> maybe<00:04:54.480> -<00:04:54.870> a<00:04:56.480> guy

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
people believe that oh maybe - a guy

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:11.000 
people believe that oh maybe - a guy
