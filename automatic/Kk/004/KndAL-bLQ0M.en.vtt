00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:08.500
 when watson and crick discovered the 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.990
 double helix of the DNA in 1953 all the 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.730
 science was euphoric it was believed that 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.460
 that was the key to unravel the 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.189
 forty years of life 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.439
 then in 1995 there was another great 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.480
 advance the sequencing of the first 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.080
 complete genome of the bacterium that 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.450
 causes meningitis 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.100
 it was thought that from then on the 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.750
 genome would provide answers to 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.820
 great problems of medicine and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.820
 human biology but it was not like that 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.600
 Now biologists have realized 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.640
 that the genome sequence alone 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.820
 can not explain the great complexity of 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.980
 a living organism 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.780
 that's why they begin to change the point of 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.020
 view of your research and focus 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.270
 in the relationship between proteins that 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.460
 Proteomics is and what is 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.620
 dedicate Luis Serrano 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.840
 to try to understand the difference 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.030
 between one another between genomics and 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.390
 proteomics in networks has occurred to us 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:09.170
 make a metaphor let's imagine that the 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.180
 cell is a great company that is in 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.360
 sanction but that this week the 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.360
 draft 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.180
 yes 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.280
 and like any company ours too 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.850
 has a building with its structure its 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.590
 halls its corridors its spaces have 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.990
 directors who are in charge of directing the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.700
 cell and making decisions and they know 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.330
 of course at all times that there is 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.520
 make the director of this cell 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.020
 contains all the genetic information 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.150
 that regulates the operation of the 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.970
 company or a living being and gives orders to 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.420
 the workers in the cell synthesizes 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.040
 proteins and directs its functions to what 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.040
 the company is dedicated in this case a 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.950
 strange advertising agency what are 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.170
 your general goals and that we what 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.090
 explains genomics however the 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.710
 genomics has no idea what it does 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.390
 each worker or the information that 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.510
 they exchange neither of the messes that there are 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.520
 between them that is can not explain 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.520
 how the organism works globally 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.100
 for example this is marta director of 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.890
 accounts and even the hat is bundled with 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.070
 pablo the designer who works with 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.070
 louis 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.470
 on the other hand we have the secretary 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.330
 The boss is 32 years old and entered the 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.810
 company makes 5 gets along very well with 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.670
 laura a ana marta luis pablo laura all 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.260
 they interact with each other and with their work 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.430
 energy and personality generated in the 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.430
 mechanism of life 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.569
 proteomics tries to understand these 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.819
 relationships as they interact with each other 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.900
 all the proteins in a cell and how 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.900
 carry out their functions 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.540
 the next step will be to simulate all that 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.340
 by computer can modify the 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.560
 statutes and perhaps 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.010
 director to be able to later create 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.160
 synthetic life but that is already another 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.160
 history
