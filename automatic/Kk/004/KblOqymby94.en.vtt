they're<00:02:11.940> not<00:02:12.060> as<00:02:12.270> harmful<00:02:12.630> for<00:02:12.990> the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
they're not as harmful for the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.940 
they're not as harmful for the
environment<00:02:13.140> as<00:02:13.830> they<00:02:14.130> used<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.730> be<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.950> it's

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
environment as they used to be and it's

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.980 
environment as they used to be and it's
like<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.280> bought<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.640> can<00:02:17.880> you're<00:02:18.510> releasing

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
like you bought the can you're releasing

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.100 
like you bought the can you're releasing
all<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.410> air<00:02:19.590> into<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.860> atmosphere<00:02:20.010> anyways

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
all the air into the atmosphere anyways

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.910 
all the air into the atmosphere anyways
I<00:02:22.110> don't<00:02:22.980> know<00:02:23.040> what<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.280> chemical<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:24.920> but

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
I don't know what the chemical is but

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.500 
I don't know what the chemical is but
it's<00:02:26.760> um<00:02:27.030> not<00:02:27.920> zone<00:02:28.920> depleting<00:02:29.490> but<00:02:30.180> it's<00:02:30.300> just

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
it's um not zone depleting but it's just

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.980 
it's um not zone depleting but it's just
a<00:02:30.600> little<00:02:30.840> bit<00:02:30.960> of<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.110> greenhouse<00:02:31.500> gas<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:32.040> think

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
a little bit of a greenhouse gas I think

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.960 
a little bit of a greenhouse gas I think
I'm<00:02:33.990> not<00:02:34.440> 100%<00:02:35.250> certain<00:02:35.460> but<00:02:35.670> it's<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.820> lot

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
I'm not 100% certain but it's a lot

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.370 
I'm not 100% certain but it's a lot
safer<00:02:36.210> for<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.570> environment<00:02:37.050> than<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.230> old

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
safer for the environment than the old

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.850 
safer for the environment than the old
stuff<00:02:37.680> but<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.310> best<00:02:38.460> way<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:38.670> found<00:02:39.090> as<00:02:40.080> you

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
stuff but the best way I found as you

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
cut them right here and look at that no

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.630 
cut them right here and look at that no

mess you know it's safe now there's a

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.930 
mess you know it's safe now there's a
hole<00:02:51.720> in<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:53.100> guy<00:02:53.220> at<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.340> scrap<00:02:53.640> yard<00:02:53.670> is

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
hole in it the guy at the scrap yard is

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.199 
hole in it the guy at the scrap yard is
gonna<00:02:54.060> squeeze<00:02:54.330> it<00:02:54.540> probably<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:57.030> works

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
gonna squeeze it probably and it works

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.070 
gonna squeeze it probably and it works
on<00:02:57.450> everything<00:02:59.600> there's<00:03:00.600> some<00:03:00.780> engine

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
on everything there's some engine

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.480 
on everything there's some engine
degreaser<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.240> uh<00:03:04.010> there's<00:03:05.010> some<00:03:05.130> more<00:03:05.250> spray

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
degreaser and uh there's some more spray

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.410 
degreaser and uh there's some more spray
paint<00:03:07.250> look<00:03:08.250> at<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.490> then<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:08.880> get<00:03:09.000> any<00:03:09.090> paint
