00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.970
 October 2 last hit the bad luck 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.770
 silvio proto who was injured during 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.630
 the warm-up of the league duel 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.240
 Champions against hyper that piraeus 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.320
 he had to be replaced at short notice 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.970
 by kaminski it's a simple balloon to 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.680
 warming 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.810
 max is a small ball with a rebound 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.970
 just in front of me and my foot remains 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.220
 stuck in the ground 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.930
 Maj we will turn but not my ankle 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.699
 there is a ligament on the side of the foot 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.770
 who tore up happily not 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.300
 totally because otherwise we should have 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.699
 do an operation there I was 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.989
 unavailable two to about three months 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:38.890
 to go to lyon I had in my misfortune 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.680
 I was lucky 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.020
 and that's why we have to 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.790
 we had to go back little by little to 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.950
 remarried to immobilize the foot also a 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.680
 certain moment and then picks up from 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.030
 resume the race slowly and 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.280
 do exercises to not lose too much 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.430
 of muscles and now here I am 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.410
 can be a guardian of workouts 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.690
 it's weird because I was 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.510
 not been hurt for almost four 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.000
 years and a half and then there in three months 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.020
 I was wounded twice so it's 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.360
 weird it's difficult too 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.500
 mentally but now 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.899
 I hope I see the end of the tunnel and 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.940
 The end of the tunnel 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.979
 it was better now for me the 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.630
 revalidation is a solitary period 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.070
 while all teammates are 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.200
 on the lawn silvio proto must 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.610
 to train separately it is necessary 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.440
 more work hard for 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.390
 back in the course that when we 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.520
 normally train with the nucleus a 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.350
 very difficult period for silvio who 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.690
 must always try to return to his 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.920
 best level 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.570
 you have to work twice as much as 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.789
 the others for to return what is 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.140
 normal and that's what also is 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.820
 difficult since here you were a good 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.170
 level and then you say here is now 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.880
 I have to do everything for 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.270
 come back to that level and that's from the 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.479
 exceed 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.790
 so it's often alone, too, in 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.280
 the room so it's not easy but it 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.680
 is also part of mid-career August a 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.900
 less good times less good times 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.090
 you have to know how to live with that good you know 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.909
 when he does this job who have some 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.650
 ideas of where do you go to see these 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.680
 managing times you have to know the 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.680
 manage 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.640
 now we are a month later 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.660
 and everything indicates that silvio is on the 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.459
 way of healing 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.840
 he again drives on 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.489
 field with the guardian coach 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.540
 and the physical is better 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.680
 it's difficult at first you're hurt 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.760
 but what always makes 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.730
 workouts in the room and 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.520
 it's not all fun but 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.590
 now here 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.030
 we associate that with the field and that's 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.820
 more enjoyable here we can work 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.960
 harder also has more energy 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.810
 here I think we have we are still 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.760
 well framed kun is always with me 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.460
 so we laugh and we laugh 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.120
 for this is because it's not that not the 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.330
 end of the world 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.950
 I think of my ti still a maticki 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.500
 more serious injury than mine 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.880
 so I assume that in life 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.250
 but here is always better than oneself 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.030
 but always worse so go 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.260
 do not go too far 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.330
 for things that happen 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.980
 we must try to retain the positive and 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.260
 I can not wait to find the 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.780
 field but it's really missing 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.100
 really hungry to start over it's 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.860
 important also after an injury from 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.050
 here's catching up on hunger and wanting 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.920
 make good benefits 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.000
 now go to the nearby 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.350
 to start 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.480
 to play matches I think in 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.180
 a week should be ready for 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.460
 replay for you to play a game the 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.370
 match against the psg will happen too soon 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.870
 for me but I hope the match 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.230
 against genk here I 'll be I'm 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.670
 able 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.670
 he probably played that match there
