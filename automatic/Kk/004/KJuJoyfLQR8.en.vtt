00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.089
 good morning, thank you very much for being 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.120
 here on a subject that is fundamental to 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.579
 our sugar and that we have to send 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.219
 a message not only to the people of LeÃ³n 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:16.250
 but to the whole country that we're going to 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.949
 to agree that the 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.230
 football matches have been and are a 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.320
 place of coexistence and a very space 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.630
 important then have the security and 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.599
 that can be carried out each of 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.429
 the parties in a different way the 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.160
 commitment that we are making here is 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.800
 which you will have to comply fully not 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.450
 only with this protocol for 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.180
 the way they have to leave the 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.090
 visiting team but we will have to 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.980
 comply fully with the regulation not 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.190
 only the municipal authorities 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.050
 but also what is the league and what 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.480
 is the team owners the 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.420
 public ministry so that it is also 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.699
 present here for the purpose of attending or 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.699
 to inhibit the commission of crimes a 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.720
 thing is what I would have to 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.020
 correspond to the municipal authority 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.289
 what would be the administrative and 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.729
 On the other hand, the local authority 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:12.890
 I would have to handle the issue of 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.009
 commission of crimes as they could be 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.630
 the injuries the damage I think the 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.729
 presence in some way would inhibit 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.860
 also the commission of crimes we 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.340
 would generate tranquility for those who 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.860
 come to the stadium whether they are local or 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.600
 foreign visitors know that there is a 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.090
 control regarding the issue of 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.330
 security and finally it is up to us 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.039
 to the municipality to guarantee safety and 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.150
 has given instructions to General Pizarro 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.790
 in order that 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.550
 to create a police a police 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.830
 specialized to cover this kind of 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.220
 massive events where there is competition 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.410
 where I could have risk in the 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.690
 events the family in events that are 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.120
 as how are these that are a true 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.950
 party for the Leonians was already given to the 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.900
 knowledge of the authorities by 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.580
 part of the municipality that corresponds to us 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.190
 which is the direction of internal affairs 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.970
 you already have the research and you are right now 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.070
 analyzing the to demarcate 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.250
 responsibility the commitment is that in 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.470
 the next match you have a group 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.720
 special that the general will already review 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.710
 who will be the people who gather the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.800
 profile for this type of 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.810
 at the final whistle and they will have a 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.060
 Different attention because it is important 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.760
 which leads them to the Authority 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.570
 guarantee them safety is the first 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.180
 approach was very important because 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.790
 I have just one week touched me 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.160
 unfortunately an event so I think 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.410
 which is also an opportunity to 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.290
 improve this by giving good service in 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.300
 this aspect in human rights makes 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.190
 please accompany General Pizarro 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.950
 in order to agree 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.930
 also with human rights in this 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.310
 training topic for respect to 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.620
 individual guarantees and rights 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.990
 humans work hand in hand as you see what 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.870
 we are trying to do here both the 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.090
 league as 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.739
 team and its servant with authority 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.140
 There are usually 300 tickets that are 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.569
 They give to the visiting truncheon on this occasion 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.750
 they entered more than 1000 them for their 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.250
 part enter they buy the tickets is 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.230
 something that we also have to coordinate 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.569
 by contact and communication 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.879
 starting from 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.079
 of the title that are animation groups 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:31.939
 I think the animation groups 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:35.560
 should do is encourage to infect the 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:39.590
 stadium generate a joy atmosphere 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.079
 of support through your participation 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.239
 but that's a job that you have to 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.310
 do and continue to do hand in hand with 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.680
 each of the animation groups and 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.870
 when the lion soccer team gets 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.969
 the green shirt and goes out to play a 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.909
 local football match or 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:58.939
 visitor not the most to 11 players that 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.950
 they are looking for victory but we are 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:03.560
 seeing representing a team 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.439
 football that represents a city to 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.310
 some interests to some emotions in power 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:12.949
 turn that passion that overflow 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.290
 the animation groups in real 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:18.349
 animation engines towards the stadium and 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.739
 not on engines that keep people away 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:24.050
 of the stadiums Mexican football was born 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.550
 as a family part and we want that 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.860
 that value that is fundamental to 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.379
 we remain a value and a pillar 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.319
 we want to see the stadiums with women 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:35.150
 with children with older people with 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:37.069
 families so much to the 'lion city' 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.680
 Like many other cities, it is not 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:41.810
 priority or exclusive thing of the 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.030
 'lion city' in the city of mexico 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.550
 in guadalajara in monterrey are 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.590
 issues of common jurisdiction and there is 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.990
 attack them in that sense but do not 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.460
 we can say to soccer and load the 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.189
 hand to football for situations that 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.620
 outside of football reiterated and concluded 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:05:00.409
 that for the theme of the groups of 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.590
 animation is the call of all 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:06.889
 the parts of the team authority 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.830
 local league many others 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.210
 factors under the fundamental principle 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.389
 than the Leonese in this case 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.180
 they like to come to football and 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.639
 see his team win and I summon the 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.889
 leoneses that see for ahead we are 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.779
 close to the group that see their 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.300
 team if you can get to the liguilla 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:29.449
 we are close to the qualification to the 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.340
 liberators who see their team in the 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:33.590
 Copa Libertadores and is reaching 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.770
 merits to be able to reach a 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.500
 and let's see to the front and what are you 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:43.040
 situations that are that nobody 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.530
 like to live them or have them good and we 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.930
 we have sat down to be able to take actions 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.940
 and go building in positive if 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.430
 we want to continue emphasizing the negative 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.980
 we will be missing the time of what 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.960
 that what is truly important 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.360
 build around the lion team in 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.730
 this occasion and the other 17 teams 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.320
 of the mx league and I really appreciate the 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.690
 presence of the mayor of course 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.450
 the support of Maria's desire to for 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.010
 as he mentions do not keep looking towards 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.530
 the front to see the positive that comes 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.940
 for the team and to know that things are 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.710
 they are doing well this was something that 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.220
 really we are very sorry with what 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.890
 it happened but let's give it 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.010
 turn around the sheet and see for what 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.010
 comes 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.000
 here in which low understand
