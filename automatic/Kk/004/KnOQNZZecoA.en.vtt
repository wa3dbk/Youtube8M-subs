00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
the case on it's really nice it's

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.359 
the case on it's really nice it's
protected<00:02:01.259> from<00:02:01.380> everything<00:02:01.860> i've<00:02:02.040> actually

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
protected from everything i've actually

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.660 
protected from everything i've actually
dropped<00:02:02.850> my<00:02:03.060> HTC<00:02:03.479> One<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.810> couple<00:02:04.110> times

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
dropped my HTC One a couple times

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.190 
dropped my HTC One a couple times
thankfully<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.700> had<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.909> case<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.570> then<00:02:06.990> as

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
thankfully I had the case on and then as

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.169 
thankfully I had the case on and then as
you<00:02:07.380> can<00:02:07.409> see<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.890> edges<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.610> little<00:02:08.759> bit

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
you can see the edges a little bit

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:09.639 
you can see the edges a little bit
raised

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
raised

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.699 
raised
so<00:02:10.340> even<00:02:10.519> if<00:02:10.610> you<00:02:10.759> put<00:02:11.450> your<00:02:11.569> HTC<00:02:11.870> One<00:02:12.230> flat

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
so even if you put your HTC One flat

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.789 
so even if you put your HTC One flat
down<00:02:12.980> there's<00:02:13.549> still<00:02:14.379> no<00:02:15.379> contact<00:02:15.709> between

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
down there's still no contact between

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:17.619 
down there's still no contact between
the<00:02:16.040> surface<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.579> your<00:02:16.909> screen<00:02:17.390> which<00:02:17.599> is

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
the surface and your screen which is

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.929 
the surface and your screen which is
definitely<00:02:17.930> good<00:02:18.319> but<00:02:19.250> like<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.459> said<00:02:19.519> there<00:02:19.849> is

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939 
definitely good but like I said there is

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.940 
definitely good but like I said there is
a<00:02:19.970> lot<00:02:20.180> of<00:02:20.209> dust<00:02:20.569> that<00:02:20.720> gets<00:02:21.200> in<00:02:21.439> there<00:02:21.680> just

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
a lot of dust that gets in there just

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.470 
a lot of dust that gets in there just
I'm<00:02:22.129> just<00:02:22.189> going<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.489> take<00:02:22.579> the<00:02:22.849> case<00:02:23.030> off<00:02:23.209> to

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
I'm just going to take the case off to

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.679 
I'm just going to take the case off to
show<00:02:23.659> you<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:25.030> think<00:02:26.030> in<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.209> case<00:02:26.359> that<00:02:26.420> is

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689 
show you I think in the case that is

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.289 
show you I think in the case that is
pretty<00:02:26.840> easy<00:02:27.049> you<00:02:27.200> just<00:02:27.319> have<00:02:27.439> to<00:02:27.739> pull<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.040> off

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
pretty easy you just have to pull it off

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.610 
pretty easy you just have to pull it off
there<00:02:29.299> are<00:02:29.359> three<00:02:29.599> sections<00:02:29.840> right<00:02:30.170> then<00:02:30.439> you

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
there are three sections right then you

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.990 
there are three sections right then you
can<00:02:30.739> take<00:02:30.859> out<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.129> first<00:02:31.370> section<00:02:34.000> hopefully

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
can take out the first section hopefully

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.330 
can take out the first section hopefully
not<00:02:35.720> break<00:02:36.470> it<00:02:37.299> oops<00:02:38.739> well<00:02:39.739> as<00:02:39.890> being<00:02:40.069> it's

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
not break it oops well as being it's

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.039 
not break it oops well as being it's
being<00:02:40.519> stubborn<00:02:40.760> right<00:02:41.030> now<00:02:41.209> but<00:02:41.480> usually

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
being stubborn right now but usually

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.000 
being stubborn right now but usually
it's<00:02:42.260> really<00:02:42.500> easy<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:43.040> take<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.430> case<00:02:43.670> of<00:02:45.010> yet

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
it's really easy to take the case of yet

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.559 
it's really easy to take the case of yet
see<00:02:46.220> sections<00:02:46.609> to<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.819> case<00:02:47.000> there's<00:02:47.269> one<00:02:47.420> at

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
see sections to the case there's one at

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.420 
see sections to the case there's one at
the<00:02:47.659> bottom<00:02:47.840> one<00:02:48.319> at<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.530> top<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.099> one<00:02:49.340> in

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:53.389 
the middle I'll try and get the top off

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:58.660 
the middle I'll try and get the top off
first<00:02:54.049> maybe<00:02:55.930> all<00:02:56.930> right<00:02:57.109> there<00:02:57.379> we<00:02:57.470> go<00:02:57.670> so

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
first maybe all right there we go so

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.000
