00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 super 8 form filled super8 film 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.040
 super 8 made with a camera of 40 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.889
 Years ago 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.870
 here is what my family was 40 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.320
 years ago to see their memories 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.970
 view cartoons also existed 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.980
 which could make the child see me 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.250
 I remember very well and old cartoons 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.369
 Animated that we saw at home with this 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.710
 projector and then your movies of 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.140
 family that were put into this 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.770
 type of plates or squares for more 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.980
 we still see everything here small 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.680
 how flat is the original container 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.680
 of the omega with various movies 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.370
 well here we see how it is positioned 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.850
 the camera compared to the 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.850
 projector 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:50.180
 think good hammer and water shoes 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:53.180
 and the buck stops here and the ball 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.180
 wrong
