00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220

first<00:03:14.220> player<00:03:14.400> commands<00:03:14.760> or<00:03:15.060> single<00:03:15.420> player

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
first player commands or single player

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.030 
first player commands or single player
commands<00:03:15.900> in<00:03:16.170> whatever<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.620> want<00:03:16.800> to<00:03:16.860> call<00:03:16.980> it

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
commands in whatever you want to call it

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.340 
commands in whatever you want to call it
and<00:03:17.569> that<00:03:18.569> way<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.750> can<00:03:18.989> switch<00:03:19.200> between

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
and that way I can switch between

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.500 
and that way I can switch between
creative<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.190> survival<00:03:20.310> mode<00:03:20.850> which<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.180> very

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
creative and survival mode which is very

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.320 
creative and survival mode which is very
useful<00:03:21.569> and<00:03:22.580> so<00:03:23.690> after<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:25.910> play<00:03:26.910> this<00:03:27.120> and

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
useful and so after you play this and

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.559 
useful and so after you play this and
say<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.510> died<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:27.780> all<00:03:28.110> this<00:03:28.319> stuff<00:03:28.410> blows<00:03:28.830> up

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
say you died and all this stuff blows up

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.240 
say you died and all this stuff blows up
you're<00:03:30.569> going<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.810> pretty<00:03:31.110> much<00:03:31.230> have<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:31.920> do

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
you're going to pretty much have to do

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.240 
you're going to pretty much have to do
half<00:03:33.239> of<00:03:33.390> that<00:03:33.510> process<00:03:33.780> over<00:03:34.410> again<00:03:34.440> so<00:03:35.130> it

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
half of that process over again so it

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.309 
half of that process over again so it
still<00:03:35.400> works<00:03:35.580> it<00:03:35.700> doesn't<00:03:35.850> take<00:03:36.090> long<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.720> all

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
still works it doesn't take long you all

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.440 
still works it doesn't take long you all
you'll<00:03:37.500> do<00:03:37.709> is<00:03:37.739> just<00:03:38.190> go<00:03:38.730> back<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:38.970> where<00:03:39.330> you

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
you'll do is just go back to where you

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.140 
you'll do is just go back to where you
extracted<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:40.049> file<00:03:40.290> copy<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.489> zombie<00:03:42.000> siege

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
extracted the file copy the zombie siege

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.530 
extracted the file copy the zombie siege
by<00:03:42.390> disco<00:03:42.690> thing<00:03:42.870> again<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.410> then<00:03:43.920> go<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.340> your

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
by disco thing again and then go to your

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.970 
by disco thing again and then go to your
doc<00:03:45.540> minecraft<00:03:45.989> folder<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.470> then<00:03:46.530> your<00:03:46.709> saves

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
doc minecraft folder and then your saves

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.009 
doc minecraft folder and then your saves
and<00:03:47.250> just<00:03:47.370> paste<00:03:47.549> it<00:03:47.760> in<00:03:47.880> again<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.810> way

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
and just paste it in again that way

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.440 
and just paste it in again that way
it'll<00:03:49.290> reset<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.310> map<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.730> I<00:03:51.000> don't<00:03:51.299> know<00:03:51.390> if

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
it'll reset the map and I don't know if

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.789 
it'll reset the map and I don't know if
this<00:03:51.600> is<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.750> most<00:03:51.930> efficient<00:03:52.380> way<00:03:52.440> but<00:03:52.709> it

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
this is the most efficient way but it

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.100 
this is the most efficient way but it
works<00:03:52.950> for<00:03:53.040> me<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.459> doesn't<00:03:53.730> take<00:03:53.760> long<00:03:54.110> so

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
works for me and it doesn't take long so

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.430 
works for me and it doesn't take long so
um<00:03:55.500> that's<00:03:56.459> really<00:03:56.880> all<00:03:57.150> thanks<00:03:58.079> for<00:03:58.140> watching
