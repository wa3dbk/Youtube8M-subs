00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.950
 hello everyone I hope I'm very good and 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.800
 this time we are going to make a 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.710
 review of the boat houses that are 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.300
 can buy at the waist to it or 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.610
 remembering that these houses only 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.220
 can acquire with social points 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.010
 I'm going to buy both the premium house and 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.410
 the affordable boat house and so that 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.410
 you can also appreciate the 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.420
 differences between the two and if 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.390
 they want to build some they can decide 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.930
 better what are we going to start building 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:49.450
 the affordable boat house who are you 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.450
 from here it costs 40 social points 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.420
 and to one side we are going to build the house 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:04.050
 boat for the link that costs 85 points 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.050
 social 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:16.290
 From the beginning you can notice that the 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.290
 premium house because it is much bigger 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.500
 the affordable affordable house has really 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.560
 a space 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.060
 rather bigger but let's see what 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.610
 such are inside 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.570
 the dimensions of the boat house 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:38.020
 affordable because they are 12 we could say to 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:43.659
 the top of this box x rectangle and 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.720
 6 well along then it's pretty 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.190
 small 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.360
 It has two floors too 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.960
 let's see a little furniture 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.900
 that as you can see, there are very 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.290
 little furniture that really is 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:05.680
 expensive that cost social points 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.760
 let's go here just the doors 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.760
 and the windows 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.150
 really the rest can be achieved 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.550
 with sumo lions the odd thing with 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.460
 lifestyle points 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:22.440
 but they are wives a pretty decoration 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.440
 simple here is common 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.430
 in a kind of patio we could 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.770
 call him 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.730
 um 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.730
 a dining room 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.750
 the kitchen and then the bathroom to the lamps 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.290
 they are also bought with social points and 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.319
 on the top 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.629
 They are also furniture 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.510
 and cheap of the cheapest in the case 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.160
 of both the beds and the 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.610
 armchairs 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.280
 we are not here just the windows and 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.810
 the lamp that is what basically 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.810
 buy as social points 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:10.410
 and really this is all that 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.410
 he has the small boat 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.690
 that's how it looks on the outside 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.870
 and that's how it looks in the boat house 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.790
 prize 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.680
 of tickets you can notice a 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.390
 difference enough pressure from how ya 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:34.350
 mentioned in the size the outside is 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.160
 shortens with the nut 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.990
 and has I think more challenges than 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.610
 buy with social points but not 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:48.140
 too many for example the doors 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.140
 like the windows 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.170
 these chairs 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.250
 an ornament here everything is bought with 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.250
 social points 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.580
 in my opinion they did not look too good 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:15.319
 with the decoration but it is quite 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:19.959
 better than in the other house boat 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:22.959
 this one looks a little more entertaining the 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.959
 room 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.370
 there's a little more stuff in the kitchen 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:37.500
 it's a dining room that the chairs have 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.500
 that put themselves with social positions 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.940
 and if we go to the second floor I think that 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:50.390
 it is also better decorated the same 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.310
 not nothing of the other world but resist 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.950
 much better than in the other house in this 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.110
 case you get so excited about the bed 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.060
 and this piece of furniture 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.220
 like the music the light that you buy with 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.220
 social points the windows equal 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.409
 If I'm not wrong, I think that 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:13.699
 basically everything that buys 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:16.650
 sheets and neither the lights of chala 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:19.039
 well we do not go that that ate sets 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.039
 social 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:27.570
 a small entertainment area with 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:31.430
 music computers and these bedrooms 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.430
 a much wider bathroom 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:41.090
 and basically that's what it offers 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.090
 our house boat train 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:49.450
 so good in my personal opinion 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.940
 It is better to wait to collect the points 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:55.180
 social to buy the house boat 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.910
 premium because good for the simple fact 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.250
 that gives us more space to 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.410
 build in such a way that if we do not 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.380
 like the decorations we see here 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.600
 Well, we can simply undo everything and 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.240
 start building from the foundations 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.780
 what we want but we will 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.390
 provide more space so that 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.960
 we elaborate on what 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.960
 we want 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:28.630
 the size of the premium boat house is 18 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.090
 then to the top of this rectangle that 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.320
 we see 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:35.570
 there are seven 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.170
 they have made me one more box 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.170
 than the previous 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:45.040
 and well that's all for now I hope that 

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:46.660
 they have served to give you an idea 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.150
 what are the differences between 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:54.070
 these two cases and also if you 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:58.139
 They had planned to buy one since they already know 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:07:00.960
 in advance how are they going to do 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:04.550
 I say goodbye for now and I see them in the 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.550
 next video chat
