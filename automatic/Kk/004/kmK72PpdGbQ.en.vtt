 cool exit to the hall 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.280
 all very light colors we decided 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:05.119

 cozy 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.910
 zone i have evening pastime 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.420
 near the fireplace 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:32.100
 also on the first floor we have a bathroom 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.810
 the bathroom is also the same colors 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.260
 at least the tiles here are almost all 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:48.940
 the same thing remains only the shower area 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:52.720
 finishing on the second floor is 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:56.640
 two bedrooms and dressing rooms 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.640
 1 disc 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.580
 this parent's bedroom is small 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:13.010
 in the attic floor 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:16.020
 Well, a very comfortable room powerfully give 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:20.670
 dormer window published in new 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.920
 OK, and it will come down a native zone, it is also very 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.840
 and very bright due to only one 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.620
 you will not need new clothes 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.620
 turn on the light and 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.830
 especially with him this house is with 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.660
 material from which this wall is 20 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.180
 centimeters no need no 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.160
 insulation and that's all you see and 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.580
 there is a finish inside no home 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.010
 she's just painted special 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.560
 lorsing compounds that preserve 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.200
 wood texture you are very natural 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.700
 preserves odor and requires no 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.250
 additional finish is die 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.530
 costs in the decoration of the house itself like and so 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.140
 same attention that in houses a campfire on 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.720
 questions to do and hidden wiring in the house 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.960
 will not find those looking for where everything will be 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.150
 hanging around here is achieved this 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.600
 so that at the design stage and 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.040
 building all this track data they 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.430
 are laid in advance and made 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.780
 at the factory and when assembling the house we have 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.870
 ready tracks we can 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.120
 use both for switches and 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.590
 outlets or other engineering systems 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:36.270
 many people ask what happens to 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:40.150
 home when he winters when he 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.340
 passed between two three green here 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.709
 all that can happen to the house you 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.540
 You can see it is necessary to channel to the can 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.670
 appear small cracks it 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.120
 normal phenomenon usually 10 game not 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.400
 will find 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:58.420
 cracks from the treasury where there will be drafts where 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.840
 will be cracking completely this all 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.290
 what can happen at home can 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.140
 After all, we are these acts of the tree knots 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:12.920
 never be afraid of bitches bitches they 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:16.290
 give the smell of wood the beauty of the texture and 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:20.639
 someone said that the measurement of the choke is 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.580
 like a rose in the meadow so it is natural 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.810
 beautiful texture that allows 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.740
 use in the interior is very 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.740
 interesting
