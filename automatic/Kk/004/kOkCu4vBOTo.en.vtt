00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
example if you I wasn't using opera it

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.760 
example if you I wasn't using opera it
clear<00:01:56.620> and<00:01:56.830> clear<00:01:57.430> that<00:01:57.930> level<00:01:58.930> too<00:01:59.170> little

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
clear and clear that level too little

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.610 
clear and clear that level too little
clear<00:02:00.160> inactive<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.210> background<00:02:02.050> processes

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
clear inactive and background processes

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.030

so let's say you have a file downloading

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.370 
so let's say you have a file downloading
in<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.190> background<00:02:06.580> if<00:02:07.390> you<00:02:07.540> hit<00:02:07.840> clear<00:02:08.140> now

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
in the background if you hit clear now

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.250 
in the background if you hit clear now
and<00:02:08.410> close<00:02:08.890> that<00:02:09.100> application<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.690> be<00:02:10.929> careful

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
and close that application so be careful

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.520 
and close that application so be careful
how<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.410> use<00:02:11.680> that<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.630> I<00:02:13.630> have<00:02:14.200> nine

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
how to use that and I have nine
