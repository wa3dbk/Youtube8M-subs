00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.760 

I<00:00:00.060> thought<00:00:00.960> we<00:00:01.050> should<00:00:01.110> go<00:00:01.290> on<00:00:01.410> a<00:00:01.439> field<00:00:01.620> trip

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770

I thought we should go on a field trip
so<00:00:02.190> this<00:00:02.610> is<00:00:02.760> sort<00:00:02.909> of<00:00:03.030> an<00:00:03.500> average<00:00:04.500> day<00:00:04.710> for<00:00:04.740> me

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
so this is sort of an average day for me

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.249 
so this is sort of an average day for me
I<00:00:05.310> didn't<00:00:05.549> feel<00:00:05.670> everything<00:00:06.270> but<00:00:06.569> I<00:00:06.839> found

most<00:00:07.440> of<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.770> stuff<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.189> I<00:00:08.250> think<00:00:08.429> it<00:00:08.519> gives

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580
