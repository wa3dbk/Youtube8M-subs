00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:04.520
 after the unexpected defeat against her vs 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.529
 these were the men of fiqas aalsmeer it was keen on a good result 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.960
 against the number two in the ranking de limburglaan jens 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:16.699
 with six more games to go what it can also be astonished to still be at the 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.009
 finish the regular competition in the last sixteen 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.390
 points are definitely needed for this 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.830
 and fiqas started the game can be driven up and concentrated 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.550
 from a solid cover with a strong keeper Jeffrey Groenveld 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.480
 after twelve minutes that already led to a 5 no lead and only then could 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.410
 giving the limburgers something back 7 5 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.830
 at that time djordje stefanovich received a time penalty as a team undercount 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.050
 fiqas managed to score 8 5 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.290
 after that, the difference became even greater for the 6th just a little later, 7 hit 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.460
 a release play the ball from luc coppens by serge rink 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.890
 the game of fiqas aalsmeer was a lot better than earlier in the week and so 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.270
 there seemed no dirt in the air yet 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.660
 but the first six minutes of the second half they would determine the 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.640
 contest 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.890
 the limburger study scored no less than five times in that period 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.330
 no goal from fiqas aalsmeer 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.780
 what they do nothing against a 12 to 15 backlog 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.320
 but the Dutchman's team fought back and the crowd remained closed 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.880
 at the connection 16 17 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.570
 halfway through the second half but it didn't come 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.710
 instead, a gap of two points 17 19 emerged 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.710
 Serge Rink reduced the difference now that this time became beautiful 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.000
 unlocked by djordje stefanovich 18 19 and moments later the deserved one 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.860
 equalize by 20 20 again by a bet of llink 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.580
 the competition was suddenly bought again and could go either way 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.100
 but the smugglers wanted too badly and that led to sloppiness and so 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.100
 ball loss in the final phase 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.200
 20 22 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.799
 ruud cousin once again gave the team a lot of good results 21 22 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.360
 maradona has left and again the mistake in a profitable blaze 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.449
 including through two weeks old 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:13.579
 but by somewhat flattering 21 final position was reached 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:18.280
 despite the loss of the trainer and I wish my could not be satisfied with the 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:19.149
 contest 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:23.349
 first team and a perfect match from our side I found the first on the 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.220
 plates and the attack we played well 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.680
 we set our game assessed the pressure mainly on the defense 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.250
 play the leading role 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.690
 and that works well this started second half all support 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.919
 the hague with not sharp enough and a robber and a second period with us 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:40.999
 life 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:42.259
 genee 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:45.379
 you walk behind the facts and then it is very difficult a second 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:46.430
 half was indeed 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.369
 the year that makes you west frisia 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:51.319
 those who play thick for 8 minutes have the two standing 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.619
 we'll find one and then do it 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:57.259
 try to make up for it as soon as possible and then my heart starts to lose something 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:01.369
 many in the video player after a suicide in a ball full of holes in it a 

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:05.439
 the role that the fourth place of the former is against me in things like that 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:10.019
 unfortunately for the dime in the wrong direction and the hole becomes one 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.019
 little flattering big I think your evening 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:15.269
 that made the 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.699
 but the rest 12 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:20.070
 as long as there are nine and you are mac the great weiver in the second half 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.559
 analysts think of thinking I think it is very nice against that 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:24.729
 that works very well 

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:25.829
 I think it deserves more than
