00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.010

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.140
 the comments now from her 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.610
 written in enduro or olga and 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.619
 next time most likely the 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.000
 Volcanic tuned that's what I wanted to do now 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.740
 have said that again at the beginning 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.839
 now no live annotated video 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.789
 I just want to be funny with one here 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:31.220
 setup so I have the piste here 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.970
 two shot and this badboy weapon with 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.680
 two shots are 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.810
 that's pretty much something 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.120
 make it looked because it was a nice 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.949
 Okay so I'll go here now 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.239
 back so I can not now for the first time 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.250
 live commentary a bit in the first 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.390
 forum to come and become easy now 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.649
 a little bit in troupe radio 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.230
 I 've already browsed 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.870
 little something prepared 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.399
 for example here is such a post where 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.899
 one tells you to wake up when I am 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.149
 if I continue here and continue 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.300
 gamble and continue to do videos then becomes 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.429
 what has that with my abi nothing 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.220
 I also do high school and and funny 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.870
 everyone stays parked video i know 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.210
 not if my people really are 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.290
 just not the best so me 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.190
 have to tell you if not with youtube 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.170
 would stop the my school notes 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.150
 determined by 23 points better but 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.710
 no idea I think that we too much 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.090
 cool and you should act so I am 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.390
 I think you should really now 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.680
 put a whole life in school 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.000
 In any case, you should always 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.530
 prepare and I learned that 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.370
 most important is that I have right 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.600
 neglected to take care in school 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.350
 I have that from the 7 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.350
 to 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.280
 I do not have until the beginning of the tenth grade 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.540
 taken care of at school and always one 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.250
 I wrote that test 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.659
 to learn beforehand this is really a mistake 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.940
 if you already watch people on 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.700
 spartak that much time but I have to 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.470
 say our crass of a seventh 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.330
 It was great that there was such a small one 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.159
 experiment was done and ours 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.550
 great kamal people who stayed seated 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.700
 are 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.990
 that was 5 sitting down and that has 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.899
 the whole whole class now completely 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.770
 well hurt and so and then you have 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.060
 stop times prefer a bit shit 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.810
 built to take care of at school 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.090
 I must say 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.840
 and that's why you do not have it that way 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.690
 had good grades yes important is her 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.430
 you have to use your time effectively what what 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.319
 For example, mine is dangerous 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.480
 for example, if I am now for example 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.250
 i am also a human i am also up 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.269
 facebook on the way and if 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.030
 I now for example once facebook 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:32.209
 Imagine because you deepened in it 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.980
 So everything that has somehow laid something 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.810
 there stands and that things and everything 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.120
 is pretty cool but i have to get you guys 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.250
 say that robs so much time so the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.510
 time I always here for mine 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.890
 I used the videos 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.989
 really as compact as possible too 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.430
 hold and you so I have to say today 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.299

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.209
 pleasant sunday 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.310
 and I my Sunday it looked like that 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.700
 I always got up yesterday as a 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.110

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.900
 in battlefield heroes youtube for today 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.240
 and then I could actually be in 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.000
 principle theoretically the rest of the day 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.530
 But school is the time to learn 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:19.030

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.810
 here, for example, something is waiting 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.560
 here in the forum 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.420
 Oh, here I am looking for a youtube 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.670

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.530
 makes a table and so on we have 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.720
 even a teamspeak then i go up 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.940
 his profile and his ios level 15 07 08 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.780
 level 5 that dreamed of the world 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.850
 on road 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.980
 i believe in the metal scene there is 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.790
 hardly youtube partner are there there 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.200

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.120
 offer fight so do not know if he the 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.780
 Caddy Hitchhiker took out Schenker's canal 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.070
 and a few others are planning the advertising 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.050
 but never probably will not 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.160
 have a lot of time over for a 15 of 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.830
 the Nazis have certainly determined 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.960
 that's really weird that's extreme 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.430
 funny yes and I have to tell you that 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.540
 I have money what he sowed 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.640
 mainly going purely taken as 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.300
 somehow not the action but there 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.980
 were from time to time really 1 2334 moments 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.150
 were even that was really cool 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.320
 they really thought that was me 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.400
 now so everything can cut together 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.310
 and now like the clips for a montage 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.260
 ready certain and I thought come on 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.090
 You just take it here 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.310
 really is not in the sense of 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.470
 kill street 34 kills in a row 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.440
 third but only two times three 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.580
 four cool at the moment yes here at the end 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.170
 I have to say I have to pack 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.540
 really in the video whenever I am 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.370
 hit an aviation opponent 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.380
 but now I have the first time 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.150
 I like the ladder now 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.770
 Do not go anymore and I think so 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.690
 that something cool is happening now 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.320
 not yet you have the pure thing that 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.750
 was never 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.800
 yes, but it was me 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.080
 I do not know if I will finish again 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.310
 I died 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.140
 but it may well be me 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.760
 not sure anymore 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.650
 In any case, I think that's pretty 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.690
 funny oh and then i still had 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.520
 forum read yes yes I am looking for everything 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.540
 dementis you sponsor my buddies 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.360
 would open it clearly go on 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.419
 his profile times a level 4 and 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:31.130
 once single child two what is that 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:32.810
 that's a little cool people 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.070
 seeks you do not seek now direct 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.930
 high clear if he starts now 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.250
 since then with videos just pick yourselves 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.110
 friends with whom he plays together and 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.430
 if he is maybe above level 20 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.990
 you could be a few clear what 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.930
 we need the level four 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.470
 which clearly quite honestly it is that's 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.150
 witless 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.860
 well I say goodbye now 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.190
 you and until next time 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.190
 solemn
