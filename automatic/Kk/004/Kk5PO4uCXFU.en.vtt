because<00:06:33.139> I'm<00:06:33.259> a<00:06:33.319> singer<00:06:33.560> I<00:06:33.710> kind<00:06:33.919> of<00:06:33.949> want<00:06:34.159> to

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
because I'm a singer I kind of want to

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.680 
because I'm a singer I kind of want to
see<00:06:34.400> what<00:06:34.610> where<00:06:34.819> am<00:06:34.879> I<00:06:34.969> when<00:06:35.180> I<00:06:35.210> was<00:06:35.300> saying<00:06:35.539> it

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:35.690 
see what where am I when I was saying it

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.809 
see what where am I when I was saying it
without<00:06:36.349> staring<00:06:36.710> at<00:06:36.860> your<00:06:36.949> guitar<00:06:37.250> yeah<00:06:37.550> and

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:37.819 
without staring at your guitar yeah and

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:39.909 
without staring at your guitar yeah and
I<00:06:37.849> think<00:06:38.060> those<00:06:38.300> dots<00:06:38.690> were<00:06:38.930> a<00:06:39.139> bit<00:06:39.289> too<00:06:39.740> small

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 
I think those dots were a bit too small

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:41.860 
I think those dots were a bit too small
already<00:06:40.490> on<00:06:40.580> the<00:06:40.669> prototypes<00:06:41.180> I'm<00:06:41.360> hoping
