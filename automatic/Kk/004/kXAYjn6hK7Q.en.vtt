00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.369
 since I disappoint you I'm doing 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:19.060
 part of the people who are also very very 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:21.699
 harrachov ob arachnophobia irak barack 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.359
 no no i am also a cow our 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.400
 forums I'm always very angry I 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.929
 am not really so arachnophobic 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.009
 that is to say I do not do 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.400
 to agree I am very very afraid of 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.230
 spiders 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.070
 so for the people it's that they 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.640
 do not really see what it's like 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.260
 steal our phobias 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.670
 it's a bit like it's a little bit 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.379
 finally like the word phobia but except 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.680
 that instead of homosexuals these are 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.989
 resides reigns even though it's even 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.379
 not incompatible we can be both 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.399
 sites he gathered is a fagot for example 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.629
 even though it's very rare that we see a 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.559
 spider a concert of mylÃ¨ne farmer 2 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.850
 it's really time I come back 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.350
 really from far away because me so 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.519
 I have always been very very afraid of 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.719
 spiders but kind it made me but 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.039
 hysterical 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.109
 I was screaming like that and 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.739
 the people targeted but finally stop it's 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.570
 that a spider 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.220
 you have no reason to live on Thursdays 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.070
 but that's it's not a reason 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.659
 it's a phobia it's visceral one can 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.340
 do nothing against that and that's why 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.630
 that I homophobes I do not judge them 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.299
 because I see it's not their 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.159
 reason that speaks 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.200
 see the story with people from 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.689
 low civitas we see the words are 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.729
 completely incoherent acts 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.500
 he is hysterical about 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.000
 homosexuals that they will have nothing to ask 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.259
 finally and well it made me think of 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.220
 me a few months when I will have a small 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.540
 harry born in the corner of the room who 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.189
 finally do not care about me doing his 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.590
 quiet life but me but it makes me 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.090
 crazy to existence you see these 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.740
 oaths so that they exist and because 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.600
 now I'm all in 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.280
 arachnophobes since precisely I have 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.689
 learned like you to know the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.430
 spiders and that's when we learn 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.579
 to know and well finally how 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.229
 to say is there the reason down that it takes the 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.100
 place of fear and because I have 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.630
 found that there was stuff 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.939
 great in spiders when we 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.920
 see for example the spiders by 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.509
 example already quite often the males who 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.890
 is smaller than the beloved female that 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.750
 compared to their specimens 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.689
 finally a species that does not censor 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.430
 females then the thread of the canvases 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.230
 spider is super strong it's 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.259
 stronger than steel has a diameter 

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:12.030
 equal because lambert 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.409
 so really I think it was 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.970
 great I thought to myself but why 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.620
 the homophobes they do not do the same 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.689
 why they were not trying to learn 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.040
 to know homosexuals so not 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.269
 necessarily touching them what I 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.459
 see marble I have trouble taking a 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.870
 nostril in hand but may have to 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.620
 know them from afar I think 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.260
 maybe he could do a 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.120
 correspondence as when we are 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.680
 young coded times in college we write a 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.959
 Italian correspondent we do not know 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.810
 to know stuff about his country 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.720
 and so I imagined that then 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.400
 could give that hello bruno I 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.019
 my name is jean michel we are 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.970
 seen at the event and it's me who 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.010
 I jostled you I should ask for forgiveness 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.569
 but at the same time my parents and I a 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.680
 thing that it's not normal that you're 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:55.709
 big tent people me stone jean 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.310
 michel at home we say homosexual is 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.799
 patent 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.139
 aaa is patente by the way it was the 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.819
 case they often have 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.200
 mustache while others try 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.519
 to make babies so still not 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.209
 a single resident the two women of the 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.319
 couple 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.819
 it's been a long time since you've lived in 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.260
 homophobia and it is true that 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.370
 homophobia one never makes the 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.799
 life is that everyone has the skull 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.590
 shaved departure also subtle originary 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.209
 of homophobia cordially bruno yes 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.829
 bruno to my parents were born in 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.180
 homophobia but all the inhabitants of 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:26.639
 my country do not have shaved head 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.870
 my mother is here certainly is at home 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.400
 tents are always the sisters of our 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.840
 other parents my father does not like them 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.260
 not because he says he does not like them 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.970
 pedal 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.430
 in fact you too celebrate 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.930
 candlestick but of course I handed but 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.400
 as we eat pancakes that does 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.109
 must not be easy for your dad to not 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.879
 not like the pedals because there are some 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.169
 a lot but at home we think that 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.269
 it's good if there are some in the 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:47.790
 life because at home we say that always 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.980
 that life is like a bike without them 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.230
 pedals less I'll advance you 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.639
 let my darling matt years so that's it 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.409
 of course it's a proposition all 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.879
 it's just a fiction but if people 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.349
 de civitas hear me 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.010
 I would like you not to take 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.010
 homos
