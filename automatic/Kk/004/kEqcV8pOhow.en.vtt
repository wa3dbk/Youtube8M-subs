internal seals and bushings is not

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.429 
internal seals and bushings is not
enough<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:05.519> these<00:01:05.640> old<00:01:05.820> turbos<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.990> one<00:01:07.260> in

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
enough for these old turbos this one in

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.609 
enough for these old turbos this one in
particular<00:01:08.070> had<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:09.000> really<00:01:09.780> excessive

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
particular had really really excessive

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.090 
particular had really really excessive
wear<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.510> these<00:01:12.510> turbine<00:01:13.350> blades<00:01:13.619> here<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.070> I

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
wear on these turbine blades here so I

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.039 
wear on these turbine blades here so I
had<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.820> install<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.479> new<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.140> new<00:01:16.170> turbine<00:01:18.049> blade

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
had to install a new a new turbine blade

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.170 
had to install a new a new turbine blade
and<00:01:19.290> shaft<00:01:19.530> assembly<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:20.850> then<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.150> course

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
and shaft assembly and then of course

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.359 
and shaft assembly and then of course
the<00:01:22.140> compressor<00:01:22.680> wheel<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.159> one<00:01:23.310> it

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
the compressor wheel on this one it

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.730 
the compressor wheel on this one it
looks<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.850> had<00:01:24.060> ingested<00:01:24.659> water<00:01:25.200> because

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
looks like it had ingested water because

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.850 
looks like it had ingested water because
it<00:01:25.890> had<00:01:26.070> literally<00:01:26.460> worn<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.630> edges<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.409> this

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
it had literally worn the edges of this

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.859 
it had literally worn the edges of this
compressor<00:01:29.490> wheel<00:01:29.670> right<00:01:30.090> down<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.750> almost

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
compressor wheel right down to almost

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:31.670 
compressor wheel right down to almost
nothing

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
nothing

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.700 
nothing
so<00:01:32.189> we<00:01:32.400> were<00:01:32.520> able<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.820> source<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:34.170> part<00:01:34.590> as

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
so we were able to source that part as

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.550 
so we were able to source that part as
well<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.490> currently<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.360> will<00:01:36.810> be<00:01:36.960> able<00:01:37.229> to
