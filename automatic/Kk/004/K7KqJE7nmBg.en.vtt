it<00:01:40.079> means<00:01:40.110> too<00:01:40.500> fast<00:01:40.799> because<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.390> a

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
it means too fast because you have a

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.760 
it means too fast because you have a
little<00:01:42.630> bit<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.869> time<00:01:43.049> otherwise<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.590> hack

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
little bit of time otherwise the hack
