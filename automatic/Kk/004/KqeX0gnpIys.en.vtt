00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.030 
no fingerprints at all and
it's<00:02:02.409> awesome<00:02:02.619> so<00:02:03.130> once<00:02:04.090> you<00:02:04.210> open<00:02:04.390> it<00:02:04.659> up<00:02:05.040> let

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
it's awesome so once you open it up let

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.339 
it's awesome so once you open it up let
me<00:02:06.130> go<00:02:06.250> ahead<00:02:06.340> and<00:02:06.460> open<00:02:06.820> this<00:02:06.880> bad<00:02:07.119> boy<00:02:07.330> up<00:02:07.360> I

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.449 

mean<00:02:11.349> it<00:02:11.470> blends<00:02:11.739> right<00:02:11.920> in<00:02:12.069> with<00:02:12.099> the<00:02:12.220> top

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
mean it blends right in with the top

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.040 
mean it blends right in with the top
screen<00:02:12.700> because<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.180> top<00:02:13.300> of<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.510> screen<00:02:13.630> is

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
screen because the top of the screen is

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.180 
screen because the top of the screen is
black<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:15.310> goes<00:02:15.670> in<00:02:15.849> perfect<00:02:16.180> with<00:02:16.270> that

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
black so it goes in perfect with that

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.740 
black so it goes in perfect with that
the<00:02:18.190> only<00:02:18.400> thing<00:02:18.610> is<00:02:18.640> when<00:02:19.090> once<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.480> put<00:02:19.630> this

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
the only thing is when once you put this

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.620 
the only thing is when once you put this
uh<00:02:19.920> armor<00:02:20.920> on<00:02:21.100> it<00:02:21.370> kind<00:02:21.640> of<00:02:21.730> makes<00:02:21.910> your<00:02:22.120> 3ds<00:02:22.480> a

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
uh armor on it kind of makes your 3ds a

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.660 
uh armor on it kind of makes your 3ds a
little<00:02:22.959> bit<00:02:23.050> heavier<00:02:23.380> so<00:02:23.680> I'm<00:02:24.340> not<00:02:24.459> going<00:02:24.610> to

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
little bit heavier so I'm not going to

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.910

awesome the only complaint that I have
so<00:02:45.880> far<00:02:46.060> with<00:02:46.269> this<00:02:46.450> is<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:47.560> L&amp;R<00:02:48.069> buttons

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
so far with this is the L&amp;R buttons

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.750 
so far with this is the L&amp;R buttons
since<00:02:49.299> it's<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.540> little<00:02:49.780> bit<00:02:49.870> bulkier<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:51.280> L&amp;R

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
since it's a little bit bulkier the L&amp;R

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.130 
since it's a little bit bulkier the L&amp;R
buttons<00:02:52.209> seem<00:02:52.569> like<00:02:52.750> they're<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:52.959> little

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.259 
buttons seem like they're a little
difficult<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:53.920> use<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:54.489> mean<00:02:54.880> you<00:02:54.940> can<00:02:55.090> still

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
difficult to use I mean you can still

difficult to use I mean you can still
use<00:02:55.510> them<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:55.720> just<00:02:55.750> takes<00:02:55.989> a<00:02:56.080> little

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
adjusting to get used to it but it still

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.050 
adjusting to get used to it but it still
works<00:02:59.830> fine<00:02:59.920> this<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.489> takes<00:03:00.760> me<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:00.940> little

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
will kind of flop back and forth not a

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.550 
will kind of flop back and forth not a
lot<00:03:27.760> but<00:03:27.970> real<00:03:28.269> real<00:03:28.720> like<00:03:28.959> it<00:03:29.200> has<00:03:29.320> a<00:03:29.350> little

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
lot but real real like it has a little

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.590 
lot but real real like it has a little
wiggle<00:03:29.950> room<00:03:30.100> and<00:03:30.489> Nintendo<00:03:31.180> did<00:03:31.329> that<00:03:31.450> on

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
wiggle room and Nintendo did that on

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.330 
wiggle room and Nintendo did that on
purpose<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:32.170> reason<00:03:32.410> why<00:03:32.500> Nintendo<00:03:32.920> did<00:03:33.130> that

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
purpose the reason why Nintendo did that

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.060 
purpose the reason why Nintendo did that
is<00:03:33.579> because<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.239> lot<00:03:34.450> of<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.570> DS<00:03:34.840> lites<00:03:35.290> the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
is because a lot of the DS lites the

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.590 
is because a lot of the DS lites the
hinges<00:03:36.489> used<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:36.850> crack<00:03:37.120> because<00:03:37.299> they<00:03:37.540> were

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
hinges used to crack because they were

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.800 
hinges used to crack because they were
too<00:03:37.660> tight<00:03:38.079> so<00:03:38.640> they<00:03:39.640> made<00:03:39.820> the<00:03:39.970> 3ds<00:03:40.299> you<00:03:40.690> know

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
too tight so they made the 3ds you know

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.990 
too tight so they made the 3ds you know
a<00:03:41.109> little<00:03:41.410> bit<00:03:41.530> loose<00:03:41.829> or<00:03:42.040> so<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:42.519> know<00:03:42.700> it

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
a little bit loose or so you know it
