college and you to be at the same time

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.200 
college and you to be at the same time
I'm<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:10.920> really<00:01:11.130> hard<00:01:11.310> because<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.970> takes

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
I'm it's really hard because it takes

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.450 
I'm it's really hard because it takes
like<00:01:12.360> 30<00:01:12.570> minutes<00:01:12.780> edit<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.229> video<00:01:13.350> plus<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.280> have

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
like 30 minutes edit a video plus I have

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.039 
like 30 minutes edit a video plus I have
to<00:01:14.610> get<00:01:14.790> gameplays<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.600> know<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.869> takes

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
to get gameplays so you know that takes

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.270 
to get gameplays so you know that takes
a<00:01:16.110> lot<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.229> time<00:01:16.350> because<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.009> don't<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.189> to

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
a lot of time because you don't have to

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.490 
a lot of time because you don't have to
study<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.759> mean<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.479> takes<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.780> long<00:01:18.960> time<00:01:19.020> and

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
study so I mean it takes a long time and

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.080 
study so I mean it takes a long time and
usually<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.159> don't<00:01:20.250> really<00:01:20.400> sleep<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.729> lot<00:01:20.850> I

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
usually I don't really sleep a lot I

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.840 
usually I don't really sleep a lot I
sleep<00:01:21.330> like<00:01:21.479> six<00:01:21.780> hours<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.080> night<00:01:22.229> if<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.850> but
