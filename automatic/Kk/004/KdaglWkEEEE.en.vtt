cool<00:00:18.750> thing<00:00:18.779> about<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.590> we're<00:00:19.739> going<00:00:19.829> to

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
cool thing about this is we're going to

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.920 
cool thing about this is we're going to
be<00:00:20.040> using<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.460> single<00:00:20.939> paradiddle<00:00:21.480> as<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
be using a single paradiddle as the
