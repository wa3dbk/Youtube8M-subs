00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
completely lost his balance I thought he

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.710 
completely lost his balance I thought he
was<00:04:44.530> going<00:04:44.680> to<00:04:44.770> take<00:04:44.920> a<00:04:44.950> new<00:04:45.220> toilet<00:04:45.520> stage<00:04:46.090> but

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
could have sent it to invite

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.339

option<00:04:52.530> instead<00:04:53.039> and<00:04:53.310> I<00:04:53.550> think<00:04:53.939> Steve<00:04:54.120> Bruce

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
option instead and I think Steve Bruce

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.149 
option instead and I think Steve Bruce
knew<00:04:54.689> that<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:55.080> moment<00:04:55.259> is<00:04:55.530> probably<00:04:55.919> gone
