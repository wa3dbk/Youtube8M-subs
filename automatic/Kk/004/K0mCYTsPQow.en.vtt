00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
me I don't I just I'm not that organized

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.470 
me I don't I just I'm not that organized
this<00:03:45.220> is<00:03:45.370> actually<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.760> only<00:03:46.030> year<00:03:46.150> I've<00:03:46.299> ever

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
this is actually the only year I've ever

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.530 
this is actually the only year I've ever
actually<00:03:46.720> used<00:03:46.900> a<00:03:47.350> binder<00:03:47.980> at<00:03:48.190> all<00:03:48.489> so<00:03:49.299> I'm
