00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
version of the surface pro I'm running

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.990 
version of the surface pro I'm running
the<00:00:20.699> game<00:00:20.880> from<00:00:21.330> an<00:00:21.510> external<00:00:21.810> hard<00:00:22.020> drive

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
the game from an external hard drive

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.900 
the game from an external hard drive
because<00:00:24.000> as<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.570> can<00:00:24.600> see<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.789> amount<00:00:26.789> of

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
because as you can see the amount of

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.870 
because as you can see the amount of
space<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.510> got<00:00:27.750> left<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.289> not<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.800> much

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
space that I got left is not that much

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.720 
space that I got left is not that much
and<00:00:30.380> I<00:00:31.380> haven't<00:00:32.189> been<00:00:32.309> very<00:00:32.460> successful

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
3 and most games I will be doing this go

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.469

to come combat the ability mode and set

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.679 
to come combat the ability mode and set
it<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.750> windows<00:01:07.110> 7<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:10.850> then<00:01:11.850> most<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
it to windows 7 and then most of the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.020 
it to windows 7 and then most of the
other<00:01:12.900> games<00:01:13.110> i<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.830> been<00:01:14.100> able<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.400> play<00:01:15.229> but

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
other games i have been able to play but

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.320 
other games i have been able to play but
crysis<00:01:18.030> 3<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.950> can't<00:01:19.950> even<00:01:20.189> get<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.030> game<00:01:21.299> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
crysis 3 I can't even get the game to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:31.670 
crysis 3 I can't even get the game to
open<00:01:24.080> so<00:01:28.130> no<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.640> can't<00:01:29.970> run<00:01:30.659> crysis<00:01:31.200> 3<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.650> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
open so no you can't run crysis 3 on the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.609 
open so no you can't run crysis 3 on the
microsoft<00:01:32.369> surface<00:01:32.520> pro<00:01:32.700> i<00:01:33.740> think<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:34.979> the

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
microsoft surface pro i think it's the

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.219 
microsoft surface pro i think it's the
the<00:01:37.619> give<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.549> graphics<00:01:39.030> card<00:01:39.450> that's

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
the give you the graphics card that's

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.770 
the give you the graphics card that's
the<00:01:40.409> problem<00:01:40.759> because<00:01:41.759> crisis<00:01:42.360> free<00:01:42.600> will

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
the problem because crisis free will

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.039 
the problem because crisis free will
only<00:01:43.020> run<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.820> computers<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.270> direct<00:01:45.869> x

it will be able to play the game if it's
installed<00:03:04.780> directly<00:03:05.110> on<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.800> tablet<00:03:06.720> but<00:03:07.720> as

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
installed directly on the tablet but as

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.710 
installed directly on the tablet but as
I<00:03:08.230> don't<00:03:08.440> have<00:03:08.650> enough<00:03:08.950> space<00:03:09.520> to<00:03:09.580> install<00:03:10.420> on

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
I don't have enough space to install on

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.840 
I don't have enough space to install on
the<00:03:11.020> tablet<00:03:11.410> or<00:03:12.190> laptop<00:03:12.670> as<00:03:13.239> i<00:03:13.510> call<00:03:13.690> it<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:14.850> i

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
the tablet or laptop as i call it and i

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.400 
the tablet or laptop as i call it and i
can<00:03:16.390> check<00:03:16.630> that<00:03:16.690> for<00:03:17.110> you<00:03:17.260> so<00:03:18.959> but<00:03:19.959> i<00:03:20.019> think

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
can check that for you so but i think

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.729 
can check that for you so but i think
it's<00:03:20.530> safe<00:03:20.709> to<00:03:20.739> say<00:03:20.890> that<00:03:21.070> it's<00:03:21.430> not<00:03:21.549> possible

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
it's safe to say that it's not possible

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.920 
it's safe to say that it's not possible
so<00:03:23.739> thanks<00:03:24.310> for<00:03:24.400> tuning<00:03:24.730> in<00:03:24.790> see<00:03:25.660> you<00:03:25.810> in

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
so thanks for tuning in see you in

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.980
