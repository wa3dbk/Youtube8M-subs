00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 bye 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.650
 hello that such friends today that I come to you 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.750
 bring a new accessories guide like 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.640
 you can see we have changed the format already 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.560
 from now on they will be video guides are 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.869
 quite more comfortable and we can explain 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.320
 better all the details of our 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.699
 accessories today we want to talk about two 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.609
 utilities that will provide us 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.380
 very much life at the time of forming 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.670
 sonelgaz air made with its corresponding 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.989
 database that is to make thousand 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.430
 data and router for this first you 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.520
 I have left the links in the written part 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.580
 of the guide 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.590
 and once installed we will import the 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.550
 database to our by our side 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.220
 for this we wrote in the bar chat 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.280
 thank you mail 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.580
 and we go to the configuration window 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.950
 let's import and here we choose if 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.530
 we want to merge or overwrite that or 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.260
 well is to maintain the base of 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.610
 previous data and join it with the new or 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.070
 well overwrite the previous one with the 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.480
 new data in this case to be a 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.300
 clean installation because it does not matter what 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.200
 that we choose we will mark all the 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.200
 possible nodes 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.840
 and here below we have two options or 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.570
 ok mark the expansion in progress 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.950
 clicking on this box and importing only 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.929
 the data of the expansion that we are 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.450
 playing or leaving this box 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.640
 unmarked and import all types of 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.230
 nodes that we have in the expansions 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.660
 Until now 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.910
 the box next to it is very important 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.010
 auto import what is going to mean that 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.220
 every time in the course we update the 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.230
 add-on or manually we will not have 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.760
 that come to import the database of 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.350
 new but automatically because the 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.960
 database is going to auto import 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.270
 nothing else we update well once done 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.630
 this we click on the import button 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.050
 the data and we see that in the minimap have 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.500
 all possible points appeared 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.880
 where can they where can we find 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.670
 both - as plants within our 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.220
 map well once this is done we will 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.740
 move to create our path way 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.380
 our circuit this we will do with the 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.530
 road we go to the chart and we write bar 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.700
 reuters that's called side and we're going to 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.560
 add a route click on add 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.650
 By default it will select us as 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.819
 alone where we have the character if 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.920
 we want to make a route from another area 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.560
 we just have to look for it in the 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.209
 list 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.940
 let's give the name to the route in 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.470
 this case will be tea leaf since only 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.569
 I will monitor the tea leaf route 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.510
 because it counts 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.090
 plants veins and others let's put inside 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.099
 the same route more time will take 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.859
 be created and how this is simply a 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.510
 tutorial and we do not want to extend 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.450
 too much video 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.670
 let's make a tiny route below 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.790
 we can find the different types 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.480
 of addons of which we can of which 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.400
 we can bring data to the road in this case 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.950
 will be the one to do main 2 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.490
 and in the other box we will find 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.200
 all possible nodes to be monitored 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.190
 in this case we are going to mark only leaves 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.810
 of green tea we create the route and we can 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.120
 check that the minimap has not 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.370
 there have been no changes we are simply going to 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.160
 refresh the route line going to 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.230
 Minimapa map and world map drawing 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.790
 and zone map we're going to mark and 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.410
 uncheck the boxes again 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.600
 to refresh the route on the map 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.200
 We can see here that the route that has 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.400
 created is a bit messy like 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.910
 see that it is now impossible to 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.760
 continue for this we will optimize the 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.769
 route to create a closed circuit 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.269
 We search the map that we have 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.800
 created in this case is that I already have 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.690
 created from earlier routes in other maps 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.940
 we will see the four winds sheet 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.709
 tea and optimize routes 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.510
 In optimal fruit, we have the 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.030
 grouping button this is going to be us 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.340
 just an average distance between 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.280
 nearby nodes and create a line that we 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.580
 go through let's see an example in this 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.950
 case we have here millions of lines 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.950
 that once grouped together all the 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.900
 Close data is simply 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.120
 surrounding a line that crosses us 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.680
 this is going to be a lot more comfortable now 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.780
 If we still do not have our circuit 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:31.590
 complete for this let's optimize 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.590
 extra and we bring the route to the foreground 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.510
 once the route is brought we close open 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.190
 our minimap and we see how it has 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.050
 totally our circuit 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.879
 round 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.150
 that goes from one end of the map to another 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:49.580
 without cutting at any time once 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.740
 done this it makes little sense to have 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.199
 so much point within the map that what 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.449
 make us dirty our route by 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:59.289
 that we 're going to eliminate it let's go back to 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.289
 make mail 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.690
 we go to the minimum option and we're going to 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.720
 disable the icons before the map as 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.080
 on the world map like those on the edge 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.889
 of the minimap 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.509
 we accept 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.939
 we check the minimap how it has 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:18.160
 stayed and we see how is our route 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:22.230
 totally clean 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.090
 and how we have a line on the minimap 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.180
 totally 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.529
 perfect to follow our route of 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.929
 farms 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:33.619
 we simply have to follow the line that 

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:33.619
 tells us side 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:40.000
 look for all the yellow dots that the 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.010
 own tracking of the wow gives us in 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.560
 the minimap right now here there is no 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.090
 no mere but I assure you that the 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.380
 We will find you along the way 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.020
 you see for example here we have a 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.960
 simply by following this we have 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.730
 that divert aside to the sides for 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.310
 pick up what we find and return 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.920
 back to the route that tells us 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:03.340
 well after doing this as much as 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:06.130
 can happen to us is that there is some map 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.510
 have a white background or a background 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.190
 too clear and that the line then not 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.130
 see you all for this we are going to 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.680
 reuters again and here we have a 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:17.219
 option in map drawing where we can 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:20.810
 change the color of our line 

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:23.300
 in red in yellow 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:26.000
 and the thickness of it both on the map of 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.650
 world as in the mini map of this 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.210
 way 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.820
 once we are going to change so you see 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:35.660
 an example we will have here our route 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:37.400
 perfect and totally visible so that 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.860
 what before could take us several 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.169
 now we can do it a lot 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.390
 Quite faster and more comfortable 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:48.030
 following this small circuit 

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.920
 For the moment that's all I hope that 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.140
 you liked it and that we can 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.570
 keep watching in more videos and in more 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.390
 trips onwards do not forget to visit 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:07:00.480
 assiduously buchacra for any other 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:02.130
 kind of information thank you very much 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.340
 been pleasure and see you in the next 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.340
 video
