00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.580 
I used to help my mom make this dish I
used<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.450> help<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> kitchen<00:01:45.960> at<00:01:46.440> this

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
used to help in the kitchen at this

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.380 
used to help in the kitchen at this
stage<00:01:46.830> but<00:01:47.370> then<00:01:47.520> dessert<00:01:47.850> would<00:01:48.030> always<00:01:48.180> go

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
stage but then dessert would always go

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.300 
stage but then dessert would always go
out<00:01:48.420> after<00:01:48.870> dinner<00:01:49.050> and<00:01:49.290> my<00:01:49.380> parents<00:01:49.890> eat<00:01:50.040> very

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
out after dinner and my parents eat very

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.990 
out after dinner and my parents eat very
very<00:01:50.610> late<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:52.230> would<00:01:52.740> try<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.490> wait<00:01:53.610> up<00:01:53.790> and

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
very late so I would try and wait up and

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.400 
very late so I would try and wait up and
stay<00:01:54.180> awake<00:01:54.420> until<00:01:54.450> they'd<00:01:54.840> had<00:01:54.990> dinner<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.380> I

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
stay awake until they'd had dinner so I

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.650 
stay awake until they'd had dinner so I
can<00:01:55.650> have<00:01:55.800> some<00:01:55.980> dessert<00:01:56.250> but<00:01:57.000> invariably

half<00:01:58.050> the<00:01:58.170> time<00:01:58.290> I'd<00:01:58.440> fall<00:01:58.590> asleep<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.070> I'd

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
half the time I'd fall asleep so I'd

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.470 
half the time I'd fall asleep so I'd
wake<00:01:59.280> up<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.520> next<00:01:59.610> morning<00:01:59.760> and<00:02:00.150> I'd<00:02:00.210> go<00:02:00.360> and

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480
