00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 next the great summary of the time and 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.000
 then as always javier ávila for 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.000
 continue with more information permission 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.000
 in figure great reception has had the 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.160
 creation of mobility for people 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.470
 disabled to which it has been 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.390
 baptized with the name of abra tree 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.150
 says the project was executed by 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.699
 young university students of the faculty of 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.550
 engineering college that 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.960
 city 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.780
 we continue a little at the national level 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.940
 In Piura a group of students made 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.160
 an innovative mobile project for 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.660
 people with disabilities they ask 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.220
 support from the authorities so that this 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.220
 project consolidate soon 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.460
 3.1 is the name of this vehicle 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.040
 motorized that can be driven with 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.920
 total autonomy by a person in a chair 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.010
 of wheels then the vehicle has a 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.740
 ramp that allows you to access the 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.720
 people have been 15 students of the 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.340
 electrical mechanics career of the 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.160
 faculty of engineering at the university 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.250
 from Piura who built this 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.680
 innovative motorized vehicle 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.690
 the university ricardo rodríguez 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.970
 Towers in charge of the project are not 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.060
 explains that they work on this idea from 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.729
 three years ago they have been in this 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.160
 project last semester and makes achievement 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.220
 this last model that is a bit more 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.440
 functional even but you have certain 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.660
 limitations the good thing is that it's already 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.660
 coming forward is improving by its 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.000
 the teacher advises the project 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.220
 Engineer Carlos Ojeda Díaz argues that 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.350
 the prototype needs to be improved with 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.300
 final finishes and in a year could 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.660
 have the final version 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:06.100
 this didactic tool is going to 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:09.280
 convert inside souk in a proposal 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.319
 It is a vehicle for the disabled 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.550
 student inventors of the project as 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.830

 javier cespedes miguel barrier fabricio 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.970
 vega among others hope that the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.010
 authorities are interested in this 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.870
 innovative creation and can put the 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.989
 vehicle available to people 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.989
 with disabilities excellent initiative 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.610
 I hope the authorities do not lose it 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.170
 a lot of time to be able to support him between 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.170
 those two possibilities
