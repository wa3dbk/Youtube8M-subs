00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:08.580
 Good day now try 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:13.679
 to ensure that the pictures were 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:16.740
 too marred nevertheless still 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:21.510
 flashes the dog okay mean 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.880
 I just wanted to tell you about android 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.460
 4.3 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:33.239
 tell a little but there are interesting 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.579
 assembly points here means dump nexus in 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.620
 the last series there just 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:44.129
 pre-installed is 43 changes 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.890
 touched most just more 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.090
 fresh software on board that is more 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.390
 the latest version plus all sorts of google currents and 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.930
 other things and google movies in new 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.239
 marks you and so are really very weak 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.530
 The interface has changed, that is, you see 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:10.280
 switch now spelled 10 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:13.590
 there was a function here it will allow 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.380
 location services and other 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.659
 google application and knock off the bones and 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.950
 even if the wifi module is turned off but it 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.850
 extra battery consumption 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.189
 this is a minus i think shorter say so 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.409
 android 4 3 this is nobody version where you are 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.640
 We have to say ah some sort of design 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.650
 how everything has changed there 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:38.790
 it is rather more honed 42 yes straight up 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:42.890
 madness is good here almost here 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.640
 Everything is good. He is very fast. 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.880
 not bad there in my order of 19 songs 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:57.110
 on stock firmware gets 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:02:04.310
 in antutu this means fps has risen in 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:07.869
 games it is 1 2 work time that is but 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.670
 it does not reflect any real picture 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:15.260
 that is just a watch I will be wounded 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:18.980
 I'll turn on my phone but practically 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:23.900
 all day was awake 9 hours not quite 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.830
 exact figure for i'm in the car 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.170
 connected apparently because of this 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.049
 lost time but generally not bad 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.989
 he showed himself and I like it better 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.150
 it was me cyanogenmod 10.1 that is 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.110
 which is based on android 4 2 2 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.620
 that's 43 despite the fact that stock 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.390
 cores 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.540
 it is by the way pardon it doesn't have at all 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:52.670
 no relationship 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:55.130
 respectively 44 android 4 3 thats god in 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.959
 I liked the principle that he 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.970
 performance increased slightly 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.209
 diminished georzh but such 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.510
 here 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.459
 Nepal unpleasant things accompanied with 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:13.690
 updating the system but i think this is all 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:18.560
 will be fixed soon but i 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:24.739
 I really hope that I still wanted to 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:27.769
 show but also as a conclusion the camera is well 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:32.239
 I think everyone here saw the camera very much 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:34.970
 at the same time an intuitive menu and that's just 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:39.110
 before when you put your finger you did not see 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.690
 what is under the finger now 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.120
 so to speak, everything is visible because 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.850
 all actions happen on your over 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.630
 they do not surround with a finger and these 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.330
 settings 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:55.770
 very conveniently started in 3d mode now 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:00.750
 full texture coverage 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:04.140
 three-dimensional ball here then nexus less 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.760
 catch the focus that is, he just beat these 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.130
 photos without stopping 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.640
 I like it from pluses 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:16.079
 a little bit there you updated the driver 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:19.380
 who is in charge of working to more 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:25.350
 stable is all the more stable 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.610
 it works what else is new there from the screen 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.530
 some kind of lock 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.310
 then minimal changes have occurred 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.650
 opportunity to broadcast on 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:39.300
 wireless monitor and such by wi-fi 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.790
 direct signal but what else in principle 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.180
 there is nothing more and no such 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.180
 supernatural 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:53.370
 Here I basically did not expect anything 43 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:58.070
 except here 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:01.960
 so that's how to say 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:05.740
 probably the completeness of the system and I think 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:10.970
 all of us google left all our 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:16.220
 dreams she and all our hopes for android 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:18.770
 5.0 and this is just such a version that 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:22.490
 it just gives us pleasure to use 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:25.420
 phone and i can't say google 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.520
 they did something wrong there 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:35.030
 systematically it develops quickly not all 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:37.610
 works fine and in general I think it is necessary 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:41.720
 will just wait for the five 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:44.450
 an intermediate option, and it has 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.370
 their patches are just not noticeable 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.890
 to the human eye are rude yes that is 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:54.110
 this is purely code optimization 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:56.050
 but they have a positive effect on the overall 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.090
 smartphone behavior 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.690
 here thanks for watching the likes 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.690
 bye everyone
