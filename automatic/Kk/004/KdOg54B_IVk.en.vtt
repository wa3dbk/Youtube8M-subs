00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.820
 Today it's about how your hair is 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.820
 to grow faster 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.820
 hello her dear i know those in virgen 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.340
 method is a big topic right now 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.930
 youtube I see it everywhere and me 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.279
 Just had to try it because you 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.039
 just not much is needed 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.380
 actually costs nothing and yes me 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.029
 Just wanted to try it out 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.740
 works because a little better 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.900
 it's just that the hair 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.640
 faster growth should be used 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.770
 you just stay for seven days 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.780
 happened in the scalp one on 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.280
 a certain way and afterwards 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.989
 we break for three weeks and catch it 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.540
 again and again and within this 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.739
 one week the hair should be 1 to 3 cm 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.110
 grow longer 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.489
 that's the theory of it and me 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.559
 Just wanted to try out of that 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.300
 reason because the blonde series with mine 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.829
 you have already broken something 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.000
 and that's why I wanted 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.160
 first a bigger piece below 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.719
 but continue to cut yours 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.789
 have hair and I just wanted that 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.440
 My hair grows longer and faster 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.690
 so I just cut more 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.430
 can i know you might be in 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.960
 my last video where i put my hair in 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.700
 this color has seen beautiful that 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.020
 I had a pretty blatant approach that 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.930
 was right after I was invasion 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.340
 method and I have now 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.880
 no desire if my approach to 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.040
 mix 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.240
 because when I see the dark color above you 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.250
 See that, then you can see the approach 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.750
 not really, and I have them now 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.909
 already washed several times 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.950
 You see, my hair is already pretty 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.869
 long, I actually had my whole 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.869
 always live relatively long hair 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.450
 sometimes like that and mostly about that 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.520
 or just now and they are down 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.630
 already relatively thin meanwhile me 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.729
 but cut pretty much always 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.860
 generous a bit off when I do that 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.509
 feeling have the will to do me because I 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.490
 also wants to be pretty healthy 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.409
 look and yes i have in wÃ¶rth and 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.030
 Method I tried it now 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.090
 Let's talk about it shortly 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.079
 that's how it works, so I'll get you 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.649
 that is also like me now 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.079
 have done 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.119
 you take seven days a month 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.520
 seven consecutive days at those 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.770
 So we have the method applied 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.140
 I made it you take oil me 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.479
 now have this coconut oil in this case 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.580
 taken from dr georg that's it 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.619
 raw food quality very high quality oil 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.510
 heat it up easily you can do it 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.400
 for example, on the heating or on 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.020
 the floor heating or a few 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.390
 in seconds for example in the microwave 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.830
 but it can only be warm not too 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.440
 hot then I do not burn the please 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.320
 head because and then you just give this 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.480
 oil on your fingertips takes the 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.970
 hair just forward only best times 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.310
 everything combed and massaged very well 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.440
 your oil in your scalp in 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.390
 I roughly distributed the oil first 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.490
 before I just put a stopwatch 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.250
 then it's really about the 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.810
 hair for four minutes or the head 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.230
 to go forward for four minutes 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.730
 and to be handy over your head 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.590
 to promote blood circulation 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.700
 I just have it with it 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.110
 I connected in these four 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.790
 really a head massage 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.860
 I have partially done 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.930
 this bar weekend in maybe ten 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.880
 head massage died with turned off 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.740
 where one just so the head so 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.870
 can happen or I have it with me 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.520
 the hands made for four minutes and 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.830
 then carefully lift your head again 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.160
 and first see if everything is fine with 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.050
 you 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.640
 because sometimes it opens up a bit 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.530
 the circulation and then you should open 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.269
 make each case slow and that makes 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.250
 you seven consecutive day you 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.440
 You can decide how to fat your own 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.120
 I do not have hair on the first day 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.860
 also the oil with the nickname happens 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.390
 also leaves very good course for yours 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.010
 hair if you do overnight to load 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.780
 We have to do it for at least two hours 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.590
 long let the oil afterwards 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.239
 wash it out 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.739
 I always tried my hair only 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.760
 every second day to wash and have 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.590
 then a little dry shampoo 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.250
 used or just one with tooth 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.570
 drawn 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.730
 because that also increases the course 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.250
 care effective hair and closest 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.850
 in the evening you can get new oil again 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.230
 Add new warm oil and the same 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.610
 I did that practically beside 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.350
 for a long time and yes what do I have through it 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.239
 I reach you blind now here 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.280
 Just a picture of it like 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.170
 my approach before except approach one can 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.780
 that of course very well notice how much 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:05.160
 the hair grown are my approach was 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.420
 on the first day 1.3 cm long so about 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.000
 in the month one says a malweise 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.550
 centimeters grow the hair 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.790
 100 have been my hair long so 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.990
 then setvey 1.3 cm long and I have it 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.160
 just can not believe after 23 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.609
 days I already noticed that one 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.320
 few millimeters more were there and on 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:26.510
 Last day I had a start 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.830
 of 2.3 mm or so in any case 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.120
 Of course, they are also different 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.790
 Let me tell you the social if you are 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.290
 You see , I'm really surprised 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.570
 that that's how it works 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.280
 works well because that just the 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.800
 circulation in the scalp stimulated 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.230
 gets through the oil and through the massage 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.850
 the finger one says well that one 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.200
 it only with the massage of the fingers 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.480
 But you can not be a strong one 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.130
 achieved growth and I think of everyone 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.110
 case very fascinating what is important 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.530
 after that first time three weeks long break 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.540
 close 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.340
 in the next month then the steps to 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.840
 repeat in the seven days because 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.720
 otherwise the scalp gets used to it 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.340
 and then the growth stagnates 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.620
 duration that means you can once in 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.540
 month for a week to complete that 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.890
 to increase your growth that you have 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.070
 because this week a two centimeters 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:12.680
 growth and then practically have 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.210
 such a centimeter in the other time in the 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.800
 Months again saxony years like that 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.390
 one centimeter approximately 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.890
 I happened that to me 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.510
 I worked it really well 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.700
 that means every time I do 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.140
 My hair has massaged my 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.460
 scalp massaged my head after 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.810
 has front and took back have 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.760
 I'm still correct for years 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.410
 strictly tied back to back 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.360
 to increase a bit the the 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.150
 effect and I have just then 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.200
 noticed how it tingles in the basket and itself 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.570
 sometimes a little bit too 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.910
 I got a headache then what 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.320
 but later in no hours later 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.030
 was alright again 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.919
 I finds in definitely fascinate 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.660
 I worked that and I would 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.800
 Great for whether it is 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.400
 maybe also hijacked for you though 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.200
 the already tried, I have indeed their 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.270
 You can even visit the internet 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.280
 look there are a lot of great videos 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.660
 Great many tips There are different 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.190
 I can use oil animal now 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.479
 Coconut oil taken something very thin 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.870
 is you can for example too 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:07.430
 Use olive oil which is very viscous 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.240
 I think maybe next 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.699
 try it with olive oil 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.139
 could also use madame practice here 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.990
 or any other needs oils 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.300
 that is very very variable I would 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.830
 say and i have to say this coconut oil 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.449
 My hair was also very well maintained 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.979
 that was really a nice chur 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:25.380
 I have it completely in the top 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:28.410
 still partly with a massaged and on 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:31.919
 next morning or hold the morning of the 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.780
 washed out on it daily and for me 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:36.150
 was definitely a very positive one 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.009
 experience it is of course annoying if 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.449
 you color your approach 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:41.520
 regularly then you have natural 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:42.449
 interest growth but by doing so 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.979
 Of course, you also have a bit more 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:45.870
 by their hair from stone are that they 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:46.949
 In the end, healthier are what I think 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.810
 also a good thing 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:51.960
 then I have my hair so then 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.550
 tinted and when the h4 comparison though 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.020
 I start again with the oil and the 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.889
 in virgen abstracts wrap the 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.050
 comments if you already
