00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.050
 O 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.800
 I imagine writers who are not watching everything at the time 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.850
 championship 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.240
 reason is simple 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.100
 some game producers decided to adapt the story of Alice in the country 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.870
 of wonders under a brave and creative rereading 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.690
 to make her go away innocent become a demonic girl is a Saudi 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.809
 told the whole story that has a fund in ten years 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.359
 logical it would be surprising that sooner or later someone would come as 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.359
 Bizarre idea to give a special touch in the original narrative 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.330
 the classic that is being harmless now turned noble games and who gave wings to the 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.130
 imagination was the design was better than anyone in 2000 had this year is that the 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.310
 say 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.020
 on the road 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.130
 still through electronic and aids 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.220
 players saw the character on the big enemies with a huge knife 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.450
 the application of saw in the shoulder that makes a very contrary reference 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.140
 chubby and the arts 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.470
 we are your advice the two embark on a somber seminary adventure 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.180
 there is a couple and hospitalized in a hospice where she receives the visit of the 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.829
 Bunny 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.659
 what makes it and have become the wonderland that is in ruins fitting 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.030
 the protagonist faced the army of the queen of hearts 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.670
 there synergies through this sequence 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.080
 all these aspirations to action seems very strange that a new 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.020
 force 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.410
 Congratulations, slavery do not live in the same place. 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.100
 using one of the famous queues of the previous game can be said that it deserves bikes 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.400
 badness is far from having an end 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.010
 and if his turn if this world plunged into sadness 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.270
 11 years have passed since the events of the first game but we will refresh your 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.820
 memory of the family of Alice and died in a terrible fire the tragedy that 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.429
 took the girl to the club 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.649
 hospitalized in a hospice was released 10 years later under the 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:14.419
 of a psychiatrist 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.659
 but back to London she ends up being taken to the altar 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:23.429
 throughout the game it will be equipped with a sensor for a machete grinder 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:27.519
 of pepper that serves to hit opponents at considerable distances 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:32.419
 the wooden horse that the guri are also part of may seem like 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:36.899
 no but these items will be very useful as you look for answers 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:40.149
 about why that nightmare never has an end 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:43.839
 some of the original commands will remain the objects that will be 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:48.409
 scattered around the scenery have some surprises so the idea is that you 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.959
 either from all boxes or cups or anything that is destructive 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.519
 many things are hidden everywhere a special view allows 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.100
 it was filled with passages and visible as platforms 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.210
 special entries and even some characters that when settled 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.600
 guaranteeing good rewards the scenario is old and because of this the details 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.920
 whimsy can only be that something almost beaten including the teeth 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.109
 it's the euros 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.269
 that it would have to be created is what also had some of its areas 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.179
 he has the power to turn into bizarre things to attack his 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:27.309
 opponents of equal to equal to being of ten teams a in the letters of the 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:28.349
 queen 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.679
 the bosses are well above average than what was seen in the first 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:32.709
 version 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.939
 but even so nothing that can be considered spectacular coffee with milk 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:38.109
 same 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.769
 throughout the six chapters the protagonist of the macabre adventures 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.189
 I assumed six types of theft 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:48.129
 vestments worthy of the creations of timor-east unmit is the psychedelic 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:53.680
 how much the game allows the pm does not have tite josÃ© butler in the period from 9 to 10 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.340
 hours 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.190
 during this time the player will be more clinging to the story that is the 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.799
 focus 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.269
 looking for elements of the traumas of the fire she suffered 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.180
 everything you see in the obscure universe are fragmented parts 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.129
 of her memories that ended up becoming the monsters to which she has 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:11.879
 to defeat 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.789
 It's understood that the way we plant 

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:17.319
 the soundtrack environment and it's pretty cool 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:21.039
 It reminds a little that climate is of scissors grits I understand that I mean 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.090
 in some moments the objects scattered in the scenarios also interfere with 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.699
 the ticking of shops that float to murmuring sounds of beings 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.650
 asking the girl for help 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.660
 in the fantastic world of alice unfortunately many repeat itself despite the 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.080
 bizarre and unique appearance to be the decoy of his new story 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.249
 there is not much ready cover 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:46.389
 after the first four hours of nardini's play their creators 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:47.849
 they knew where 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.849
 have invested more in the direction of art to hold 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.669
 one but the propeller madness returns faces demons that neither freud explains 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.669
 but should warn the less demanding 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.460
 The guide is available for pc xbox 360 and playstation 3
