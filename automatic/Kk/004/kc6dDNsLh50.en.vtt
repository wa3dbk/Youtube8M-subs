00:00:15.503 --> 00:00:22.503
 The tulip is one of the most widespread and hybridized bulbs in the world, whose cultivation has been very successful in Europe 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.989
 it is a real bulb, originating from Turkey 

00:00:28.196 --> 00:00:36.196
 Tulip bulbs settle in autumn or late winter, in a sunny position, with fresh, deep and sandy soil 

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:43.604
 so that their development is not slowed down by an overly compact substrate 

00:00:43.853 --> 00:00:56.853
 They are buried at a depth equal to the diameter of the bulb itself; if we live in an area with very cold winter, and we want to leave the tulips at home, we increase this depth by about 50% 

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:02.058
 Between the bulbs we leave a space equal to one and a half, or two, the diameter of the bulb 

00:01:43.101 --> 00:01:53.100
 The tulips do not need further care, except to water them in the case of very dry soil during the spring months, when the plant develops 

00:01:54.515 --> 00:02:00.520
 At the end of winter we spread a slow release granular fertilizer between the bulbs. 

00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:21.270
 Tulips in the open ground can remain at home throughout the year, even in winter 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:29.600
 if cultivated in pots it is instead advisable to place the pots in a sheltered place, or to eradicate the bulbs, when the foliage has already dried up 

00:02:31.055 --> 00:02:36.060
 and put them in a dry, cool and dark place, until ready to put them back in the pot
