00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.340
 why 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.150
 think and press 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.930
 Attention 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.370
 and neither 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.370
 of action or means 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.220
 the important thing 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.649
 they do not have 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.550
 the truth is coming out the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.550
 things we loved 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.890
 how would you explain what is the technique 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.890
 power 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.750
 positive feelings 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.180
 what 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.690
 true now have the personality of 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.690
 each room 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.500
 and knowledge is what allows you 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:20.300
 develop your personality but the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.020
 bullfighting I think it's an art 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:27.149
 and personal 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.149
 even the imperfections we know 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.840
 given many aesthetic defects 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.430
 when the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.670
 to 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.970
 does not stay still everything would happen to tell 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.409
 the 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.869
 although for many the fence 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.770
 he fought in movement and yes that 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.770
 others can be 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.340
 coordinated 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.600
 I really like the old bull 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.600
 because the most essential 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.430
 has made a barrel a problem for the 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.430
 more bull without so much visitor boast 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.150
 in the tyrant to please if not more 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.440
 but what sets it apart from the theory 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.469
 from the rest of the world it does not feel like 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.500
 team and is not able to attract 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:35.500
 votes 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.120
 3 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.500
 many times wrong 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.879
 having there 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.930
 is to triumph against the shore 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.240
 everything that may be the way 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.870
 is not correct and what 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.870
 and return 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.250
 a race in motion totally 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.569
 and you have to react in a fast 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.219
 and good starts to piggyback 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.219
 and fight to please 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.460
 with time one develops what 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.970
 that someone else likes practically 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.320
 that you but it makes it perfect and that or 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.000
 be as it has achieved based on 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.000
 analyze training 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.920
 because I practically hope to make them very 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.959
 important 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.959
 is what allows you to think 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.459
 time is developing 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.720
 it is not coming out 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.650
 I create the time you are putting it then 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.420
 OK 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:16.810
 knowing the bull and acquaintances of tube 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.810
 in fact it counts 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.170
 with a 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.139
 why 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.860
 to make the temple of the temple 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.960
 easy everything 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.520
 the moment you still can not reduce 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.680
 in the movement 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.300
 the world 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.650
 the first one 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.650
 everything they did and 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:15.180
 it's a money that people are always 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.180
 please with juan castillo 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.760
 with you and all that 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.140
 if one wants to leave something said not 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.759
 one can say they are lies mÃ¡laga is 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.759
 a square that 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:40.340
 I like it a lot too 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.340
 We suffered to heat 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.670
 but it has a very special something 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:51.390
 important 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.390
 is that when 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.139
 is going to take flight cloak and nuria 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:01.069
 stay put I do not know what 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.069
 and a long time ago 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.020
 a little more 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.669
 look 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:18.410
 I was not going to stand 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.410
 and stable 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.220
 get up
