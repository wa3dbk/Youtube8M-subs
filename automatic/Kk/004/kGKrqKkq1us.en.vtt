00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.990
 Welcome to cooking step by step today 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.689
 I'm going to show you how I prepare eggplants in 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.560
 pickled these are the ingredients that 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.410
 we will use 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.289
 [Music] 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:34.120
 I'm going to use about 4 aubergines that are 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.320
 a kilo a kilo 200 approximately and what 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.379
 first thing we have to do is 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.210
 cut into slices 1 centimeter 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.570
 thickness 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.820
 if we can use them with the shell 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.710
 without the shell as they want and we will put 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.390
 the slices inside a pot 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.360
 [Music] 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.550
 let's color them with thick sauce or 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.070
 salt between final 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.079
 and we'll leave them for another half hour or 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.320
 less so that they are releasing all the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.320
 liquid 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.680
 if here you can see how he's letting go 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.920
 liquid that the bitterness that has the 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.860
 eggplant 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.670
 and then we will continue pushing the 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.770
 [Music] 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.680
 one for one hour we are rinsing the 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.869
 We put in a colander to dry 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.960
 yes and here you can see the liquid that 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.810
 they have released that is 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.820
 and how bitter is the eggplant already 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.700
 then we will put in a pot a 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.879
 liter of vinegar and a liter of water 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.879
 [Music] 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:44.210
 some bay leaves 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:46.250
 and let's put the water to boil 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.600
 once it is boiling we will put the 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.600
 slices of eggplant 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.460
 [Music] 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.500
 now yes once we have all the 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.480
 sliced ​​aubergine put 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.900
 let's wait for it to boil 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.930
 [Music] 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.199
 and since it starts to boil the water with 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.420
 the vinegar will wait about 5 minutes 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:13.610
 [Music] 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.510
 It can be 4 5 or 6 minutes 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.670
 approximately we will have to see that 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.200
 have this consistency just like that 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.709
 because if they are not going to undo the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.709
 eggplant 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.330
 and now we take them out we put them in a 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.040
 strainer 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.960
 we do not let them get cold 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.960
 [Music] 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.030
 and while we are going to prepare the 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.970
 seasoning 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.000
 ground chili oregano pepper 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.000
 grain 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.689
 the garlic that can be two cloves of garlic 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.510
 three or four as they want more 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.830
 strong 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.720
 [Music] 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.720
 I'll use four cloves of garlic here 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.250
 [Music] 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.970
 sunflower oil 200 milliliters that 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.970
 it would be a glass 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.470
 we mix well and now if we have to 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.110
 have the aubergine slices a 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.959
 little bit colder and if we can not 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.640
 put on some plates separating it for 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.760
 who loved each other 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.760
 [Music] 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.500
 and then 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.050
 we will put them in a glass container 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.600
 in a jar in this case I'm 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.050
 using a little seasoning for 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.050
 under 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.390
 [Music] 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.450
 then the slices of eggplant 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.540
 [Music] 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.670
 and so we will intersperse the seasoning 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.150
 with eggplant with some leaf 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.150
 laurel 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.620
 until you get to the top of everything 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.139
 [Music] 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.940
 that's important that I did not want to go in 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:11.540
 the medium so while we are putting 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.190
 we can press with a spoon with a 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.980
 fork or with your hands and once you 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.130
 we have reached the top can already 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.350
 close and we have the aubergines ready 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.390
 pickled 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.300
 As you can see, there's been enough left over so I'm going 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.980
 to prepare another jar another jar of 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.840
 eggplant 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.150
 and I hope you have liked to know 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.570

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:46.350
