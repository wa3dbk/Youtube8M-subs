doing that now with this pair of bands

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.000 
doing that now with this pair of bands
so<00:01:50.750> we<00:01:50.810> can<00:01:50.930> actually<00:01:51.050> miss<00:01:51.380> out<00:01:51.590> this<00:01:51.800> peg

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
so we can actually miss out this peg

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.860 
so we can actually miss out this peg
that<00:01:52.670> would<00:01:52.790> give<00:01:52.910> the<00:01:53.000> banana<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.360> nice<00:01:53.540> curve

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
that would give the banana a nice curve

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.890 
that would give the banana a nice curve
so<00:01:54.350> take<00:01:54.770> them<00:01:54.950> go<00:01:55.550> straight<00:01:56.060> past<00:01:56.119> it<00:01:56.540> and

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
so take them go straight past it and

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.770 
so take them go straight past it and
onto<00:01:57.140> that<00:01:57.170> peg<00:01:57.470> there<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:58.580> then<00:01:59.510> we'll<00:01:59.630> take

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
onto that peg there and then we'll take

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.930 
onto that peg there and then we'll take
another<00:02:00.020> two<00:02:00.410> pair<00:02:00.590> of<00:02:00.619> bands<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:01.310> stretch

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
loop them diagonally to the left hand

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.430 
loop them diagonally to the left hand
side<00:04:13.000> like<00:04:13.960> so

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
side like so

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.890 
side like so
now<00:04:15.130> if<00:04:15.220> you're<00:04:15.340> inside<00:04:15.610> this<00:04:15.820> one<00:04:16.120> take<00:04:16.810> the

to<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:25.960> forward<00:04:26.170> peg<00:04:26.410> so<00:04:26.640> then<00:04:27.640> do<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.360> same

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
to the forward peg so then do the same

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.120 
to the forward peg so then do the same
again<00:04:30.450> okay<00:04:31.450> and<00:04:32.050> then<00:04:32.440> with<00:04:32.560> this<00:04:32.680> pair<00:04:32.890> fans

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
again okay and then with this pair fans

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.680 
again okay and then with this pair fans
are<00:04:33.310> gonna<00:04:33.370> be<00:04:33.490> looping<00:04:33.850> diagonally<00:04:34.360> to<00:04:34.600> the

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
are gonna be looping diagonally to the

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.710 
are gonna be looping diagonally to the
central<00:04:35.080> row<00:04:35.200> so<00:04:35.650> push<00:04:35.890> back<00:04:36.130> that<00:04:36.370> band<00:04:36.720> count

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
central row so push back that band count

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.240 
central row so push back that band count
to<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:37.900> bottoms<00:04:38.370> and<00:04:39.370> loop<00:04:39.520> them<00:04:39.700> that<00:04:39.880> way

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
to the bottoms and loop them that way

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.670 
to the bottoms and loop them that way
and<00:04:42.250> then<00:04:42.460> stretch<00:04:42.760> them<00:04:43.000> over<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.330> peg<00:04:43.680> and

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
and then stretch them over the peg and

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.640 
and then stretch them over the peg and
then<00:04:44.830> go<00:04:44.950> into<00:04:45.130> this<00:04:45.370> peg<00:04:46.260> catch<00:04:47.260> the<00:04:47.500> bottom

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
then go into this peg catch the bottom

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.320 
then go into this peg catch the bottom
pair<00:04:48.010> of<00:04:48.070> black<00:04:48.340> bands<00:04:48.820> and<00:04:49.000> loop<00:04:49.300> them

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
pair of black bands and loop them

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.380 
pair of black bands and loop them
diagonally<00:04:49.870> back<00:04:50.260> to<00:04:50.440> where<00:04:50.560> they<00:04:50.650> came<00:04:50.800> from

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
diagonally back to where they came from

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.770 
diagonally back to where they came from
over<00:04:52.390> here<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:55.060> then<00:04:55.210> we've<00:04:55.330> got<00:04:55.390> one<00:04:55.570> more<00:04:55.720> to

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
over here and then we've got one more to

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.190 
over here and then we've got one more to
go

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
go

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.490 
go
so<00:04:56.440> hook<00:04:57.070> inside<00:04:57.630> get<00:04:58.630> that<00:04:58.780> bottom<00:04:59.110> single

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
so hook inside get that bottom single

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.340 
so hook inside get that bottom single
band<00:04:59.820> move<00:05:00.820> it<00:05:01.000> forward<00:05:01.360> then<00:05:01.960> this<00:05:02.110> one's

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
band move it forward then this one's

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.660 
band move it forward then this one's
actually<00:05:02.530> going<00:05:02.860> to<00:05:02.950> turn<00:05:03.100> into<00:05:03.280> a<00:05:03.400> slipknot

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
actually going to turn into a slipknot

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.690 
actually going to turn into a slipknot
so<00:05:04.240> then<00:05:04.390> put<00:05:04.540> your<00:05:04.630> hook<00:05:04.810> back<00:05:05.080> inside<00:05:05.610> cut<00:05:06.610> to

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
so then put your hook back inside cut to

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.520 
so then put your hook back inside cut to
the<00:05:06.790> bottom<00:05:06.940> and<00:05:07.360> like<00:05:07.570> so<00:05:07.870> and<00:05:08.080> then<00:05:08.200> pull<00:05:08.410> it

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
the bottom and like so and then pull it

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.920 
the bottom and like so and then pull it
up<00:05:08.680> through<00:05:08.920> itself<00:05:09.340> and<00:05:10.060> just<00:05:10.600> knock<00:05:10.900> that

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
up through itself and just knock that

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.920 
up through itself and just knock that
one<00:05:11.320> off<00:05:11.470> the<00:05:11.590> tape<00:05:11.800> like<00:05:12.730> so<00:05:13.000> then<00:05:13.750> you<00:05:13.840> can

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
one off the tape like so then you can

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.380 
one off the tape like so then you can
intercept<00:05:14.260> not<00:05:14.470> so<00:05:15.370> make<00:05:15.580> sure<00:05:15.610> your<00:05:16.060> bounds

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
intercept not so make sure your bounds

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.300 
intercept not so make sure your bounds
are<00:05:16.480> all<00:05:16.630> loop<00:05:16.900> like<00:05:17.140> this<00:05:17.170> because<00:05:18.160> we're

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
are all loop like this because we're

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.880
