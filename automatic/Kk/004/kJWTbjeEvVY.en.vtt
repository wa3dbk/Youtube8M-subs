food manufacturers women when the dairy

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.840 
food manufacturers women when the dairy
manufacturers<00:01:32.690> processed<00:01:33.690> milk<00:01:34.640> what<00:01:35.640> they

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
manufacturers processed milk what they

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.740 
manufacturers processed milk what they
do<00:01:35.910> is<00:01:36.270> they<00:01:36.450> kill<00:01:36.810> all<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:37.440> live<00:01:38.090> elements<00:01:39.090> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
do is they kill all the live elements to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.210 
do is they kill all the live elements to
the<00:01:39.900> milk<00:01:40.430> right<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.610> kill<00:01:41.790> all<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.090> enzymes

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
the milk right to kill all the enzymes

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.780 
the milk right to kill all the enzymes
all<00:01:44.220> bacteria<00:01:44.970> good<00:01:45.600> bacteria<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:47.640> milk

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
all bacteria good bacteria in the milk

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.810 
all bacteria good bacteria in the milk
so<00:01:48.570> all<00:01:48.750> you're<00:01:48.960> left<00:01:48.990> with<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:50.600> dead

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
so all you're left with is a dead

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.859 
so all you're left with is a dead
processed<00:01:53.820> food<00:01:54.000> that's<00:01:54.300> what<00:01:54.420> processing

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
processed food that's what processing

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.450 
processed food that's what processing
does<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.170> kills<00:01:55.410> it<00:01:55.590> it's<00:01:55.979> dead

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
does it kills it it's dead

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.550 
does it kills it it's dead
there's<00:01:56.610> nothing<00:01:56.910> live<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.330> it<00:01:57.420> anymore<00:01:57.630> so

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
there's nothing live in it anymore so

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.710 
there's nothing live in it anymore so
you're<00:01:58.680> left<00:01:58.830> over<00:01:58.979> with<00:01:59.160> a<00:01:59.280> lot<00:01:59.550> of<00:01:59.720> lactose

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
you're left over with a lot of lactose

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.660 
you're left over with a lot of lactose
right<00:02:01.619> lactose<00:02:02.510> is<00:02:03.510> a<00:02:03.570> form<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.050> sugar<00:02:04.670> it's

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
right lactose is a form of sugar it's

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.160 
right lactose is a form of sugar it's
sugary<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.360> lot<00:02:06.510> of<00:02:06.600> people<00:02:06.810> can't<00:02:06.960> break<00:02:07.080> down

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
sugary a lot of people can't break down

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.650 
sugary a lot of people can't break down
that<00:02:07.590> sugar<00:02:08.060> so<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:10.170> natural<00:02:10.830> way<00:02:11.070> for<00:02:11.660> that

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
that sugar so the natural way for that

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.009 
that sugar so the natural way for that
sugar<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.050> be<00:02:13.230> broken<00:02:13.590> down<00:02:13.769> is<00:02:14.130> with<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:15.019> enzyme

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
sugar to be broken down is with a enzyme

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.979 
sugar to be broken down is with a enzyme
alive<00:02:16.440> enzyme<00:02:16.980> called<00:02:17.310> lactase<00:02:17.840> see<00:02:18.840> you

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
alive enzyme called lactase see you

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.199 
alive enzyme called lactase see you
nature<00:02:19.170> didn't<00:02:19.470> fuck<00:02:19.650> up<00:02:19.769> right<00:02:20.040> God<00:02:20.880> didn't

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
nature didn't fuck up right God didn't

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.449 
nature didn't fuck up right God didn't
make<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.360> mistake<00:02:21.540> when<00:02:21.989> he<00:02:22.019> made<00:02:22.200> milk<00:02:23.570> right

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
make a mistake when he made milk right

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.400 
make a mistake when he made milk right
lactase<00:02:26.459> breaks<00:02:27.000> down<00:02:27.209> lactose<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:28.110> when<00:02:28.260> you

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
lactase breaks down lactose so when you

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.470 
lactase breaks down lactose so when you
when<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.010> drink<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.459> when<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.180> drink<00:02:30.390> the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
when you drink it when you drink the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.759 
when you drink it when you drink the
milk<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:30.870> don't<00:02:30.989> have<00:02:31.080> all<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:31.350> goddamn

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
milk you don't have all this goddamn

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.620 
milk you don't have all this goddamn
Bucktown<00:02:32.310> sugar<00:02:32.580> it's<00:02:33.150> why<00:02:33.239> something<00:02:33.510> people

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
Bucktown sugar it's why something people

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.729 
Bucktown sugar it's why something people
lactose-intolerant<00:02:34.230> cuz<00:02:34.560> there's<00:02:34.680> no

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
lactose-intolerant cuz there's no

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.340 
lactose-intolerant cuz there's no
lactase<00:02:35.160> anymore<00:02:35.519> in<00:02:35.940> your<00:02:36.480> body<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.170> lot<00:02:37.320> of
