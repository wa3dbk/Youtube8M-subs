00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
hello I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.769 
hello I'm going to show you how to make
a<00:00:03.270> paper<00:00:03.929> origami<00:00:04.500> crane<00:00:05.040> and<00:00:05.629> what<00:00:06.629> I'm<00:00:06.690> gonna

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
a paper origami crane and what I'm gonna

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.299 
a paper origami crane and what I'm gonna
do<00:00:06.870> differ<00:00:07.080> in<00:00:07.230> this<00:00:07.379> tutorial<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.010> I'm<00:00:08.160> going

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
do differ in this tutorial is I'm going

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.870 
do differ in this tutorial is I'm going
to<00:00:08.460> use<00:00:08.670> highlighters<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:10.550> emphasize<00:00:11.550> and

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
to use highlighters to emphasize and

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.480 
to use highlighters to emphasize and
illustrate<00:00:12.440> crease<00:00:13.440> so<00:00:13.679> it's<00:00:13.830> just<00:00:14.009> gonna<00:00:14.370> be

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
illustrate crease so it's just gonna be

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.359 
illustrate crease so it's just gonna be
a<00:00:14.519> little<00:00:14.730> bit<00:00:14.880> easier<00:00:15.560> step-by-step<00:00:16.560> for<00:00:16.890> and

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
a little bit easier step-by-step for and

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.920 
a little bit easier step-by-step for and
maybe<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.730> first<00:00:17.880> time<00:00:18.180> or<00:00:18.420> if<00:00:18.480> you're<00:00:18.600> new<00:00:18.900> to

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
maybe the first time or if you're new to

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.800 
maybe the first time or if you're new to
do<00:00:19.260> an<00:00:19.380> origami<00:00:19.789> so<00:00:20.789> first<00:00:21.449> you're<00:00:21.630> gonna<00:00:21.689> need

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
do an origami so first you're gonna need

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.220 
do an origami so first you're gonna need
either<00:00:22.590> origami<00:00:23.250> paper<00:00:23.519> or<00:00:24.109> printer<00:00:25.109> paper

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
either origami paper or printer paper

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.839 
either origami paper or printer paper
that<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.650> can<00:00:25.680> make<00:00:25.920> into<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> square<00:00:26.640> and

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
that you can make into a square and

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.820 
that you can make into a square and
which<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:27.840> want<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.080> do<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.320> do<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.470> is

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
which we want to do to do that is

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
which we want to do to do that is
basically<00:00:29.010> take<00:00:29.810> this<00:00:30.810> corner<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.289> fold<00:00:31.850> it

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
basically take this corner and fold it

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.130 
basically take this corner and fold it
down<00:00:35.059> along<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.120> edge<00:00:38.390> and<00:00:39.390> then<00:00:39.899> take<00:00:40.110> a

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
down along that edge and then take a

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.470 
down along that edge and then take a
pair<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.440> scissors<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:42.530> cut<00:00:44.360> the<00:00:45.360> excess

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
pair of scissors and cut the excess

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:55.970 
pair of scissors and cut the excess
paper<00:00:48.480> off<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:54.500> and<00:00:55.500> then<00:00:55.739> when

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
paper off just like that and then when

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.260 
paper off just like that and then when
you<00:00:56.160> open<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.850> back<00:00:56.969> up<00:00:58.699> you<00:00:59.699> have<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> perfect

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
you open it back up you have a perfect

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.720 
you open it back up you have a perfect
square<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.960> then<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.160> going<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.430> be<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
square and then this is going to be the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.609 
square and then this is going to be the
first<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.300> your<00:01:03.570> fold<00:01:04.049> you're<00:01:04.260> going<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.470> want

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
first of your fold you're going to want

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.740 
first of your fold you're going to want
to<00:01:04.650> do<00:01:05.030> so<00:01:06.030> I'll<00:01:06.150> go<00:01:06.360> ahead<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.630> illustrate

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
to do so I'll go ahead and illustrate

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:16.120 
to do so I'll go ahead and illustrate
this<00:01:07.439> one

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.120 

on<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.280> next<00:01:17.780> slide<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.990> fold<00:01:19.289> you're<00:01:19.890> going

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
on the next slide this fold you're going

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.399 
on the next slide this fold you're going
to<00:01:20.219> take<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.429> other<00:01:20.609> corner<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.920> two<00:01:24.409> and

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
to take the other corner and two and

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:41.010 
to take the other corner and two and
fold<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.310> other<00:01:26.460> way<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:28.880> like<00:01:29.880> that

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.600 

and<00:01:42.020> then<00:01:42.259> now<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:42.860> want<00:01:43.040> to<00:01:43.100> flip<00:01:43.280> it<00:01:43.430> over

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
and then now you want to flip it over

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
and then now you want to flip it over
and<00:01:44.470> you're<00:01:45.470> going<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.650> fold<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.310> now<00:01:46.430> into<00:01:46.700> in

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
and you're going to fold it now into in

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.889 
and you're going to fold it now into in
half<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.440> other<00:01:48.470> way<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:50.240> basically<00:01:50.450> two

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
half the other way to basically two

00:01:50.899 --> 00:02:00.910 
half the other way to basically two
rectangles<00:01:59.259> and<00:02:00.259> then<00:02:00.380> you'll<00:02:00.530> want<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:00.710> do<00:02:00.830> it

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
rectangles and then you'll want to do it

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:15.580 
rectangles and then you'll want to do it
the<00:02:01.070> other<00:02:01.220> way<00:02:01.430> as<00:02:02.000> well<00:02:14.080> so<00:02:15.080> now<00:02:15.200> on<00:02:15.350> this

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
the other way as well so now on this

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.570 
the other way as well so now on this
side<00:02:20.080> now<00:02:21.080> have<00:02:21.319> a<00:02:21.350> folds<00:02:21.920> basically<00:02:22.370> going

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
side now have a folds basically going

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.580 
side now have a folds basically going
the<00:02:22.850> other<00:02:22.880> way<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:26.080> then<00:02:27.080> once<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.350> get<00:02:27.470> to

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
the other way and then once you get to

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.309 
the other way and then once you get to
this<00:02:27.680> point<00:02:27.950> you're<00:02:28.160> gonna<00:02:28.220> want<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:29.140> tilt<00:02:30.140> it

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
this point you're gonna want to tilt it

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.309 
this point you're gonna want to tilt it
like<00:02:30.470> that<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.980> these<00:02:31.970> two<00:02:32.269> folds<00:02:32.720> right<00:02:32.930> here

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
like that and these two folds right here

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.110 
like that and these two folds right here
it's<00:02:33.860> going<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.069> kind<00:02:34.160> of<00:02:34.250> naturally<00:02:34.850> want<00:02:35.060> to

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
it's going to kind of naturally want to

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.240 
it's going to kind of naturally want to
come<00:02:35.330> together<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:35.959> you<00:02:36.350> want<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.590> fold<00:02:36.830> along

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
come together and you want to fold along

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.360 
come together and you want to fold along
those<00:02:37.730> edges<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.239> bring<00:02:38.630> these<00:02:38.810> two<00:02:39.080> points

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
those edges and bring these two points

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.030 
those edges and bring these two points
inward<00:02:40.370> down<00:02:41.269> to<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.540> bottom<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.290> then<00:02:42.950> when

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
inward down to the bottom and then when

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.550 
inward down to the bottom and then when
you<00:02:43.100> do<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:43.400> at<00:02:43.549> the<00:02:43.640> top<00:02:44.049> hold<00:02:45.049> those<00:02:45.230> crease

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
you do that at the top hold those crease

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.920 
you do that at the top hold those crease
down<00:02:45.739> just<00:02:46.130> like<00:02:46.310> that<00:02:46.579> so<00:02:47.420> then<00:02:47.570> now<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:47.780> have

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
down just like that so then now you have

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.410 
down just like that so then now you have
the<00:02:48.860> square<00:02:49.340> basically<00:02:50.030> they're<00:02:50.269> kind<00:02:50.390> of

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
the square basically they're kind of

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.190 
the square basically they're kind of
like<00:02:50.540> four<00:02:52.209> little<00:02:53.209> triangular<00:02:53.660> flanges

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
like four little triangular flanges

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.140 
like four little triangular flanges
coming<00:02:54.500> out<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:55.579> then<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:55.820> want<00:02:55.970> to<00:02:56.030> always

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
coming out and then you want to always

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.310 
coming out and then you want to always
keep<00:02:56.359> the<00:02:56.890> flaps<00:02:57.890> on<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.640> bottom<00:02:59.140> and<00:03:00.140> then

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
keep the flaps on the bottom and then

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.740 
keep the flaps on the bottom and then
now<00:03:00.470> for<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.739> next<00:03:00.980> step<00:03:01.329> once<00:03:02.329> you<00:03:02.450> get<00:03:02.630> that

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
now for the next step once you get that

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.810 
now for the next step once you get that
creased<00:03:03.140> real<00:03:03.380> good<00:03:03.590> if<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.430> want<00:03:04.640> to<00:03:04.700> take

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
creased real good if you want to take

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.640 
creased real good if you want to take
this<00:03:04.970> corner<00:03:05.450> right<00:03:05.630> here<00:03:05.690> this<00:03:06.109> edge<00:03:06.350> and

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
this corner right here this edge and

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.759 
this corner right here this edge and
match<00:03:07.640> along<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.900> center<00:03:09.200> crease<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:09.620> have

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
match along the center crease you have

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:23.650 
match along the center crease you have
right<00:03:10.010> here<00:03:12.100> basically<00:03:13.100> just<00:03:13.250> fold<00:03:13.549> these<00:03:14.209> in

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.800 

and<00:03:24.660> then<00:03:24.870> once<00:03:25.080> you<00:03:25.200> do<00:03:25.319> that<00:03:25.530> flip<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:26.640> over

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
and then once you do that flip it over

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:39.130 
and then once you do that flip it over
and<00:03:27.810> do<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.410> same<00:03:28.680> thing<00:03:28.980> on<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.610> other<00:03:29.640> side

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.070 

I'm<00:03:40.140> going<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.350> go<00:03:40.410> ahead<00:03:40.800> and<00:03:41.069> illustrate

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
I'm going to go ahead and illustrate

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.570 
I'm going to go ahead and illustrate
those<00:03:43.080> for<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:43.950> actually<00:03:44.160> there's<00:03:44.459> one

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
those for you and actually there's one

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.100 
those for you and actually there's one
more<00:03:44.700> thing<00:03:44.880> one<00:03:45.060> so<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.480> get<00:03:45.600> those<00:03:45.750> folded

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
more thing one so you get those folded

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.040 
more thing one so you get those folded
on<00:03:46.200> both<00:03:46.410> sides<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.720> step<00:03:48.900> isn't

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
on both sides and the step isn't

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.780 
on both sides and the step isn't
necessary<00:03:49.620> but<00:03:49.830> I<00:03:50.100> like<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.370> do<00:03:50.489> it<00:03:50.580> as<00:03:50.700> an

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
necessary but I like to do it as an

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.660 
necessary but I like to do it as an
extra<00:03:51.120> step<00:03:51.330> is<00:03:51.569> when<00:03:52.020> you<00:03:52.110> take<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.800> top<00:03:53.370> part

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
extra step is when you take the top part

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.120 
extra step is when you take the top part
right<00:03:53.850> here<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.959> give<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:55.590> just<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.830> little<00:03:55.950> bit

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
right here and give it just a little bit

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.880 
right here and give it just a little bit
of<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.370> crease<00:03:56.640> on<00:03:57.480> top<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:57.989> that'll<00:03:58.200> help<00:03:58.320> help

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
of a crease on top and that'll help help

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.479 
of a crease on top and that'll help help
guide<00:03:59.160> a<00:03:59.190> fold<00:03:59.730> later<00:04:00.630> on<00:04:01.220> then<00:04:02.220> you<00:04:02.280> want<00:04:02.430> to

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
guide a fold later on then you want to

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.420 
guide a fold later on then you want to
go<00:04:02.550> ahead<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:02.730> open<00:04:02.910> up<00:04:03.239> all<00:04:03.930> four<00:04:04.530> sides<00:04:05.069> I'm

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
go ahead and open up all four sides I'm

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.070 
go ahead and open up all four sides I'm
going<00:04:05.550> to<00:04:05.760> illustrate<00:04:05.850> all<00:04:06.239> these<00:04:06.269> for<00:04:06.690> you

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:19.659 

you'll<00:04:10.080> fold<00:04:10.380> their<00:04:11.360> fold<00:04:12.360> and<00:04:12.720> fold<00:04:16.760> down

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
you'll fold their fold and fold down

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.680 
you'll fold their fold and fold down
right<00:04:20.669> there<00:04:20.970> and<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:21.989> crease<00:04:22.290> we<00:04:22.530> did<00:04:23.690> right

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
right there and the crease we did right

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
right there and the crease we did right
on<00:04:24.870> top<00:04:25.110> and<00:04:26.070> so<00:04:26.400> now<00:04:27.500> go<00:04:28.500> ahead<00:04:28.530> and

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
on top and so now go ahead and

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:37.040 
on top and so now go ahead and
illustrate<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:29.370> unit<00:04:29.640> side<00:04:30.830> fold<00:04:35.900> just<00:04:36.900> like

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
illustrate the unit side fold just like

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.080 
illustrate the unit side fold just like
that<00:04:37.200> so<00:04:37.500> you<00:04:37.560> have<00:04:37.740> folded<00:04:38.039> like<00:04:38.160> this<00:04:38.400> and

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
that so you have folded like this and

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.820 
that so you have folded like this and
when<00:04:39.270> you<00:04:39.360> did<00:04:39.570> that<00:04:39.600> also<00:04:40.080> full<00:04:40.470> of<00:04:40.500> the

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
when you did that also full of the

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.070 
when you did that also full of the
inside<00:04:41.280> which<00:04:42.090> then<00:04:42.240> what<00:04:42.390> you<00:04:42.510> want<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:42.750> do<00:04:42.930> is

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
inside which then what you want to do is

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.029 
inside which then what you want to do is
take<00:04:43.260> this<00:04:43.470> bottom<00:04:43.890> flap<00:04:44.510> and<00:04:45.530> push<00:04:46.530> it<00:04:46.710> up

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
take this bottom flap and push it up

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.490 
take this bottom flap and push it up
and<00:04:47.390> crease<00:04:48.390> it<00:04:48.419> right<00:04:48.900> there<00:04:49.140> where<00:04:49.320> this

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
and crease it right there where this

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.820 
and crease it right there where this
fold<00:04:49.770> is<00:04:49.979> and<00:04:50.370> then<00:04:51.330> on<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:52.110> two<00:04:52.350> inside

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
fold is and then on the two inside

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.520 
fold is and then on the two inside
creases<00:04:53.539> basically<00:04:54.539> fold<00:04:54.900> those<00:04:55.169> in<00:04:57.530> crease

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
creases basically fold those in crease

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.159 
creases basically fold those in crease
the<00:04:58.710> bottom<00:04:59.070> and<00:04:59.300> then<00:05:00.300> just<00:05:00.840> kind<00:05:00.990> of<00:05:01.050> let

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
the bottom and then just kind of let

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.730 
the bottom and then just kind of let
this<00:05:01.320> fall<00:05:01.590> together<00:05:02.300> into<00:05:03.300> a<00:05:03.330> crease<00:05:03.840> just

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
this fall together into a crease just

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.140 
this fall together into a crease just
like<00:05:05.130> that<00:05:05.460> and<00:05:06.150> then<00:05:06.990> flip<00:05:07.289> it<00:05:07.410> over<00:05:07.530> and<00:05:08.150> do

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
like that and then flip it over and do

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.480 
like that and then flip it over and do
the<00:05:09.180> same<00:05:09.479> thing<00:05:09.750> and<00:05:10.740> then<00:05:11.070> you're<00:05:11.400> gonna

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
the same thing and then you're gonna

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.740 
the same thing and then you're gonna
want<00:05:11.669> to<00:05:11.729> take<00:05:11.820> this<00:05:11.880> and<00:05:12.270> kinda<00:05:12.450> just<00:05:12.479> give<00:05:12.690> it

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
want to take this and kinda just give it

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.400 
want to take this and kinda just give it
a<00:05:12.780> little<00:05:12.900> bit<00:05:13.080> of<00:05:13.169> crease<00:05:13.410> the<00:05:13.590> other<00:05:13.620> way

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:24.730 

and<00:05:19.840> open<00:05:20.840> it<00:05:20.900> up<00:05:22.660> now<00:05:23.660> along<00:05:23.900> these<00:05:24.110> two<00:05:24.350> folds

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
and open it up now along these two folds

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.810 
and open it up now along these two folds
right<00:05:24.890> here<00:05:25.220> Oh

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.350 

fold<00:05:31.820> those<00:05:32.150> in<00:05:33.040> and<00:05:34.040> let<00:05:34.400> this<00:05:34.580> all<00:05:34.820> just<00:05:35.150> kind

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
fold those in and let this all just kind

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.650 
fold those in and let this all just kind
of<00:05:35.420> fall<00:05:35.720> together<00:05:36.170> just<00:05:36.530> like<00:05:36.590> that<00:05:37.660> crease

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
of fall together just like that crease

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.410 
of fall together just like that crease
it<00:05:38.870> real<00:05:39.050> good<00:05:42.730> and<00:05:43.730> once<00:05:44.060> you<00:05:44.150> have<00:05:44.240> that

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.420 
it real good and once you have that

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.240 
it real good and once you have that
you'll<00:05:44.600> see<00:05:44.780> the<00:05:44.900> split<00:05:45.530> part<00:05:45.800> down<00:05:45.980> at<00:05:46.190> the

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
you'll see the split part down at the

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.060 
you'll see the split part down at the
bottom<00:05:46.580> I'm<00:05:46.760> gonna<00:05:46.910> keep<00:05:47.060> that<00:05:47.300> there<00:05:47.570> and<00:05:48.070> now

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
bottom I'm gonna keep that there and now

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.320 
bottom I'm gonna keep that there and now
what<00:05:49.250> you're<00:05:49.370> going<00:05:49.490> to<00:05:49.550> want<00:05:49.670> to<00:05:49.730> do<00:05:49.910> is<00:05:50.120> take

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
what you're going to want to do is take

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.070 
what you're going to want to do is take
the<00:05:51.370> corner<00:05:52.370> edges<00:05:52.550> and<00:05:53.000> this<00:05:53.150> right<00:05:53.540> here<00:05:53.870> and

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
the corner edges and this right here and

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:03.840 
the corner edges and this right here and
fold<00:05:54.770> it<00:05:54.920> in<00:05:55.040> to<00:05:55.310> the<00:05:55.790> center<00:05:56.030> just<00:05:56.360> like<00:05:57.260> this

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:12.220 

get<00:06:04.850> on<00:06:04.970> both<00:06:05.240> sides<00:06:10.660> it<00:06:11.660> looks<00:06:11.840> just<00:06:12.050> like

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.230 
get on both sides it looks just like

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.600 
get on both sides it looks just like
that<00:06:13.120> then<00:06:14.120> fold<00:06:14.450> it<00:06:14.600> up<00:06:14.720> I'll<00:06:15.080> flip<00:06:15.320> it<00:06:15.410> over

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
that then fold it up I'll flip it over

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:25.720 
that then fold it up I'll flip it over
and<00:06:16.610> do<00:06:16.970> the<00:06:17.210> same<00:06:18.280> two<00:06:19.280> folds<00:06:19.880> just<00:06:24.310> like<00:06:25.310> that

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730 
and do the same two folds just like that

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.230 
and do the same two folds just like that
so<00:06:26.000> it<00:06:26.090> looks<00:06:26.270> like<00:06:26.450> that<00:06:26.950> well<00:06:27.950> then<00:06:28.040> now<00:06:28.280> you

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
so it looks like that well then now you

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.460 
so it looks like that well then now you
don't<00:06:29.450> want<00:06:29.570> to<00:06:29.600> take<00:06:30.250> the<00:06:31.250> two<00:06:31.880> flaps<00:06:32.470> pinch

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
don't want to take the two flaps pinch

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.920 
don't want to take the two flaps pinch
them<00:06:33.680> together<00:06:33.940> at<00:06:34.940> the<00:06:35.060> same<00:06:35.180> time<00:06:35.420> pinch<00:06:35.780> the

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
them together at the same time pinch the

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.300 
them together at the same time pinch the
other<00:06:35.960> two<00:06:36.350> together<00:06:36.500> so<00:06:36.710> you're<00:06:36.980> basically

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
other two together so you're basically

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:42.160 
other two together so you're basically
just<00:06:37.870> inverting<00:06:38.870> what<00:06:39.650> you<00:06:39.860> have<00:06:40.100> and<00:06:41.170> you'll

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:42.170 
just inverting what you have and you'll

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.950 
just inverting what you have and you'll
get<00:06:42.350> what<00:06:42.620> looks<00:06:42.860> like<00:06:43.100> this<00:06:43.460> and<00:06:44.210> then<00:06:44.780> from

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 
get what looks like this and then from

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.680 
get what looks like this and then from
there<00:06:45.310> look<00:06:46.310> I<00:06:46.400> already<00:06:46.580> see<00:06:46.820> a<00:06:47.150> little<00:06:47.540> bit<00:06:47.630> of

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.690 
there look I already see a little bit of

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:53.040 
there look I already see a little bit of
a<00:06:47.750> crease<00:06:47.990> right<00:06:48.110> here<00:06:48.880> go<00:06:49.880> on<00:06:49.910> to<00:06:50.240> fold<00:06:50.630> up

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.780 

these<00:06:54.050> parts<00:06:54.410> on<00:06:55.280> both<00:06:55.640> sides<00:06:55.930> flip<00:06:56.930> it<00:06:57.080> over

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.790 
these parts on both sides flip it over

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.410 
these parts on both sides flip it over
fold<00:06:58.790> it<00:06:59.030> up<00:06:59.150> there<00:06:59.360> at<00:06:59.450> the<00:06:59.570> bottom<00:06:59.920> and<00:07:01.420> then

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:02.420 
fold it up there at the bottom and then

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.410 
fold it up there at the bottom and then
now<00:07:02.860> basically<00:07:03.860> invert<00:07:04.520> it<00:07:04.670> again<00:07:04.910> so<00:07:05.150> pinch

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:05.420 
now basically invert it again so pinch

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.480 
now basically invert it again so pinch
these<00:07:05.630> two<00:07:05.870> together<00:07:05.990> and<00:07:06.440> pinch<00:07:07.160> the<00:07:07.340> back

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490 
these two together and pinch the back

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.530 
these two together and pinch the back
two<00:07:07.760> together<00:07:07.940> just<00:07:09.070> like<00:07:10.070> that<00:07:10.400> so<00:07:11.330> then

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:11.540 
two together just like that so then

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.780 
two together just like that so then
you'll<00:07:11.690> get<00:07:11.810> this<00:07:11.990> and<00:07:12.410> then<00:07:13.130> down<00:07:13.490> at<00:07:13.670> the

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:13.790 
you'll get this and then down at the

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.670 
you'll get this and then down at the
bottom<00:07:14.050> fold<00:07:15.050> these<00:07:15.500> over<00:07:15.950> to<00:07:16.730> get<00:07:16.880> your<00:07:17.090> wings

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 
bottom fold these over to get your wings

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:23.399 
bottom fold these over to get your wings
same<00:07:18.680> thing<00:07:18.890> on<00:07:19.010> the<00:07:19.070> other<00:07:19.130> side

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:23.409 

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:25.839 

and<00:07:24.409> now<00:07:24.619> you<00:07:25.069> can<00:07:25.189> see<00:07:25.339> you<00:07:25.429> have<00:07:25.459> the<00:07:25.639> wings

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:25.849 
and now you can see you have the wings

00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:29.049 
and now you can see you have the wings
and<00:07:26.779> the<00:07:27.289> last<00:07:27.529> second<00:07:28.279> last<00:07:28.459> step<00:07:28.699> we<00:07:28.849> want<00:07:28.939> to

00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:29.059 
and the last second last step we want to

00:07:29.059 --> 00:07:31.359 
and the last second last step we want to
take<00:07:29.299> these<00:07:29.509> and<00:07:30.049> along<00:07:30.679> this<00:07:30.889> edge<00:07:31.129> right

00:07:31.359 --> 00:07:31.369 
take these and along this edge right

00:07:31.369 --> 00:07:33.849 
take these and along this edge right
here<00:07:31.429> basically<00:07:32.419> just<00:07:32.869> kind<00:07:33.319> of<00:07:33.409> pull<00:07:33.679> them

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:33.859 
here basically just kind of pull them

00:07:33.859 --> 00:07:37.029 
here basically just kind of pull them
out<00:07:34.039> and<00:07:34.539> then<00:07:35.539> pinch<00:07:35.929> it<00:07:36.169> and<00:07:36.289> refold<00:07:36.829> it

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 
out and then pinch it and refold it

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:40.449 
out and then pinch it and refold it
right<00:07:37.969> along<00:07:38.179> that<00:07:38.329> edge<00:07:39.069> same<00:07:40.069> thing<00:07:40.249> on<00:07:40.369> this

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:40.459 
right along that edge same thing on this

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:45.609 
right along that edge same thing on this
side<00:07:42.549> then<00:07:43.549> last<00:07:43.909> step<00:07:44.179> I'm<00:07:45.079> gonna<00:07:45.199> take<00:07:45.409> the

00:07:45.609 --> 00:07:45.619 
side then last step I'm gonna take the

00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:49.629 
side then last step I'm gonna take the
four<00:07:46.249> the<00:07:46.339> head<00:07:46.719> basically<00:07:48.009> push<00:07:49.009> this<00:07:49.309> down

00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:49.639 
four the head basically push this down

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:58.199 
four the head basically push this down
and<00:07:52.509> pinch<00:07:53.509> it<00:07:53.779> in<00:07:56.289> just<00:07:57.289> like<00:07:57.499> that

00:07:58.199 --> 00:07:58.209 
and pinch it in just like that

00:07:58.209 --> 00:08:02.279 
and pinch it in just like that
and<00:07:59.209> there<00:07:59.779> you<00:07:59.869> have<00:07:59.929> it<00:08:00.019> you<00:08:00.259> have<00:08:00.289> a<00:08:00.709> origami

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:02.289 
and there you have it you have a origami

00:08:02.289 --> 00:08:05.289 
and there you have it you have a origami
crane
