Germany<00:03:12.549> is<00:03:12.610> being<00:03:12.880> progressive<00:03:13.420> and

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
Germany is being progressive and

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.270 
Germany is being progressive and
stepping<00:03:14.019> forward<00:03:14.319> you<00:03:14.799> know<00:03:14.890> this<00:03:15.040> has<00:03:15.250> a

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
stepping forward you know this has a

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.910 
stepping forward you know this has a
massive<00:03:15.549> implication<00:03:16.239> for<00:03:16.799> cultures<00:03:17.799> and

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
massive implication for cultures and

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.830 
massive implication for cultures and
societies<00:03:18.070> and<00:03:18.519> for<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.700> state<00:03:18.970> because<00:03:19.540> the

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
societies and for the state because the

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.599 
societies and for the state because the
whole<00:03:20.019> system<00:03:20.440> is<00:03:20.530> based<00:03:20.560> on<00:03:20.920> those<00:03:21.040> two<00:03:21.100> boxes

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
whole system is based on those two boxes

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:22.949 
whole system is based on those two boxes
the<00:03:21.700> whole<00:03:21.820> Internet<00:03:22.209> is<00:03:22.329> based<00:03:22.570> on<00:03:22.750> those<00:03:22.900> two

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
the whole Internet is based on those two

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.840 
the whole Internet is based on those two
boxes<00:03:23.530> so<00:03:23.980> there<00:03:24.130> are<00:03:24.190> massive<00:03:24.549> costs

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
boxes so there are massive costs

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.120 
boxes so there are massive costs
potentially<00:03:25.380> for<00:03:26.380> changing<00:03:26.829> that<00:03:26.980> and

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
potentially for changing that and

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.890 
potentially for changing that and
recognizing<00:03:27.609> that<00:03:27.640> intersex<00:03:28.090> people<00:03:28.420> exist<00:03:28.750> I

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
recognizing that intersex people exist I

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.990 
recognizing that intersex people exist I
think<00:03:29.410> it's<00:03:29.500> good<00:03:29.650> for<00:03:29.680> all<00:03:29.829> of<00:03:30.190> us<00:03:30.370> because

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
think it's good for all of us because

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.509 
think it's good for all of us because
those<00:03:31.180> two<00:03:31.390> boxes<00:03:31.780> constrain<00:03:32.260> us<00:03:32.440> all<00:03:32.680> into

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
those two boxes constrain us all into

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.130 
those two boxes constrain us all into
these<00:03:33.640> little<00:03:33.910> things<00:03:34.239> of<00:03:34.420> what<00:03:34.570> a<00:03:34.600> man<00:03:34.900> should

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
these little things of what a man should

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.360 
these little things of what a man should
be<00:03:35.170> or<00:03:35.350> what<00:03:35.470> a<00:03:35.500> woman<00:03:35.829> should<00:03:36.010> be<00:03:36.040> and

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
be or what a woman should be and

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.370 
be or what a woman should be and
actually<00:03:36.730> we're<00:03:37.660> who<00:03:37.780> we<00:03:37.959> are<00:03:38.079> we're

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
actually we're who we are we're

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.740 
actually we're who we are we're
individuals<00:03:38.620> but<00:03:39.250> for<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.489> kids<00:03:39.790> who<00:03:40.030> grow<00:03:40.690> up

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
individuals but for the kids who grow up

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.970 
individuals but for the kids who grow up
with<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:40.900> birth<00:03:41.079> certificate<00:03:41.230> with<00:03:41.500> nothing<00:03:41.890> on

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
with a birth certificate with nothing on

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.229 
with a birth certificate with nothing on
it<00:03:42.010> I<00:03:42.280> mean<00:03:42.400> they're<00:03:42.609> going<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:42.880> have<00:03:43.000> a<00:03:43.030> lot<00:03:43.209> of

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
it I mean they're going to have a lot of

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.449 
it I mean they're going to have a lot of
issues<00:03:43.570> later<00:03:44.200> in<00:03:44.320> life<00:03:44.500> as<00:03:44.890> a<00:03:44.980> result<00:03:45.100> of<00:03:45.340> that

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
issues later in life as a result of that

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.099 
issues later in life as a result of that
that's<00:03:45.670> a<00:03:45.850> problem<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:46.329> I<00:03:46.420> think<00:03:46.450> Germany<00:03:47.079> is

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
that's a problem and I think Germany is

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.259 
that's a problem and I think Germany is
they've<00:03:47.859> done<00:03:48.340> a<00:03:48.400> good<00:03:48.609> thing<00:03:48.790> but<00:03:48.910> we<00:03:48.970> need<00:03:49.180> to

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
they've done a good thing but we need to

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:50.490 
they've done a good thing but we need to
go<00:03:49.390> further<00:03:49.660> we<00:03:49.900> actually<00:03:50.170> need<00:03:50.320> to<00:03:50.350> have<00:03:50.410> a

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
go further we actually need to have a

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.259 
go further we actually need to have a
new<00:03:50.739> classification<00:03:51.160> for<00:03:51.670> those<00:03:51.820> people<00:03:52.209> who

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
new classification for those people who

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.729 
new classification for those people who
want<00:03:52.450> to<00:03:52.540> define<00:03:52.870> themselves<00:03:53.049> as<00:03:53.350> intersex
