00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
coming out out of the button all right

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.109 
coming out out of the button all right
one<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.890> button<00:00:23.220> either<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.580> button<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:23.939> too

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
one the button either the button is too

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.759 
one the button either the button is too
small<00:00:24.390> or<00:00:25.340> you<00:00:26.340> have<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.269> button<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:28.349> close<00:00:28.590> to

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
small or you have the button to close to

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.530 
small or you have the button to close to
the<00:00:28.890> motor<00:00:29.179> okay<00:00:30.650> so<00:00:31.650> all<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:33.120> need<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.360> do<00:00:33.510> is

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
the motor okay so all you need to do is

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.740 
the motor okay so all you need to do is
just<00:00:34.170> if<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.700> have<00:00:35.880> if<00:00:36.180> it's<00:00:36.329> too<00:00:36.510> close<00:00:36.690> to

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
just if you have if it's too close to

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.810 
just if you have if it's too close to
the<00:00:36.930> motor<00:00:37.110> just<00:00:37.320> pull<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.680> out<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.040> then<00:00:38.129> just

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the motor just pull it out and then just

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.420 
the motor just pull it out and then just
stick<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.600> hot<00:00:39.809> glue<00:00:39.960> gun<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.250> leaves

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
stick this hot glue gun it to and leaves

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.459 
stick this hot glue gun it to and leaves
about<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:42.719> know<00:00:42.840> half<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> centimeter<00:00:44.340> or<00:00:45.469> you

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
about you know half a centimeter or you

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.520 
about you know half a centimeter or you
have<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> centimeter<00:00:47.190> out<00:00:47.370> above<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.300> motor<00:00:48.660> so

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
have a centimeter out above the motor so

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.830 
have a centimeter out above the motor so
it's<00:00:49.680> floating<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:50.789> instead<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.480> touching

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
it's floating it's instead of touching

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.930 
it's floating it's instead of touching
the<00:00:51.930> motor<00:00:52.140> like<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:53.219> out<00:00:53.489> just<00:00:53.850> a

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
the motor like this it's out just a

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.639 
the motor like this it's out just a
little<00:00:53.969> bit<00:00:54.239> all<00:00:54.809> right<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:57.050> that's<00:00:58.050> one<00:00:58.500> of

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
little bit all right so that's one of

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.770 
little bit all right so that's one of
the<00:00:58.710> reasons<00:00:59.070> why<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.280> Neo<00:01:00.149> keeps<00:01:00.420> popping

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the reasons why the Neo keeps popping

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.470 
the reasons why the Neo keeps popping
out<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.250> if<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.670> put<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> rubber<00:01:03.059> band<00:01:03.180> around

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
out and if you put a rubber band around

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.280 
out and if you put a rubber band around
it<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:05.010> gets<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.460> stops<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
it and it gets it stops you have the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.770 
it and it gets it stops you have the
rubberband<00:01:07.680> too<00:01:07.860> tight<00:01:08.130> man<00:01:08.600> loosen<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.689> up

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
rubberband too tight man loosen it up

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.649 
rubberband too tight man loosen it up
where<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.409> enough<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.479> motor

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
where it's enough to have the motor

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.130 
where it's enough to have the motor
moving<00:01:13.110> still<00:01:13.439> but<00:01:14.310> keep<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.350> paper<00:01:16.350> clip<00:01:16.590> in

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
moving still but keep the paper clip in

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.370 
moving still but keep the paper clip in
and<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.650> needles<00:01:19.979> sticking<00:01:20.880> out<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.390> mean<00:01:21.689> it

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
and the needles sticking out I mean it

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.890 
and the needles sticking out I mean it
should<00:01:22.680> not<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:22.860> sticking<00:01:23.369> out<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:24.060> much<00:01:24.330> you

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
should not be sticking out that much you

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.410
