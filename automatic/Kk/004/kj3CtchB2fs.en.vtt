00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
live on the acronym homes gives us the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.370 
live on the acronym homes gives us the
first<00:02:42.000> letter<00:02:42.300> in<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.570> name<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.840> each<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.200> the

first letter in the name of each of the
Great<00:02:43.590> Lakes<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.070> if<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.220> get<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.400> question

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
Great Lakes so if you get a question

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.400 
Great Lakes so if you get a question
that<00:02:45.000> says<00:02:45.150> which<00:02:45.330> of<00:02:45.360> these<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.750> not<00:02:45.990> a<00:02:46.050> great

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
that says which of these is not a great

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.190 
that says which of these is not a great
lake<00:02:46.650> if<00:02:47.520> any<00:02:47.940> one<00:02:48.150> of<00:02:48.420> them<00:02:48.750> starts<00:02:49.050> with<00:02:49.170> a

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
lake if any one of them starts with a

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.650 
lake if any one of them starts with a
letter<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.680> is<00:02:49.800> not<00:02:49.980> in<00:02:50.190> homes<00:02:50.460> that's<00:02:51.360> not

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
letter that is not in homes that's not

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.590 
letter that is not in homes that's not
one<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.930> Great<00:02:52.170> Lakes<00:02:53.120> now<00:02:54.120> where<00:02:54.390> are

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
one of the Great Lakes now where are

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.780 
one of the Great Lakes now where are
them<00:02:55.200> located<00:02:55.620> how<00:02:55.890> can<00:02:56.070> we<00:02:56.160> kind<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.400> remember

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
them located how can we kind of remember

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.870 
them located how can we kind of remember
this<00:02:57.000> first<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.750> all<00:02:57.840> Lake<00:02:58.140> Superior<00:02:58.700> which<00:02:59.700> is

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
this first of all Lake Superior which is

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.000 
this first of all Lake Superior which is
the<00:03:00.000> largest<00:03:00.390> lake<00:03:00.840> in<00:03:01.050> North<00:03:01.260> America<00:03:01.800> by<00:03:01.950> the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
the largest lake in North America by the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.550 
the largest lake in North America by the
way<00:03:02.220> both<00:03:02.790> by<00:03:02.970> surface<00:03:03.420> area<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:03.900> by<00:03:04.110> volume

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
way both by surface area and by volume

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.120 
way both by surface area and by volume
is<00:03:05.370> also<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.570> farthest<00:03:07.230> north<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:07.950> can

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
is also the farthest north so you can

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.370 
is also the farthest north so you can
think<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.460> it<00:03:08.610> as<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.970> top<00:03:09.300> lake<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.020> because

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
think of it as the top lake so because

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.890 
think of it as the top lake so because
it's<00:03:10.560> on<00:03:10.680> top<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.220> thinks<00:03:11.550> it's<00:03:11.700> superior<00:03:12.180> so

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
it's on top it thinks it's superior so

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.480 
it's on top it thinks it's superior so
think<00:03:13.170> about<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.590> little<00:03:13.860> mnemonic<00:03:14.070> to<00:03:14.460> help

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
think about that little mnemonic to help

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.980 
think about that little mnemonic to help
you<00:03:14.670> remember<00:03:15.030> that<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.330> one<00:03:15.600> that's<00:03:15.810> on<00:03:15.960> the

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
you remember that the one that's on the

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.110 
you remember that the one that's on the
top<00:03:16.290> that's<00:03:16.860> Lake<00:03:17.160> Superior<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.880> it's<00:03:17.970> also

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
top that's Lake Superior and it's also

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.640 
top that's Lake Superior and it's also
the<00:03:18.420> biggest<00:03:18.630> one<00:03:18.990> so<00:03:19.020> it<00:03:19.290> thinks<00:03:19.530> its

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
the biggest one so it thinks its

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.200 
the biggest one so it thinks its
superior<00:03:20.100> because<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.490> that<00:03:20.640> -<00:03:20.850> you<00:03:21.090> might

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
superior because of that - you might

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.460 
superior because of that - you might
want<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.480> think<00:03:21.600> of<00:03:21.780> it<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:21.990> way<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.200> remember

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
want to think of it that way to remember

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.490 
want to think of it that way to remember
um<00:03:23.330> then<00:03:24.330> you<00:03:24.480> can<00:03:24.690> think<00:03:24.960> of<00:03:25.940> Lake<00:03:26.940> Huron<00:03:27.500> and

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
um then you can think of Lake Huron and

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.830 
um then you can think of Lake Huron and
when<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.040> think<00:03:29.340> of<00:03:29.430> Huron<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:29.880> kind<00:03:30.360> of<00:03:30.420> think<00:03:30.660> it

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
when I think of Huron I kind of think it

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.050 
when I think of Huron I kind of think it
sounds<00:03:31.170> like<00:03:31.290> Heron<00:03:31.830> which<00:03:32.160> is<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.370> bird<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:32.970> if

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
sounds like Heron which is a bird and if

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.570 
sounds like Heron which is a bird and if
you<00:03:33.150> look<00:03:33.330> at<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.540> shape<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:34.080> Lake<00:03:34.350> Huron<00:03:34.650> you

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
you look at the shape of Lake Huron you

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.510 
you look at the shape of Lake Huron you
can<00:03:35.760> kind<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.060> see<00:03:36.270> a<00:03:36.300> pair<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.780> wings<00:03:37.310> and<00:03:38.310> a

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
can kind of see a pair of wings and a

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.900 
can kind of see a pair of wings and a
head<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.180> tail<00:03:39.590> so<00:03:40.590> think<00:03:40.860> of<00:03:41.010> it<00:03:41.160> is<00:03:41.460> sort

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
head and a tail so think of it is sort

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.640 
head and a tail so think of it is sort
of<00:03:42.060> roughly<00:03:42.450> shaped<00:03:42.570> like<00:03:42.990> a<00:03:43.020> bird<00:03:43.320> and<00:03:43.620> that

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
of roughly shaped like a bird and that

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.730 
of roughly shaped like a bird and that
way<00:03:43.830> you<00:03:43.890> can<00:03:44.070> remember<00:03:44.280> that's<00:03:44.610> Lake<00:03:44.910> Huron

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
way you can remember that's Lake Huron

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.340 
way you can remember that's Lake Huron
Lake<00:03:46.740> Michigan<00:03:47.459> you<00:03:48.300> can<00:03:48.510> remember<00:03:48.690> is<00:03:49.050> along

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
Lake Michigan you can remember is along

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.410 
Lake Michigan you can remember is along
the<00:03:49.530> border<00:03:49.890> of<00:03:50.010> Michigan<00:03:50.490> Michigan<00:03:51.030> is<00:03:51.180> just

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
the border of Michigan Michigan is just

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.780 
the border of Michigan Michigan is just
to<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.630> east<00:03:51.660> of<00:03:52.260> Lake<00:03:52.440> Michigan<00:03:52.890> so<00:03:53.400> think

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
to the east of Lake Michigan so think

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.730 
to the east of Lake Michigan so think
about<00:03:53.910> where<00:03:54.150> Michigan<00:03:54.330> is<00:03:54.660> located<00:03:55.170> on<00:03:55.290> the

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
about where Michigan is located on the

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.080 
about where Michigan is located on the
one<00:03:55.920> that<00:03:56.040> runs<00:03:56.220> all<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.490> way<00:03:56.670> north<00:03:56.850> and

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
one that runs all the way north and

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.320 
one that runs all the way north and
south<00:03:57.890> along<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:59.220> side<00:03:59.400> of<00:03:59.550> Michigan<00:03:59.970> that's

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
south along the side of Michigan that's

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.240 
south along the side of Michigan that's
Lake<00:04:00.630> Michigan<00:04:01.310> Lake<00:04:02.310> Erie<00:04:02.670> is<00:04:03.450> down<00:04:03.720> towards

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
Lake Michigan Lake Erie is down towards

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.500 
Lake Michigan Lake Erie is down towards
towards<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.340> south<00:04:05.580> it's<00:04:05.850> a<00:04:05.940> smaller<00:04:06.270> one

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
towards the south it's a smaller one

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.080 
towards the south it's a smaller one
it's<00:04:06.750> near<00:04:06.959> Pennsylvania<00:04:07.850> think<00:04:08.850> about

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
it's near Pennsylvania think about

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.580 
it's near Pennsylvania think about
Pennsylvania<00:04:09.570> sort<00:04:10.200> of<00:04:10.290> sounds<00:04:10.530> like

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
Pennsylvania sort of sounds like

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.010 
Pennsylvania sort of sounds like
Transylvania<00:04:11.580> and<00:04:11.730> that's<00:04:12.000> very<00:04:12.450> eerie

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
Transylvania and that's very eerie

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.260 
Transylvania and that's very eerie
so<00:04:13.380> remember<00:04:13.770> Erie<00:04:14.100> that<00:04:14.490> way<00:04:14.670> it's<00:04:14.850> next<00:04:15.180> to

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
so remember Erie that way it's next to

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.710 
so remember Erie that way it's next to
Pennsylvania<00:04:15.980> and<00:04:16.980> then<00:04:17.430> lastly<00:04:17.850> we<00:04:18.150> see<00:04:18.359> Lake

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
Pennsylvania and then lastly we see Lake

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.020 
Pennsylvania and then lastly we see Lake
Ontario<00:04:18.959> which<00:04:19.770> borders<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.520> Canadian

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
Ontario which borders the Canadian

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.870 
Ontario which borders the Canadian
province<00:04:21.510> of<00:04:21.630> Ontario<00:04:22.590> Ontario's<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.760> the

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
province of Ontario Ontario's to the

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.800 
province of Ontario Ontario's to the
north

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
north

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.720 
north
and<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.290> United<00:04:25.560> States<00:04:25.770> is<00:04:25.920> to<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.160> south<00:04:26.400> of

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
and the United States is to the south of

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.420 
and the United States is to the south of
Lake<00:04:26.940> Ontario<00:04:27.180> so<00:04:27.800> hopefully<00:04:28.800> those<00:04:28.980> kind<00:04:29.370> of

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
Lake Ontario so hopefully those kind of

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.120 
Lake Ontario so hopefully those kind of
silly<00:04:29.670> mnemonics<00:04:30.270> will<00:04:31.050> actually<00:04:31.530> be<00:04:31.710> kind<00:04:32.040> of

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
silly mnemonics will actually be kind of

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.470 
silly mnemonics will actually be kind of
helpful<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.580> you<00:04:32.670> and<00:04:32.820> remembering<00:04:33.240> where

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
helpful to you and remembering where

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.000 
helpful to you and remembering where
each<00:04:33.690> of<00:04:33.870> these<00:04:33.960> lakes<00:04:34.230> is<00:04:34.410> located<00:04:34.889> because

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
each of these lakes is located because

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.129 
each of these lakes is located because
as<00:04:35.250> I<00:04:35.400> said<00:04:35.460> you<00:04:35.790> might<00:04:35.970> be<00:04:36.180> asked<00:04:36.630> you<00:04:37.020> might

be given a map like this on the exam and

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.970 
be given a map like this on the exam and
asked<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.389> identify<00:04:39.480> one<00:04:40.139> of<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.380> particular

Great<00:04:41.370> Lakes<00:04:42.470> also<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:43.530> should<00:04:43.800> know<00:04:43.980> the<00:04:44.430> two

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
Great Lakes also you should know the two

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.560 
Great Lakes also you should know the two
sort<00:04:45.900> of<00:04:45.990> largest<00:04:46.470> most<00:04:46.650> important<00:04:47.040> rivers

Mexico the Missouri River is a tributary

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.230 
Mexico the Missouri River is a tributary
to<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.560> Mississippi<00:05:08.130> River<00:05:08.370> and<00:05:08.580> the

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
to the Mississippi River and the

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.240 
to the Mississippi River and the
Missouri<00:05:09.660> River<00:05:09.810> is<00:05:10.110> actually<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.650> longest

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
Missouri River is actually the longest

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.100 
Missouri River is actually the longest
river<00:05:11.460> in<00:05:11.669> North<00:05:12.210> America<00:05:12.720> so<00:05:12.930> it's

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
river in North America so it's

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.650 
river in North America so it's
significant<00:05:13.830> for<00:05:14.010> that<00:05:14.760> reason<00:05:15.300> and<00:05:15.510> it

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
significant for that reason and it

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.680 
significant for that reason and it
passes<00:05:16.140> through<00:05:16.380> ten<00:05:17.340> US<00:05:17.610> states<00:05:18.150> and<00:05:18.390> two

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
passes through ten US states and two

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.140 
passes through ten US states and two
Canadian<00:05:19.229> provinces<00:05:19.500> so<00:05:20.130> it's<00:05:20.490> quite<00:05:20.790> a<00:05:20.850> long

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
Canadian provinces so it's quite a long

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.980 
Canadian provinces so it's quite a long
river<00:05:23.120> you<00:05:24.120> also<00:05:24.300> want<00:05:24.600> to<00:05:24.630> be<00:05:24.750> able<00:05:24.870> to

proximity to large populated areas
that<00:06:37.629> and<00:06:38.169> because<00:06:38.560> it's<00:06:38.740> an<00:06:38.860> active<00:06:39.220> volcano

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
that and because it's an active volcano

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.830 
that and because it's an active volcano
it's<00:06:39.879> considered<00:06:40.419> one<00:06:40.569> of<00:06:40.599> the<00:06:40.720> most

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
it's considered one of the most

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.070 
it's considered one of the most
dangerous<00:06:41.370> volcanoes<00:06:42.370> in<00:06:43.030> the<00:06:43.090> world<00:06:43.659> because

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
dangerous volcanoes in the world because

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.740 
dangerous volcanoes in the world because
of<00:06:44.259> the<00:06:44.379> possibility<00:06:45.009> of<00:06:45.039> it<00:06:45.250> erupting<00:06:45.789> you'll

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
of the possibility of it erupting you'll

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.110 
of the possibility of it erupting you'll
notice<00:06:47.080> that<00:06:47.259> there<00:06:47.470> is<00:06:47.680> a<00:06:47.710> large<00:06:48.310> amount<00:06:48.699> of

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
notice that there is a large amount of

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.210 
notice that there is a large amount of
mountains<00:06:49.750> along<00:06:50.169> the<00:06:50.379> west<00:06:50.620> coast<00:06:51.009> of<00:06:51.159> the

mountains along the west coast of the
United<00:06:51.340> States<00:06:51.789> and<00:06:52.000> that's<00:06:52.060> where<00:06:52.479> most<00:06:52.750> of

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:52.870 
United States and that's where most of

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.379 
United States and that's where most of
the<00:06:52.990> volcanoes<00:06:53.680> occur<00:06:54.430> as<00:06:54.580> well<00:06:54.849> and<00:06:55.150> where

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:55.389 
the volcanoes occur as well and where

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:56.790 
the volcanoes occur as well and where
most<00:06:55.539> of<00:06:55.690> the<00:06:55.780> earthquakes<00:06:56.289> occur

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
most of the earthquakes occur

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.040 
most of the earthquakes occur
the<00:06:57.340> reason<00:06:57.729> for<00:06:57.909> all<00:06:58.120> of<00:06:58.360> those<00:06:58.479> things<00:06:58.810> is

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.050 
the reason for all of those things is

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.860 
the reason for all of those things is
because<00:06:59.470> that<00:06:59.979> is<00:07:00.039> a<00:07:00.220> plate<00:07:00.610> boundary<00:07:01.090> there's

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
because that is a plate boundary there's

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.570 
because that is a plate boundary there's
a<00:07:01.930> big<00:07:02.199> plate<00:07:02.620> underneath<00:07:03.009> the<00:07:03.310> entire

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
a big plate underneath the entire

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.320 
a big plate underneath the entire
Pacific<00:07:03.789> Ocean<00:07:04.569> and<00:07:04.750> it<00:07:05.169> bumps<00:07:05.379> against<00:07:06.220> the

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
Pacific Ocean and it bumps against the

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.430 
Pacific Ocean and it bumps against the
continental<00:07:07.330> plate<00:07:07.569> the<00:07:07.780> United<00:07:08.080> States<00:07:08.289> is

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.440 
continental plate the United States is

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.740 
continental plate the United States is
on<00:07:08.590> right<00:07:09.069> along<00:07:09.370> the<00:07:09.550> west<00:07:09.759> coast<00:07:10.120> and<00:07:10.389> that

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:10.750 
on right along the west coast and that

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.570 
on right along the west coast and that
bumping<00:07:11.199> together<00:07:11.500> causes<00:07:11.949> mountains<00:07:12.400> to

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:12.580 
bumping together causes mountains to

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.279 
bumping together causes mountains to
build<00:07:12.759> up<00:07:12.940> and<00:07:13.150> it<00:07:13.240> causes<00:07:13.629> that<00:07:13.780> volcanic

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:14.289 
build up and it causes that volcanic

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:16.680 
build up and it causes that volcanic
activity<00:07:15.009> and<00:07:15.039> seismic<00:07:15.639> activity<00:07:15.759> that<00:07:16.539> we're

activity and seismic activity that we're

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.189 
activity and seismic activity that we're
all<00:07:16.810> pretty<00:07:17.020> familiar<00:07:17.289> with<00:07:18.030> and<00:07:19.030> this<00:07:19.690> region

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:20.199 
all pretty familiar with and this region

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:22.589 
all pretty familiar with and this region
that<00:07:20.289> surrounds<00:07:20.469> the<00:07:20.979> Pacific<00:07:21.400> plate<00:07:21.599> where

00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:22.599 
that surrounds the Pacific plate where

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:24.510 
that surrounds the Pacific plate where
we<00:07:22.780> see<00:07:22.990> all<00:07:23.139> that<00:07:23.259> volcanic<00:07:23.860> activity<00:07:24.400> and

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:24.520 
we see all that volcanic activity and

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.670 
we see all that volcanic activity and
seismic<00:07:24.969> activity<00:07:25.120> is<00:07:25.659> called<00:07:26.169> the<00:07:26.289> Ring<00:07:26.530> of
