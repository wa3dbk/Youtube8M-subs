to get these two instead together that

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.449 
to get these two instead together that
way<00:03:21.079> it<00:03:21.200> keeps<00:03:21.319> the<00:03:21.470> prices<00:03:21.829> down<00:03:21.950> as<00:03:22.129> well<00:03:22.250> as

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
bit of pace all defensive stats for

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:47.020 
bit of pace all defensive stats for
their<00:04:46.070> positions

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
their positions

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.820 
their positions
so<00:04:48.020> yeah<00:04:48.170> oh<00:04:48.380> then<00:04:48.890> strike<00:04:49.190> up<00:04:49.400> we<00:04:50.210> have

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
so yeah oh then strike up we have

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.220 
so yeah oh then strike up we have
Hernandez<00:04:51.830> and<00:04:51.890> the<00:04:52.400> reason<00:04:52.850> why<00:04:53.090> I<00:04:53.450> have<00:04:54.110> this

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
Hernandez and the reason why I have this

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.220 
Hernandez and the reason why I have this
guy<00:04:54.500> here<00:04:54.740> 90<00:04:55.220> pace<00:04:55.430> 71<00:04:56.390> shoots<00:04:56.690> in<00:04:56.810> left<00:04:57.080> field

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
guy here 90 pace 71 shoots in left field

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.960 
guy here 90 pace 71 shoots in left field
so<00:04:57.980> theoretically<00:04:58.640> if<00:04:58.730> I<00:04:58.970> played<00:04:59.240> him<00:04:59.650> here

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
so theoretically if I played him here

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.940 
so theoretically if I played him here
this<00:05:01.970> is<00:05:02.090> what<00:05:02.240> people<00:05:02.420> were<00:05:02.720> saying<00:05:02.950> this

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
this is what people were saying this

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.640 
this is what people were saying this
would<00:05:04.130> be<00:05:04.280> better<00:05:04.490> wouldn't<00:05:04.730> it<00:05:04.880> so<00:05:05.470> it's<00:05:06.470> left

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
would be better wouldn't it so it's left

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.670 
would be better wouldn't it so it's left
for<00:05:06.770> aiding<00:05:07.130> cutting<00:05:07.550> has<00:05:08.000> got<00:05:08.240> more<00:05:08.750> pace<00:05:09.020> but

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
for aiding cutting has got more pace but

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.410 
for aiding cutting has got more pace but
Cavani's<00:05:10.220> also<00:05:10.520> a<00:05:10.550> target<00:05:10.970> man<00:05:11.060> so<00:05:11.270> this

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
Cavani's also a target man so this

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.120 
Cavani's also a target man so this
should<00:05:11.660> be<00:05:11.690> reticle<00:05:12.470> II<00:05:12.530> work<00:05:12.710> out<00:05:12.920> better

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
should be reticle II work out better

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.040 
should be reticle II work out better
when<00:05:14.060> you're<00:05:14.180> going<00:05:14.330> to<00:05:14.450> non<00:05:14.570> line<00:05:14.750> game<00:05:14.930> if

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
when you're going to non line game if

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.280 
when you're going to non line game if
you<00:05:15.140> see<00:05:15.320> Cavani's<00:05:15.770> regulate<00:05:16.360> 649<00:05:17.360> is<00:05:17.480> rate<00:05:17.660> 84

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
you see Cavani's regulate 649 is rate 84

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.810 
you see Cavani's regulate 649 is rate 84
that<00:05:18.440> means<00:05:18.620> you're<00:05:18.710> gonna<00:05:18.830> have<00:05:18.920> 85<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:19.430> tap

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
that means you're gonna have 85 the tap

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.270 
that means you're gonna have 85 the tap
and<00:05:20.090> this<00:05:20.660> team<00:05:20.930> isn't<00:05:21.230> that<00:05:21.740> great<00:05:21.950> so<00:05:22.190> you're

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
and this team isn't that great so you're

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.080 
and this team isn't that great so you're
going<00:05:22.430> to<00:05:22.490> be<00:05:22.610> given<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:22.940> wrong<00:05:23.030> impression

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
going to be given the wrong impression

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.870 
going to be given the wrong impression
of<00:05:23.540> the<00:05:23.630> team<00:05:23.840> and<00:05:24.140> one<00:05:25.130> second<00:05:25.640> of<00:05:25.700> all

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
of the team and one second of all

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.210 
of the team and one second of all
Hernandez<00:05:26.810> in<00:05:27.080> camp<00:05:27.410> is<00:05:27.560> going<00:05:27.740> to<00:05:27.800> cost<00:05:27.920> a<00:05:28.070> lot

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
Hernandez in camp is going to cost a lot

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.830 
Hernandez in camp is going to cost a lot
whereas<00:05:28.490> cavani's<00:05:29.000> price<00:05:29.270> doesn't<00:05:29.570> really

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
whereas cavani's price doesn't really

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.360 
whereas cavani's price doesn't really
vary<00:05:30.110> that<00:05:30.230> much<00:05:30.290> from<00:05:30.590> the<00:05:30.680> striker<00:05:30.950> to<00:05:31.160> camp

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
vary that much from the striker to camp

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.030 
vary that much from the striker to camp
so<00:05:31.820> this<00:05:31.940> keeps<00:05:32.180> the<00:05:32.810> prices<00:05:33.560> down<00:05:33.590> a<00:05:33.800> little

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
so this keeps the prices down a little

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.180 
so this keeps the prices down a little
bit<00:05:34.930> so<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:35.990> could<00:05:36.320> change<00:05:36.500> them<00:05:36.740> around<00:05:36.800> if

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
bit so you could change them around if

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.010 
bit so you could change them around if
you<00:05:37.310> like<00:05:37.520> but<00:05:38.270> this<00:05:38.390> is<00:05:38.510> just<00:05:38.540> how<00:05:38.900> I'm

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
you like but this is just how I'm

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.830 
you like but this is just how I'm

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.930 
showing it to you today I haven't got
any<00:05:42.020> more<00:05:42.140> goals<00:05:42.470> because<00:05:42.980> I<00:05:43.310> haven't<00:05:43.790> had

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
any more goals because I haven't had

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.400 
any more goals because I haven't had
much<00:05:44.180> chance<00:05:44.480> to<00:05:44.630> play<00:05:44.720> with<00:05:44.930> his<00:05:45.020> team<00:05:45.230> but<00:05:45.380> I

much chance to play with his team but I

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.170 
much chance to play with his team but I

if<00:05:52.580> you<00:05:52.730> wanted<00:05:52.940> to<00:05:53.030> swap<00:05:53.270> these<00:05:53.420> two<00:05:53.480> around

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
but to be honest and unless as a striker

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.080 
but to be honest and unless as a striker
it's<00:05:56.300> very<00:05:56.480> good<00:05:56.690> anyway<00:05:57.440> and<00:05:57.710> so<00:05:58.220> Cavani<00:05:58.790> is

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
it's very good anyway and so Cavani is

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.210 
it's very good anyway and so Cavani is
still<00:05:59.330> good<00:05:59.540> cam<00:05:59.810> and<00:06:00.680> that's<00:06:00.800> got<00:06:00.950> to<00:06:01.040> be<00:06:01.100> the

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
still good cam and that's got to be the

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.950 
still good cam and that's got to be the
