track<00:00:23.970> athletes<00:00:24.510> now<00:00:25.109> my<00:00:25.500> assumption<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.189> if

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
track athletes now my assumption is if

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.550 
track athletes now my assumption is if
you're<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.699> track<00:00:27.000> athlete<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.960> you're<00:00:28.289> not

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
you're a track athlete that you're not

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.800 
you're a track athlete that you're not
doing<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.310> long-distance<00:00:30.000> you're<00:00:30.420> not<00:00:30.539> going

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
doing the long-distance you're not going

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.620 
doing the long-distance you're not going
the<00:00:30.869> mile<00:00:31.080> run<00:00:31.349> you're<00:00:32.040> not<00:00:32.189> doing<00:00:32.630> 5,000

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
the mile run you're not doing 5,000

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.600 
the mile run you're not doing 5,000
meters<00:00:33.870> or<00:00:34.110> 10,000<00:00:34.649> meters<00:00:34.860> whatever<00:00:35.190> else<00:00:35.430> it

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
meters or 10,000 meters whatever else it

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.840 
meters or 10,000 meters whatever else it
is<00:00:35.640> you're<00:00:36.239> more<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.920> power<00:00:37.920> athlete<00:00:38.610> so

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
is you're more of a power athlete so

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.209 
is you're more of a power athlete so
you're<00:00:38.879> talking<00:00:39.480> maybe<00:00:39.629> 400<00:00:40.590> meters<00:00:40.950> or<00:00:41.160> less

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
you're talking maybe 400 meters or less

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.810 
you're talking maybe 400 meters or less
and<00:00:41.969> you're<00:00:42.540> also<00:00:42.719> talking<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.860> jumps<00:00:44.579> such

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
and you're also talking the jumps such

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.310 
and you're also talking the jumps such
as<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> triple<00:00:45.480> long<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.649> high<00:00:47.280> jump<00:00:48.320> not

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
as the triple long and high jump not

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.229 
as the triple long and high jump not
sure<00:00:49.710> if<00:00:49.890> you're<00:00:50.100> doing<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:51.210> field<00:00:51.660> shotput

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
sure if you're doing the field shotput

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.750 
sure if you're doing the field shotput
hammer<00:00:54.239> toss<00:00:54.570> stuff<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.530> but<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.550> can

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
hammer toss stuff like that but this can

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.880 
hammer toss stuff like that but this can
be<00:00:56.789> incorporated<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.809> as<00:00:57.989> well<00:00:58.500> but<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.829> would

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
be incorporated in as well but I would

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.189 
be incorporated in as well but I would
kind<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.280> tweak<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.820> little<00:00:59.850> bit<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.899> let<00:01:01.109> me

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
kind of tweak it a little bit but let me

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.250 
kind of tweak it a little bit but let me
just<00:01:01.440> go<00:01:01.590> over<00:01:02.239> exactly<00:01:03.239> how<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.660> train<00:01:04.080> my

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
just go over exactly how I train my

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.490 
just go over exactly how I train my
track<00:01:05.040> athletes<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> gym<00:01:06.060> now<00:01:06.570> I'm<00:01:06.960> taking

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
track athletes in the gym now I'm taking

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.660 
track athletes in the gym now I'm taking
for<00:01:07.680> granted<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.220> hold<00:01:08.369> them<00:01:08.580> accountable

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
for granted and I hold them accountable

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.830 
for granted and I hold them accountable
that<00:01:09.210> they<00:01:09.360> are<00:01:09.570> running<00:01:10.850> usually<00:01:11.850> with<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
that they are running usually with the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.300 
that they are running usually with the
person<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.260> I'm<00:01:13.439> training<00:01:13.680> now<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:13.920> think

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
person that I'm training now I think

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.590 
person that I'm training now I think
they<00:01:14.430> say<00:01:14.939> run<00:01:16.100> four<00:01:17.100> or<00:01:17.220> five<00:01:17.460> days<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> week

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
they say run four or five days a week

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.200 
they say run four or five days a week
they're<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.049> track<00:01:19.290> I've<00:01:19.560> heard<00:01:19.920> as<00:01:20.210> much

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
they're on the track I've heard as much

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.890 
they're on the track I've heard as much
as<00:01:21.420> six<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.470> seven<00:01:23.100> I'm<00:01:23.280> working<00:01:24.180> on<00:01:24.299> technique

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
as six to seven I'm working on technique

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.660 
as six to seven I'm working on technique
and<00:01:25.170> various<00:01:25.830> things<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.130> that

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
and various things like that

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.580 
and various things like that
so<00:01:26.880> they<00:01:27.119> had<00:01:27.360> their<00:01:27.600> separate<00:01:28.049> coach<00:01:28.290> where

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
so they had their separate coach where

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.109 
so they had their separate coach where
they're<00:01:28.770> training<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.159> 100<00:01:29.670> meters<00:01:29.970> and

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
they're training to 100 meters and

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.880 
they're training to 100 meters and
they're<00:01:30.600> learning<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.049> technique<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.710> I

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
they're learning the technique so I

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.380 
they're learning the technique so I
don't<00:01:32.070> bother<00:01:32.250> with<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.759> what<00:01:33.270> I'm

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
don't bother with that what I'm

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.789 
don't bother with that what I'm
interested<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.170> getting<00:01:34.409> them<00:01:34.619> more

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
interested in is getting them more

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.100 
interested in is getting them more
powerful<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.610> getting<00:01:36.270> their<00:01:36.390> body<00:01:36.600> right<00:01:36.960> in

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
powerful and getting their body right in

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.560 
powerful and getting their body right in
the<00:01:37.560> gym<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.100> I'll<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:38.850> all<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.150> technique

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
the gym and I'll have all the technique

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.359 
the gym and I'll have all the technique
with<00:01:39.810> their<00:01:39.990> coach<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.070> how<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.220> break

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
with their coach so this is how I break

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.510 
with their coach so this is how I break
it<00:01:41.670> down<00:01:41.960> when<00:01:42.960> they<00:01:43.079> come<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.439> here<00:01:43.680> they<00:01:44.369> go

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
it down when they come in here they go

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.819 
it down when they come in here they go
through<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> full<00:01:44.939> assessment<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.990> through

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
through a full assessment so through

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.710 
through a full assessment so through
that<00:01:46.979> full<00:01:47.130> assessment<00:01:47.520> I'm<00:01:47.850> able<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.240> see<00:01:48.450> as

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
that full assessment I'm able to see as

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.810 
that full assessment I'm able to see as
far<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.560> upper<00:01:49.920> shoulder<00:01:50.280> girdle<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
far as in the upper shoulder girdle the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.080 
far as in the upper shoulder girdle the
neck<00:01:51.390> area<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.829> hips<00:01:53.189> from<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> hips

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
neck area and the hips from the hips

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.050 
neck area and the hips from the hips
down<00:01:54.600> where<00:01:55.320> they<00:01:55.590> have<00:01:55.860> muscle<00:01:56.430> imbalances

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
down where they have muscle imbalances

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.179 
down where they have muscle imbalances
that<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:57.750> need<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.079> do<00:01:58.200> corrective<00:01:58.710> stretches

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
that we need to do corrective stretches

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.800 
that we need to do corrective stretches
so<00:01:59.670> usually<00:02:00.119> typically<00:02:00.630> right<00:02:00.810> here<00:02:01.340> like<00:02:02.340> I

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
so usually typically right here like I

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.320 
so usually typically right here like I
see

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
see

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.600 
see
certain<00:02:05.330> things<00:02:05.540> such<00:02:05.990> as<00:02:06.050> very<00:02:07.010> tight<00:02:07.340> hip

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
certain things such as very tight hip

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.640 
certain things such as very tight hip
flexors<00:02:07.640> yes<00:02:08.360> even<00:02:08.720> in<00:02:08.840> track<00:02:09.080> athletes<00:02:09.500> they

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:09.650 
flexors yes even in track athletes they

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.410 
flexors yes even in track athletes they
do<00:02:09.710> have<00:02:10.040> it<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:10.760> still<00:02:11.030> see<00:02:11.300> the

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
do have it and you still see the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.080 
do have it and you still see the
inhibited<00:02:11.960> glutes<00:02:12.230> so<00:02:12.830> my<00:02:13.340> first<00:02:13.580> thing<00:02:13.850> that

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
inhibited glutes so my first thing that

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.960 
inhibited glutes so my first thing that
I<00:02:14.120> try<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.830> work<00:02:15.830> with<00:02:16.040> them<00:02:16.160> is<00:02:16.400> prehab

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
I try to work with them is prehab

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.150 
I try to work with them is prehab
basically<00:02:17.960> what<00:02:18.110> I<00:02:18.140> want<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.470> do<00:02:18.590> here<00:02:18.860> is<00:02:18.980> all

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
basically what I want to do here is all

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.340 
basically what I want to do here is all
the<00:02:19.370> corrective<00:02:19.850> stretches<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.600> all<00:02:21.140> the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
the corrective stretches and all the

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.490 
the corrective stretches and all the
corrective<00:02:22.030> firing<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.480> ISO<00:02:23.900> activation

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
corrective firing the ISO activation

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.470 
corrective firing the ISO activation
drills<00:02:24.770> like<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:25.130> used<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.400> like<00:02:25.490> I<00:02:26.000> like<00:02:26.300> to

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
drills like I used to like I like to

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.630 
drills like I used to like I like to
call<00:02:26.630> them<00:02:26.870> where<00:02:27.710> I'm<00:02:27.800> basically<00:02:28.310> getting

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
call them where I'm basically getting

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.420 
call them where I'm basically getting
them<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.240> fire<00:02:29.540> their<00:02:29.840> glutes<00:02:30.200> fire<00:02:30.980> their<00:02:31.250> hip

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
them to fire their glutes fire their hip

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.400 
them to fire their glutes fire their hip
flexors<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.210> other<00:02:32.720> muscles<00:02:33.140> that<00:02:33.230> they're

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
flexors and other muscles that they're

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.220 
flexors and other muscles that they're
going<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.590> be<00:02:33.680> using<00:02:34.040> whether<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:34.700> be<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.540> long

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
going to be using whether it be a long

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.850 
going to be using whether it be a long
jump<00:02:36.530> triple<00:02:37.250> jumps<00:02:37.730> something<00:02:38.090> like<00:02:38.240> that

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
jump triple jumps something like that

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.770 
jump triple jumps something like that
from<00:02:39.860> there<00:02:40.130> we<00:02:40.670> are<00:02:40.700> going<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.240> play<00:02:41.450> with<00:02:41.660> the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
from there we are going to play with the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.290 
from there we are going to play with the
force<00:02:42.110> velocity<00:02:42.770> curve<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.970> power

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
force velocity curve and the power

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.660 
force velocity curve and the power
spectrum<00:02:45.080> so<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.740> first<00:02:45.980> one<00:02:46.220> is<00:02:46.250> going<00:02:46.460> to<00:02:46.520> be

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
spectrum so the first one is going to be

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.050 
spectrum so the first one is going to be
speed<00:02:47.150> strength<00:02:48.160> if<00:02:49.160> you're<00:02:49.460> familiar<00:02:49.640> with

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
speed strength if you're familiar with

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.480 
speed strength if you're familiar with
the<00:02:50.240> with<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.900> power<00:02:51.170> spectrum<00:02:51.860> this<00:02:52.310> is

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
the with the power spectrum this is

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.070 
the with the power spectrum this is
going<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:52.700> be<00:02:52.850> more<00:02:53.120> towards<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.570> speed<00:02:53.870> side

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
going to be more towards the speed side

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.140 
going to be more towards the speed side
like<00:02:54.260> I<00:02:54.350> said<00:02:54.560> their<00:02:54.770> speed<00:02:55.160> work<00:02:55.430> is<00:02:55.670> taken

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
like I said their speed work is taken

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.610 
like I said their speed work is taken
care<00:02:56.330> of<00:02:56.390> they're<00:02:56.630> already<00:02:56.930> running<00:02:57.230> on<00:02:57.470> the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
care of they're already running on the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.640 
care of they're already running on the
track<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.160> I<00:02:58.580> want<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.030> work<00:02:59.240> more<00:02:59.480> plyos<00:03:00.260> here

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
track so I want to work more plyos here

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.760 
track so I want to work more plyos here
will<00:03:01.610> either<00:03:01.760> do<00:03:02.030> weighted<00:03:02.360> plyos<00:03:02.990> I'll<00:03:03.260> add<00:03:03.740> a

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
will either do weighted plyos I'll add a

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.980 
will either do weighted plyos I'll add a
load<00:03:04.160> I'm<00:03:04.520> always<00:03:04.790> constantly<00:03:05.210> varying

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
load I'm always constantly varying

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.240 
load I'm always constantly varying
either<00:03:06.260> I'm<00:03:06.440> going<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.650> take<00:03:06.830> away<00:03:07.070> their

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
either I'm going to take away their

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.220 
either I'm going to take away their
stretch<00:03:07.550> shortening<00:03:08.060> cycle<00:03:08.239> and<00:03:08.630> jumps<00:03:09.050> or<00:03:09.170> I

stretch shortening cycle and jumps or I

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.010 
stretch shortening cycle and jumps or I
might<00:03:09.890> have<00:03:10.070> them<00:03:10.250> do<00:03:10.459> you<00:03:11.270> know<00:03:11.390> depending<00:03:11.900> on

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
might have them do you know depending on

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.420 
might have them do you know depending on
what<00:03:12.230> day<00:03:12.410> it<00:03:12.560> is<00:03:12.620> it's<00:03:13.010> going<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.220> be<00:03:13.400> a

vertical or horizontal power type

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.210 
vertical or horizontal power type
movement<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.550> we<00:03:16.940> alter<00:03:17.390> those<00:03:17.830> then<00:03:18.830> from

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
movement and we alter those then from

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.040 
movement and we alter those then from
there<00:03:19.430> they're<00:03:19.700> going<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.239> do<00:03:20.360> a<00:03:20.390> strength

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
there they're going to do a strength

like to go on a very high powerful

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.320 
like to go on a very high powerful
threshold<00:03:44.500> from<00:03:45.500> there<00:03:45.769> we<00:03:46.370> have<00:03:46.550> an<00:03:46.670> absolute

to do five by five six by threes six by
ones<00:03:53.239> and<00:03:53.600> that's<00:03:54.170> going<00:03:54.320> to<00:03:54.380> be<00:03:54.560> in<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.800> bench

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040

now<00:03:56.570> you<00:03:56.630> can<00:03:56.930> vary<00:03:57.200> these<00:03:57.410> obviously<00:03:58.040> you<00:03:58.190> can

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
now you can vary these obviously you can

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.550 
now you can vary these obviously you can
mess<00:03:58.550> around<00:03:58.580> with<00:03:59.060> different<00:03:59.260> boxes<00:04:00.260> you<00:04:00.410> can

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
mess around with different boxes you can

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.729 
mess around with different boxes you can
mess<00:04:00.709> around<00:04:00.739> with<00:04:01.070> different<00:04:01.190> band<00:04:01.670> chains

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.320 
mess around with different band chains
vary<00:04:03.739> it<00:04:03.980> up<00:04:04.130> have<00:04:04.459> them<00:04:04.610> do<00:04:04.820> different<00:04:05.300> things

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
vary it up have them do different things

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.820 
vary it up have them do different things
but<00:04:05.840> always<00:04:06.790> make<00:04:07.790> sure<00:04:07.820> they're<00:04:08.150> going<00:04:08.330> on

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
but always make sure they're going on

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.580 
but always make sure they're going on
similar<00:04:09.070> effort<00:04:09.430> here<00:04:09.960> last<00:04:10.960> but<00:04:11.200> not<00:04:11.320> least

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
similar effort here last but not least

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.670 
similar effort here last but not least
is<00:04:11.860> auxiliaries<00:04:12.850> so<00:04:13.540> depending<00:04:14.170> on<00:04:14.260> what<00:04:14.440> they

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
is auxiliaries so depending on what they

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.710 
is auxiliaries so depending on what they
are<00:04:14.710> actually<00:04:15.280> doing<00:04:15.520> you're<00:04:16.180> going<00:04:16.480> to

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
are actually doing you're going to

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.430 
are actually doing you're going to
tailor<00:04:17.260> that<00:04:17.410> to<00:04:18.070> their<00:04:18.549> auxilary<00:04:19.120> x'<00:04:19.440> and

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
tailor that to their auxilary x' and

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.980 
tailor that to their auxilary x' and
have<00:04:20.920> them<00:04:21.190> doing<00:04:21.640> a<00:04:21.730> lot<00:04:21.940> of<00:04:22.090> core<00:04:22.420> work<00:04:22.450> here

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
have them doing a lot of core work here

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.870 
have them doing a lot of core work here
integrated<00:04:23.710> core<00:04:23.920> work<00:04:24.130> where<00:04:24.700> they're

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
integrated core work where they're

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.660 
integrated core work where they're
transferring<00:04:25.480> energy<00:04:26.040> extremely<00:04:27.040> fast<00:04:27.340> and

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
transferring energy extremely fast and

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.330 
transferring energy extremely fast and
efficient<00:04:28.240> um<00:04:28.710> like<00:04:29.710> I<00:04:29.830> said<00:04:30.070> that's

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
efficient um like I said that's

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.130 
efficient um like I said that's
basically<00:04:30.820> how<00:04:31.060> I<00:04:31.090> set<00:04:31.480> up<00:04:31.510> the<00:04:31.690> structure

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
basically how I set up the structure

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.750 
basically how I set up the structure
depending<00:04:32.920> on<00:04:33.070> how<00:04:33.160> many<00:04:33.220> days<00:04:33.520> they're

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
depending on how many days they're

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.000 
depending on how many days they're
running<00:04:34.090> I<00:04:34.210> usually<00:04:34.660> would<00:04:34.780> go<00:04:34.930> three<00:04:35.440> days<00:04:35.770> a

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
running I usually would go three days a

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.330 
running I usually would go three days a
week<00:04:36.450> so<00:04:37.450> this<00:04:37.630> might<00:04:37.870> be<00:04:37.900> Monday<00:04:38.620> Wednesday

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
week so this might be Monday Wednesday

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.780 
week so this might be Monday Wednesday
Friday<00:04:39.730> its<00:04:40.540> total<00:04:41.110> body<00:04:41.320> basically<00:04:42.250> every

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
Friday its total body basically every

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.030 
Friday its total body basically every
day<00:04:42.940> but<00:04:43.210> you<00:04:43.330> put<00:04:43.540> emphasis<00:04:44.080> so<00:04:44.800> say<00:04:45.010> for

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
day but you put emphasis so say for

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.830 
day but you put emphasis so say for
instance<00:04:45.310> one<00:04:45.790> day<00:04:45.970> we<00:04:46.180> emphasize<00:04:46.810> the

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
instance one day we emphasize the

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.740 
instance one day we emphasize the
dynamic<00:04:47.770> speed<00:04:48.070> type<00:04:48.400> work<00:04:48.670> we<00:04:49.210> might<00:04:49.450> do<00:04:49.720> a

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
dynamic speed type work we might do a

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.590 
dynamic speed type work we might do a
deadlift<00:04:50.560> then<00:04:51.280> come<00:04:51.580> Wednesday<00:04:51.820> we<00:04:52.180> might<00:04:52.390> do

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
deadlift then come Wednesday we might do

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.500 
deadlift then come Wednesday we might do
a<00:04:52.630> bench<00:04:53.020> here<00:04:53.440> then<00:04:54.070> Friday<00:04:54.640> you'll<00:04:55.180> come

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
a bench here then Friday you'll come

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.480 
a bench here then Friday you'll come
back<00:04:55.660> to<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:55.990> squat<00:04:56.350> I<00:04:56.620> never<00:04:57.130> want<00:04:57.430> to

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
back to the squat I never want to

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.720 
back to the squat I never want to
texture<00:04:58.060> I<00:04:58.240> never<00:04:58.510> want<00:04:58.690> to<00:04:58.720> do<00:04:58.840> a<00:04:58.870> max<00:04:59.230> effort

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
texture I never want to do a max effort

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.250 
texture I never want to do a max effort
lower<00:05:00.730> on<00:05:01.120> any<00:05:01.540> of<00:05:01.660> the<00:05:01.750> days<00:05:01.930> where<00:05:02.140> I'm

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
lower on any of the days where I'm

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.560 
lower on any of the days where I'm
totally<00:05:02.830> killing<00:05:03.100> their<00:05:03.340> legs<00:05:03.610> because<00:05:04.420> of

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
totally killing their legs because of

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.120 
totally killing their legs because of
the<00:05:04.630> simple<00:05:04.900> fact<00:05:04.960> is<00:05:05.290> they're<00:05:05.620> running<00:05:05.950> I

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
the simple fact is they're running I

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.890 
the simple fact is they're running I
need<00:05:06.310> them<00:05:06.610> to<00:05:06.640> still<00:05:06.940> run<00:05:07.210> a<00:05:07.420> proper

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
need them to still run a proper

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.750 
need them to still run a proper
technique<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:08.530> when<00:05:08.740> you're<00:05:08.980> when<00:05:09.550> your

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
technique and when you're when your

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.360 
technique and when you're when your
power<00:05:10.450> output<00:05:10.840> is<00:05:10.990> very<00:05:11.170> decreased<00:05:11.650> you<00:05:12.100> start

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
power output is very decreased you start

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.340 
power output is very decreased you start
to<00:05:12.460> turn<00:05:12.610> sloppy<00:05:13.000> in<00:05:13.210> your<00:05:13.360> technique<00:05:13.840> so<00:05:14.320> I

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
to turn sloppy in your technique so I

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.440 
to turn sloppy in your technique so I
like<00:05:14.680> to<00:05:14.710> hit<00:05:15.040> them<00:05:15.220> hard<00:05:15.250> here<00:05:15.910> but<00:05:16.060> I<00:05:16.330> don't

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
like to hit them hard here but I don't

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.900 
like to hit them hard here but I don't
like<00:05:16.840> to<00:05:16.990> do<00:05:17.169> repetitive<00:05:17.890> effort<00:05:18.520> for<00:05:18.820> the

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
like to do repetitive effort for the

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.570 
like to do repetitive effort for the
lower<00:05:19.120> body<00:05:19.390> a<00:05:19.780> lot<00:05:20.740> of<00:05:20.830> upper<00:05:21.130> body<00:05:21.310> you<00:05:21.460> can

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
lower body a lot of upper body you can

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.330 
lower body a lot of upper body you can
do<00:05:21.700> that<00:05:21.850> but<00:05:22.660> that's<00:05:22.870> pretty<00:05:22.960> much<00:05:23.290> it<00:05:23.560> use

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
do that but that's pretty much it use

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.580 
do that but that's pretty much it use
this<00:05:24.700> block<00:05:25.060> if<00:05:25.419> you<00:05:25.570> can<00:05:25.840> only<00:05:25.930> go<00:05:26.110> two<00:05:26.169> days<00:05:26.530> a

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
this block if you can only go two days a

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.470 
this block if you can only go two days a
week<00:05:26.860> three<00:05:27.160> days<00:05:27.310> a<00:05:27.340> week<00:05:27.490> like<00:05:28.060> I<00:05:28.210> said<00:05:28.450> I

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
week three days a week like I said I

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.140 
week three days a week like I said I
focused<00:05:29.440> more<00:05:29.620> on<00:05:29.680> a<00:05:29.830> total<00:05:30.700> body<00:05:30.850> movement

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
focused more on a total body movement

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.050 
focused more on a total body movement
