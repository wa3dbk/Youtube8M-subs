00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello people this is the first one today 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.509
 video after my wg challenge me 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.490
 Link the final video of the 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.809
 wednesday is here and today 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.969
 Sunday and I wanted to have today 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.440
 give at least a short update how 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.109
 it continues with the channel's namely 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.420
 that had promised I had on 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.800
 wednesday already that addressed that 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.990
 I wanted to ask you this with mine 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.939
 channel here should go on and has 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.250
 There's a lot of positive feedback already 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.019
 got you and that motivates me 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.630
 Of course, to do a tremendous job 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.399
 and I loved every comment 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.040
 of you and am pleased that totally 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.690
 about that and that's why I thought so 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.649
 to ask again today that one 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.280
 a bit different from 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.100
 compliment watch fun and save me 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.390
 me and therefore just the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.850
 announcement it is here on this 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.860
 channel are in any case continue today 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.989
 it is not a real new topic because 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.340
 I had no time 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.239
 Yesterday my uni project is from the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.129
 I also already during the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.410
 challenge told has come to an end 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.140
 was relatively successful to the people 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.329
 it is therefore relatively positive 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.949
 and the next days I have for it 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.049
 that our more time videos for you 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.880
 prepare 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.860
 Planner once a week video then 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.409
 upload to each other 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.240
 next week's topic, for example, is about it 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.830
 then go ahead with probably the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.479
 vegan chocolate I r you 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.610
 during the challenge had announced 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.680
 The problem with different recipes 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.509
 How to make chocolate without milk yourself 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.549
 It can make a few already 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.530
 found online and we try 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.180
 let's see it through and now I have too 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.159
 to eat sugar again 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.650
 that's why I have more than that 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.890
 bandwidth that the recipes as 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.119
 during the challenge and after that 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.470
 In any case, it will definitely be weeks 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.720
 other team right on already 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.380
 the kitchen already has a theme for in two 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.210
 weeks ago 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.860
 because that's probably how long it takes 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.380
 I had you to do that 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.360
 a day 18 already announced there 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.189
 I have you so mysterious big glasses 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.049
 drawn and with that something completely happened 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.040
 definite and that is definitely 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.780
 Do not forget that is in the making and 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.399
 could be curious what so followed 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.740
 and I thought that up 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.870
 every case so in two three months 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.720
 to make an update 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.640
 the challenge changed my everyday life 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.230
 I noticed now after the challenge 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.090
 I already like that when shopping and so that 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.310
 i did a bit of what cosmos then 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.500
 a two-three-month something in it 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.000
 has done in the long term or whether that 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.100
 everything has to come back in the same way 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.440
 always as before with fast food and 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.820
 we will see unhealthy food 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.070
 i will definitely tell you if 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.840
 Subscribing to her is not to be missed 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.500
 That's why I would recommend to 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.210
 subscribe to 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.740
 if you do not have it otherwise 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.230
 just look at it from time to time 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.720
 and yes you can look forward to next 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.550
 week then a chocolates video and 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.160
 I hope you like that and you 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.180
 stay tuned and see you again 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.860

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.860
