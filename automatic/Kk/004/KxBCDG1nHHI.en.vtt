00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.460
 Hi everyone in this video I try to 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.309
 explain to you how to overcome the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.050
 difficulties of life and to explain it to me 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.990
 I'll tell you a story about a game 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.280
 a master and his disciple 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.160
 walked the street and the 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.950
 disciple asks the master teacher how 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.950
 I can do to improve mine 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.439
 position to face to overcome 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.710
 all the difficulties and that of the buffer 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.810
 the master of saying come with me yes 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.150
 they set out and towards evening 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:38.530
 they arrived in front of a house 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:42.290
 very poor knocked on the door 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:45.739
 they opened a very large family 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:50.170
 modest very poor but dignified 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:53.500
 however the master told him he asked if 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:57.260
 they could have hospitality for the night 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:01.850
 the head of resignation defended himself 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:04.190
 come in and the bears there something for dinner 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.890
 the family was really poor not 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:12.040
 they knew how to live a cup of orsoni 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:16.430
 of milk thus speaking the breadwinner 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.040
 She told him about all the difficulties of 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.960
 children he could not send to 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.500
 school that could not feed the 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.230
 enough because he had no money for 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.630
 buy things their essential 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.360
 life revolved around a cow 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.520
 the cow and their only source of 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.160
 sustenance and the whole family was 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.990
 concentrated on this cow they sought to 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.330
 bring the few to pasture to eat 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.260
 things took milk from this cow 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.590
 that the milk of serviva we also say 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.240
 to feed, however, beyond beyond 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.270
 this cow beyond this hole does not 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.720
 they really had nothing 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.300
 the night came 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.260
 m disciple go to sleep in the 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.960
 then marked room they put to sleep 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.210
 at the suggestion with a bit of straw 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.850
 because there were no beds they really were 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.880
 poor in this family during the 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.270
 night the master of sa disciple come 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.200
 they went out with me and went into the 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.420
 stable where there was the cow and the master 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.870
 quickly pulled out a long knife e 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.230
 he struck a blow that he killed instantly 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:36.970
 the mouth and then they left the 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.920
 disciple was practically caught by the 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.709
 Panic himself master, but what have you done 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.990
 that family way of hunger you have 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.240
 killed the only source of them 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.240
 sustenance now as it will do from 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.430
 live the master said you come with me 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.110
 don't worry you are disciples from 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.380
 they are masters 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:01.300
 a year passes from that event and the 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.820
 disciple was still hesitant in the 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.070
 against the master in all that 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.680
 year he didn't see it anymore he had started it 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.170
 to see him as a bad person 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.450
 a year passed the master of stripes 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.790
 comes this evening I want to bring you 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.670
 imposed redone an adaptation to the 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.550
 same road that they did a year ago 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.100
 and it came to the same place where 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.489
 they were hosted by that family but 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.299
 strangely in place of the slum 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.299
 a year earlier 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:35.519
 there was a nice house instead of 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:39.549
 ground meeting outside saw you a 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:43.600
 land cultivated with fruit trees 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:45.400
 with grain and video also a stable with 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.769
 different animals 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.600
 the disciple thinks bar definitely with 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.299
 the family will be very hungry it will be 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.000
 someone else who had taken over took over 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:58.410
 their place says the master of 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.319
 stuns comes knocking knocked e 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.299
 strangely open 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:08.219
 the same person who had opened a 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.719
 year ago however it was not badly dressed as a 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:13.469
 year ago 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:16.049
 decent clothes also beautiful and also the 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:18.750
 wife the children were well dressed and a 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.770
 house inside had become had become 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:25.530
 beautiful and the breadwinner and said but I will 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.680
 I recognize I know you because a year 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.630
 facts that hosts fair and combination is 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.030
 understood just that evening that some 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.120
 ill-intentioned killed our dear 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.080
 friend only source of livelihood 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.940
 that event really was 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.860
 really important determinant for 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.900
 us because leaders 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.270
 we ended up in discomfort because 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.340
 we did n't really know our life in 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.849
 danger we did not know how to go about 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.330
 to live 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:53.729
 but then we begin to evaluate others 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:58.110
 possibility to evaluate other perspectives 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:05:00.509
 and the land that was in front of the 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.150
 our home that the account we decided to 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:06.210
 we started planting it 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.370
 seed begins to moderate it to pull 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.940
 outside the fertile areas fat lands 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.740
 we planted trees and then we will see that 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.460
 in short, what the product of 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:20.460
 our farm was larger than 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.530
 what we need to live 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.800
 and then we start to sell it and then 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.199
 we begin to find staff that 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.669
 he worked for us is in short 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:34.139
 one year 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:36.449
 we built a farm that 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:39.620
 now it thrives and allows us to 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:44.639
 live well and hard 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:46.620
 we must thank those who killed the 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:51.930
 our cow even if we never know 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:54.810
 the reason why he did it well 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:58.740
 story ends here and the teaching which 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:01.139
 is the teaching is that I think we don't 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.199
 we face the difficulties of life ad 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.310
 example maybe we have a job there 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:08.310
 makes money 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:12.890
 and little but gives us the right sustenance 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:15.540
 to live but we do n't have the courage to 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:19.850
 leave this job and look for a 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:24.060
 another and to do something else 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:26.940
 sure often maybe then it happens that if 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:30.840
 we are the scientists then that work 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.640
 then we start doing because we are 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.440
 in short, if we see the scientists 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.200
 they killed our muck ours 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.850
 work that box allowed us to 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.180
 survive but did not allow us to 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:44.970
 live like we wanted to live and 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:48.180
 so but we find the energies we find 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:50.220
 strategies we find creativity for 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.650
 put up for example an activity 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:56.190
 entrepreneurial to put up or 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.420
 to find something that satisfies a lot 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.400
 more those that are ours 

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.230
 needs that allow us to develop 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.200
 this is what our talents are 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:08.030
 because often 90 percent of the 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:11.670
 people among jobs just to live 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:14.670
 to survive I would say but not 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:17.490
 develop the talent they have inside 

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:19.080
 the fraud fail to abandon that 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:22.290
 work because their source of 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.930
 sustenance like the peasants of the 

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:27.240
 story they could not say 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.340
 they remained tied to the cow that 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.800
 they gave to survive but certainly not 

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.800
 to live well when a 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:39.540
 event that practically killed alla 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:41.610
 cow things have changed 

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:45.830
 so think about the work you do 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:48.810
 to the activity you do and think about that 

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:51.690
 you can improve it to improve it 

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:53.790
 obviously you need to change must 

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:57.150
 change not being tied is one thing 

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:59.100
 that we don't like that doesn't satisfy us 

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:01.640
 the only way to deal with 

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:05.070
 life difficulties and then act 

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:09.920
 well I give you an appointment at the next 

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:12.550
 video and in the meantime I invite you to follow 

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:16.720

 Hi everyone
