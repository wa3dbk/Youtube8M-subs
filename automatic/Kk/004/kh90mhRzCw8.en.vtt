00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.160
 very good to everyone today I bring you here to 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:12.009
 warwick dancing a little bit and good 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:14.400
 I'm going to bring a guide like jungle bunker 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:17.330
 warwick 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.330
 the little 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.760
 Well, we started with the blue 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:28.080
 although it's pretty bad with blue 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.390
 Y 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.700
 I have a good group prepared video 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.829
 I got to prepare because I have some 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:42.230
 parts and I have to put together we're going 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:44.559
 with youtube I hope you like the best 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.559
 person 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.110
 and well, I'll explain what 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.110
 do the each 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.140
 parade 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.760
 of warwick the turmeric you already see a meten 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.760
 claw and recover life 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.159
 the w the movement speed is not 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.159
 easy or passive 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.549
 there are pimps that I will not use for 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.439
 both I will not use is maite as 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.899
 You see, I spend a lot of mana just 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.899
 I spent it with three claws less 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.720
 because it is a character that gives where there are left 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.720
 in jungle 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.170
 because according to the w 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.350
 I'm going to do my mana a little bit 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.010
 if not 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.010
 never 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.550
 w good he perceives what he does is 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:51.010
 inflicts basic imported magic damage 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.800
 thing that in the end gives us security a lot 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.450
 because you ride it to nobody 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.450
 but good we go 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:06.620
 good then a basic power 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.620
 good this note 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.330
 and as you can see they are mint 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.590
 speak good movement was speaking 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.590
 milk I'm going to take a stroll 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.980
 then if you see as such 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.820
 at the time I'm going because I'm going slow and I did not have 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.620
 pool is not necessary like this man 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.620
 but good is more like you eat 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.830
 all 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.510
 and then take more basic svb 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.090
 well now I should upload all 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.530
 but good 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.530
 how are we between family 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:54.599
 in the blake law we told him what 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.599
 It is when the enemies are a little 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:03.370
 to little life guido and brakes are heard and 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.370
 let's go and give the friends version 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:15.290
 I do not know if it's a good thing I do not know 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.830
 Become a dragon with two balls but not 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.300
 I will be able but good and so 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.870
 I explain the last one while I move 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:27.299
 and such 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:29.970
 and hey, the last thing he does is 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.910
 is a little bit apart from studying 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.820
 because it gives you 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.690
 it takes little life from the enemy but it 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.390
 pita 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.240
 and good if you have any doubt you already know 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.330
 Leave a comment I'll leave the guide 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.550

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.660
 game if you want a whole game of 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:55.800
 warwick ask me and good 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.800
 a little more to say 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.790

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:06.230
 so see you in the next video 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.100
