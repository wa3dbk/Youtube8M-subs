levels<00:00:32.969> i<00:00:33.270> believe<00:00:33.660> are<00:00:34.079> going<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.290> pull<00:00:34.469> up<00:00:34.649> as

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
levels i believe are going to pull up as

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.700 
levels i believe are going to pull up as
they're<00:00:36.270> going<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.450> be<00:00:36.600> will<00:00:37.050> cease<00:00:37.320> either

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
they're going to be will cease either

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.119 
they're going to be will cease either
the<00:00:37.860> same<00:00:38.070> size<00:00:38.399> as<00:00:38.850> as<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.260> ipad<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.829> that's<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
the same size as as the ipad so that's a

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.750 
the same size as as the ipad so that's a
very<00:00:41.160> cool<00:00:42.920> who<00:00:43.920> didn't<00:00:44.399> want<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.579> get<00:00:44.700> shot

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
very cool who didn't want to get shot

00:00:44.760 --> 00:01:01.189 
very cool who didn't want to get shot
there<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:55.820> tricky<00:00:59.449> not<00:01:00.449> seeing<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.840> big<00:01:01.050> way

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
there so tricky not seeing a big way

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:08.359 
there so tricky not seeing a big way
around<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:06.390> as<00:01:06.799> you<00:01:07.799> can<00:01:07.950> see<00:01:08.189> we<00:01:08.340> can

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
around this so as you can see we can

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.429 
around this so as you can see we can
head<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.790> back<00:01:08.970> out<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.390> here<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.840> go<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
head it back out of here and go to the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.399 
head it back out of here and go to the
menu<00:01:10.909> that's<00:01:11.909> looking<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> hard<00:01:13.049> level

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
menu that's looking like a hard level

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.170 
menu that's looking like a hard level
there<00:01:13.590> we'll<00:01:13.799> check<00:01:14.010> out<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.189> ipad<00:01:14.430> levels

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
there we'll check out the ipad levels

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.010 
there we'll check out the ipad levels
and<00:01:15.360> i<00:01:16.700> played<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> few<00:01:18.090> i'm<00:01:18.390> not<00:01:18.600> sure<00:01:18.810> where<00:01:18.960> I

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
and i played a few i'm not sure where I

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.789 
and i played a few i'm not sure where I
was<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.590> think<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:21.000> do<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.020> tutorial<00:01:22.229> was

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
was that I think and do the tutorial was

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.010 
was that I think and do the tutorial was
on<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.040> bread<00:01:23.250> crumbs<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.509> get<00:01:24.750> quite<00:01:24.990> a

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
on the bread crumbs so you get quite a

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.870 
on the bread crumbs so you get quite a
few<00:01:25.110> levels<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:25.799> free<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.310> be<00:01:26.430> honest<00:01:26.700> with

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
few levels for free to be honest with

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.600 
few levels for free to be honest with
you<00:01:27.060> um<00:01:27.409> maybe<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.560> was<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.009> iPad<00:01:29.340> so

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
anyways I play several levels there's

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.560 
anyways I play several levels there's
there's<00:01:32.909> difference<00:01:33.770> there's<00:01:34.770> different<00:01:35.570> you

so<00:01:51.310> anyways<00:01:52.090> you<00:01:52.180> get<00:01:52.270> that<00:01:52.450> happy<00:01:52.810> sound<00:01:53.110> when

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
so anyways you get that happy sound when

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.530 
so anyways you get that happy sound when
you<00:01:53.470> get<00:01:53.650> there<00:01:53.860> but<00:01:54.430> as<00:01:54.820> you<00:01:54.970> can<00:01:55.090> see<00:01:55.240> this<00:01:55.360> is

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
you get there but as you can see this is

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.180 
you get there but as you can see this is
like<00:01:55.720> a<00:01:56.340> pinball<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:59.350> they<00:01:59.770> have<00:01:59.950> there's

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
like a pinball so they have there's

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.770 
like a pinball so they have there's
cannons<00:02:00.700> that<00:02:00.760> blow<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.120> up<00:02:01.240> as<00:02:01.450> you<00:02:01.570> saw<00:02:01.750> in

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
cannons that blow you up as you saw in

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.930 
cannons that blow you up as you saw in
the<00:02:01.930> first<00:02:02.260> round<00:02:02.530> on<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:03.700> fail<00:02:03.940> there<00:02:04.980> so<00:02:05.980> you

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
the first round on the fail there so you

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.940 
the first round on the fail there so you
got<00:02:07.120> to<00:02:07.240> try<00:02:07.390> to<00:02:07.420> beat<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:07.750> designers<00:02:08.440> speed

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
got to try to beat the designers speed

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.510 
got to try to beat the designers speed
that's<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.610> point<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:11.140> well<00:02:11.680> anybody<00:02:11.950> else's

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
that's the point and well anybody else's

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:20.420 
that's the point and well anybody else's
speed<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:18.180> obviously<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.300> gotta<00:02:19.690> go<00:02:19.870> get<00:02:20.050> the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
speed and obviously you gotta go get the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.490 
speed and obviously you gotta go get the
the<00:02:21.450> buttons<00:02:22.450> too<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.790> this<00:02:25.090> this<00:02:25.420> app<00:02:25.690> is<00:02:25.870> is

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
the buttons too so this this app is is

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.220 
the buttons too so this this app is is
it<00:02:26.680> typical<00:02:26.890> it's<00:02:27.400> really<00:02:27.640> cool<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:28.150> how<00:02:29.110> it

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
it typical it's really cool the how it

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.449 
it typical it's really cool the how it
works<00:02:29.440> with<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.830> accelerometer<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:31.140> the

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
works with the accelerometer and the

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.250 
works with the accelerometer and the
sound<00:02:33.459> effects<00:02:33.820> that<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.330> graphics<00:02:34.930> the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
sound effects that the graphics the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.710 
sound effects that the graphics the
whole<00:02:35.410> nine<00:02:35.590> yards<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.390> don't<00:02:37.390> know<00:02:37.450> why<00:02:37.570> they

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
whole nine yards I don't know why they

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.420 
whole nine yards I don't know why they
say<00:02:37.930> nine<00:02:38.140> yards<00:02:38.500> but<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.830> whole<00:02:38.950> nine<00:02:39.130> yards

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
say nine yards but the whole nine yards

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.120 
say nine yards but the whole nine yards
is<00:02:39.580> pretty<00:02:39.850> cool<00:02:40.030> I<00:02:40.930> guess<00:02:41.470> with<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:41.800> NFL

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
is pretty cool I guess with the NFL

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:49.440 
is pretty cool I guess with the NFL
draft<00:02:42.400> coming<00:02:42.580> up<00:02:42.730> it's<00:02:42.850> appropriate<00:02:48.450> don't

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
draft coming up it's appropriate don't
