00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:13.839
 0 2 ps3 Technology was leaking big step to a new one 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:15.069
 Plaintiff with me 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:18.949
 here I have chosen a case on the map Anja Pärson 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.160
 but I did not think that you have to comment alone 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.519
 but I have a very, very 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.960
 known that is the trouble with me Stecher 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.349
 Cirrus people I'm shortened because one or the other may like me 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.239
 me out like that 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.300
 OT GM Place on with UCB 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.300
 and 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.610
 x2 miss the Flesh Nachterstedt 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.360
 who can easily century percent before the duty is there there is 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.690
 strange further 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.010
 parried not been written could have been a good match 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.470
 what can do and have 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.050
 more talked about and 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.370
 Years ago, especially since one had come and dreamed one time that the Werra 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.750
 chosen around 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.160
 old yes also a bit up to date the PSN Sylt Downline the theme the monster 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.030
 chooses it as it still was 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.899
 but that is still up to date 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.530
 he remains committed 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.670
 Son Klein comparison between percent 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.490
 online services on PSN and online services on Xbox Live 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.540
 Jahns interesting thing so a little bit victorious hurt 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.040
 I'm not an Erich Moosmann impression of the ps3 Forster I think 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.790
 I had the Xbox Century MA I have the man still at the start 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.210
 unfair 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.850
 and there you can stop 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.350
 explained by but you know what he had yes 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.939
 around the course and I had a little over in advance 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:42.940
 to chat 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.330
 so you can put the team on percent the general line if you have the Xbox 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.690
 starts 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.020
 and also the 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.930
 4 3 then it starts 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.020
 In comparison, even a little bit differently designed the Xbox is HIV 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.229
 top and good 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.280
 was once 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.110
 in the ps3 synonymous something like tell me now 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.159
 Pictures or something would have the counter 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.740
 something like a gold digger but in general it is a bit the 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.509
 Plus designed as you said 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.169
 in comparison and 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:16.909
 it is so that the Xbox the little bit what costs alone but Chris was that yes 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:21.489
 the club also your opinion are promised who so I find this 60 Euro me 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.669
 In the beginning, I've always cursed for percent of it, something like that 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:30.299
 but in the end, silly SUT has the tides shown 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.629
 maybe that makes more sense who to invest 60 euros a year for the 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.589
 online service and making sure that their students also tell you 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:42.689
 seen at the Xbox percent demos ready to go crackpond seen 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.810
 You had so many choices if we had an offer 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:50.139
 and that's not the case with the PlayStation 3 so for those who 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.299
 Blackbox dry 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.049
 since we're on the PlayStation 3 I'm in the game with me on goal comes to the 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.469
 Example nothing 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:59.659
 or just extension or what's in there where you stop 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.099
 Now our records can it comes to the Xbox com they conjure up 60 percent 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.620
 it's the whole thing 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.249
 that he is almost in all play so I have now also works around where 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:11.900
 Modern Warfare 2 at the start 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.640
 It is also in the juniors before what Dorn benefits so everything under 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.149
 concert 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:18.439
 around 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.159
 It is also so I have now on the direct comparison of Anna so it is 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.769
 just like the demos as you said that likes to have normal 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.999
 chewing German account on the Xbox down Uster 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:32.229
 among Christians, each one is really made up of being Christian 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:34.139
 demotivated Goerges and 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.359
 Do not worry about her not finding the CAS 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.219
 and it's also like that if you are allowed to do a bit of research 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:41.709
 also looked around 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.549
 For example, on eBay, the CEEC has been transporting for twelve months for 35 euros 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.340
 and also the 60 euros a year if you are a bit recalculated are the 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.529
 five euros a month and I think that's for every gambler 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.539
 first finds the insured of Filth Vollbrecht 

00:03:57.539 --> 00:04:01.929
 this is said to be the colorful patterns at the beginning of the year but Walter concludes 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:04.399
 Kunz cheaper three months costs 

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:07.429
 20 Euros I think so Wars rock-liner 

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:09.079
 but that is yes 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:14.619
 it was still agreed Klacks and because you forget just Professor barefoot 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:16.379
 play and 

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:18.639
 he is also what we especially at 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.069
 in Black Ops he's noticed with two of ours 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:24.150
 the host Miko right on the ps3 he is mostly like that 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.060
 Walls of comparison, the game finally the ass and what noticeable 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.699
 suffered because 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.129
 most of the time it breaks off and on the Xbox is a bissl from Elten 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:35.370
 Replacement players aborts 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.750
 m collapsed on and on, except for Kasab, for example 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.819
 I was free for everyone 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.689
 solves 25 to only unfortunately all opponents have gone out that of course no 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:48.840
 Chance though 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.790
 so normally it is not that i am i got myself at the 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.790
 Break selection and enter the selection by standing up for the less 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.060
 yes it also has on the place is so amazing have 50 000 lines 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:02.779
 my PlayStation to middle cable connection 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:08.150
 Although connected makes up to 50 percent with the places quickly showed and bus 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.180
 20 or 7 that's 20 thousand 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.449
 and 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:14.900
 but 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.749
 I have the open kind 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:20.939
 From time to cheap telgte except Berau bishopric also full house with Brecht 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:23.080
 then would not have to comfort so far 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.680
 to be introduced even though I actually just flew around at the same time 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.479
 Search made but only German Buyten by 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.930
 yes, I can easily test a "medium" 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.710
 that is dramatic 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.820
 what you might say otherwise the 60 euros in itself that's finally 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:42.940
 sometimes the reason why most even pay one percent and so on 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.870
 the heart is sneaking 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.719
 It sounds a bit like something when you talk about it 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:51.660
 the big number first at the beginning Körting 60 euros firmly 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.770
 but when you really think about it and you look at the individual 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.569
 Temporarily is not much either 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:00.119
 wild as I said it is 

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:03.529
 it can be one she can actually afford and everyone 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:04.699
 for this custom 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:08.860
 that's just really cup alternatives Dirk Gemeinder wanted to buy 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:09.680
 then this one 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.430
 The pressure is more too dry because he thinks he paid for what he paid 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.400
 had to play the mothers no loss but for that it is already packed 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.849
 known board 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:23.259
 Nagler introduces a sitter yes you have to do it because you pay for it 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:23.800
 has Sulz 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.289
 do not be on 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:32.539
 yes so it's time in general our opinion is that's what I am there too me 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:35.650
 Now without paying for it, we now want the PSN itself 

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:37.460
 bad talk or so Walser 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.550
 it does not like it now or so it's just something like that 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.100
 small comparison Hundefell expression remains the same 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.000
 still often 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.099
 Mattresses of the press lesson 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:49.930
 yes, that is not even a gram of fat to change or something 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.969
 I just had the direct comparison in front 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:57.979
 and he's about to pass the gameplay 40, which will say goodbye 

00:06:57.979 --> 00:06:59.830
 Mayer also tells us stopwatch 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.870
 Percent on so 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.850
 Thanks a lot so that we could say here and say what that is 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.520
 reported to me is called do not 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.569
 If you are interested in more money, it will probably be competition on the list 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:13.339
 look 

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:15.330
 Blanche com would be down below 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.180
 maybe not at all, of course, with you again 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.849
 A lot of fun and the WEEK MIRROR attention formation us 

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:23.810
 he thank you could call now
