that we've been challenged to look at

than just building the next building the

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.459 
than just building the next building the
way<00:00:36.610> we<00:00:36.760> built<00:00:36.940> the<00:00:37.030> last<00:00:37.239> one<00:00:37.510> to<00:00:37.690> look<00:00:38.170> at<00:00:38.350> it

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
way we built the last one to look at it

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:39.689 
way we built the last one to look at it
and<00:00:38.590> say<00:00:38.710> is<00:00:38.829> there<00:00:38.949> a<00:00:38.980> way<00:00:39.280> that<00:00:39.309> we<00:00:39.489> can

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
and say is there a way that we can

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.959 
and say is there a way that we can
improve<00:00:39.940> on<00:00:40.120> that<00:00:40.149> process<00:00:41.429> we<00:00:42.429> ship<00:00:42.609> cards

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
improve on that process we ship cards

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:44.910 
improve on that process we ship cards
from<00:00:43.089> here<00:00:43.269> as<00:00:43.359> far<00:00:43.570> east<00:00:43.600> as<00:00:43.929> Cincinnati<00:00:44.410> on

from here as far east as Cincinnati on
an<00:00:45.309> average<00:00:45.460> day<00:00:45.670> here<00:00:46.210> we're<00:00:46.329> going<00:00:46.420> to<00:00:46.510> do

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
an average day here we're going to do

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.150 
an average day here we're going to do
about<00:00:46.660> a<00:00:47.019> thousand<00:00:47.739> eighty<00:00:48.129> vehicles<00:00:48.760> per<00:00:48.940> day

about a thousand eighty vehicles per day

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.650 
about a thousand eighty vehicles per day
we<00:00:51.160> built<00:00:51.429> this<00:00:51.699> as<00:00:51.999> a<00:00:52.030> green<00:00:52.420> building

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
we built this as a green building

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.630 
we built this as a green building
because<00:00:53.320> we<00:00:53.589> thought<00:00:53.769> we<00:00:53.949> can<00:00:54.070> incorporate<00:00:54.370> a

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
because we thought we can incorporate a

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.060 
because we thought we can incorporate a
lot<00:00:54.850> of<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.149> concepts<00:00:55.809> into<00:00:56.710> a<00:00:56.739> production

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
lot of the concepts into a production

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.180 
lot of the concepts into a production
facility<00:00:57.659> and<00:00:58.659> it<00:00:58.960> was<00:00:59.109> a<00:00:59.140> chance<00:00:59.499> to<00:00:59.739> look<00:00:59.920> at

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
facility and it was a chance to look at

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.630 
facility and it was a chance to look at
what<00:01:00.670> made<00:01:00.909> sense<00:01:01.769> part<00:01:02.769> of<00:01:02.890> Toyotas<00:01:03.309> thing<00:01:03.489> is

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
what made sense part of Toyotas thing is

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.700 
what made sense part of Toyotas thing is
continual<00:01:04.180> improvement<00:01:04.690> or<00:01:04.780> Kaizen<00:01:05.230> we're

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
continual improvement or Kaizen we're

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.860 
continual improvement or Kaizen we're
always<00:01:05.920> looking<00:01:06.280> for<00:01:06.730> ways<00:01:06.760> to<00:01:06.940> save<00:01:07.240> energy

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
always looking for ways to save energy

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.480 
always looking for ways to save energy
materials<00:01:08.710> resources<00:01:09.540> time<00:01:10.540> labor<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:12.100> it's

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
materials resources time labor so it's

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.420 
materials resources time labor so it's
all<00:01:12.640> part<00:01:12.880> of<00:01:13.000> our<00:01:13.149> core<00:01:13.450> philosophy<00:01:14.310> when<00:01:15.310> the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
all part of our core philosophy when the

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.609 
all part of our core philosophy when the
water<00:01:15.640> runs<00:01:16.060> off<00:01:16.360> bar<00:01:16.689> pavement<00:01:17.170> and<00:01:17.229> asphalt

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
water runs off bar pavement and asphalt

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.130 
water runs off bar pavement and asphalt
it<00:01:18.280> drains<00:01:18.729> into<00:01:18.939> our<00:01:19.119> stormwater<00:01:19.750> system

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
it drains into our stormwater system

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.499 
it drains into our stormwater system
where<00:01:20.740> it<00:01:20.829> goes<00:01:20.950> through<00:01:21.250> an<00:01:21.340> oil<00:01:21.640> filter<00:01:21.850> from

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
where it goes through an oil filter from

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.780 
where it goes through an oil filter from
there<00:01:22.719> it<00:01:22.840> drains<00:01:23.170> into<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.530> bios<00:01:23.740> whale<00:01:24.040> so

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
there it drains into the bios whale so

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.249 
there it drains into the bios whale so
when<00:01:24.939> it<00:01:25.030> goes<00:01:25.180> out<00:01:25.329> into<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.689> lamb<00:01:25.960> River

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
when it goes out into the lamb River

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.350 
when it goes out into the lamb River
it's<00:01:26.469> clean<00:01:26.770> cool<00:01:27.610> and<00:01:27.880> clear<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.909> facility

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
it's clean cool and clear the facility

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.969 
it's clean cool and clear the facility
recycled<00:01:31.899> ninety-six<00:01:32.439> percent<00:01:32.590> of<00:01:32.890> its

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
recycled ninety-six percent of its

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.950 
recycled ninety-six percent of its
materials<00:01:33.490> last<00:01:33.670> year<00:01:34.000> we<00:01:34.450> only<00:01:34.600> had<00:01:34.780> an

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
materials last year we only had an

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.630 
materials last year we only had an
average<00:01:35.140> of<00:01:35.409> six<00:01:35.680> ounces<00:01:36.070> of<00:01:36.219> waste<00:01:36.460> to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
average of six ounces of waste to

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.330 
average of six ounces of waste to
landfill<00:01:37.090> per<00:01:37.360> vehicle<00:01:37.840> so<00:01:38.110> that's<00:01:39.009> about<00:01:39.130> the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
landfill per vehicle so that's about the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.110 
landfill per vehicle so that's about the
size<00:01:39.490> for<00:01:39.700> hershey<00:01:39.939> bar

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
size for hershey bar

the<00:01:41.480> phrase<00:01:41.780> you<00:01:41.990> hear<00:01:42.020> from<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.800> Japanese

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
the phrase you hear from the Japanese

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.120 
the phrase you hear from the Japanese
TPS<00:01:44.120> experts<00:01:44.660> is<00:01:44.870> there's<00:01:45.410> never<00:01:45.680> a<00:01:45.770> best

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
TPS experts is there's never a best

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.430 
TPS experts is there's never a best
there's<00:01:46.550> always<00:01:46.850> a<00:01:46.880> better

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
there's always a better

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.320 
there's always a better
and<00:01:48.560> so<00:01:49.340> you're<00:01:49.520> always<00:01:49.850> looking<00:01:50.180> for

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
and so you're always looking for

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.850 
and so you're always looking for
something<00:01:50.510> better

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.920 

you
