00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 Talking about blood in the sun as you said 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.820
 I dropped hands yesterday was good 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.309
 friends and was the first interview 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.349
 year since leaving selection 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.450
 Brazilian yesterday in the program 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.810
 celebrated ten years of good friends 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.750
 Congratulations to all of the program staff . 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.460
 by the appeal made and the hand menezes had 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.289
 a certain blood in the zio to at least 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.180
 speaking of his work that is my 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.130
 interpretation one wants to hear after your 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.029
 on the subject 10 that said hand 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.130
 menezes 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.489
 Brazil needs to be back again. 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:40.879
 protagonist and humans and remember that 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:43.890
 but talking is said and I keep thinking 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.190
 so I worked for two and a half years 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.430
 in this direction 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:54.030
 during some passages he was warned 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.070
 by friends that I should not perhaps 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.070
 keep chasing this same 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.230
 Riding all the risks you want to follow 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.850
 in this direction and tried to do this until 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.439
 while I was at the helm of the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.630
 Brazilian selection what you have found 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.060
 Football played in Brazil 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.600
 seems to me that this is the great dilemma 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.700
 We live and find a point of 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.000
 balance between playing football 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.150
 here traditionally 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.360
 has become the biggest winner of all 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.360
 the soccer cups that one throws out there 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.950
 when the coach of the Brazilian national team 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.600
 I often talked to Carlos 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.850
 alberto vine because I admire and 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.310
 I respect, in particular, your 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.250
 professional posture when not in the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.630
 the selection and others are 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.960
 respect and always come to aa 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.369
 conclusion that we are missing 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.110
 The intensity of the game has the author Miguel 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.310
 taking on this on the issue of 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.110
 neymar 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.700
 both ronaldo and the vine thinks 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.110
 He should have gone before I wanted. 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.430
 Know your opinion but it 's Brazil is half 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.200
 funny, huh? 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.890
 When you see a little 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.149
 before the speakers take to 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.209
 damn right 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.180
 suffered I was called a Corinthian I 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.519
 it was against the saints 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.989
 even the king said that I did not like the 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.609
 Saints who wanted to see the neymar outside 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.010
 those things all 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:23.709
 when you have challenges to be 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.769
 achieved you work to overcome 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.269
 these challenges and works every day they 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.519
 are there you need to solve the 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.469
 problems within the game and when they 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.650
 they no longer exist, you do not 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:37.389
 works the same way is simple and the 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.959
 challenges it does not exist 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:41.379
 more 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.209
 he was in the class but I 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.810
 I love to chat with menezes 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.400
 about soccer 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.870
 I respect the work of the hand 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.310
 really same 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.430
 but just look at an opinion on this 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.319
 Subject is a prosecutor in Brazil 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.959
 just be out of the selection 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.549
 brazil was hand menezes will leave 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.840
 Brazilian team for all 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.200
 children who were made to work 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.700
 They had disappeared and suddenly 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.069
 it looks like the hand selection was 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.349
 thus bombing the 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:12.700
 on which people relied 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:14.200
 to defend the truth is good to leave 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.090
 of course I found it absolutely 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.349
 Inopportune the moment when the selection 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.989
 Brazilian also changed command 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.729
 I think it's strange that 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.379
 many people who were very critical 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:25.090
 the work of the hand has defended the 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.729
 continuity based on results 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.409
 against unimpressive selections where 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:31.030
 What day did you go to work today? 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.739
 in the year and who were criticizing 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.629
 were the last two games that 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.780
 he did see that he did at the front of the 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:40.449
 selection is now I think he keeps 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.799
 showed you can see a 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:44.229
 resentment of who had the job 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:47.889
 interrupted when he would enter a straight 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:51.220
 end but did it with the usual elegance 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:52.780
 what worried me the most yesterday 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.239
 moment that established a right 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.340
 debate between manuel parreira was 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.590
 following the clearly human during 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.569
 his passage through the Brazilian national team 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.759
 his agenda was like one of 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.349
 improve play dynamics 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:06.849
 of the Brazilian team this intensity 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.709
 that he has always shown 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.079
 concern and may have been one of the 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.509
 first voices to say that here we are 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.909
 played another game when you watched 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:18.459
 soccer in mexico in brazil and soccer 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:20.049
 that plays in europe and a speech 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.579
 it has always been based on what we 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.940
 improve our intensity 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.980
 already the vine defends the line that 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.470
 we have to try to impose our 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.150
 Shiloh our way of playing I do not 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.830
 I want to get into the discussion of who is 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.960
 sure of the best way for the 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.740
 Brazilian soccer that I want to show 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:41.080
 is that we have gone from a mentality to 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.970
 a mentality b posed there 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.610
 apparently quite another 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.980
 end in final preparation for straight 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.430
 two competitions is done with whom who 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:54.160
 going through this process will suffer no 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.890
 be the good hand or the bad be the felipe 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.640
 who took good or bad the spectacular in the 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.080
 his work 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.790
 there will be suffering will not 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.350
 happen overnight and we 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.550
 is on the eve of a competition with 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.540
 a series of questions on the 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.130
 Brazilian Team 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.450
 although I think in the end will try 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.480
 seek balance try to seek a 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.650
 way that our way of playing 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.120
 can you impose that intensity 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.640
 European thing that is not happening 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.890
 today because it is now agreed that 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.100
 Brazil, the bad coach is just in the 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.510
 Brazilian team because it will be 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.240
 slaughtered from the moment when 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:30.900
 assume the selection is exactly the virtual 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.900
 Your president has already become a target.
