00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.649
 if you just for a second get out 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.750
 Creative mode and he gives you the most 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.879
 don't grieve but he hits very hard and 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.559
 you know what the most insulting thing is that they usually 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.399
 there are such big ones 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.260
 in flocks of 15 and then there are 20 and if 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.000
 suddenly build a house day be cute 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.340
 cottages on the beach 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.940
 meet him like that guy or hear him 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.240
 this sound 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.520
 run-run and don't turn around because 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.740
 that they will beat you to death now we 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.750
 we will be in creative mode and that is, we remove 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.210
 and as you can see they start attacking you 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.060
 this guy's one blow gives you one 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.500
 heart and it's damn dangerous how 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.119
 see they all start at once you 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.430
 attacking killing them is difficult but possible 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.409
 let's try to do it all the same 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.170
 of two from practical three hits 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.299
 diamond about what he they are killed and of them 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.729
 possesses that mucus right and yet 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.540
 some kind of dye is like a thread 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.060
 6 species 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.009
 here they were still one no all six 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.780
 species more bad was one of them 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.450
 1 dye does not fall out even one 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.990
 against measles dye and 1 mucus from which 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.700
 you can 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.890
 here's a piston to do some 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.990
 door or something else retractable beautiful 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.119
 they know a very nasty sound when 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.009
 death some sound from the nineties 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.310
 maybe open and dye you will have 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.680
 Now 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.320
 oh so much dye can go and 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.420
 dye dye wool and not 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.460
 only six but someone else 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.659
 Well, you can get the mucus 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.299
 spend on some interesting 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.429
 pistons and make them very cool 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.289
 the mechanism in general, here are these guys you 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.060
 you can find your world and you know what 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.110

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.360
 I can see that I will enter the grass 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.610
 honestly it pissed me off when i tried 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.290
 build with them anything and they 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.299
 jump out of nowhere and start 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.030
 take it really hurt and this 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.160
 frankly all that is in it again, and 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.720
