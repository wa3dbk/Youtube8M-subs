area<00:04:34.770> here<00:04:35.130> I<00:04:35.280> guess<00:04:36.169> this<00:04:37.169> stuff<00:04:37.620> is<00:04:37.830> nasty

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
area here I guess this stuff is nasty

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.719 
area here I guess this stuff is nasty
really<00:04:39.750> nasty<00:04:40.169> stuff<00:04:40.199> so<00:04:40.680> this<00:04:40.830> is<00:04:41.009> going<00:04:41.639> to

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
really nasty stuff so this is going to

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:50.510 
really nasty stuff so this is going to
be<00:04:41.880> x<00:04:42.090> x<00:04:42.830> and<00:04:43.830> then<00:04:44.750> hopefully<00:04:46.250> you<00:04:47.250> know<00:04:49.520> what

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
be x x and then hopefully you know what

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.830 
be x x and then hopefully you know what
i<00:04:50.550> was<00:04:50.669> going<00:04:50.789> to<00:04:50.880> show<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:51.090> but<00:04:51.630> it<00:04:51.750> wasn't

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
i was going to show you but it wasn't

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.189 
i was going to show you but it wasn't
quick<00:04:52.880> so<00:04:53.880> that's<00:04:54.090> it<00:04:54.270> so<00:04:54.599> this<00:04:54.750> is<00:04:54.780> all<00:04:55.020> going

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
quick so that's it so this is all going

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.260 
quick so that's it so this is all going
to<00:04:55.259> be<00:04:55.319> gone<00:04:55.530> this<00:04:56.099> is<00:04:56.250> going<00:04:56.460> to<00:04:56.520> be<00:04:56.580> gone<00:04:56.729> this

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
to be gone this is going to be gone this

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.499 
to be gone this is going to be gone this
is<00:04:57.330> going<00:04:57.569> to<00:04:57.659> be<00:04:57.720> gone<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:58.380> hopefully<00:04:59.509> these

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509 
is going to be gone and hopefully these

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:03.309 
is going to be gone and hopefully these
will<00:05:00.569> be<00:05:01.050> up<00:05:01.229> here<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:02.130> whatever<00:05:02.610> her<00:05:02.970> but

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:03.319 
will be up here and whatever her but

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:08.379 
will be up here and whatever her but
that's<00:05:04.319> basically<00:05:04.620> it<00:05:05.039> you<00:05:05.580> know<00:05:06.319> just<00:05:07.319> I

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
that's basically it you know just I

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.600 
that's basically it you know just I
guess<00:05:09.389> to<00:05:09.599> give<00:05:09.720> you<00:05:10.190> someone<00:05:11.190> says<00:05:11.400> looks

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
guess to give you someone says looks

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.230 
guess to give you someone says looks
like<00:05:11.729> a<00:05:11.759> mouth<00:05:12.030> to<00:05:12.389> eyes<00:05:12.569> and<00:05:13.610> nose<00:05:14.610> bridge<00:05:15.120> of

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
like a mouth to eyes and nose bridge of

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.249 
like a mouth to eyes and nose bridge of
the<00:05:15.330> nose<00:05:15.360> and<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:15.930> mountain<00:05:16.470> or<00:05:16.800> are<00:05:17.280> you

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
the nose and the mountain or are you

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:23.270 
the nose and the mountain or are you
anyway<00:05:19.259> so<00:05:20.159> that's<00:05:20.280> that<00:05:21.590> on<00:05:22.590> any<00:05:22.800> of<00:05:22.979> us<00:05:23.130> I

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
anyway so that's that on any of us I

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.279 
anyway so that's that on any of us I
guess<00:05:23.340> you<00:05:23.580> really<00:05:23.759> wouldn't<00:05:24.030> notice<00:05:24.289> because

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
guess you really wouldn't notice because

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.999 
guess you really wouldn't notice because
we<00:05:25.440> hide<00:05:25.680> it<00:05:25.860> very<00:05:25.889> well<00:05:27.530> partly<00:05:28.530> because<00:05:28.740> we

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
we hide it very well partly because we

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:33.310 
we hide it very well partly because we
used<00:05:29.250> to<00:05:29.400> it<00:05:29.520> and<00:05:30.380> another<00:05:31.380> part<00:05:31.620> is<00:05:31.889> because

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
used to it and another part is because

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.350 
used to it and another part is because
you<00:05:34.320> kind<00:05:34.560> of<00:05:34.620> wet<00:05:34.770> bag<00:05:35.009> here<00:05:35.190> clothes<00:05:35.550> I'm

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
you kind of wet bag here clothes I'm

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.959 
you kind of wet bag here clothes I'm
paying<00:05:37.169> this<00:05:37.320> down<00:05:37.560> a<00:05:37.590> little<00:05:37.770> bit<00:05:39.530> and<00:05:40.969> focus

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:41.969 
paying this down a little bit and focus

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.450 
paying this down a little bit and focus
good<00:05:42.449> so<00:05:43.199> that's<00:05:43.409> it<00:05:43.590> that's<00:05:43.800> not<00:05:44.070> before<00:05:44.219> us

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
good so that's it that's not before us

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.709 
good so that's it that's not before us
and<00:05:44.900> um<00:05:45.900> I<00:05:46.280> guess<00:05:47.280> seven<00:05:48.000> hours<00:05:48.449> eight<00:05:48.690> hours

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:48.719 
and um I guess seven hours eight hours

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:51.260 
and um I guess seven hours eight hours
from<00:05:49.139> now<00:05:49.349> I'll<00:05:49.620> be<00:05:49.650> getting<00:05:50.400> it<00:05:50.639> removed<00:05:50.789> I

from now I'll be getting it removed I

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.969 
from now I'll be getting it removed I

will my next video part of this video
you'll<00:06:46.229> see<00:06:46.319> me<00:06:46.590> in<00:06:46.620> the<00:06:46.770> hospital<00:06:46.800> just

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:47.219 
you'll see me in the hospital just

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:50.089 
you'll see me in the hospital just
waking<00:06:47.759> up<00:06:47.849> from<00:06:48.319> whatever<00:06:49.319> or<00:06:49.740> just<00:06:49.949> going

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:50.099 
waking up from whatever or just going

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:51.950 
waking up from whatever or just going
into<00:06:50.340> it<00:06:50.580> I<00:06:50.669> don't<00:06:50.819> know<00:06:50.849> what<00:06:51.120> probably<00:06:51.750> just

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
into it I don't know what probably just

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.450 
into it I don't know what probably just
waking<00:06:52.349> up<00:06:52.469> and<00:06:52.680> getting<00:06:52.770> out<00:06:53.039> of<00:06:53.189> anesthesia

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 
waking up and getting out of anesthesia

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.580 
waking up and getting out of anesthesia
so<00:06:54.060> that<00:06:54.599> will<00:06:54.779> be<00:06:54.900> the<00:06:54.990> next<00:06:55.110> part<00:06:55.439> of<00:06:55.469> the

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
so that will be the next part of the

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.610 
so that will be the next part of the
video<00:06:55.680> so<00:06:56.990> hopefully<00:06:57.990> everything<00:06:58.199> will<00:06:58.409> work

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620 
video so hopefully everything will work

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.240 
video so hopefully everything will work
out<00:06:58.800> and<00:06:59.039> be<00:06:59.279> fine<00:06:59.520> and<00:06:59.819> I'll<00:07:00.919> explain<00:07:01.919> to<00:07:02.129> you
