00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
Pentatonix I'm going to use pull-ups to

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.769 
Pentatonix I'm going to use pull-ups to
procreate<00:00:23.110> this<00:00:23.320> fast<00:00:23.619> lick<00:00:24.609> and<00:00:24.910> this<00:00:25.630> is

check<00:00:29.890> them<00:00:29.949> out<00:00:30.070> and<00:00:30.990> I'm<00:00:31.990> using<00:00:32.379> a<00:00:32.710> hell

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
check them out and I'm using a hell

tars<00:00:37.510> and<00:00:37.780> I'm<00:00:37.930> using<00:00:38.140> a<00:00:38.440> line<00:00:39.190> six<00:00:39.550> HD<00:00:39.970> 500<00:00:40.780> and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
tars and I'm using a line six HD 500 and

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.280 
tars and I'm using a line six HD 500 and
that<00:00:41.559> amp<00:00:41.799> model<00:00:42.159> is<00:00:42.280> a<00:00:42.309> J<00:00:42.640> 45<00:00:43.150> and<00:00:43.930> I<00:00:43.989> have<00:00:44.110> also

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
that amp model is a J 45 and I have also

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.180 
that amp model is a J 45 and I have also
added<00:00:44.589> a<00:00:44.920> overdrive<00:00:45.850> or<00:00:46.530> two<00:00:47.530> drive<00:00:47.799> rather<00:00:48.040> I

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
added a overdrive or two drive rather I

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.810 
added a overdrive or two drive rather I
think<00:00:48.400> it<00:00:48.489> is<00:00:48.580> to<00:00:49.089> drive<00:00:50.460> stompbox<00:00:51.460> model<00:00:51.729> in

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
think it is to drive stompbox model in

00:00:51.820 --> 00:01:03.509 
think it is to drive stompbox model in
it<00:00:51.970> so<00:00:52.900> if<00:00:53.470> you're<00:00:53.619> playing<00:00:53.830> it<00:00:54.040> one<00:00:54.280> more<00:00:54.400> time

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:15.720 

and<00:01:04.519> a<00:01:04.610> slower<00:01:04.850> tempo

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.710 

so<00:01:16.730> as<00:01:16.820> you<00:01:16.940> can<00:01:17.030> see<00:01:17.240> it's<00:01:17.450> really<00:01:17.690> a

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
so as you can see it's really a

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.430 
so as you can see it's really a
repetitive<00:01:18.200> pattern<00:01:18.650> I'm<00:01:19.040> using<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:19.820> typical

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
repetitive pattern I'm using the typical

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.520 
repetitive pattern I'm using the typical
the<00:01:21.440> regular<00:01:21.950> I<00:01:22.220> should<00:01:22.520> say<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:22.910> pentatonic

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
the regular I should say the pentatonic

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.020 
the regular I should say the pentatonic
scale<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:24.800> this<00:01:24.920> is<00:01:25.100> in<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.310> first<00:01:25.550> position

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
scale and this is in the first position

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:33.070 
scale and this is in the first position
and<00:01:31.030> you<00:01:32.030> probably<00:01:32.240> know<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.660> one<00:01:32.930> I'm

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
and you probably know that one I'm

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.530 
and you probably know that one I'm
assuming<00:01:33.650> so<00:01:33.920> so<00:01:34.700> let's<00:01:34.880> take<00:01:35.030> a<00:01:35.060> closer<00:01:35.330> look

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
assuming so so let's take a closer look

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.910 
assuming so so let's take a closer look
on<00:01:35.660> the<00:01:35.720> fretboard<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.200> I<00:01:36.290> can<00:01:36.440> explain<00:01:36.740> more

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
on the fretboard and I can explain more

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.460 
on the fretboard and I can explain more
in<00:01:37.130> detail<00:01:37.190> how<00:01:37.910> I<00:01:37.940> play<00:01:38.180> this<00:01:38.240> so<00:01:39.140> here<00:01:39.320> it<00:01:39.380> is

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
in detail how I play this so here it is

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:53.740 
in detail how I play this so here it is
slowly

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.260 

you

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.990 

and<00:01:56.390> as<00:01:57.170> you<00:01:57.290> can<00:01:57.380> see<00:01:57.439> I'm<00:01:57.860> using<00:01:58.100> hammer-ons

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
and as you can see I'm using hammer-ons

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.210 
and as you can see I'm using hammer-ons
and<00:01:59.299> pull-offs<00:01:59.420> a<00:02:00.170> lot<00:02:00.439> here<00:02:00.680> I'm<00:02:00.770> not<00:02:00.920> using

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
and pull-offs a lot here I'm not using

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.969 
and pull-offs a lot here I'm not using
alternate<00:02:01.790> picking<00:02:01.869> so<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.560> first<00:02:03.830> two<00:02:03.979> notes

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
alternate picking so the first two notes

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.859 
alternate picking so the first two notes
this<00:02:06.979> is<00:02:07.040> on<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.520> DS<00:02:07.729> bouncer<00:02:08.360> on<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.660> B

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
this is on the DS bouncer on the B

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.699 
this is on the DS bouncer on the B
string<00:02:10.690> so<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.780> second<00:02:12.050> note<00:02:12.140> is<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.350> hammer<00:02:12.560> on

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
string so the second note is a hammer on

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.340 
string so the second note is a hammer on
and<00:02:12.920> then<00:02:13.930> switching<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.200> E<00:02:15.290> string<00:02:17.350> back

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
and then switching to the E string back

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.270 
and then switching to the E string back
to<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.709> B<00:02:18.980> string<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:20.590> then<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.620> pull<00:02:21.890> off<00:02:22.040> on

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
to the B string and then a pull off on

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.759 
to the B string and then a pull off on
the<00:02:22.340> E<00:02:22.550> string<00:02:22.670> up<00:02:23.030> here<00:02:25.660> B<00:02:26.660> string<00:02:27.040> pull<00:02:28.040> off

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
the E string up here B string pull off

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.120 
the E string up here B string pull off
back<00:02:30.769> up<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.100> E<00:02:31.130> string<00:02:32.470> B<00:02:33.470> string<00:02:33.500> pull<00:02:34.010> off

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
back up to E string B string pull off

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.630 
back up to E string B string pull off
again

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.320 

now<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.670> g<00:02:37.970> string<00:02:39.160> back<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.459> B<00:02:40.610> string<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.030> pull

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
now a g string back to B string and pull

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.610 
now a g string back to B string and pull
off<00:02:41.450> again<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:44.090> g<00:02:44.780> string<00:02:45.019> and<00:02:45.049> pull<00:02:45.290> off<00:02:45.410> from

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
off again and g string and pull off from

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.940 
off again and g string and pull off from
here<00:02:47.590> then<00:02:48.590> up<00:02:48.739> to<00:02:48.950> B<00:02:49.250> string<00:02:49.549> again<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:51.830> then

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
here then up to B string again and then

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.140 
here then up to B string again and then
pull<00:02:52.100> off<00:02:52.190> on<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.459> g<00:02:52.610> string<00:02:52.640> from<00:02:53.060> here<00:02:55.150> D

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
pull off on the g string from here D

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.949 
pull off on the g string from here D
string<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:57.940> then<00:02:58.940> up<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.390> g<00:02:59.540> string<00:02:59.810> on<00:02:59.900> the

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
string and then up the g string on the

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.590 
string and then up the g string on the
same<00:03:00.140> fret<00:03:00.350> then<00:03:00.560> I<00:03:00.590> pull<00:03:00.769> off<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:04.060> then<00:03:05.060> D

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
same fret then I pull off and then D

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.240 
same fret then I pull off and then D
string<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:07.310> then<00:03:07.459> g<00:03:07.640> string<00:03:08.769> we<00:03:09.769> see<00:03:10.010> it's

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
string and then g string we see it's

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.729 
string and then g string we see it's
it's<00:03:10.940> very<00:03:11.120> it's<00:03:11.540> kind<00:03:12.230> of<00:03:12.260> a<00:03:12.350> repetitive

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
it's very it's kind of a repetitive

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.040 
it's very it's kind of a repetitive
pattern

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.059 

so<00:03:18.050> there's<00:03:18.230> there's<00:03:18.710> four<00:03:18.950> nodes<00:03:19.130> 1<00:03:19.670> 2<00:03:20.170> 3<00:03:21.170> 4

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
so there's there's four nodes 1 2 3 4

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.580 
so there's there's four nodes 1 2 3 4
and<00:03:22.400> then<00:03:22.459> starting<00:03:22.940> over<00:03:23.120> from<00:03:23.330> this<00:03:23.660> one<00:03:23.870> the

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
and then starting over from this one the

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.320 
and then starting over from this one the
second<00:03:24.980> node<00:03:25.130> I<00:03:25.280> previously<00:03:25.520> played<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.209> play

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
second node I previously played and play

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.930 
second node I previously played and play
four<00:03:26.600> notes<00:03:27.550> one<00:03:29.050> three<00:03:30.280> and<00:03:31.280> then<00:03:31.490> back<00:03:31.670> to

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
four notes one three and then back to

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.199 
four notes one three and then back to
the<00:03:32.060> second<00:03:32.720> one<00:03:32.840> all<00:03:33.050> those<00:03:33.670> previously<00:03:34.670> for

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
the second one all those previously for

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.960 
the second one all those previously for
I've<00:03:35.390> just<00:03:35.660> played<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.110> do<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.530> same<00:03:36.709> thing

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.240 

and<00:03:40.970> again

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.480 

mmm

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.010 

we're<00:03:48.490> just<00:03:48.610> ending<00:03:48.940> with<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.060> last<00:03:49.690> little

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
we're just ending with that last little

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.880 
we're just ending with that last little
phrase<00:03:51.960> and<00:03:52.960> this<00:03:53.110> is<00:03:53.260> something<00:03:53.590> that<00:03:53.710> you

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
phrase and this is something that you

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.980 
phrase and this is something that you
hear<00:03:54.010> Eric<00:03:54.310> gales<00:03:54.490> do<00:03:54.730> a<00:03:54.760> lot<00:03:55.000> to<00:03:55.210> do<00:03:55.330> you<00:03:55.720> know

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
hear Eric gales do a lot to do you know

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.330 
hear Eric gales do a lot to do you know
play<00:03:56.230> in<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.440> different<00:03:56.740> positions<00:03:57.160> of

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
play in the different positions of

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.700 
play in the different positions of
course<00:03:57.550> but<00:03:57.790> but<00:03:58.270> this<00:03:58.420> one<00:03:58.720> way<00:03:59.200> you<00:03:59.260> can

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
course but but this one way you can

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.950 
course but but this one way you can
practice<00:04:00.580> playing<00:04:00.760> these<00:04:01.090> kind<00:04:01.330> of<00:04:01.420> ideas<00:04:01.780> you

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
practice playing these kind of ideas you

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:15.790 
practice playing these kind of ideas you
can<00:04:02.200> keep<00:04:02.860> going

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.949 

then<00:04:16.459> using<00:04:16.700> all<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.209> notes<00:04:17.390> in<00:04:17.720> this

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
then using all the notes in this

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.870 
then using all the notes in this
position<00:04:18.410> that's<00:04:19.010> kind<00:04:19.220> of<00:04:19.250> a<00:04:19.340> long<00:04:19.489> lake<00:04:19.730> to

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
position that's kind of a long lake to

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.880 
position that's kind of a long lake to
play<00:04:20.030> so<00:04:20.090> we<00:04:20.300> just<00:04:20.540> usually<00:04:21.440> I<00:04:21.470> just<00:04:21.590> use

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
play so we just usually I just use

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.850 
play so we just usually I just use
something<00:04:22.610> that<00:04:22.820> has<00:04:23.390> going<00:04:24.200> from<00:04:24.410> the<00:04:24.530> high<00:04:24.830> E

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
something that has going from the high E

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.590 
something that has going from the high E
string<00:04:24.980> down<00:04:25.430> to<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.700> g<00:04:25.850> string<00:04:26.090> or<00:04:26.240> perhaps

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
string down to the g string or perhaps

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.020 
string down to the g string or perhaps
the<00:04:26.720> D<00:04:26.870> string<00:04:27.080> as<00:04:27.290> it<00:04:27.860> is<00:04:27.980> in<00:04:28.580> this<00:04:28.790> lick

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
the D string as it is in this lick

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:52.330 
the D string as it is in this lick
example

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.400 

now<00:04:52.910> you<00:04:52.970> can<00:04:53.150> of<00:04:53.240> course<00:04:53.479> use<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:53.900> same<00:04:54.110> idea

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
now you can of course use the same idea

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.439 
now you can of course use the same idea
and<00:04:54.590> play<00:04:54.830> somewhere<00:04:55.280> else<00:04:55.310> in<00:04:55.639> the<00:04:55.699> neck<00:04:55.879> just

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
and play somewhere else in the neck just

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:57.490 
and play somewhere else in the neck just
a<00:04:56.599> finger<00:04:56.870> it's<00:04:56.990> going<00:04:57.110> to<00:04:57.169> be<00:04:57.229> a<00:04:57.259> little<00:04:57.379> bit

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
a finger it's going to be a little bit

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.559 
a finger it's going to be a little bit
different<00:04:57.680> if<00:04:58.009> I'm<00:04:58.220> using<00:04:58.400> this<00:04:58.729> position<00:04:59.389> of

00:04:59.559 --> 00:04:59.569 
different if I'm using this position of

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:02.379 
different if I'm using this position of
the<00:04:59.780> of<00:05:00.110> the<00:05:00.530> minor<00:05:01.039> pentatonic<00:05:01.250> scale<00:05:01.909> it

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
the of the minor pentatonic scale it

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:14.029 
the of the minor pentatonic scale it
would<00:05:02.539> be<00:05:02.629> like<00:05:02.750> this

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.249 

but<00:05:15.029> then<00:05:15.180> it<00:05:15.330> gets<00:05:15.419> it<00:05:15.719> gets<00:05:15.779> a<00:05:15.960> little<00:05:16.020> tricky

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
but then it gets it gets a little tricky

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:18.140 
but then it gets it gets a little tricky
with<00:05:16.379> the<00:05:16.439> fingering<00:05:16.800> so<00:05:17.009> I<00:05:17.219> find<00:05:17.580> this<00:05:17.699> one<00:05:17.909> is

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
with the fingering so I find this one is

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.899 
with the fingering so I find this one is
the<00:05:18.389> best<00:05:18.569> one<00:05:18.719> to<00:05:19.020> to<00:05:19.919> use<00:05:20.460> if<00:05:20.639> you<00:05:20.729> want<00:05:20.789> to

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
the best one to to use if you want to

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:22.549 
the best one to to use if you want to
play<00:05:21.150> one<00:05:21.360> of<00:05:21.389> those<00:05:21.539> fast<00:05:21.839> to<00:05:22.110> clash<00:05:22.319> with<00:05:22.469> a

00:05:22.549 --> 00:05:22.559 
play one of those fast to clash with a

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:24.649 
play one of those fast to clash with a
track<00:05:22.740> this<00:05:22.919> one<00:05:23.099> so<00:05:23.999> you<00:05:24.180> guys<00:05:24.270> have<00:05:24.419> to<00:05:24.509> work
