00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:39.889 
button all of your attacks are using the

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:42.580 
button all of your attacks are using the
joystick<00:02:40.159> and<00:02:40.790> your<00:02:41.209> your<00:02:41.840> buttons<00:02:42.200> here<00:02:42.439> to

joystick and your your buttons here to

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.910 
joystick and your your buttons here to
move<00:02:42.769> the<00:02:42.920> character<00:02:43.280> around<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:44.599> it's<00:02:45.349> a<00:02:45.500> it's

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
move the character around so it's a it's

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.479 
move the character around so it's a it's
really<00:02:46.010> really<00:02:46.939> strange<00:02:48.069> I've<00:02:49.069> never<00:02:49.280> played

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
really really strange I've never played

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.399 
really really strange I've never played
this<00:02:49.730> one<00:02:49.909> before<00:02:50.120> so<00:02:50.540> it<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:51.049> be<00:02:51.139> kind<00:02:51.290> of

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
this one before so it to be kind of

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.920 
this one before so it to be kind of
interesting<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:52.099> try<00:02:52.730> out<00:02:53.030> I<00:02:53.329> don't<00:02:53.689> even<00:02:53.780> know

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
interesting to try out I don't even know

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.080 
interesting to try out I don't even know
if<00:02:53.959> I<00:02:54.139> get<00:02:54.200> on<00:02:54.409> with<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.739> or<00:02:54.950> not<00:02:55.129> but<00:02:55.489> as<00:02:55.939> you

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
if I get on with it or not but as you

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.909 
if I get on with it or not but as you
can<00:02:56.209> see<00:02:56.389> here<00:02:56.599> here<00:02:56.750> is<00:02:56.870> different<00:02:57.379> movements

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:57.919 
can see here here is different movements

00:02:57.919 --> 00:02:59.619 
can see here here is different movements
that<00:02:58.040> are<00:02:58.099> controlled<00:02:58.669> by<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.909> joystick<00:02:59.450> and

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
that are controlled by the joystick and

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.569 
that are controlled by the joystick and
everything's<00:03:00.409> backwards<00:03:00.650> so<00:03:01.310> you<00:03:01.400> got<00:03:01.549> the

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
everything's backwards so you got the

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.099 
everything's backwards so you got the
buttons<00:03:01.909> on<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.150> left<00:03:02.180> and<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.599> joystick<00:03:03.019> on

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
buttons on the left and the joystick on

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.979 
buttons on the left and the joystick on
the<00:03:03.230> right<00:03:03.790> but<00:03:04.790> this<00:03:05.329> will<00:03:05.540> be<00:03:05.629> definitely

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
the right but this will be definitely

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.979 
the right but this will be definitely
something<00:03:06.790> something<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.849> try<00:03:08.120> out<00:03:08.329> man<00:03:08.629> this

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
something something to try out man this

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.119

and look at the name right now second
nightmare<00:03:39.780> beast<00:03:40.780> busters<00:03:41.230> board<00:03:41.590> which<00:03:42.370> I

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
nightmare beast busters board which I

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:43.860 
nightmare beast busters board which I
don't<00:03:42.730> have<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.180> motherboard<00:03:43.629> but<00:03:43.840> I

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
don't have the motherboard but I

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.390 
don't have the motherboard but I
actually<00:03:44.140> have<00:03:44.439> the<00:03:44.560> ROM<00:03:44.739> board<00:03:45.040> just<00:03:45.310> like

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
actually have the ROM board just like

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.179 
actually have the ROM board just like
this<00:03:45.730> so<00:03:46.359> that<00:03:46.750> would<00:03:46.900> be<00:03:46.930> also<00:03:47.290> something

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:48.189 
this so that would be also something

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:49.860 
this so that would be also something
pretty<00:03:48.579> cool<00:03:48.640> to<00:03:48.909> try<00:03:49.150> out<00:03:49.329> and<00:03:49.480> then<00:03:49.569> I'd<00:03:49.689> only

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
pretty cool to try out and then I'd only

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.289 
pretty cool to try out and then I'd only
be<00:03:50.049> missing<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.739> couple<00:03:50.890> more<00:03:51.220> games<00:03:51.489> to<00:03:51.760> have

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299
