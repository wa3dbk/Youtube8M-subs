00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
like it would work and I have thought

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.190 
like it would work and I have thought
about<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.450> past<00:00:33.630> but<00:00:33.870> I've<00:00:34.050> never

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
about it in the past but I've never

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.549 
about it in the past but I've never
really<00:00:34.500> tried<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:36.059> got<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> big<00:00:36.570> or<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.290> got

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
really tried it so I got a big or I got

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.340 
really tried it so I got a big or I got
a<00:00:37.590> little<00:00:37.770> piece<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.219> blue<00:00:38.969> cardstock<00:00:39.540> because

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
a little piece of blue cardstock because

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.110 
a little piece of blue cardstock because
that's<00:00:40.559> what<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.739> do<00:00:40.829> all<00:00:40.950> my<00:00:41.250> son<00:00:41.489> tangles<00:00:41.969> on

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120

is<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.649> card<00:00:43.649> stock<00:00:44.420> and<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.570> started<00:00:45.960> trying<00:00:46.260> it

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
is a card stock and I started trying it

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.869 
is a card stock and I started trying it
out<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.770> first<00:00:46.950> thing<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.280> noticed<00:00:47.670> is

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
out and the first thing I noticed is

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.850 
out and the first thing I noticed is
that<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.329> get<00:00:48.930> big<00:00:49.200> bold<00:00:49.620> white<00:00:50.039> lines<00:00:51.860> which

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
that you get big bold white lines which

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.130 
that you get big bold white lines which
this<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.579> really<00:00:53.910> what<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.090> was<00:00:54.300> looking<00:00:54.329> for<00:00:54.660> I

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
this is really what I was looking for I

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.350 
this is really what I was looking for I
mean<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:55.620> nice<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.829> bold<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.670> don't<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.270> to

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
mean it's nice and bold I don't have to

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.360 
mean it's nice and bold I don't have to
go<00:00:57.480> through<00:00:57.780> everything<00:00:58.050> twice<00:00:58.440> which<00:00:58.859> was<00:00:59.039> my

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
go through everything twice which was my

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.279 
go through everything twice which was my
major<00:00:59.760> problem<00:01:00.270> with<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.539> gelly<00:01:00.780> roll<00:01:00.899> pen

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
major problem with the gelly roll pen

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.219 
major problem with the gelly roll pen
the<00:01:02.190> only<00:01:02.399> problem<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:02.940> I've<00:01:03.210> really<00:01:03.960> seen

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
the only problem that I've really seen

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.750 
the only problem that I've really seen
in<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.129> somewhat<00:01:05.549> difficult

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
in this is that it's somewhat difficult

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.179 
in this is that it's somewhat difficult
to<00:01:06.409> adjust<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:08.189> width<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.760> your<00:01:09.659> lines<00:01:10.530> so

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
to adjust the width of your lines so

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.910 
to adjust the width of your lines so
this<00:01:11.760> would<00:01:12.180> mainly<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:13.229> used<00:01:13.439> for<00:01:13.740> like

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
this would mainly be used for like

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.570 
this would mainly be used for like
bigger<00:01:14.250> thicker<00:01:14.960> Zentangles<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:18.680> don't<00:01:19.680> really

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
bigger thicker Zentangles I don't really

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.230 
bigger thicker Zentangles I don't really
know<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:21.180> there<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.810> another<00:01:22.200> brand<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:23.240> white

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
know if there is another brand of white

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.899 
know if there is another brand of white
outer<00:01:24.450> correction<00:01:25.200> fluid<00:01:25.409> with<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.580> smaller

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
outer correction fluid with a smaller

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.090 
outer correction fluid with a smaller
tip<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.960> something<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.530> will<00:01:28.890> be

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
tip on it it is something that I will be

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.490 
tip on it it is something that I will be
on<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.369> lookout<00:01:29.490> for<00:01:30.140> when<00:01:31.140> I'm<00:01:31.320> out<00:01:31.470> in

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
on the lookout for when I'm out in

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.770 
on the lookout for when I'm out in
stores<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.130> things<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.119> doesn't<00:01:33.479> seem

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
stores and things but it doesn't seem

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.230 
stores and things but it doesn't seem
probable<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.740> there<00:01:35.490> will<00:01:35.729> be<00:01:35.759> another

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
probable that there will be another

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.999 
probable that there will be another
sized<00:01:36.840> tip<00:01:38.540> now<00:01:39.540> while<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.020> couldn't<00:01:40.439> get<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
sized tip now while I couldn't get the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.999 
sized tip now while I couldn't get the
exact<00:01:41.610> detailing<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.840> was<00:01:43.350> looking<00:01:43.710> for

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
exact detailing that I was looking for

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.060 
exact detailing that I was looking for
with<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.640> white<00:01:45.240> out<00:01:45.420> marker<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.110> think<00:01:46.860> what

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
with this white out marker I think what

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.520 
with this white out marker I think what
I<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.220> do<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.880> go<00:01:48.299> over<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.780> with<00:01:48.960> some<00:01:48.990> ultra

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
I can do is go over it with some ultra

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.859 
I can do is go over it with some ultra
fine<00:01:49.799> Sharpie<00:01:50.520> markers<00:01:51.090> different<00:01:51.509> colors<00:01:51.840> of

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
fine Sharpie markers different colors of

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.219 
fine Sharpie markers different colors of
that<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.649> add<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> little<00:01:54.149> bit<00:01:54.390> more<00:01:54.420> detail<00:01:55.020> I

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
that and add a little bit more detail I

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.120 
that and add a little bit more detail I
think<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.590> would<00:01:55.740> be<00:01:55.770> an<00:01:55.950> interesting

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
think that would be an interesting

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.280 
think that would be an interesting
effect<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.240> think<00:01:57.540> that's<00:01:57.780> actually<00:01:57.960> what

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
effect and I think that's actually what

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.389 
effect and I think that's actually what
I'm<00:01:58.409> going<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.619> do<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:59.009> tomorrow's<00:01:59.460> video

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
I'm going to do for tomorrow's video

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.280 
I'm going to do for tomorrow's video
another<00:02:02.399> thing<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.759> could<00:02:03.149> probably<00:02:03.329> do<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:04.020> use

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
another thing I could probably do is use

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.980 
another thing I could probably do is use
the<00:02:04.560> whiteout<00:02:04.979> pen<00:02:05.490> along<00:02:06.060> with<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.719> gelly

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
the whiteout pen along with the gelly

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.960 
the whiteout pen along with the gelly
roll<00:02:07.110> pen<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.250> would<00:02:08.399> give<00:02:08.759> me<00:02:08.789> some

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
roll pen and that would give me some

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.730 
roll pen and that would give me some
very

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.140 
of the thickness of the lines that I'm
creating<00:02:13.730> I<00:02:15.280> don't<00:02:16.280> know<00:02:16.370> I'll<00:02:16.610> try<00:02:16.820> a<00:02:16.850> few
