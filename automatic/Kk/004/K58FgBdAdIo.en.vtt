00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.730
 Hello dear friends with you me and 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.660
 crane and we keep looking at ptshke in 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.899
 patch back well in the patch test 08 11 games 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.510
 world of tanks and next in line with us 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:36.820
 268 object of which ponerfili too 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.700
 significantly and not lil slightly we 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.350
 Now friends find out and what ponerfili 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.500
 This ptshke Well first nerve touched her 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.399
 understeer 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.800
 well changed 30 degrees cut to 28 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.409
 but this is not so much in principle 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.300
 significant nerve it can 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:58.899
 compensate with the same doppike 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.100
 and you generally will not notice the change but 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.109
 generally . 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.140
 and so quickly enough continues 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:07.420
 spin well besides that also 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.100
 minor nerve and this increase 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:14.080
 scatter when turning the instrument at 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.930
 turning the hull and when we move 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.840
 gun also unloading size 11 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.000
 percent but it's already a shower enough 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.549
 noticeably and slightly less comfortable 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.530
 it becomes play but not critical that 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:32.469
 the most critical is probably the nerve 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.979
 damage damage we had a one-time before 850 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:38.140
 units now become 750 but at the same time 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.689
 we all got a little 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.240
 compensation in the form of accelerated 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:46.299
 recharge and now when we have on 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.000
 half a second faster about dpm but i'm not 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:52.450
 I know most likely all the same dpm a little bit 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.869
 will suffer and still become lower and also 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.939
 we still had speed backward 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.710
 if earlier it was 18 kilometers 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.350
 and we could easily roll back 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.719
 quickly back now cut it up 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.509
 15 again say it somehow 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:10.149
 critically I can not quite comfortable 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.850
 speed back 15 kilometers and we can 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.860
 drive back quickly enough well 18 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.560
 of course it was the best but come to terms with it 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.420
 but many can write 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.580
 Well, how can you but 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.709
 way meaning then swing these support in 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.660
 soul and drying 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.489
 750 damage yes I agree with them caliber 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.319
 the same but still want to feel 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.270
 some kind of progression when you were on 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.180
 level eight on the ninth they give you again 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.810
 already the gun was 10 on the tenth again something 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.340
 it seems 700 the same 50 damage yes you are straight 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.190
 certainly higher than on the eighth level but 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.680
 I would still like to at least 800 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.290
 damage or at least 775 you hear how 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.300
 different from the same eighth level and 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.310
 drying at the same 152 cumulatively 700 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.530
 gives out one-time damage here on the tenth 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.260
 level 750 well, as it is not quite 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.690
 fair but in general Fri-shka itself 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.209
 Feels comfortable enough to think 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.560
 it will be as good to damage but it is still 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.430
 and foreseen 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.130
 the coat of arms of the whole class pt but in patch 08 11 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.530
 268 I think in principle there will also be many 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.480
 Damage also basically comfortable yourself 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.190
 feel but of course have a little bit 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.160
 readjust a little bit to come to terms with 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.400
 Some new parameters also forgot 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.750
 note that cut punching 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.959
 penetration rate cumulative projectile 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.660
 used to be 450 millimeters going could 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.299
 boast 206 8 object as the most 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.980
 penetration gun in the game no one could 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.549
 boast such characteristics yes 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:43.450
 it was ebalo and now cut to 395 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:46.060
 Like Foch, I won’t say that 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.880
 noticeably but lower and now we are there with 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.440
 the ease of all sorts of yag pz e100 and hundredths 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.230
 Mouse in the top armor plate and under 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.209
 we can’t sew gold on slopes because 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.340
 that breaking through is still not enough 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.130
 but this is not such an extremely negative 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.049
 still, similar situations occur 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.540
 rarely and so in general so bebashkah 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.450
 left all the same three 105 breakthroughs and 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.510
 I think that we will also punch everything and 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.030
 Basically feel comfortable but 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.190
 the nerve is the nerve is still small but 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.919
 there is a nerve if you used to put 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.549
 4000 damage now well, I don’t know 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.830
 of 3700 to apply still some kind of 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.780
 the fall is exactly the statistics you have me 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.130
 I think it will be observed after all cut off 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.960
 speed well as speed dynamics because 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.410
 that turn and a little bit slower with 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.590
 increased scatter cut-through angle 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.670
 but you are in this patch, you can still 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.940
 bend over 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:45.630
 I hope you friends liked my such 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.220
 opinion and description of the nerf 268 object in 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.800
 new patch subscribe to the channel 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.360
 like it if you like it 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.160
 put dizlyki and do not subscribe 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.350
 if you didn't like everyone good luck in 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.350
 randomly with you I was the screen and bye bye
