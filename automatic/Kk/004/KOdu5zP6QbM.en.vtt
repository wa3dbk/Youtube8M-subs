00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
servers and I actually made a really

would<00:02:41.760> be<00:02:41.820> lets<00:02:42.350> say<00:02:43.350> I'm<00:02:43.470> going<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.680> build

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
would be lets say I'm going to build

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.590 
would be lets say I'm going to build
this<00:02:44.850> little

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.580 

floor<00:02:48.290> whatever<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:53.200> when<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:54.230> throw<00:02:54.410> this

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
floor whatever and when I throw this

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.180 
floor whatever and when I throw this
floor<00:02:56.800> it's<00:02:58.840> now<00:02:59.840> got<00:03:00.110> this<00:03:00.350> like<00:03:00.650> empty<00:03:00.950> space

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
floor it's now got this like empty space

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.030 
floor it's now got this like empty space
right<00:03:01.370> here<00:03:03.850> but<00:03:04.850> let's<00:03:05.600> say<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:05.870> opened<00:03:06.530> this

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
right here but let's say I opened this

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.540 
right here but let's say I opened this
the<00:03:07.550> water<00:03:07.790> will<00:03:07.940> flood<00:03:08.180> in<00:03:08.390> whereas<00:03:09.380> in<00:03:09.770> the

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
the water will flood in whereas in the

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.490 
the water will flood in whereas in the
other<00:03:10.580> server<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.810> I<00:03:11.870> was<00:03:12.020> playing<00:03:12.110> on<00:03:12.380> you

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
other server that I was playing on you

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.130 
other server that I was playing on you
could<00:03:12.620> actually<00:03:12.770> move<00:03:13.760> water<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.510> be<00:03:14.630> floating

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
could actually move water to be floating

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.230 
could actually move water to be floating
in<00:03:15.260> mid-air<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:15.770> stuff<00:03:15.950> like<00:03:16.070> that<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:16.490> it's

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
in mid-air and stuff like that and it's

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.700 
in mid-air and stuff like that and it's
good<00:03:17.390> to<00:03:17.540> meet<00:03:17.660> uses<00:03:17.930> like<00:03:18.080> elevators<00:03:18.560> and

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
good to meet uses like elevators and

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.310 
good to meet uses like elevators and
stuff<00:03:18.890> because<00:03:19.040> like<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.880> can<00:03:20.290> swim<00:03:21.290> in

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
stuff because like you can swim in

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.630 
stuff because like you can swim in
rocdur<00:03:21.650> so<00:03:21.890> if<00:03:21.980> you're<00:03:22.070> under<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.340> water<00:03:22.520> you

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
rocdur so if you're under the water you

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.600 
rocdur so if you're under the water you
hold<00:03:22.820> on<00:03:23.210> space<00:03:23.570> near<00:03:23.810> go<00:03:23.960> up<00:03:24.080> and<00:03:24.290> just<00:03:25.280> random

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
hold on space near go up and just random

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.410 
hold on space near go up and just random
fries<00:03:25.910> I<00:03:26.090> don't<00:03:26.510> know<00:03:26.570> why<00:03:26.750> but<00:03:27.130> anyway<00:03:28.130> yeah
