00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.320
 to enter with the tropical agroindustry is focused on the development 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.750
 research and technology to enable differentiated products that 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.260
 contribute to the aggregation of value of agricultural production within the 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:26.520
 agribusiness, the unit works in several areas always prioritizing 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.739
 strengthening of the whole production chain caused the blackout 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.090
 he comes without a doubt 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.070
 is to replace many products for some products until they are imported 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.080
 at that time to 0 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.170
 he comes to replace why he is rich 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.700
 for animal feed and coating and 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.730
 the means that are no more than sought by demei 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.960
 he recognized me is the market is too big 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.010
 to save the side dodo 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.150
 with this process that passed 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.380
 developed 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.140
 paulo the little ones and everyone 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.200
 producers 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.119
 it also give a cost condition 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.560
 lowering a little 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.560
 there is no sin of the finished product of the ration 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.060
 thereby 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.780
 it will make it viable 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.640
 I am not like the people will get another gain 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.619
 how will it also give better condition 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.000
 in new industrialized products invasion 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.240
 had the treaty case 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.220
 he 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.700
 lf that's easy 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.939
 ef 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.500
 with that to vote 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.500
 the cashew culture will have more development 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.220
 not only in the chestnut with our side stressed 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.400
 with also in the feed industry 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.070
 The peduncle of the cashew presented in difficult is in the feeding of 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.150
 ruminants 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.100
 have the worst protein 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.460
 carbohydrate 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.729
 edicts 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.789
 besides being well accepted by animals that have a good digestibility 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.310
 the level of cannon a Sunday gift does not detract from the quality of the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.330
 balanced ration 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.630
 there are two ways of using the cashew peduncle as an ingredient of 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.609
 balanced feed for ruminants 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:17.359
 one of them is the optimization of the production by-product of juice 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:18.829
 and the other 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:19.799
 the use of the term 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.869
 the document 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:25.769
 the process that uses the by-product of juice production 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.769
 begins with the collection of the raw material in the industry 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:34.519
 and this material is passed in a forage machine to give greater 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.729
 uniformity of raw material 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:39.729
 which will reflect on the final quality of the breed 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:46.209
 then it is placed to dry under the sun a thin layer for a period 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.740
 of up to three 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.059
 we depending on the weather conditions 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:54.739
 during this step it is necessary to return the material 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.129
 at least three times a day 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.459
 after drying 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.999
 dutra is crushed and stored to be used as an ingredient in feed 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:07.379
 balanced 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.309
 this material must be kept in a protected place in order to avoid 

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:14.779
 development of fungi 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:18.519
 the ration composition depends on the ingredients available 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:25.150
 like soybean meal corn sorghum wheat bran the cotton pie 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.469
 and the costs of its components 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:33.419
 other factors that must be taken into consideration the action the title and the 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.259
 category of animal 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:41.339
 the cashew by-product may be used as a substitute for maize, sorghum or 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:43.059
 wheat bran 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:44.680
 financed actions 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.269
 and food Poland 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.949
 the dog's diet 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:50.639
 can also be made 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.429
 using the cashew on the tower 

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:58.809
 the great advantage is the reduction of waste in the field and the generation of 

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:00.869
 more employment and income 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:04.879
 this experience is being developed in the settlement 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:05.829
 guevarra 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.749
 in the municipality of ocara o ceará 

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.749
 aimar pagot 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.389
 We're working now, making russell and cashew. 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:20.039
 we have the union paula it produces a thousand tons of cashew or not 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.330
 that's all we sell 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.749
 7 50 

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:29.399
 tonne this means that the telescope is disjoined 850 tons of cashew year 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.849
 so we preparing such sources question waste 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:37.120
 give 40 tons of food 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.860
 I can animals 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.900
 consume 20 tons - can move and sell 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.599
 it is impracticable of the establishment twenty tons of ration 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:52.259
 this is this is very interesting family culture priest in your old car 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:57.749
 Why did she leave the loló or the animals with cerano edano without commitment we 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:59.520
 we do not have a job that will generate 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.090
 here in the community goes through the projects and spain only adds to improve the 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.580
 condition of life here to find the family Aquino son of our 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.110
 community 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:15.419
 after the brown pick-up has collapsed the manufacturer's request to eliminate the 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:16.320
 impurities 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.480
 and placed to dry in the sun this process takes on average 21 days 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:28.550
 and the case must be resolved at least three times a day after completion of 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.479
 drying the material is crushed and stored 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.949
 in the same way as the process that uses a by-product of the industry 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.259
 of juice 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:44.479
 in the balanced feed formulation process should also be observed 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:49.840
 factors of availability in the southeast glory and type of animal
