first of all hey it is such an amazing
show<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:36.920> I<00:00:37.309> still<00:00:37.699> think<00:00:37.730> Dax<00:00:38.270> is<00:00:38.570> one<00:00:39.440> of<00:00:39.590> the

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
show and I still think Dax is one of the

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.770 
show and I still think Dax is one of the
best<00:00:39.920> characters<00:00:40.640> in<00:00:40.879> Star<00:00:41.210> Trek<00:00:41.360> because

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
best characters in Star Trek because

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.939 
best characters in Star Trek because
there<00:00:42.650> are<00:00:42.769> so<00:00:43.070> many<00:00:43.280> layers<00:00:44.089> to<00:00:44.629> her<00:00:44.930> and<00:00:45.229> her

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
there are so many layers to her and her

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.520 
there are so many layers to her and her
relationship<00:00:46.580> with<00:00:46.729> Worf<00:00:47.059> in<00:00:47.300> my<00:00:47.629> opinion<00:00:48.080> was

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
relationship with Worf in my opinion was

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.670 
relationship with Worf in my opinion was
the<00:00:48.710> only<00:00:48.920> believable<00:00:49.879> coupling<00:00:50.690> that

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
the only believable coupling that

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.560 
the only believable coupling that
happened<00:00:52.070> it<00:00:52.400> seemed<00:00:52.670> like<00:00:52.820> you<00:00:53.000> guys<00:00:53.030> did<00:00:53.449> it

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.399 
met because it was so good yeah I was
really<00:01:03.199> I<00:01:03.229> felt<00:01:03.710> fortunate<00:01:04.540> so<00:01:05.540> fortunate<00:01:06.170> at

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
really I felt fortunate so fortunate at

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.850 
really I felt fortunate so fortunate at
first<00:01:06.890> what<00:01:07.040> was<00:01:07.159> scary<00:01:07.520> was<00:01:08.150> being<00:01:08.630> alive<00:01:08.930> 350

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
first what was scary was being alive 350

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.960 
first what was scary was being alive 350
years<00:01:10.100> and<00:01:10.490> then<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.810> blessing<00:01:12.290> is<00:01:12.670> it<00:01:13.670> being

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
years and then the blessing is it being

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.020 
years and then the blessing is it being
layers<00:01:14.300> and<00:01:14.780> I<00:01:15.560> think<00:01:15.800> when<00:01:15.950> I<00:01:15.980> first<00:01:16.340> started

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
layers and I think when I first started

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.580 
layers and I think when I first started
it<00:01:17.180> felt<00:01:17.480> like<00:01:17.630> oh<00:01:17.780> my<00:01:17.900> god<00:01:18.050> is<00:01:18.230> going<00:01:18.380> to<00:01:18.440> look

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
it felt like oh my god is going to look

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.350 
it felt like oh my god is going to look
really<00:01:18.770> inconsistent<00:01:19.460> and<00:01:19.850> all<00:01:19.940> over<00:01:20.270> the

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
really inconsistent and all over the

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.830 
really inconsistent and all over the
place

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
place

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.790 
place
but<00:01:21.350> it<00:01:21.470> wasn't<00:01:21.910> it<00:01:22.910> hindsight<00:01:23.600> if<00:01:24.440> I'd<00:01:24.650> had

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
but it wasn't it hindsight if I'd had

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.590 
but it wasn't it hindsight if I'd had
the<00:01:24.830> confidence<00:01:25.490> of<00:01:25.790> knowing<00:01:25.820> I<00:01:26.300> could<00:01:26.510> have

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
the confidence of knowing I could have

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
time doing everything right around that

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.680 
time doing everything right around that
season<00:03:13.959> three<00:03:14.380> mark<00:03:15.070> is<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:16.120> time<00:03:16.360> that<00:03:16.660> I

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
season three mark is the time that I

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.740 
season three mark is the time that I
really<00:03:17.440> felt<00:03:17.470> like<00:03:17.950> they<00:03:18.730> were<00:03:18.790> allowing<00:03:19.270> more

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
really felt like they were allowing more

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.590 
really felt like they were allowing more
of<00:03:19.810> you<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:21.010> be<00:03:21.130> seen<00:03:21.400> in<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.700> character<00:03:22.180> I

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
of you to be seen in the character I

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.560 
of you to be seen in the character I
think<00:03:22.660> that's<00:03:23.110> when<00:03:23.350> Dax<00:03:23.620> really<00:03:24.280> got<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:25.420> be

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
think that's when Dax really got to be

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.979 
think that's when Dax really got to be
the<00:03:25.720> strong<00:03:26.280> capable<00:03:27.280> type<00:03:27.820> that<00:03:28.209> we<00:03:28.540> think<00:03:28.900> of

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
the strong capable type that we think of

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.380 
the strong capable type that we think of
her<00:03:29.110> as<00:03:29.260> now<00:03:29.440> I<00:03:29.470> mean<00:03:29.739> she's<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:29.950> badass<00:03:30.390> season

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
her as now I mean she's a badass season

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.970 
her as now I mean she's a badass season
one<00:03:31.540> she's<00:03:31.750> very<00:03:31.959> smart<00:03:32.320> very<00:03:32.650> kind<00:03:32.860> of

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
one she's very smart very kind of

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.300 
one she's very smart very kind of
ethereal<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:34.500> nervous<00:03:35.500> about<00:03:35.680> having<00:03:36.040> to

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
ethereal and nervous about having to

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.790 
ethereal and nervous about having to
kill<00:03:36.670> or<00:03:37.150> fight<00:03:37.510> but<00:03:37.750> then<00:03:37.900> by<00:03:38.050> season<00:03:38.470> three

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
kill or fight but then by season three

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.580 
kill or fight but then by season three
it<00:03:39.100> was<00:03:39.340> it<00:03:39.970> was<00:03:40.239> on<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:40.810> I've<00:03:41.019> always<00:03:41.410> thought

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
it was it was on and I've always thought

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.070 
it was it was on and I've always thought
it<00:03:41.920> was<00:03:42.160> because<00:03:42.519> they<00:03:42.910> allowed<00:03:43.180> more<00:03:43.570> of<00:03:43.780> your

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
it was because they allowed more of your

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.530 
it was because they allowed more of your
strong<00:03:44.860> personality<00:03:45.580> to<00:03:45.700> come<00:03:45.850> through<00:03:46.090> yeah

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
strong personality to come through yeah

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.930 
strong personality to come through yeah
I<00:03:46.570> think<00:03:46.750> IRA<00:03:47.140> was<00:03:47.620> really<00:03:48.040> instrumental<00:03:48.459> in

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
I think IRA was really instrumental in

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.850 
I think IRA was really instrumental in
all<00:03:49.120> of<00:03:49.269> that<00:03:49.450> but<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:49.840> think<00:03:50.200> all<00:03:50.500> of<00:03:50.560> these

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
all of that but I think all of these

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.250 
all of that but I think all of these
things<00:03:51.220> working<00:03:51.519> together<00:03:51.850> and<00:03:52.420> one<00:03:52.959> of<00:03:53.110> them

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
things working together and one of them

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.590 
things working together and one of them
is<00:03:53.470> I<00:03:53.769> was<00:03:54.250> nervous<00:03:54.760> at<00:03:54.910> first<00:03:54.940> they<00:03:55.360> didn't

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
is I was nervous at first they didn't

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.300 
is I was nervous at first they didn't
know<00:03:55.630> what<00:03:55.959> to<00:03:56.110> do<00:03:56.260> with<00:03:56.410> Dax<00:03:56.680> so<00:03:57.010> it<00:03:57.130> made<00:03:57.280> me

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
know what to do with Dax so it made me

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.680 
know what to do with Dax so it made me
feel<00:03:57.550> a<00:03:57.610> little<00:03:57.700> bit<00:03:57.880> like<00:03:57.970> that<00:03:58.000> well<00:03:58.450> if<00:03:58.570> you

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
feel a little bit like that well if you

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.750 
feel a little bit like that well if you
don't<00:03:58.870> know<00:03:58.989> what<00:03:59.170> to<00:03:59.290> do

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760
