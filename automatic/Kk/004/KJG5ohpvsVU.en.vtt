I've intentionally program it to have
quite<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.060> slow<00:01:39.360> start<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.870> stop<00:01:40.050> time<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.560> I

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
quite a slow start and stop time so I

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.860 
quite a slow start and stop time so I
