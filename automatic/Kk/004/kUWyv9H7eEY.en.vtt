00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
asked Lee how many force reps should I

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.560 
asked Lee how many force reps should I
be<00:00:19.590> doing<00:00:19.770> at<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.310> end<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.699> my<00:00:20.880> exercises

forced reps are an advanced training
technique<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.980> can<00:00:29.189> increase<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
technique that can increase the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.690 
technique that can increase the
intensity<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.720> any<00:00:30.990> set<00:00:31.520> substantially<00:00:32.520> and

intensity of any set substantially and

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.030 
intensity of any set substantially and

unassisted repetitions yourself for
example<00:00:46.260> let's<00:00:46.710> say<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:46.890> you're<00:00:47.129> doing<00:00:47.340> a

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
example let's say that you're doing a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.490 
example let's say that you're doing a
set<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.879> bench<00:00:48.090> presses<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.989> might<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.320> able

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
set of bench presses you might be able

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.590 
set of bench presses you might be able
to<00:00:49.590> perform<00:00:49.800> six<00:00:50.399> reps<00:00:50.700> by<00:00:50.940> yourself<00:00:51.420> but

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
to perform six reps by yourself but

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.660 
to perform six reps by yourself but
maybe<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.289> seventh<00:00:52.649> rep<00:00:52.920> halfway<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.520> you

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
maybe on the seventh rep halfway up you

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.119 
maybe on the seventh rep halfway up you
start<00:00:53.969> slowing<00:00:54.300> down<00:00:54.449> your<00:00:55.230> partner<00:00:55.620> helps

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
start slowing down your partner helps

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.369 
start slowing down your partner helps
you<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.460> finish<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.910> repetition<00:00:57.210> you've<00:00:58.109> now

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
you to finish that repetition you've now

completed<00:00:58.590> one<00:00:59.370> for<00:00:59.760> strep<00:01:00.180> let's<00:01:00.930> say<00:01:01.109> that

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
completed one for strep let's say that

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.380 
completed one for strep let's say that
you<00:01:01.410> go<00:01:01.620> for<00:01:01.890> another<00:01:02.219> one<00:01:02.460> again<00:01:03.120> about

you go for another one again about
halfway<00:01:03.719> up<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.379> start<00:01:04.619> slowing<00:01:05.159> down<00:01:05.939> and

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
halfway up you start slowing down and
