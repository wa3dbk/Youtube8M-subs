00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
going to be looking at morph you know it

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.539 
going to be looking at morph you know it
sucks<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:11.910> um<00:00:12.679> that<00:00:13.679> Marvel<00:00:14.009> Legends<00:00:14.429> or

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
sucks that um that Marvel Legends or

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.980 
sucks that um that Marvel Legends or
they<00:00:14.790> really<00:00:15.000> never<00:00:15.179> made<00:00:15.360> any<00:00:15.540> other<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.809> more

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
they really never made any other of more

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.450 
they really never made any other of more
figures<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.470> think<00:00:16.650> we've<00:00:16.980> gotten<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.430> think

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
figures I think we've gotten I think

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.260 
figures I think we've gotten I think
maybe<00:00:17.789> two<00:00:18.029> more<00:00:18.840> figures<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.380> believe<00:00:19.859> but<00:00:20.850> I

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
maybe two more figures I believe but I

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.880 
maybe two more figures I believe but I
mean<00:00:21.539> it's<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:21.990> think<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.230> sucks<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.560> you

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
mean it's it I think it sucks that you

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.859 
mean it's it I think it sucks that you
know<00:00:22.920> they<00:00:23.850> never<00:00:23.970> came<00:00:24.269> out<00:00:24.390> with<00:00:24.539> one<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
know they never came out with one in the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.599 
know they never came out with one in the
Marvel<00:00:25.170> Legends<00:00:25.500> line<00:00:25.710> they<00:00:25.890> probably<00:00:26.310> should

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
Marvel Legends line they probably should

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.060 
Marvel Legends line they probably should
I<00:00:26.640> mean<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.050> mean<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.260> don't<00:00:28.740> know<00:00:28.859> if<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:28.980> guys

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
like to see a six inch more figure I

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.520 
like to see a six inch more figure I
think<00:00:33.180> morph<00:00:33.390> was<00:00:33.480> an<00:00:33.600> awesome<00:00:33.780> was<00:00:34.440> an

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
think morph was an awesome was an

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.660 
think morph was an awesome was an
awesome<00:00:34.649> character<00:00:35.040> even<00:00:35.309> though<00:00:35.370> he<00:00:35.489> wasn't

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670

he does have he does bend at the knee
and<00:01:23.790> his<00:01:23.880> legs<00:01:24.689> do<00:01:24.810> go<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:25.320> at<00:01:25.470> arm<00:01:25.650> as

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
and his legs do go in and out at arm as

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.060 
and his legs do go in and out at arm as
you<00:01:25.799> go<00:01:26.009> forward<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.400> back<00:01:26.580> now<00:01:27.890> one<00:01:28.890> cool

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.890 
you go forward and back now one cool
thing<00:01:29.340> about<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.700> figure<00:01:29.909> though<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.360> you

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
thing about this figure though is you

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.020 
thing about this figure though is you
got<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.079> normal-looking<00:01:31.650> morph<00:01:32.040> right<00:01:32.340> but

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
got the normal-looking morph right but

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.030 
got the normal-looking morph right but
another<00:01:33.270> cool<00:01:33.450> thing<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:33.930> uh<00:01:34.170> he<00:01:34.920> has

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
another cool thing is that uh he has

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.920 
another cool thing is that uh he has
interchangeable<00:01:35.280> heads<00:01:35.759> let's<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.720> pop

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
interchangeable heads let's just pop

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.830 
interchangeable heads let's just pop
right<00:01:37.200> off<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.740> then<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.610> got<00:01:39.619> the<00:01:40.619> evil<00:01:40.829> morph

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
right off and then we got the evil morph

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.120 
right off and then we got the evil morph
look<00:01:42.840> at<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.079> he's<00:01:43.290> got<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.530> black<00:01:43.740> under

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
look at that he's got the black under

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.819 
look at that he's got the black under
his<00:01:44.280> eyes<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.000> really<00:01:45.509> really<00:01:45.720> cool<00:01:46.020> if

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
his eyes this is really really cool if
