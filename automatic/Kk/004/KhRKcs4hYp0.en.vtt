tablespoon serving on each 90 calories

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.699 
tablespoon serving on each 90 calories
100<00:01:35.899> calories<00:01:36.819> okay<00:01:37.819> we<00:01:38.720> have<00:01:38.899> 8<00:01:39.170> grams<00:01:39.439> of<00:01:39.500> fat

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:39.709 
100 calories okay we have 8 grams of fat

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:42.760 
100 calories okay we have 8 grams of fat
a<00:01:39.860> Corinne's<00:01:40.130> of<00:01:40.250> fat<00:01:40.490> 4<00:01:41.090> kinds<00:01:41.330> of<00:01:41.479> carbs<00:01:42.020> 3

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
a Corinne's of fat 4 kinds of carbs 3

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.719 
a Corinne's of fat 4 kinds of carbs 3
grams<00:01:43.009> of<00:01:43.220> carbs<00:01:43.610> 1<00:01:44.390> sugar<00:01:44.720> 1<00:01:45.440> sugar<00:01:45.860> 3<00:01:46.280> protein

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
grams of carbs 1 sugar 1 sugar 3 protein

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.229 
grams of carbs 1 sugar 1 sugar 3 protein
3<00:01:46.970> protein<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:47.479> pretty<00:01:48.319> similar<00:01:49.090> this<00:01:50.090> one

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:50.239 
3 protein so pretty similar this one

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:53.020 
3 protein so pretty similar this one
actually<00:01:50.360> has<00:01:50.690> 10<00:01:51.080> calories<00:01:51.920> less<00:01:52.250> but<00:01:52.849> guess

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
actually has 10 calories less but guess

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.199
