00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.419
 channel recipes 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.340
 it's been a long time since I wanted to 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:28.279
 to do that but for lack of space I do not 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.250
 could not make recipe videos 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.590
 so here you have behind me my 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.879
 new kitchen we moved in there 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.870
 two weeks with my girlfriend in a 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.930
 new apartment 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.180
 lyall the place there is a superb bar for 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.520
 introduce you to the different elements 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.960
 and different recipes 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.300
 so today we will make a 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.550
 super simple super fast it's a 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.980
 house winner that will bring you to little 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.410
 nearly 850 kg calories in less than three 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.239
 minutes to swallow and in terms of 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.460
 preparation we will be in five minutes 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.120
 what do we find ourselves right now 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.339
 with the ingredients let's go so that's it 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.469
 we have all our ingredients there then 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.719
 started there is honey 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:10.909
 it's an old bio of flowers it's 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:13.640
 classic there are thirty grams 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.409
 it's about 2 or 3 good spoon 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.450
 soup 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.689
 then we cocoa butter it 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.399
 peanut sleep so there I had it 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.810
 the more I passed the supermarket I 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.609
 bought a little basic stuff 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.740
 otherwise I advise you that of my 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:29.119
 protein that's really good because 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.529
 that you are guaranteed that there is 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.880
 only peanut 

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:37.909
 while here we will have some plant and 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.829
 stuff to sweeten in terms of price 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.560
 the low so expensive is about 8 euros 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.259
 worried too I'm wrong and in 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.719
 terms of taste frankly it's nickel 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:50.829
 so rather take supermarket I you 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:54.229
 advise that of my protein next 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.359
 in this bowl we have 40 grams of almonds in 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.039
 powder 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:59.710
 so here it's death in fine powder and 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.270
 I know we can 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.540
 bought a lot cheaper on the internet 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.060
 that's what I'm going to be here soon 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.479
 in it we have 45 g of wade isola at 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.040
 chocolate me right now what 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.959
 I try 10 adored what I have to the 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.200
 house after you can very well the 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:20.080
 do with aouille or christmas 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.270
 classic or otherwise casein that that 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.790
 will depend if we wanted to a 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.620
 rapid or rather slow absorption of 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.270
 protein 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.370
 then we have half a banana life done at 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.780
 about 50 grams what I do is 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.000
 I cut in four on the length 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.440
 and then I slice them like that 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.519
 ti me ass but for the blender 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:43.090
 it will be much easier to mix there 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:47.470
 in there are 25 centilitres of milk milk 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.300
 skim and bio is then in terms of 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.519
 material it's not very complicated there is 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.150
 a blender c1 bender first price that 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:58.480
 cheap cost you need not a 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.040
 monster and then then did not buy to himself 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.100
 mock heart for the eve 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.680
 usually it's 7,100 milliliters 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.870
 fit in perfectly so here are the 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.579
 pretty simple ingredients it's not very 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:15.190
 dear to the righteous blender and that's going to 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:24.340
 the bacteria are tidy these parts 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:31.600
 where he goes tech so first thing that's 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:36.700
 that we will put our nose in the bottom after 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:43.840
 take the law and isolate it is we put 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:51.390
 in front of the german gold adds to 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.390
 above peanut 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:24.960
 and finally I have him in it then take on 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:41.620
 release me but he did next 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:43.180
 learn banana then shut up 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.870
 little roads less than I do it's 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:51.070
 I never plug the blender so it's 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.660
 are closed well positioned and that I have 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.160
 checked that you fall on zero 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:03.060
 otherwise it goes in all directions with 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:03.060
 sleeves and it's music party 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.370
 Roland is a little bit of strength 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:48.940
 go look for the little demons who 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:51.110
 silent it is true that 101 got your 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:59.540
 mind 6 nov 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:06:06.850
 in flap it's perfect it smells great 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:06.850
 beautiful but really super good 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:24.620
 we put in the chai taylor after 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.630
 either do you like me do me 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.950
 I prepare it the day before at the evening of May 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.950
 in the fridge and I drink it the next day 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:33.850
 morning at breakfast 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:35.890
 either you drink it directly 1 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:38.630
 it depends when are you preparing 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:40.700
 so in terms of consumption me I 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.740
 advise you carefully to take it as 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.300
 me at breakfast 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.180
 if not take it after training 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.160
 or possibly the afternoon avoid 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.250
 just before training because 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.650
 between fines and butter 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.270
 peanuts that will make a lot of 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.890
 lipids so I do not guarantee that the 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.320
 digestion during the training will be 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.770
 really to go with it's not going well 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.740
 bother 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.630
 so we will perpetuate its sooner either 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:09.560
 in the morning either after training or 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:12.050
 during the day in the afternoon voila 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.940
 this was the first recipe we had 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.740
 found on bodybuilding and nutrition 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:19.330
 point fr for other items from other 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.330
 videos and see you soon 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.760
 the bottom
