today is I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
today is I'm going to go ahead and
measure<00:01:08.509> the<00:01:09.509> pumpkin<00:01:09.960> using<00:01:10.890> what<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.640> called

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
measure the pumpkin using what is called

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.320 
measure the pumpkin using what is called
the<00:01:12.060> OTT<00:01:12.810> method<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.380> over-the-top<00:01:14.369> method

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
the OTT method the over-the-top method

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.570 
the OTT method the over-the-top method
basically<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:16.530> use<00:01:16.799> one<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.759> these<00:01:19.580> one

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
basically you just use one of these one

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.219 
basically you just use one of these one
of<00:01:20.640> these<00:01:20.789> measuring<00:01:21.180> tapes<00:01:21.509> here<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.049> you

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
of these measuring tapes here and you

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.050 
of these measuring tapes here and you
measure<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> circumference<00:01:23.399> of<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> pumpkin

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
measure the circumference of the pumpkin

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.120 
measure the circumference of the pumpkin
parallel<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> ground<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.979> also

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
parallel to the ground and you also

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.950 
parallel to the ground and you also
measure<00:01:26.460> two<00:01:26.850> measurements<00:01:27.390> one<00:01:27.570> over<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
measure two measurements one over the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.990 
measure two measurements one over the
top<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.380> way<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.830> then<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:29.520> over<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.820> top

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
top this way and then one over the top

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
top this way and then one over the top
this<00:01:30.360> way<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.350> let's<00:01:31.890> go<00:01:32.069> ahead<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.550> measure

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
this way so let's go ahead and measure

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.649 
this way so let's go ahead and measure
going<00:01:34.020> all<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.259> way<00:01:34.289> around<00:01:35.149> at<00:01:36.149> the<00:01:36.270> widest

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
going all the way around at the widest

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.460 
going all the way around at the widest
point<00:01:38.539> actually<00:01:39.539> let<00:01:39.690> me<00:01:39.780> go<00:01:39.929> this<00:01:40.110> way<00:01:40.289> like

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
point actually let me go this way like

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.399 
point actually let me go this way like
this<00:01:41.030> what<00:01:42.030> we're<00:01:42.149> gonna<00:01:42.240> do<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.659> we're<00:01:43.319> gonna

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
this what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.570 
this what we're gonna do is we're gonna
harvest<00:01:43.679> this<00:01:43.920> pumpkin<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.369> then<00:01:44.460> we're

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
harvest this pumpkin and then we're

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.969 
harvest this pumpkin and then we're
gonna<00:01:44.670> compare<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.179> and<00:01:45.210> see<00:01:45.560> how<00:01:46.560> close<00:01:46.830> we

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
gonna compare it and see how close we

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.029 
gonna compare it and see how close we
actually<00:01:47.250> are<00:01:48.080> so<00:01:49.080> that's<00:01:49.140> about<00:01:49.319> two<00:01:49.649> inches

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
actually are so that's about two inches

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.029 
actually are so that's about two inches
off<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:51.420> whole<00:01:51.750> thing<00:01:52.170> plus<00:01:52.560> about<00:01:52.740> two

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
off so this whole thing plus about two

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.520 
off so this whole thing plus about two
inches<00:01:53.429> it's<00:01:53.759> about<00:01:54.409> sixty<00:01:55.409> two<00:01:55.649> inches<00:01:57.530> in

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
inches it's about sixty two inches in

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:12.760 
inches it's about sixty two inches in
circumference<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.840> it's<00:02:01.590> about<00:02:06.649> is<00:02:07.649> about<00:02:11.569> 43

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
circumference and it's about is about 43

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:25.430 
circumference and it's about is about 43
43<00:02:13.770> inches<00:02:15.830> side<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.980> side<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.580> about<00:02:24.440> is

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
43 inches side to side it is about is

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:33.470 
43 inches side to side it is about is
about<00:02:28.010> 42<00:02:29.010> inches<00:02:30.319> from<00:02:31.319> stem<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:32.150> blossom<00:02:33.150> or

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
about 42 inches from stem to blossom or

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.910 
about 42 inches from stem to blossom or
whatever<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.810> want<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:33.989> call<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:34.709> what<00:02:34.830> you

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
whatever you want to call it so what you

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.080 
whatever you want to call it so what you
do<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.099> you<00:02:35.190> add<00:02:35.340> all<00:02:35.489> those<00:02:35.610> up<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.030> then

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
do is you add all those up and then

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.070 
do is you add all those up and then
that's<00:02:37.050> your<00:02:37.230> total<00:02:37.790> OTT<00:02:38.790> score<00:02:39.269> so<00:02:39.780> let's<00:02:39.959> see

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
that's your total OTT score so let's see

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.540 
that's your total OTT score so let's see
it's<00:02:40.230> 62<00:02:40.920> plus<00:02:41.550> about<00:02:41.790> 43<00:02:42.560> that's<00:02:43.560> what<00:02:43.769> 105

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
it's 62 plus about 43 that's what 105

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.000 
it's 62 plus about 43 that's what 105
plus<00:02:45.300> another<00:02:46.050> 42<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:48.209> that's<00:02:48.360> roughly

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
plus another 42 so that's roughly

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.170 
plus another 42 so that's roughly
roughly<00:02:50.010> about<00:02:50.099> a<00:02:50.250> hundred<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.670> forty<00:02:51.030> seven

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
roughly about a hundred and forty seven

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.390 
roughly about a hundred and forty seven
so<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.500> got<00:02:52.620> about<00:02:52.739> one<00:02:52.800> hundred<00:02:53.099> and<00:02:53.129> forty

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
so you got about one hundred and forty

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.390 
so you got about one hundred and forty
seven<00:02:53.519> inches<00:02:53.879> on<00:02:54.090> this<00:02:54.180> pumpkin<00:02:54.569> and<00:02:55.400> they've

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
seven inches on this pumpkin and they've

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.399 
seven inches on this pumpkin and they've
done<00:02:56.700> some<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.269> lot<00:02:57.659> of<00:02:57.840> measurements<00:02:58.319> on

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
done some a lot of measurements on

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.800 
done some a lot of measurements on
pumpkins<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.010> there's<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.450> there's<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.510> graph

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
pumpkins and there's a there's a graph

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.680 
pumpkins and there's a there's a graph
there's<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.650> graph<00:03:01.890> that<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.370> can<00:03:02.550> plot<00:03:02.849> and<00:03:03.239> it

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
there's a graph that you can plot and it

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.250 
there's a graph that you can plot and it
basically<00:03:04.019> just<00:03:04.140> relates<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:05.459> OTT<00:03:06.260> inches

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
basically just relates the OTT inches

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.070 
basically just relates the OTT inches
measurement<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.430> an<00:03:08.730> estimated

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
measurement to an estimated

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.440 
measurement to an estimated
wait<00:03:10.710> and<00:03:11.700> then<00:03:11.790> we're<00:03:11.880> gonna<00:03:11.970> harvest<00:03:12.210> the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
wait and then we're gonna harvest the

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.300 
wait and then we're gonna harvest the
pumpkin<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.230> then<00:03:13.350> we're<00:03:13.470> gonna<00:03:13.560> officially

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
pumpkin and then we're gonna officially

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.510 
pumpkin and then we're gonna officially
weigh<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.910> with<00:03:15.570> my<00:03:15.810> my<00:03:16.260> scale<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:17.310> see<00:03:17.490> how

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
weigh it with my my scale and see how

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.990 
weigh it with my my scale and see how
close<00:03:17.730> where<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.450> this<00:03:19.350> is<00:03:19.530> our<00:03:19.710> our<00:03:20.310> beast<00:03:20.700> a

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
close where so this is our our beast a

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.390 
close where so this is our our beast a
beast<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:21.690> year<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.650> if<00:03:22.800> I<00:03:22.890> had<00:03:23.070> to<00:03:23.160> guess

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
beast of the year and if I had to guess

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.420 
beast of the year and if I had to guess
I<00:03:23.640> would<00:03:23.670> say<00:03:23.820> it's<00:03:24.150> probably<00:03:24.660> 70<00:03:25.530> between<00:03:25.980> 70

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
I would say it's probably 70 between 70

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.720 
I would say it's probably 70 between 70
and<00:03:26.550> 80<00:03:26.700> pounds<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.360> don't<00:03:28.230> think<00:03:28.380> it's<00:03:28.500> quite<00:03:28.730> a

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
and 80 pounds I don't think it's quite a

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.480 
and 80 pounds I don't think it's quite a
hundred<00:03:30.360> pounds<00:03:30.630> yet<00:03:30.810> but<00:03:31.160> it's<00:03:32.160> late<00:03:32.340> in<00:03:32.460> the

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
hundred pounds yet but it's late in the
