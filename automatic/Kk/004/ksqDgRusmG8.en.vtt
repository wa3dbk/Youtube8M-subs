can<00:02:07.020> pull<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.380> out<00:02:07.819> there's<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:08.940> tiny<00:02:09.539> little

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
can pull it out there's this tiny little

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.870 
can pull it out there's this tiny little
hole<00:02:10.170> up<00:02:10.379> in<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:11.760> stick

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
hole up in it that you can stick

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.870 
hole up in it that you can stick
this<00:02:13.000> key<00:02:13.270> through<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:15.130> then<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:17.670> take<00:02:18.670> this

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
this key through and then so I take this

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.740 
this key through and then so I take this
key<00:02:19.500> you're<00:02:20.500> becoming<00:02:20.740> better<00:02:21.370> view<00:02:21.880> stick

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
key you're becoming better view stick

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.560 
key you're becoming better view stick
the<00:02:22.870> skin<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.470> then<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:24.580> see<00:02:24.790> this<00:02:24.910> red<00:02:25.300> road

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
the skin and then you see this red road

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.840 
the skin and then you see this red road
came<00:02:25.840> out<00:02:26.050> which<00:02:26.260> was<00:02:26.470> blocking<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.760> then

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
came out which was blocking it and then

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.180 
came out which was blocking it and then
this<00:02:28.030> other<00:02:28.180> corner<00:02:28.600> stone<00:02:28.810> came<00:02:29.080> out<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.530> pull

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
this other corner stone came out I pull

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.020 
this other corner stone came out I pull
this<00:02:30.340> out<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.880> then<00:02:31.630> it<00:02:31.990> opens<00:02:32.380> up<00:02:35.910> under<00:02:36.910> this

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
this out and then it opens up under this

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.450 
this out and then it opens up under this
one<00:02:37.240> morning<00:02:37.630> so<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:39.000> stick<00:02:40.000> this<00:02:40.210> back<00:02:40.510> in<00:02:40.810> and

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
one morning so I stick this back in and

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.610 
one morning so I stick this back in and
I<00:02:42.460> push<00:02:42.910> this<00:02:43.290> in<00:02:44.290> there<00:02:45.900> then<00:02:46.900> I<00:02:47.230> put<00:02:47.590> the

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
I push this in there then I put the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.770 
I push this in there then I put the
corner<00:02:48.190> stands<00:02:48.460> back<00:02:48.700> home<00:02:49.000> if<00:02:49.330> I<00:02:49.480> can<00:02:49.690> get

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
corner stands back home if I can get

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.710 
corner stands back home if I can get
them<00:02:49.990> to<00:02:50.140> fit<00:02:50.430> like<00:02:51.430> that<00:02:52.680> I'm<00:02:53.760> clock<00:02:54.760> hand<00:02:55.090> so

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
them to fit like that I'm clock hand so

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.410 
them to fit like that I'm clock hand so
this<00:02:56.650> only<00:02:56.830> holds<00:02:57.070> one<00:02:57.220> gumball<00:02:57.580> like<00:02:58.000> I<00:02:58.150> said

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
this only holds one gumball like I said

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.450 
this only holds one gumball like I said
and<00:02:59.580> the<00:03:00.580> coin<00:03:00.820> slot<00:03:01.150> is<00:03:01.450> right<00:03:01.870> up<00:03:02.050> here<00:03:02.460> takes

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
and the coin slot is right up here takes

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.170 
and the coin slot is right up here takes
quarters<00:03:06.930> so<00:03:07.930> I<00:03:08.320> stick<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:08.980> corner<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.820> then

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
quarters so I stick the corner and then

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.750 
quarters so I stick the corner and then
the<00:03:11.020> gumball<00:03:11.410> came<00:03:11.620> out<00:03:11.800> but<00:03:12.130> this<00:03:12.310> is<00:03:12.460> just<00:03:12.490> a

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
the gumball came out but this is just a

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.220 
the gumball came out but this is just a
white<00:03:12.940> marble<00:03:13.210> it<00:03:13.510> looks<00:03:13.750> like<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:13.930> gumball

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
white marble it looks like a gumball

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.770 
white marble it looks like a gumball
though<00:03:14.410> so<00:03:14.710> then<00:03:15.550> you<00:03:15.700> reload<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.210> by<00:03:16.450> taking

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
though so then you reload it by taking

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.780 
though so then you reload it by taking
this<00:03:17.050> and<00:03:17.290> sticking<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.740> back<00:03:17.920> up<00:03:18.190> on<00:03:18.430> here

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
this and sticking it back up on here

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.470 
this and sticking it back up on here
like<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:20.220> again<00:03:22.110> comes<00:03:23.110> out<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:25.000> get<00:03:25.120> back<00:03:25.270> up

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
like that again comes out to get back up

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.970 
like that again comes out to get back up
in<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:29.320> so<00:03:30.040> yeah<00:03:30.430> um<00:03:31.440> well<00:03:32.440> I'm<00:03:32.680> going<00:03:32.920> to

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
in and so yeah um well I'm going to

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.980 
in and so yeah um well I'm going to
hopefully<00:03:33.220> show<00:03:33.520> you<00:03:33.820> guys<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.330> mechanism<00:03:34.810> if

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
hopefully show you guys the mechanism if

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.170 
hopefully show you guys the mechanism if
I<00:03:35.110> can<00:03:35.290> ever<00:03:35.380> get<00:03:35.650> this<00:03:35.740> all<00:03:35.950> frayed<00:03:39.180> actually

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
I can ever get this all frayed actually

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.240 
I can ever get this all frayed actually
a<00:03:40.210> very<00:03:40.660> simple<00:03:41.170> mechanism<00:03:43.830> it's<00:03:44.830> just<00:03:45.070> the

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
a very simple mechanism it's just the

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.170 
a very simple mechanism it's just the
lever<00:03:45.459> one<00:03:48.990> so<00:03:49.990> yeah<00:03:50.520> the<00:03:51.520> coin<00:03:51.730> slots<00:03:51.970> on<00:03:52.150> the

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
lever one so yeah the coin slots on the

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.860 
lever one so yeah the coin slots on the
roof<00:03:52.450> so<00:03:52.750> when<00:03:52.900> I<00:03:53.370> so<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.790> coin<00:03:55.060> you're<00:03:55.750> right

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
roof so when I so the coin you're right

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:04.380 
roof so when I so the coin you're right
i<00:03:56.020> think<00:03:56.080> the<00:04:00.750> canadian<00:04:01.750> quarter<00:04:02.700> so<00:04:03.700> um<00:04:04.030> yeah

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
i think the canadian quarter so um yeah

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.940 
i think the canadian quarter so um yeah
the<00:04:04.540> coin<00:04:04.750> slot<00:04:05.020> would<00:04:05.230> normally<00:04:05.590> be<00:04:05.740> like

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
the coin slot would normally be like

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.860 
the coin slot would normally be like
right<00:04:06.190> above<00:04:06.580> this<00:04:07.150> little<00:04:07.450> thing<00:04:07.660> right<00:04:07.690> here

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
right above this little thing right here

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.900 
right above this little thing right here
but<00:04:08.830> i'm<00:04:08.920> just<00:04:08.980> going<00:04:09.220> to<00:04:09.250> show<00:04:09.340> you<00:04:09.459> what<00:04:09.820> it

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
but i'm just going to show you what it

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.449 
but i'm just going to show you what it
doesn't<00:04:10.209> i<00:04:10.240> reload<00:04:10.480> it<00:04:10.570> so<00:04:11.410> i<00:04:11.770> take<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.160> gumbo

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
doesn't i reload it so i take the gumbo

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.270 
doesn't i reload it so i take the gumbo
and<00:04:12.700> I<00:04:12.790> stick<00:04:13.090> it<00:04:13.120> up<00:04:13.450> what<00:04:14.380> do<00:04:14.560> you<00:04:14.620> guys<00:04:14.800> see

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.939 

and<00:04:18.280> try<00:04:18.459> to<00:04:18.520> get<00:04:18.670> a<00:04:18.700> good<00:04:18.820> view

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.499 

tripods<00:04:23.949> not<00:04:24.160> stand<00:04:24.430> still<00:04:24.699> but<00:04:25.120> you<00:04:25.330> just

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:25.509 
tripods not stand still but you just

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:27.870 
tripods not stand still but you just
take<00:04:25.870> this<00:04:26.050> up<00:04:26.289> stick<00:04:27.280> through<00:04:27.460> there<00:04:27.639> and

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
take this up stick through there and

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.730 
take this up stick through there and
then<00:04:28.060> it<00:04:28.300> pushes<00:04:28.539> that<00:04:28.810> back<00:04:29.080> and<00:04:29.440> then<00:04:29.590> it

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
then it pushes that back and then it

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.499 
then it pushes that back and then it
resets<00:04:30.430> that<00:04:30.669> right<00:04:30.849> there<00:04:31.150> and<00:04:31.330> then<00:04:31.389> the

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
resets that right there and then the

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.930 
resets that right there and then the
gumball<00:04:31.780> sitting<00:04:32.080> there<00:04:32.289> ready<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:32.650> be<00:04:32.940> pushed

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
gumball sitting there ready to be pushed

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.140 
gumball sitting there ready to be pushed
off<00:04:34.180> so<00:04:34.710> when<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.860> quarter<00:04:36.160> drops<00:04:36.460> down<00:04:36.759> it

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
off so when the quarter drops down it

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.939 
off so when the quarter drops down it
falls<00:04:37.509> down<00:04:37.630> through<00:04:38.080> here<00:04:38.349> and<00:04:38.590> then<00:04:38.680> it<00:04:38.800> hits

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
falls down through here and then it hits

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.809 
falls down through here and then it hits
this<00:04:39.039> ramp<00:04:40.259> it<00:04:41.259> doesn't<00:04:41.620> do<00:04:41.680> that<00:04:41.860> just<00:04:42.669> look

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:42.819 
this ramp it doesn't do that just look

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:44.640 
this ramp it doesn't do that just look
you<00:04:43.030> should<00:04:43.270> do<00:04:43.539> a<00:04:43.750> little<00:04:43.990> more<00:04:44.199> speed<00:04:44.470> like

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
you should do a little more speed like

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:51.330 
you should do a little more speed like
and<00:04:45.509> then<00:04:46.949> so<00:04:47.949> the<00:04:48.160> gumball<00:04:49.800> gumball<00:04:50.800> would<00:04:51.190> be
