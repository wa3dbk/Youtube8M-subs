this game I would be blown away because
it's<00:01:16.560> really<00:01:16.799> realistic<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.670> cars<00:01:17.970> go<00:01:18.210> really

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
it's really realistic the cars go really

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.969 
it's really realistic the cars go really
