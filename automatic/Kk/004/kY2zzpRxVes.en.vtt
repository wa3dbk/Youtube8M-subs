to the XPS m1330 which we gave not only
our<00:00:11.099> editors<00:00:11.370> choice<00:00:11.610> but<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:11.969> best<00:00:12.150> notebook

it starts off with luxury details right
away<00:00:18.420> with<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> leather<00:00:18.930> strip<00:00:19.320> here<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.939> then

away with a leather strip here and then
a<00:00:21.180> metal<00:00:21.480> layer<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.020> then<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.590> glossy<00:00:23.100> black

a metal layer and then this glossy black
finish<00:00:23.369> which<00:00:23.970> unfortunately<00:00:24.359> as<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.779> can

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
finish which unfortunately as you can

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.670 
finish which unfortunately as you can
see<00:00:25.199> maybe<00:00:25.470> picks<00:00:26.340> up<00:00:26.519> some<00:00:26.670> fingerprints

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
see maybe picks up some fingerprints

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.600 
see maybe picks up some fingerprints
then<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.769> open<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.099> up<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:31.070> sort<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.160> you'll

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
then you open it up and sort of you'll

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.370 
then you open it up and sort of you'll
see<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> same<00:00:33.059> design<00:00:33.420> mirror<00:00:33.750> here<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
see the same design mirror here the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.010 
see the same design mirror here the
metal<00:00:34.649> layer<00:00:35.360> continues<00:00:36.360> her<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.660> hinges

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
metal layer continues her in the hinges

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.080 
metal layer continues her in the hinges
we<00:00:37.200> actually<00:00:37.590> don't<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.460> much<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
we actually don't like this so much the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.119 
we actually don't like this so much the
exposed<00:00:39.660> hinges<00:00:40.110> with<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.379> exposed<00:00:40.680> screws

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
exposed hinges with the exposed screws

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.270 
exposed hinges with the exposed screws
here<00:00:41.460> but<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:43.020> keyboard<00:00:43.260> has<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> nice<00:00:43.980> soft

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
here but the keyboard has a nice soft

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.299 
here but the keyboard has a nice soft
finish<00:00:44.550> here<00:00:45.379> that's<00:00:46.379> just<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.739> very<00:00:46.890> flat

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
finish here that's just the very flat

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.970 
finish here that's just the very flat
surface<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.530> there<00:00:49.530> are<00:00:49.559> these<00:00:49.710> touch

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
surface to there are these touch

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.670 
surface to there are these touch
sensitive<00:00:50.870> multimedia<00:00:51.870> controls<00:00:52.289> which<00:00:52.469> will

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
sensitive multimedia controls which will

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.209 
sensitive multimedia controls which will
go<00:00:52.770> white<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.969> match<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.629> have<00:00:55.219> LED

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
go white and to match it you have LED

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.610 
go white and to match it you have LED
lights<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.640> front<00:00:56.730> here<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.420> even<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
lights on the front here and even the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.830 
lights on the front here and even the
power<00:00:58.859> button<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.550> side<00:00:59.760> goes<00:01:00.510> why<00:01:00.719> I'm

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
power button on the side goes why I'm

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.180 
power button on the side goes why I'm
not<00:01:00.960> sure<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.440> see<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.829> there<00:01:02.039> but

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
not sure if you can see that there but

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.280 
not sure if you can see that there but
that<00:01:02.340> goes<00:01:02.489> white<00:01:02.789> as<00:01:03.270> well<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.960> sort<00:01:04.199> of

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
that goes white as well so that sort of

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.710 
that goes white as well so that sort of
wraps<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.519> all<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.880> these<00:01:06.000> subtle<00:01:06.330> details

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
wraps in all of these subtle details

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.429 
wraps in all of these subtle details
that<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:06.930> make<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.619> design<00:01:09.290> staying<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
that really make the design staying the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.050 
that really make the design staying the
design<00:01:10.740> design<00:01:11.189> for<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> minute<00:01:11.610> one<00:01:11.760> thing<00:01:11.939> I

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
design design for a minute one thing I

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.880 
design design for a minute one thing I
didn't<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.720> my<00:01:12.840> review<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.350> touchpad

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
didn't like in my review is the touchpad

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.070 
didn't like in my review is the touchpad
just<00:01:14.670> because<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.270> small<00:01:15.600> if<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.930> look

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
just because it's so small if you look

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.249 
just because it's so small if you look
at<00:01:16.170> my<00:01:16.290> finger<00:01:16.650> here<00:01:16.920> as<00:01:17.630> I<00:01:18.630> move<00:01:18.810> Mike<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
at my finger here as I move Mike and

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.050 
at my finger here as I move Mike and
around<00:01:19.500> easy<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.189> my<00:01:20.340> finger<00:01:20.640> up<00:01:20.729> against

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
around easy to but my finger up against

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.490 
around easy to but my finger up against
the<00:01:21.150> upper<00:01:21.450> end<00:01:21.689> at<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.869> touchpad<00:01:22.350> which

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
the upper end at the touchpad which

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.920 
the upper end at the touchpad which
really<00:01:22.830> shouldn't<00:01:23.130> happen<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.689> touch

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
really shouldn't happen but the touch

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.109 
really shouldn't happen but the touch
buttons<00:01:25.320> are<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:25.950> very<00:01:26.070> tactile<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.850> soft

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
buttons are just very tactile and soft

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.080 
buttons are just very tactile and soft
and<00:01:27.360> don't<00:01:27.540> make<00:01:27.630> much<00:01:27.900> noise<00:01:27.930> says<00:01:28.829> nice

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
and don't make much noise says nice

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.830 
and don't make much noise says nice
let's<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.299> talk<00:01:30.450> quickly<00:01:30.689> about

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
let's just talk quickly about

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.020 
let's just talk quickly about
performance<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.740> has<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.220> latest<00:01:32.549> intel

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
performance this has the latest intel

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.850 
performance this has the latest intel
core<00:01:33.270> 2<00:01:33.450> duo<00:01:33.479> processors<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.560> this

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
core 2 duo processors and this

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.429 
core 2 duo processors and this
particular<00:01:35.400> unit<00:01:35.579> has<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.820> six<00:01:36.150> cell<00:01:36.360> battery

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
particular unit has a six cell battery

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.870 
particular unit has a six cell battery
now<00:01:37.439> unfortunately<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:38.159> only<00:01:38.220> lasted<00:01:38.700> two

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
now unfortunately it only lasted two

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.730 
now unfortunately it only lasted two
hours<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.299> 42<00:01:39.689> minutes<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:40.049> our<00:01:40.140> battery<00:01:40.439> test

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
hours and 42 minutes in our battery test

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.109 
hours and 42 minutes in our battery test
and<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:40.950> would<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.189> expected<00:01:41.400> somewhere<00:01:42.030> in

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
and we would have expected somewhere in

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.490 
and we would have expected somewhere in
the<00:01:42.180> four<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.540> four<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.869> half<00:01:42.899> hour<00:01:43.200> range

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
the four to four and a half hour range

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.749 
the four to four and a half hour range
so<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.860> was<00:01:43.979> actually<00:01:44.100> one<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.520> things

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
so that was actually one of the things

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.090 
so that was actually one of the things
we<00:01:44.939> liked<00:01:45.090> least<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.689> although<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.710> performed

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
we liked least and although it performed

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.910 
we liked least and although it performed
well<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:48.030> chassis<00:01:48.750> tended<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.200> get<00:01:49.320> warm<00:01:49.590> even

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
well the chassis tended to get warm even

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.109 
well the chassis tended to get warm even
when<00:01:50.070> we<00:01:50.159> weren't<00:01:50.310> doing<00:01:50.520> much<00:01:50.670> with<00:01:50.970> it

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
when we weren't doing much with it

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.450 
when we weren't doing much with it
especially<00:01:51.210> up<00:01:51.750> here<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.770> because<00:01:53.340> your

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
especially up here so because your

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.830 
especially up here so because your
fingers<00:01:53.579> aren't<00:01:53.880> touching<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.630> might

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
fingers aren't touching this that might

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.270 
fingers aren't touching this that might
not<00:01:55.049> be<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.290> deal<00:01:55.500> breaker<00:01:55.530> but<00:01:55.920> when<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.159> do

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
not be a deal breaker but when you do

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.560 
not be a deal breaker but when you do
pick<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.579> up<00:01:56.670> you'll<00:01:56.820> notice<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.270> it's<00:01:57.390> kind

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
pick it up you'll notice that it's kind

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.810 
pick it up you'll notice that it's kind
of<00:01:57.659> hot<00:01:58.130> now<00:01:59.130> we're<00:01:59.310> just<00:01:59.340> going<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.610> do<00:01:59.790> a
