00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.820
 Dashkova like knocks out lung places here 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:19.949
 as knocks the holes with more attempts yet 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.289
 but attempts to bit 21 may not be 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.650
 logical and a little quarter look 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.960
 Patrick marvel what he was doing what he was doing this 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.300
 asshole is just fantastic we already 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.130
 everything was clear that it was unlikely 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.719
 we can win but the fleet for luck 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.770
 which we needed so now 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.680
 of course still over the finish but there is still 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.690
 time at the opponent but i think he 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.739
 curse think bozhena how like that 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.739

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.600
 for some reason I donâ€™t know what is friends 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.520
 absolutely plan timer probably would be here 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.670
 everything worked out but it turns out not 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.260

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.260

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.170
 try to escape vodka in such a case 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.570
 carter turns on but here it is 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.759
 it will be hard and here I will try 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.340
 replay fiction 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.619

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.390
 has stopped 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.130
 looked around and took advantage of that 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.369
 really what is there to hide those friends 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.220
 who understand what I know that Andrei 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:32.930
 Pavel's sound is probably his 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:36.950
 the surname is not always adequate and 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.259
 Well here of course beautiful in accuracy 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.670

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.200

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:54.729

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.850
 stone decided not everything turns out emission 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.750
 and now such a candle 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.619

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.240

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.209
 enchanting most fantastic goal 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.010
 which you can imagine 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:20.019
 friends look it's just general 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.090
 something unreasonable call for a rebound 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.780
 of course the rubber washer which 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.849
 absolutely should not soar high 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.489
 great just great moment it should be 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:33.430
