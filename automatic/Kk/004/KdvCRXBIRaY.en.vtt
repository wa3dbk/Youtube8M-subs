00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:26.279
 hello people I dragged 111 just 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.140
 why drag tried discoveries 2 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.710
 tin cans first canned 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.590
 jar 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:38.750
 your discovered damage in principle almost 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:42.680
 but there 2 already they managed a little bit bad 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.879
 cutting edge issues are simple and 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.140
 just paul i mean it here 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:56.690
 plastic extremely duque de cinema three 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:01:00.769
 legs in principle how to show it 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.780
 when not stupid here on my wedge 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:09.799
 principle so much so very very 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:16.140
 plastic really like the progress of the blade 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:19.740
 after I drove the remote 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:26.310
 vtulochku something else pattern finely-small 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:28.619
 sandpaper fitted under the site with polished 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.060
 this whole thing is now on the entrance to everything is very 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.810
 cool part but the question is what 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.570
 I have some question 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.329
 wedge 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.609
 But with such a good clip opens 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.090
 in this way let's show 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:47.090
 have tried 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:55.520
 that's almost 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:59.230
 almost to the end see yes but it is worth just 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:04.000
 hands a little pull 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:06.290
 klinochek and now he has rested 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.009
 that is, this is the story for me 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.700
 a little bit quite listening to you besides 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.700
 wanted to check 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.570
 see yourself before 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:29.650
 wanted to check and that 11 lock well here 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.050
 so here is the principle of equality 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.880
 I could he fold and 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:40.700
 For some reason, I have developed from the first 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:43.690
 hitting here I'm good either null lock 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.690
 went almost to the end 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.100
 you understand what I am talking about 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.160
 such a story I understand what it is 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:59.810
 untargeted let's say using a knife 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.540
 that he is in such situations but not 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.280
 meet but 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.239
 hands here it does not add up in principle 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:11.480
 but if the nose . and in the rain . like this 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:16.360
 That is, the principles of the arbitrator is not much 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.360
 absolutely absolutely not much beat 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.190
 absolutely not very well with the Jury 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.519
 put it yourself not on your finger 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.070
 Well, I would not want for eleven 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:32.150
 thousand ruble 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:33.980
 This is a story to have except 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.299
 I want to say that now I have a knife 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.489
 folded it only dragged only 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:45.769
 I just dragged the knife and see 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:50.510
 here you can see inside yes there it is 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:51.440
 jar inside a little bit here stands 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.420
 she is 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.480
 and now look me just brings 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.990
 formed on the finger 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:06.830
 it's good that I removed my fingers 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:09.320
 it is evident yes here is such a bad story 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.810
 it turns out on a blade ie right now 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.890
 spent about an hour of time 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:18.370
 to drag the knife and when closing on 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:23.030
 finger that's what happened to me I 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:26.960
 I hope can be seen in return very huge 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:34.360
 such a min that is basically a knife when 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:37.280
 folding I don't know what he gets 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:42.320
 now look now open here just 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:46.400
 at this level you see yes here I have 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:50.870
 This is why it turns out to be so noticeable. 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:54.050
 that's the question as if not really a knife 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:59.690
 I really like a knife I like 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:03.410
 new well here's what to do with the lock and what 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:06.070
 do here with this song but I don't know 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:09.410
 maybe it should be 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:13.250
 But I'm not sure 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.680
 see, yes, such a huge replacement 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.280
 The last time I saw this piece of us 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:26.630
 she she seven hundred and tenth where the wedge 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:31.930
 rested was cleaned in a jar on 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.930
 Well, in principle, in principle, something like this 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.849
 wedge become and again ran a little 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.970
 with all 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.830
 was kind of centered and now i'm 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.830
 he twice banged his head slightly 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:55.789
 completely fled but will have to again 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:59.689
 sharpening the knife is unpleasant of course but 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:01.340
 so then somehow I'll be okay with a knife 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:03.740
 use in principle not sell 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.949
 I thought the knife really like that is actively 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.199
 here in hand what sits fine but 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:13.180
 But with these jambs, I would advise how 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:15.650
 would guys workshop 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:19.280
 shirogorov something to think something but themselves 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:25.569
 do you understand it is not normal 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.569
 there is good for 11,000 rubles for now
