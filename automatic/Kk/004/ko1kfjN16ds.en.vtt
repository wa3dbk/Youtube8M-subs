00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.820
 When I want to prune the rose bush, I want it to be low, dense and have lots of flowers. 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.360
 Therefore, I must give it a slightly larger cut. 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.800
 That is, the rose bush max becomes 20-30 centimeters above the ground when I have cut it. 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.520
 I have actually done this with this bush. 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.880
 Yet one can see that it is a good meter high. 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.340
 So it'll come again. 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.340
 One should not be afraid to cut the rose, because they will grow a lot on a growing season. 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:40.020
 Must be large, light, airy and a little romantic with fewer roses on it. 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.640
 - then don't cut your rose bush too far back. 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.380
 That is, you might have to cut it at a height of 50-60 centimeters. 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.120
 And then let it grow from there. 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.680
 Can you, however, like that your rose bush is a little closer to it, - 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.860
 - not too big, not too airy and has many roses, - 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.260
 Then you can cut it down to 10-20 centimeters above the ground. 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.820
 When I want to prune the rose, I look down on this, which is also called 'the ugly legs'. 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.300
 In fact, I can see that there are some smaller and larger buds around. 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.820
 If now I chose to prune the rose here, - 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.820
 - then the growth would continue through this knob, and then there would be a 10 centimeter dead branch. 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.220
 I'm not interested in that. 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.660
 I want the growth to continue at the end of my branches. 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.720
 That's why I put the cut just above the bud here. 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.080
 I take my pruning shears and make a cut. 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.260
 I have taken quite a bit of the rose bush, - 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.540
 a good half meter, but it doesn't matter. 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.760
 There will probably come a new rose bush and look nice. 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.640
 Another thing that is important when cutting your rose bush is - 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.820
 that you are also looking at whether something is dead. 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.020
 That is, some withered branches or that some of the rose has been attacked by a disease. 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.380
 Then this is where you also cut away all the parts. 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.140
 In fact, there is a whole dead branching and it must also be gone. 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.300
 If I think this one is a little too high, 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.080
 - Then I can see that there are some places where some tiny buds are sitting. 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.340
 And then take it a little further down. 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.500
 In the long run, when we come a little further in the season, they want to shoot and turn into bigger buds. 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.740
 And thus the growth of the rose bush will continue through this. 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.640
 And again here I have a knob. 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:44.880
 I put my cut just above the bud so the growth continues through the end of the stems on the rose bush.
