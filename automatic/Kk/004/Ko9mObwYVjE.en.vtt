00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.140
 and here we are with eureka and nancy cruz and 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.269
 who came to visit us as you walk 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.700
 all very well all very nice I am 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.809
 delighted with that you like the for the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.930
 blog if imaginary illuminated enlightened 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.510
 it's a viewpoint and through it the good 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.730
 night and the little lights look good and 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.220
 It is very nice in atmosphere gives us a 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.619
 totally clear light but ambience 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.769
 let's make the color of the last 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.270
 little box and well let's develop that 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.399
 because we have several steps as I 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.230
 it seems is a cartonage technique is 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.360
 a carton technique and we're going to use 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.900
 the racing that we are going to use in 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.150
 grounds 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.700
 the patinas to the wax obviously the 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.230
 acrylics that are a few for 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.810
 make a mixture of colors and that is 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.180
 pretty so we started having a 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.600
 cardboard color gray this is from a 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.990
 We are going to paint it white not 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.960
 I'm going to stop in this and then with 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.680
 the tissue paper we keep because what 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.840
 we want to generate is actually texture 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:13.750
 so then after we open it 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.750
 and we grab the moto2 which is a sticker 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.409
 waterproofing also a varnish 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.810
 then meet several was a birthday in 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.229
 two functions and you have this important 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.830
 because when you can make it from a 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.909
 let 's say it lets you then make a 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.040
 watercolor technique easily because 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.030
 It is very waterproof because the boom 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.090
 of that function we adhere 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.310
 you can do this we go through again 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.710
 above the motives and that's where I 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.759
 I say that waterproofs the product if 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.979
 I do not stop in this this is done about 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:56.030
 the entire surface 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:59.270
 and after it reached 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.380
 Give him a little hand of antique white to 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.130
 the entire surface 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.130
 once this is done we let it dry 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.459
 obviously 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.020
 and in the old target we started playing 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.970
 a little bit with the colors and 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.180
 and in this we are going to make a mixture of 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.579
 several we grab the yellow of naples 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.810
 the sun is clear that it is a very color 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:27.870
 very cute and here would be the first 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.569
 color that I'm going to put together 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.560
 I'm going to use a moisture technique on 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:38.590
 he opens a little bit of orange 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:43.360
 and I start to color him when I go 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:46.200
 giving the color well on the surface 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.200
 after 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:53.870
 we started to pass some wet cloth and 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.250
 on the we go scattering the color and 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.740
 here where we started to play a 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.780
 little bit with the colors I'm turning it 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.060
 so he does not really want 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.700
 deposited a lot of color in the areas 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.390
 where I do not want to can be cleaned 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.620
 because because I have the advantage of having 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.530
 waterproofed the surface that was 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.170
 as we talked before and here we 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.860
 we can mix a little bit plus one of 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.860
 the oranges 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.180
 with total earth ground shadow 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.080
 Toast you should start with the 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.120
 angles 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.300
 what exactly starts with 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.560
 the angles and here where when happening to 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.450
 the angles we repeat but in reality 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.020
 the amount is not going to be much that I 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.810
 I will deposit later we will continue 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:47.360
 playing a little with him glycine because the 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:50.640
 racing has a viscosity that allows 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.700
 when using an acrylic viscosity 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.280
 it gives you that transparency that you look for 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.989
 because I retire a lot with water and 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.880
 rag is what I do not want in the 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.670
 whole and there where I also 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.230
 I can stop around a little window 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.030
 and repeat again exactly the same 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.360
 yes 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.880
 and there and the cloth you're changing, I'm going 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.910
 changing the position and we are giving the 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.609
 tonality that we want as much as I want 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.790
 more less if anything can be 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.730
 keep retiring can be added 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.160
 You can continue adding color according to what 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.110
 look for this the point this is always 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.050
 try not to lose the light completely 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.060
 that you see the light at work because 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.700
 Well that makes the difference 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.940
 alcohol here is we have used the 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.580
 colors already above I felt the same no and 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.140
 now with exactly the entire surface 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.840
 it is dry 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.610
 and we're going to start using the glass and 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.150
 without this was what I told him 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.910
 earlier than actually good 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.400
 achieves in giving a viscosity to 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.010
 acrylic and lightweight 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.930
 obviously it also gives a transparency 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.910
 when we want to use techniques 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.400
 watercolors this is what allows 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.150
 as to make candle hard to be 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.800
 glazes and well this is very good and 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.650
 it gives me a time of work also that 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.100
 clearly when talking to then I 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.700
 good again with the toasted shadow and 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.700
 the Orange 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.170
 the amount is also comfortable I do not 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.480
 I can say a 30 and a 20 because according to 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.670
 the amount you want to emphasize the 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.490
 I work the shadow that you want to give 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:37.190
 when I use blessing I'm not going to 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.170
 put only in the area that I'm going to 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.630
 use but I'm going to spread a little more 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.360
 because because if not the brush in this 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.190
 case the mode is going to slow down and then 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.430
 I deposit the color 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:53.910
 to give a mode or a soft brush and 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.280
 I start from the tip to pass it like this and 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.220
 we go then there we go putting the 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.960
 we deposit the color again in the 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.330
 areas where we had blake without 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.980
 previously always the areas where 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.900
 English that I'll tell you and always 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.450
 where is the base of darker color 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.330
 darker exactly because I go in the 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:14.580
 angles well the angles supposedly 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:18.180
 It is a little house that has been aging 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:21.060
 over time I've done this 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.860
 and the texture of the paper we want 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.970
 highlight a little bit and with a patina 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.710
 the wax in this case with bitumen yes with 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:32.690
 bitumen what's going to happen what we're not going to 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:35.190
 to do is to scrub a lot just is 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:38.639
 deposit highlight a little some 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:41.370
 politician something that I deposit a lot 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:46.910
 amount ended up having all the 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:49.380
 operas that is what I do not want is that 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.389
 these little houses illuminate these little houses 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.160
 illuminated the others are with different 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:54.870
 colors with the same type that leads to 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.419
 try with material that there are a lot of 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.250
 acrylics is of many colors vintages 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:01.729
 colors as you gave me this color 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.729
 clay 

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:08.340
 cute thank you very much with your people 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:12.990
 thank you we're still together
