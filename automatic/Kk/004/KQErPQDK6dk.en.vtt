00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
into the lead pipe and then I usually

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.230 
into the lead pipe and then I usually
give<00:02:02.680> it<00:02:02.800> a<00:02:02.890> gentle<00:02:03.159> twist<00:02:03.610> either<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:04.150> the

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
give it a gentle twist either to the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.610 
give it a gentle twist either to the
right<00:02:04.330> or<00:02:04.450> left<00:02:04.630> it<00:02:04.960> doesn't<00:02:05.110> matter<00:02:05.380> which

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
right or left it doesn't matter which

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.800

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
way that just kind of helps it stick

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.749 
way that just kind of helps it stick
into<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.319> instrument<00:02:08.920> so<00:02:09.099> when<00:02:09.280> you<00:02:09.399> flip<00:02:09.729> it

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
into the instrument so when you flip it

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.849 
into the instrument so when you flip it
upside<00:02:10.179> down<00:02:10.209> because<00:02:11.049> you're<00:02:11.260> just<00:02:11.530> being<00:02:11.799> a

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:11.859 
upside down because you're just being a

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:13.309

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
below like parallel to the ground this

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.909 
below like parallel to the ground this
would<00:05:17.159> be<00:05:17.250> even<00:05:17.430> with<00:05:17.729> the<00:05:17.849> ground<00:05:18.800> and<00:05:19.800> I

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
would be even with the ground and I

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.439 
would be even with the ground and I
usually<00:05:20.310> put<00:05:20.520> it<00:05:20.550> down<00:05:20.819> just<00:05:21.029> a<00:05:21.180> little<00:05:21.210> bit

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
usually put it down just a little bit

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:22.969 
usually put it down just a little bit
because<00:05:21.690> it's<00:05:21.810> more<00:05:21.990> comfortable<00:05:22.289> for<00:05:22.860> me
