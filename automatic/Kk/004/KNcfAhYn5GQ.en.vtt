roughness - you usually you want to have
a<00:02:48.150> little<00:02:48.390> zigzag<00:02:49.170> lies<00:02:49.710> and<00:02:50.220> study<00:02:50.460> they<00:02:50.670> got

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
a little zigzag lies and study they got

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.650 
a little zigzag lies and study they got
to<00:02:51.000> be<00:02:51.090> perfect

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
to be perfect

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:59.510 
to be perfect
yeah<00:02:52.080> there<00:02:52.830> you<00:02:52.860> go<00:02:53.120> keep<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.360> tight<00:02:58.520> there

we go
we're<00:03:01.320> almost<00:03:01.530> done<00:03:03.560> keep<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:04.800> tight

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
we're almost done keep that tight

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.420 
we're almost done keep that tight
against<00:03:05.520> there<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.000> you<00:03:06.990> curve<00:03:07.350> it<00:03:07.620> you're

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
against there and you curve it you're

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.270 
against there and you curve it you're
doing<00:03:08.700> like<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:08.850> semicircle<00:03:10.400> see<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:13.280> keep

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
doing like a semicircle see that keep

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.400 
doing like a semicircle see that keep
very<00:03:14.880> good<00:03:15.150> he<00:03:15.300> said<00:03:15.600> it<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:15.870> got<00:03:16.050> to<00:03:16.140> learn

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
very good he said it I got to learn

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.510 
very good he said it I got to learn
there's<00:03:16.740> no<00:03:17.010> tension<00:03:17.880> point<00:03:18.890> there<00:03:19.890> you<00:03:20.070> good

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
there's no tension point there you good

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.540 
there's no tension point there you good
keep<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:20.850> tight<00:03:21.060> up<00:03:21.120> against<00:03:21.660> that<00:03:22.280> going<00:03:23.280> in<00:03:23.460> a

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
keep it tight up against that going in a

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.390 
keep it tight up against that going in a
circular<00:03:23.850> motion<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:24.810> see<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.650> kid<00:03:25.860> you<00:03:26.220> want

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
circular motion and see the kid you want

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.820 
circular motion and see the kid you want
to<00:03:26.490> stay<00:03:26.670> you<00:03:27.390> want<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.690> bring<00:03:27.930> this<00:03:28.170> here<00:03:28.410> come

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
to stay you want to bring this here come

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.390 
to stay you want to bring this here come
tight<00:03:29.420> on<00:03:30.420> that<00:03:30.750> seam<00:03:31.140> right<00:03:31.170> there<00:03:32.870> see<00:03:33.870> that

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
tight on that seam right there see that

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.030 
tight on that seam right there see that
look<00:03:35.400> at<00:03:35.520> that<00:03:35.670> look<00:03:35.820> at<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.440> one<00:03:37.440> more<00:03:37.710> step

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
look at that look at that one more step

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.330 
look at that look at that one more step
so<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.430> see<00:03:38.640> how<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:38.790> back<00:03:39.150> in<00:03:39.650> lap<00:03:40.650> it's<00:03:41.160> not

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
so you see how that back in lap it's not

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.370 
so you see how that back in lap it's not
perfect<00:03:41.880> we<00:03:42.000> don't<00:03:42.030> need<00:03:42.390> perfect<00:03:42.750> that's<00:03:43.140> why

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
perfect we don't need perfect that's why

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.090 
perfect we don't need perfect that's why
we<00:03:43.620> so<00:03:44.250> perfect<00:03:44.850> like<00:03:44.880> we<00:03:45.180> article<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:45.630> we
