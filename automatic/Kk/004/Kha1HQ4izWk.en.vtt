00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.410
 there are a lot of jokes and jokes on 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.440
 the topic is female driver but women 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.640
 ridicule pilots cause far less 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.590
 maybe because they themselves are wrong 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.539
 a lot but maybe because they are more 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.350
 Serious and responsible approach to 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.470
 flight business 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.119
 leyla al-numan masters the fifth type 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.670
 plane and dwell on 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.279
 achieved is not going to why she 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.170
 came to the airfield and how the main work 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.320
 helps her cope with piloting 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.910
 Layla told our film crew about this 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.260
 group 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.890
 actually this is our creative 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.969
 process he can see you all 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.800
 show some of our work and we 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.920
 We are engaged in painting and church 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.379
 temple and work equally well 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.629
 for the interiors of private customers was 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.640
 al-numan professional artist 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.409
 she graduated from Stroganov now together 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.750
 my husband and I have my own graphic 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.390
 applied art they are engaged in stained glass 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.580
 mosaic painting and painting but for 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.030
 for making such a stained glass window for example 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.049
 the whole team works first i do 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.030
 a sketch of small paints then done 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.340
 big cardboard so called this in 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.610
 life size everything needs to be drawn 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.920
 and then master 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:31.170
 already cut glass solder stained glass to 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.720
 he turned out so beautiful 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.369
 this kind decided her husband made a gift 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.470
 to open a common workshop in the house 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.450
 artist work to order they started 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.069
 Engage in student life later 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.440
 more than twenty years have become the best 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.509
 masters of their craft in Moscow may 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.190
 our viewer already had a question why are we 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.929
 all this we are telling 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.319
 and here the aircraft answer is pretty 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.319
 is simple 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.530
 selling and 7 professional artists 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.690
 lied all my life I wanted to try myself 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.940
 as a pilot three years ago she decided 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.600
 my desire to fulfill when I did 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.640
 test flight 1 Sergey Vanych my 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.520
 the instructor told me to go home 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.040
 thought well because if by this 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.880
 be engaged seriously here I am 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.850
 I thought I realized and wrote that I 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.370
 I decided to do it and structures 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.690
 this decision is treated with respect 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.670
 sent the necessary literature 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.010
 so began this aviation history 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.920
 fly leila studied on an airplane tag us 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.950
 n 2002 then I was transplanted to high 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.739
 plan too italian us pan 92 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.930
 I flew on it and own first 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.510
 departure was exactly on this plane 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.700
 now mastered the fifth type of aircraft 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.650
 twin type us twin pack departure 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.540
 they are only familiar with the instructor 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.700
 For about three years, Sergey Kovalkov 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.410
 tells gave him came to the flying club 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.070
 was the only woman in the harsh 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.070
 male team 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.360
 about these features not instructors not 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.100
 most in detail not to tell 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.990
 became Sergei Ivanovich only thin 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.090
 noticed that jay noise in the process 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.040
 learning needs a special approach strong 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.590
 you don't use a word like a man 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.250
 you criticize the work of women cadets 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.250
 there are also pluses 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.160
 getting ready to fly heads and really very 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.209
 carefully played a role here and and 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.670
 honors syndrome 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.890
 helped the education of the artist she others 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.280
 drew a map of their flights there is such 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.830
 exercise need to draw maps 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.480
 hands and memory but as I 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.340
 professional artist for me is 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.880
 just clear and for me it's just 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.519
 Here it is possible and here I sat to draw 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.040
 these cards helped me a lot 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.310
 for example, it can really be 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.110
 purely feminine maybe this 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.540
 individual character trait for 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.840
 it is important to pre-list me 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.750
 what is going on and how was it possible 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.790
 less surprises this feature 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.740
 character of a purely feminine trait to whom how 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.790
 more like slowed down the first 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.560
 independent departure 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.450
 if colleagues could boast that 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.700
 flew pretty quickly concealed and not 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.490
 hurry doing doing doing think 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.200
 Well, that soon you and the instructor 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.300
 says u probably soon next 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.470
 a week here it is you do not miss not 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.900
 let but basically I sweat 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.890
 calmed down and realized that I fly for 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.320
 yourself here seneca said that we are not learning for 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.960
 schools to study for life and this cause 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.000
 also relates her goal was not to fly out 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.050
 faster than anyone and do not even set a record 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.909
 by the number of mastered 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.340
 planes she wanted to learn how to fly 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:59.560
 drill not performed despite the fact that 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.340
 husband was totally not allowed 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.349
 him on the airfield 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.180
 now tell laylock occasionally 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:07.150
 flies with her I would not say that 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.819
 it was easy for me it was difficult but I 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.860
 I did this for myself and wanted to 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:14.590
 so beautiful and interesting is difficult 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.639
 difficult thing to come to the airfield more often 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.009
 total goddess 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.509
 for her the plane is a vent here he 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.580
 turns off the phone with him 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:23.050
 turns off their work and everyday 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.400
 fuss she has a certificate 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.530
 amateur pilot 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.479
 on calling themselves amateurs but along with 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.800
 so master the flight technique with such 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.259
 persistence which we probably 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.659
 would be envied by many professionals and 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:36.659
 This is not to spit pilot Vladimir Eve
