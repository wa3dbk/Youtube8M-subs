00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.359 
the front I want to think about this
truck<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.630> an<00:02:01.110> ambulance<00:02:01.350> either<00:02:01.860> have<00:02:01.950> hot<00:02:02.159> or

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
truck on an ambulance either have hot or

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.950 
truck on an ambulance either have hot or
you<00:02:02.460> have<00:02:02.610> cold<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.540> actually<00:02:03.840> have<00:02:03.930> a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
you have cold so and you actually have a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.780 
you have cold so and you actually have a
gauge<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.470> can<00:02:04.619> control<00:02:05.040> which<00:02:05.220> helps<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.549> lot

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
gauge you can control which helps a lot

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.399 
gauge you can control which helps a lot
with<00:02:05.970> our<00:02:06.119> little<00:02:06.299> kids<00:02:06.630> because<00:02:07.080> we<00:02:07.290> either

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
with our little kids because we either

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.169 
with our little kids because we either

have them it are hot and they have a

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.280 
have them it are hot and they have a

temperature or them they get cold so it

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.680 
temperature or them they get cold so it
helps<00:02:13.620> them<00:02:13.709> we<00:02:13.770> can<00:02:13.920> actually<00:02:14.040> control<00:02:14.430> that

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
helps them we can actually control that

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.000 
helps them we can actually control that
