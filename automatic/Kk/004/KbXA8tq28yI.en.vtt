we<00:04:10.349> got<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.620> stars<00:04:11.420> there<00:04:12.420> you<00:04:12.480> go

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.420 

and<00:04:22.540> that<00:04:22.660> one's<00:04:22.810> hearts<00:04:23.170> with<00:04:23.530> arrow<00:04:24.160> going

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
and that one's hearts with arrow going

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.950 
and that one's hearts with arrow going
through<00:04:24.670> it<00:04:24.760> but<00:04:24.850> I<00:04:24.910> have<00:04:25.060> it<00:04:25.150> upside<00:04:25.270> down<00:04:25.450> so

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
through it but I have it upside down so

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.380 
through it but I have it upside down so
you<00:04:26.020> get<00:04:26.200> the<00:04:26.290> point<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:30.460> there's<00:04:30.730> circles

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
you get the point and there's circles

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.050 
you get the point and there's circles
with<00:04:31.660> a<00:04:31.690> big<00:04:31.960> dot<00:04:32.170> in<00:04:32.290> the<00:04:32.380> middle<00:04:32.970> so<00:04:33.970> they

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
with a big dot in the middle so they

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.460 
with a big dot in the middle so they
probably<00:04:34.210> look<00:04:34.360> like<00:04:34.510> a<00:04:34.540> big<00:04:34.720> tube<00:04:34.990> going<00:04:35.320> down

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
probably look like a big tube going down

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:43.940 
probably look like a big tube going down
the<00:04:35.620> with<00:04:35.950> the<00:04:36.190> fog<00:04:36.430> on

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950
