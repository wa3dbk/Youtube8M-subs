00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
differently I think a lot of people

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.250 
differently I think a lot of people
would<00:04:57.790> be<00:04:57.820> really<00:04:58.150> impressed<00:04:58.630> with<00:04:58.720> this<00:04:58.990> and

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
would be really impressed with this and

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.370 
would be really impressed with this and
it<00:04:59.590> fit<00:04:59.950> them<00:05:00.100> nicely<00:05:00.600> so<00:05:01.600> if<00:05:01.720> you've<00:05:02.110> tried

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
it fit them nicely so if you've tried

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.560 
it fit them nicely so if you've tried
the<00:05:02.530> true<00:05:02.680> writers<00:05:02.950> before<00:05:03.390> definitely<00:05:04.390> give

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
the true writers before definitely give

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.090 
the true writers before definitely give
this<00:05:04.720> one<00:05:04.930> a<00:05:04.990> shot<00:05:05.080> I<00:05:05.590> think<00:05:05.770> would<00:05:05.980> make<00:05:06.010> a

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
this one a shot I think would make a

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.000 
this one a shot I think would make a
great<00:05:06.430> addition<00:05:06.580> to<00:05:07.000> any<00:05:07.120> collection<00:05:07.480> and<00:05:08.020> if

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
great addition to any collection and if

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.500 
great addition to any collection and if
