00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hi this is gringo magic you a video 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.290
 which shows how to make a plane in 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.280
 paper a glider with a leaf 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.410
 normal white attack so we're going 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.300
 start you learn it format wore 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.039
 so in the height you bend the edge 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.380
 right you flap it and on the edge 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.699
 left that will give us a fold in the center 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.640
 you notice the folds 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:33.390
 naturally like this the voice you 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:38.000
 did you open that we did the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.680
 central well so you take a brink 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.239
 joe of the fault suilhard example and 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.039
 you bring it back to the central fold that 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.890
 gives us his voice the mark and well he 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:56.430
 must be the same with the other so the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:01:00.510
 here on the bench here it is now 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.940
 you will pick up the folds and the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.940
 put back the central edge gives us his 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:16.650
 brand is well near recruiting him 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:19.740
 the bola on the central well if we 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.009
 mark well once you have that 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.119
 you bend the flaw in two you 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.119
 notice the folds 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.110
 then we take you to the base one 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:38.790
 centimeter to vouvray top of the sheet 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:39.590
 and you bend the ale like these same ones 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.549
 on the other side 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.259
 but the second is simpler 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:52.830
 just a superimposed on the first 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:55.140
 like this there you fall back gel and 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.030
 it gives you a glider thank you for having 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.409
