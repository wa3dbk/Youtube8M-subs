on<00:01:35.130> an<00:01:35.250> espresso<00:01:35.579> machine<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.570> we've<00:01:36.720> got<00:01:36.869> your

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
on an espresso machine so we've got your

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.899 
on an espresso machine so we've got your
ristretto<00:01:37.439> which<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> short<00:01:38.250> shot<00:01:38.490> then<00:01:38.820> you

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
ristretto which is a short shot then you

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.870 
ristretto which is a short shot then you
have<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.450> regular<00:01:40.049> espresso<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.490> lungo

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
have a regular espresso and a lungo

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.850 
have a regular espresso and a lungo
which<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.180> about<00:01:42.329> three<00:01:42.659> ounces<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.829> also

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
which is about three ounces you also

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.620 
which is about three ounces you also
have<00:01:44.220> an<00:01:44.280> Americano<00:01:44.700> which<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.240> when<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.450> add

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
have an Americano which is when you add

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.499 
have an Americano which is when you add
hot<00:01:45.960> water<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.380> your<00:01:46.950> espresso<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.729> some

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
hot water to your espresso and some

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.330 
hot water to your espresso and some
people<00:01:48.750> might<00:01:48.899> think<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.409> cafe<00:01:49.770> crema<00:01:50.070> is

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
people might think that a cafe crema is

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.429 
people might think that a cafe crema is
very<00:01:50.759> similar<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.240> an<00:01:51.479> Americano<00:01:51.930> but<00:01:52.290> it's

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
very similar to an Americano but it's

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.840 
very similar to an Americano but it's
actually<00:01:52.950> quite<00:01:53.159> different<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.700> has<00:01:53.820> a

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
actually quite different it has a

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.330 
actually quite different it has a
different<00:01:53.970> flavor<00:01:54.509> profile<00:01:55.140> as<00:01:55.409> all<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
different flavor profile as all the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.760 
different flavor profile as all the
water<00:01:56.640> runs<00:01:57.000> through<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.719> coffee<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.619> cafe

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
water runs through the coffee in a cafe

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.249 
water runs through the coffee in a cafe
crema<00:01:59.360> that's<00:02:00.360> right<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:00.719> we're<00:02:00.990> going<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.140> do

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
crema that's right so we're going to do

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.530 
crema that's right so we're going to do
a<00:02:01.290> cafe<00:02:01.649> crema<00:02:01.979> now<00:02:02.399> we're<00:02:03.030> going<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.210> use<00:02:03.360> one

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
a cafe crema now we're going to use one

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.780 
a cafe crema now we're going to use one
of<00:02:03.570> our<00:02:03.659> favorite<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.890> course<00:02:04.950> italian

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
of our favorite of course italian

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.930 
of our favorite of course italian
coffees<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.630> italy's<00:02:07.110> favorite<00:02:07.619> coffee

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
coffees the italy's favorite coffee

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.550 
coffees the italy's favorite coffee
Lavazza<00:02:08.940> super<00:02:09.690> crema<00:02:09.959> which<00:02:10.200> i<00:02:10.289> think<00:02:10.349> is

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
Lavazza super crema which i think is

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.690 
Lavazza super crema which i think is
also<00:02:10.709> appropriate<00:02:11.190> because<00:02:11.310> we're<00:02:11.489> doing<00:02:11.550> a

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
also appropriate because we're doing a

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.210 
also appropriate because we're doing a
cap

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220

krama<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:13.510> again<00:02:13.780> for<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.290> way<00:02:14.410> we're<00:02:14.530> going

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
krama and again for the way we're going

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.190 
krama and again for the way we're going
to<00:02:14.680> do<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:14.950> we're<00:02:15.100> going<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.280> adjust<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.970> grind

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
to do it we're going to adjust the grind

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.660 
to do it we're going to adjust the grind
so<00:02:17.200> what's<00:02:17.350> interesting<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:18.070> that<00:02:18.100> from<00:02:18.580> a

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
so what's interesting is that from a

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.180 
so what's interesting is that from a
one-ounce<00:02:18.970> ristretto<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.810> six<00:02:20.530> ounce<00:02:20.710> cafe

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
one-ounce ristretto to a six ounce cafe

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.980 
one-ounce ristretto to a six ounce cafe
crema<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:22.090> want<00:02:22.270> to<00:02:22.480> get<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.720> same

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
crema you want to get the same

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.960 
crema you want to get the same
extraction<00:02:23.830> time<00:02:24.070> so<00:02:24.340> you're<00:02:24.460> looking<00:02:24.760> for

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
extraction time so you're looking for

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.880 
extraction time so you're looking for
twenty<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.450> thirty<00:02:25.690> seconds<00:02:26.200> for<00:02:26.320> all<00:02:26.530> the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
twenty to thirty seconds for all the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.770 
twenty to thirty seconds for all the
drinks<00:02:27.070> that<00:02:27.280> you're<00:02:27.400> making<00:02:27.550> that's<00:02:28.540> right

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
drinks that you're making that's right

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.660 
drinks that you're making that's right
in<00:02:28.960> the<00:02:29.080> way<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.740> affect<00:02:30.490> that

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
in the way that you affect that

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.790 
in the way that you affect that
extraction<00:02:31.060> time<00:02:31.420> is<00:02:31.690> by<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:31.960> size<00:02:32.380> of<00:02:32.650> the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
extraction time is by the size of the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.770 
extraction time is by the size of the
grind<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:33.340> much<00:02:33.640> finer<00:02:33.880> grind<00:02:34.120> on<00:02:34.330> or<00:02:34.450> stretto

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
grind so much finer grind on or stretto

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.320 
grind so much finer grind on or stretto
coarser<00:02:35.710> grind<00:02:35.920> on<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.250> cafe<00:02:36.760> crema

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
coarser grind on a cafe crema

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.940 
coarser grind on a cafe crema
so<00:02:37.660> that<00:02:37.810> speeds<00:02:38.080> up<00:02:38.290> slows<00:02:38.320> down<00:02:38.800> the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
so that speeds up slows down the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.600 
so that speeds up slows down the
extraction<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:40.030> what<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.450> did<00:02:41.220> here's<00:02:42.220> a<00:02:42.310> look

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
extraction so what I did here's a look

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.610 
extraction so what I did here's a look
at<00:02:42.820> you<00:02:43.060> can<00:02:43.210> see<00:02:43.390> here's<00:02:43.660> a<00:02:43.720> typical<00:02:43.990> espresso

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
at you can see here's a typical espresso

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.800 
at you can see here's a typical espresso
grind<00:02:45.070> as<00:02:45.370> compared<00:02:45.820> to<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.120> grind<00:02:46.360> I<00:02:46.510> ended

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
we did that when I was a little bit too

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
we did that when I was a little bit too
coarse<00:03:05.980> on<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.280> grind

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670

coarse on the grind
I<00:03:06.730> really<00:03:07.090> didn't<00:03:07.330> produce<00:03:07.480> any<00:03:07.840> crema<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:08.410> it

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
I really didn't produce any crema and it

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.740 
I really didn't produce any crema and it
was<00:03:08.560> a<00:03:08.590> rather<00:03:08.770> wheat<00:03:09.520> cup<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:09.910> coffee<00:03:10.120> when<00:03:10.690> I

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
was a rather wheat cup of coffee when I

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.720 
was a rather wheat cup of coffee when I
got<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.020> grind<00:03:11.290> dialed<00:03:11.680> in<00:03:11.800> just<00:03:11.830> right<00:03:12.280> I<00:03:12.550> hit

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
got the grind dialed in just right I hit

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.420 
got the grind dialed in just right I hit
it<00:03:12.760> right<00:03:12.850> at<00:03:13.060> 25<00:03:13.570> seconds<00:03:14.140> got<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.650> nice<00:03:14.950> layer

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
it right at 25 seconds got a nice layer

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.420 
it right at 25 seconds got a nice layer
of<00:03:15.670> crema<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.209> created<00:03:16.930> a<00:03:16.989> nice<00:03:17.200> bold<00:03:17.739> cup

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
of crema and created a nice bold cup

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.670 
of crema and created a nice bold cup
didn't<00:03:18.850> taste<00:03:19.000> too<00:03:19.150> thin<00:03:19.540> wasn't<00:03:19.989> too<00:03:20.110> much<00:03:20.350> it

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
didn't taste too thin wasn't too much it

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.340 
didn't taste too thin wasn't too much it
was<00:03:20.800> just<00:03:21.220> right<00:03:21.430> kind<00:03:21.880> of<00:03:21.940> Goldilocks<00:03:22.350> mark

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
was just right kind of Goldilocks mark

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.570 
was just right kind of Goldilocks mark
one<00:03:23.500> thing<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:23.769> did<00:03:23.980> that<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:24.220> told<00:03:24.430> me<00:03:24.519> about

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
one thing you did that you told me about

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.570 
one thing you did that you told me about
was<00:03:25.030> you<00:03:25.450> use<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:25.780> s<00:03:25.930> Pro<00:03:26.230> calibrated<00:03:27.190> tamper

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
was you use the s Pro calibrated tamper

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.880 
was you use the s Pro calibrated tamper
now<00:03:27.730> why<00:03:27.880> did<00:03:28.060> you<00:03:28.180> do<00:03:28.300> that<00:03:28.450> well<00:03:29.290> I<00:03:29.320> find<00:03:29.739> that

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
now why did you do that well I find that

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.040 
now why did you do that well I find that
it's<00:03:30.250> much<00:03:30.459> easier<00:03:31.060> if<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.269> use<00:03:31.420> a<00:03:31.480> calibrated

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
it's much easier if you use a calibrated

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.990 
it's much easier if you use a calibrated
tamper<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:33.040> take<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.519> you<00:03:33.790> know<00:03:33.880> the

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
tamper you take the you know the

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.370 
tamper you take the you know the
difference<00:03:34.360> in<00:03:34.510> tamping<00:03:34.840> pressure<00:03:35.050> out<00:03:35.350> of

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
difference in tamping pressure out of

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.990 
difference in tamping pressure out of
the<00:03:35.530> equation<00:03:36.040> when<00:03:36.220> you're<00:03:36.370> trying<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:36.790> find

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
the equation when you're trying to find

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.240 
the equation when you're trying to find
just<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.600> right<00:03:37.630> grind<00:03:38.080> so<00:03:38.350> as<00:03:38.500> you<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:39.160> know

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
just the right grind so as you you know

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.490 
just the right grind so as you you know
pull<00:03:39.489> a<00:03:39.519> couple<00:03:39.790> of<00:03:40.000> shots<00:03:40.350> you're<00:03:41.350> always

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
pull a couple of shots you're always

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.500 
pull a couple of shots you're always
using<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.920> same<00:03:42.130> tamp<00:03:42.430> pressure<00:03:42.760> but<00:03:43.420> you're

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
using the same tamp pressure but you're

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.509 
using the same tamp pressure but you're
only<00:03:43.780> changing<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.530> grind<00:03:44.799> size<00:03:45.100> so<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:45.370> just

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
only changing the grind size so it just

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.330 
only changing the grind size so it just
makes<00:03:45.670> a<00:03:45.790> lot<00:03:46.090> easier<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:47.170> zero<00:03:47.680> in<00:03:47.920> on<00:03:48.190> the

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
makes a lot easier to zero in on the

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.460 
makes a lot easier to zero in on the
proper<00:03:48.670> grind<00:03:48.940> so<00:03:49.750> mark<00:03:49.930> because<00:03:50.200> we're<00:03:50.350> using

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
proper grind so mark because we're using

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.530 
proper grind so mark because we're using
a<00:03:50.680> coarser<00:03:51.160> grind<00:03:51.370> do<00:03:51.640> you<00:03:51.730> have<00:03:51.880> any<00:03:52.060> dosing

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
a coarser grind do you have any dosing

yeah I mean I had some problems

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.539 
yeah I mean I had some problems
initially<00:03:56.440> because<00:03:56.709> I<00:03:56.860> you<00:03:57.070> know<00:03:57.130> did<00:03:57.310> it<00:03:57.340> like

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
initially because I you know did it like

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:58.590 
initially because I you know did it like
I<00:03:57.640> was<00:03:57.730> gonna<00:03:57.820> do<00:03:57.940> a<00:03:57.970> normal<00:03:58.269> shot<00:03:58.420> of<00:03:58.510> espresso

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
right to the top swiped it off cam two

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.080 
right to the top swiped it off cam two
down<00:04:02.620> and<00:04:02.769> because<00:04:03.040> it's<00:04:03.190> coarser<00:04:03.610> it's<00:04:03.850> not

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
down and because it's coarser it's not

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.390 
down and because it's coarser it's not
going<00:04:04.299> to<00:04:04.360> tamp<00:04:04.600> as<00:04:04.840> much<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.799> I<00:04:06.040> wasn't<00:04:06.340> able

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
going to tamp as much and I wasn't able

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.220 
going to tamp as much and I wasn't able
to<00:04:06.610> lock<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:06.940> Porta<00:04:07.239> filter<00:04:07.269> into<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.049> group

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
to lock the Porta filter into the group

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.810 
to lock the Porta filter into the group
headed<00:04:08.470> off<00:04:08.709> so<00:04:09.220> what<00:04:09.340> I<00:04:09.370> did<00:04:09.610> was<00:04:09.790> just

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
headed off so what I did was just

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.640 
headed off so what I did was just
slightly<00:04:10.209> under<00:04:10.450> dose<00:04:11.110> the<00:04:11.350> Porta<00:04:11.620> filter

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
slightly under dose the Porta filter

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.680 
slightly under dose the Porta filter
just<00:04:12.519> enough<00:04:12.880> and<00:04:13.060> you<00:04:13.120> have<00:04:13.269> to<00:04:13.360> find<00:04:13.570> that

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
just enough and you have to find that

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.630 
just enough and you have to find that
spot<00:04:14.049> where<00:04:14.350> then<00:04:14.650> you<00:04:14.799> will<00:04:15.070> be<00:04:15.250> able<00:04:15.430> to<00:04:15.489> lock

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
spot where then you will be able to lock

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.610 
spot where then you will be able to lock
the<00:04:15.820> Porta<00:04:16.090> filter<00:04:16.120> in<00:04:16.600> now<00:04:17.080> what<00:04:17.229> some<00:04:17.470> people

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
the Porta filter in now what some people

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.610 
the Porta filter in now what some people
will<00:04:17.890> do<00:04:18.130> is<00:04:18.430> use<00:04:19.150> a<00:04:19.180> triple<00:04:19.690> shot<00:04:19.870> basket<00:04:20.500> so

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
will do is use a triple shot basket so

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.529 
will do is use a triple shot basket so
they<00:04:20.739> can<00:04:20.890> use<00:04:21.039> the<00:04:21.250> same<00:04:21.489> dose<00:04:21.820> and<00:04:22.120> still<00:04:22.390> get

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
they can use the same dose and still get

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.310 
they can use the same dose and still get
that<00:04:22.570> Porta<00:04:22.990> filter<00:04:23.020> to<00:04:23.410> lock<00:04:23.590> in

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
that Porta filter to lock in

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.230 
that Porta filter to lock in
Arkan<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:24.920> were<00:04:25.040> experimenting<00:04:25.550> you<00:04:25.940> had<00:04:26.120> to

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
Arkan you were experimenting you had to

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.090 
Arkan you were experimenting you had to
adjust<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.660> grind<00:04:26.840> a<00:04:27.050> few<00:04:27.230> times<00:04:27.470> now<00:04:27.770> how<00:04:27.950> did

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
adjust the grind a few times now how did

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.890 
adjust the grind a few times now how did
you<00:04:28.190> know<00:04:28.400> when<00:04:28.580> you<00:04:28.670> had<00:04:28.820> it<00:04:28.910> right

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
you know when you had it right

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.110 
you know when you had it right
well<00:04:30.410> first<00:04:30.680> was<00:04:30.920> you<00:04:31.220> know<00:04:31.310> getting<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:31.880> time

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
well first was you know getting the time

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.970 
well first was you know getting the time
right<00:04:32.420> so<00:04:32.480> if<00:04:32.780> I<00:04:32.870> was<00:04:33.020> in<00:04:33.170> that<00:04:33.500> twenty<00:04:33.890> to

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
right so if I was in that twenty to

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.800 
right so if I was in that twenty to
thirty<00:04:34.190> second<00:04:34.610> range<00:04:34.790> I<00:04:35.000> knew<00:04:35.300> I<00:04:35.330> was<00:04:35.570> doing

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
thirty second range I knew I was doing

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.840 
thirty second range I knew I was doing
well<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.590> other<00:04:36.710> thing<00:04:36.950> is<00:04:37.130> when<00:04:37.610> I<00:04:37.640> was

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
well the other thing is when I was

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.340 
well the other thing is when I was
grinding<00:04:38.000> a<00:04:38.210> little<00:04:38.390> bit<00:04:38.510> too<00:04:38.660> coarse<00:04:39.080> I

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
grinding a little bit too coarse I

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.560 
grinding a little bit too coarse I
really<00:04:40.130> wasn't<00:04:40.310> getting<00:04:40.640> much<00:04:40.820> of<00:04:40.880> a<00:04:41.090> crema<00:04:41.360> so

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
really wasn't getting much of a crema so

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.270 
really wasn't getting much of a crema so
I<00:04:41.630> wasn't<00:04:41.960> really<00:04:42.200> you<00:04:42.380> know<00:04:42.500> getting<00:04:43.070> the

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
I wasn't really you know getting the

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.040 
I wasn't really you know getting the
oils<00:04:43.700> out<00:04:43.940> of<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.150> coffee<00:04:44.390> that<00:04:44.720> are<00:04:44.840> really

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
oils out of the coffee that are really

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
oils out of the coffee that are really
going<00:04:45.170> to<00:04:45.230> give<00:04:45.350> you<00:04:45.440> a<00:04:45.500> lot<00:04:45.680> of<00:04:45.800> that<00:04:45.890> flavor

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
going to give you a lot of that flavor

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.980 
going to give you a lot of that flavor
so<00:04:46.520> when<00:04:46.910> I<00:04:46.940> got<00:04:47.120> it<00:04:47.210> just<00:04:47.390> right<00:04:47.570> I<00:04:47.750> was

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
so when I got it just right I was

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.570 
so when I got it just right I was
getting<00:04:48.200> just<00:04:48.320> a<00:04:48.470> nice<00:04:48.680> layer<00:04:48.920> of<00:04:49.070> crema<00:04:49.340> on

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
getting just a nice layer of crema on

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.370 
getting just a nice layer of crema on
the<00:04:49.670> top<00:04:49.850> of<00:04:50.000> the<00:04:50.060> coffee<00:04:50.300> and<00:04:50.870> also<00:04:51.170> hitting

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
the top of the coffee and also hitting

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.350 
the top of the coffee and also hitting
it<00:04:51.560> right<00:04:51.710> at<00:04:51.830> 25<00:04:52.220> seconds<00:04:52.670> for<00:04:52.850> a<00:04:52.880> six<00:04:53.150> ounce

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
it right at 25 seconds for a six ounce

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.120 
it right at 25 seconds for a six ounce
cup<00:04:53.720> and<00:04:53.930> then<00:04:54.320> of<00:04:54.410> course<00:04:54.650> you<00:04:54.950> know<00:04:55.070> you

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
cup and then of course you know you

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.730 
cup and then of course you know you
taste<00:04:55.460> it<00:04:55.760> and<00:04:55.940> it<00:04:56.780> just<00:04:56.810> there<00:04:57.230> was<00:04:57.350> just<00:04:57.590> such

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
taste it and it just there was just such

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.170 
taste it and it just there was just such
a<00:04:57.770> difference<00:04:58.190> between<00:04:58.220> a<00:04:58.520> grind<00:04:58.880> that<00:04:59.030> was

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
a difference between a grind that was

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.120 
a difference between a grind that was
just<00:04:59.450> right<00:04:59.720> and<00:04:59.900> a<00:05:00.290> grind<00:05:00.590> that<00:05:00.770> was<00:05:00.920> to

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
just right and a grind that was to

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.920 
just right and a grind that was to
coarse<00:05:01.520> where<00:05:02.150> it<00:05:02.240> didn't<00:05:02.540> produce<00:05:02.660> that

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
coarse where it didn't produce that

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.710 
coarse where it didn't produce that
crema<00:05:03.260> so<00:05:04.100> let's<00:05:04.280> recap<00:05:04.700> if<00:05:04.970> somebody<00:05:05.360> wants

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
crema so let's recap if somebody wants

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.720 
crema so let's recap if somebody wants
to<00:05:05.750> make<00:05:05.870> a<00:05:06.020> cafe<00:05:06.530> crumb<00:05:06.800> at<00:05:06.920> home<00:05:07.160> using<00:05:07.460> a

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
to make a cafe crumb at home using a

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.790 
to make a cafe crumb at home using a
semi<00:05:08.060> automatic<00:05:08.210> machine<00:05:08.900> what<00:05:09.380> are<00:05:09.470> the<00:05:09.560> key

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
semi automatic machine what are the key

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.410 
semi automatic machine what are the key
points<00:05:10.250> that<00:05:10.310> they<00:05:10.520> need<00:05:10.670> to<00:05:10.820> know<00:05:10.940> well

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
points that they need to know well

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.340 
points that they need to know well
there's<00:05:11.690> a<00:05:11.750> lot<00:05:11.870> of<00:05:11.960> different<00:05:12.230> methods

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
there's a lot of different methods

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.990 
there's a lot of different methods
hopefully<00:05:12.800> we've<00:05:13.130> given<00:05:13.250> you<00:05:13.430> a<00:05:13.460> good<00:05:13.640> start

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
hopefully we've given you a good start

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.840 
hopefully we've given you a good start
but<00:05:14.840> I<00:05:14.900> think<00:05:15.020> it's<00:05:15.440> all<00:05:15.620> about<00:05:15.890> the<00:05:16.250> grind<00:05:16.520> and

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
but I think it's all about the grind and

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.760 
but I think it's all about the grind and
but<00:05:17.390> more<00:05:17.570> importantly<00:05:17.990> is<00:05:18.110> a<00:05:18.140> consistent

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
but more importantly is a consistent

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.400 
but more importantly is a consistent
tamp<00:05:19.070> as<00:05:19.250> your<00:05:19.400> zero<00:05:19.700> in<00:05:20.000> on<00:05:20.210> that<00:05:20.390> grind<00:05:20.690> also

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
tamp as your zero in on that grind also

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.660 
tamp as your zero in on that grind also
you<00:05:21.470> want<00:05:21.650> to<00:05:21.680> look<00:05:21.740> for<00:05:21.920> that<00:05:22.040> 20<00:05:22.370> to<00:05:22.460> 30

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
you want to look for that 20 to 30

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.520 
you want to look for that 20 to 30
second<00:05:23.030> extraction<00:05:23.600> time<00:05:23.840> if<00:05:24.320> you're<00:05:24.440> going

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
second extraction time if you're going

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.990 
second extraction time if you're going
to<00:05:24.620> use<00:05:24.710> a<00:05:24.740> double<00:05:24.920> shot<00:05:25.190> basket<00:05:25.760> you're<00:05:25.880> going

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
to use a double shot basket you're going

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.190 
to use a double shot basket you're going
to<00:05:26.060> want<00:05:26.180> to<00:05:26.210> under<00:05:26.480> fill<00:05:26.660> it<00:05:26.780> a<00:05:26.840> little<00:05:27.020> bit

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
to want to under fill it a little bit

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.540 
to want to under fill it a little bit
because<00:05:27.350> it's<00:05:27.560> not<00:05:27.620> going<00:05:27.860> to<00:05:27.950> compress<00:05:28.280> as

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
because it's not going to compress as

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.860 
because it's not going to compress as
much<00:05:28.700> because<00:05:28.910> it's<00:05:29.060> a<00:05:29.090> little<00:05:29.270> coarser<00:05:29.690> or

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
much because it's a little coarser or

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.740 
much because it's a little coarser or
consider<00:05:30.590> using<00:05:30.770> a<00:05:30.980> triple<00:05:31.160> shot<00:05:31.430> basket<00:05:31.910> okay

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
consider using a triple shot basket okay

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.720 
consider using a triple shot basket okay
so<00:05:33.290> that's<00:05:33.470> Mark's<00:05:33.830> method<00:05:34.190> for<00:05:34.430> making<00:05:34.670> a

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730
