very<00:00:35.340> intense<00:00:35.760> spectrum<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:36.989> like<00:00:37.770> but<00:00:38.370> you

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
very intense spectrum just like but you

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.770 
very intense spectrum just like but you
have<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.640> be<00:00:38.730> careful<00:00:39.090> using<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.390> spectrum

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
have to be careful using a spectrum

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.069 
have to be careful using a spectrum
because<00:00:41.180> just<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.540> sun's<00:00:42.780> powerful

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
because just like the sun's powerful

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.830 
because just like the sun's powerful
Ray's<00:00:43.260> if<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.680> leave<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.010> too<00:00:44.250> long<00:00:44.840> your

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
Ray's if you leave it on too long your

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.779 
Ray's if you leave it on too long your
plants<00:00:46.230> will<00:00:46.350> burn<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.309> get<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.489> tan

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
plants will burn just like we get a tan

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.410 
plants will burn just like we get a tan
from<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.180> very<00:00:48.930> powerful<00:00:49.140> Sun<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.460> without

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
from a very powerful Sun so without

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.139 
from a very powerful Sun so without
further<00:00:51.629> ado<00:00:52.050> let's<00:00:52.320> plug<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:53.010> guy<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.910> and

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
further ado let's plug this guy in and

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.830 
further ado let's plug this guy in and
see<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:58.760> ok<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.239> now<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:00.480> have<00:01:00.719> it

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
see what it's like ok so now we have it

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.830 
see what it's like ok so now we have it
plugged<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:02.010> as<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.489> see<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:03.449> can

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
plugged in and as you can see I can

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.539 
plugged in and as you can see I can
switch<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.320> back<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.500> forth<00:01:04.890> between<00:01:05.040> bej<00:01:05.339> and

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
switch it back and forth between bej and

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.240 
switch it back and forth between bej and
bloom<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.570> UVB<00:01:06.900> lights<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.680> off<00:01:07.830> so

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
bloom and the UVB lights on and off so

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.520 
bloom and the UVB lights on and off so
I'll<00:01:08.850> pick<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.090> up<00:01:09.299> now<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.020> veg<00:01:10.229> state

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
I'll pick it up now in the veg state

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.330 
I'll pick it up now in the veg state
with<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> UVB<00:01:11.159> off<00:01:11.610> oh<00:01:12.950> I'm<00:01:13.950> sorry<00:01:14.159> that's

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
with the UVB off oh I'm sorry that's

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.280 
with the UVB off oh I'm sorry that's
pretty<00:01:14.640> bright<00:01:14.820> for<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.090> canner<00:01:15.299> man<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:15.840> so

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
pretty bright for the canner man but so

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.710 
pretty bright for the canner man but so
here's<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.710> veg<00:01:16.979> if<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.939> want<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.210> switch<00:01:18.390> it

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
here's the veg if I want to switch it

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.070 
here's the veg if I want to switch it
over<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.020> bloom<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:20.210> just<00:01:21.210> do<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.509> there<00:01:21.869> and

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
over to bloom I just do that there and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.070 
over to bloom I just do that there and
now<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.920> spectrum<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.549> more<00:01:23.729> optimized<00:01:24.330> with

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
now this spectrum is more optimized with

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.080 
now this spectrum is more optimized with
the<00:01:25.350> deep<00:01:25.890> red<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.250> reds<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.880> warm

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
the deep red and reds and the warm

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.149 
the deep red and reds and the warm
whites<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:28.049> now<00:01:28.170> if<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.320> want<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.590> turn<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.799> UVB

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
whites and now if I want to turn the UVB

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.030 
whites and now if I want to turn the UVB
on<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.180> put<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.509> switch<00:01:30.750> here<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.259> now

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
on I just put the switch here and now

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.950 
on I just put the switch here and now
those<00:01:32.310> lights<00:01:32.610> will<00:01:32.729> go<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:37.860> now<00:01:38.960> they

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
those lights will go on so now they

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.740 
those lights will go on so now they
designed<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.590> life<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.250> be<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:42.420> four

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
more uniform light spread and you know

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.820 
more uniform light spread and you know
what<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.869> if

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
what this is if

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.170 
what this is if
use<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.160> correctly<00:01:50.580> in<00:01:50.730> the<00:01:50.820> right<00:01:50.970> size

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
use this correctly in the right size

to be about a four by four to five by
five<00:01:54.770> although<00:01:55.770> with<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.040> light<00:01:56.190> mover<00:01:56.490> you

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
five although with the light mover you

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.860 
five although with the light mover you
could<00:01:56.730> probably<00:01:56.880> cover<00:01:57.180> about<00:01:57.420> four<00:01:57.690> by<00:01:57.840> eight

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
could probably cover about four by eight

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.620 
could probably cover about four by eight
area<00:01:58.370> you<00:01:59.370> can<00:01:59.490> end<00:01:59.640> up<00:01:59.700> using<00:01:59.880> about<00:02:00.210> fifty

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
area you can end up using about fifty

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.740 
area you can end up using about fifty
percent<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.050> power<00:02:01.550> as<00:02:02.550> a<00:02:03.000> comparable

percent of the power as a comparable
light<00:02:03.960> output<00:02:04.350> hid<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.420> one<00:02:06.600> has<00:02:06.750> a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
light output hid like so this one has a

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.580 
light output hid like so this one has a
hundred<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.290> sixty<00:02:07.740> five<00:02:08.729> watt<00:02:09.090> LEDs<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:10.229> has

hundred and sixty five watt LEDs and has

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.790 
hundred and sixty five watt LEDs and has
two<00:02:11.010> axial<00:02:11.520> fans<00:02:11.790> built<00:02:12.120> in<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.620> cool<00:02:13.620> these

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
two axial fans built in that cool these

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.400 
two axial fans built in that cool these
lights<00:02:14.070> over<00:02:14.310> heat<00:02:14.520> sinks<00:02:14.910> but<00:02:15.140> I'm<00:02:16.140> putting

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
lights over heat sinks but I'm putting

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.930 
lights over heat sinks but I'm putting
my<00:02:16.500> hand<00:02:16.770> against<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.370> right<00:02:17.520> here<00:02:17.790> and

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
my hand against it right here and

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.050 
my hand against it right here and
honestly<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.900> heat<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.290> minimal<00:02:20.250> I'd<00:02:20.790> really

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
honestly the heat is minimal I'd really

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.870 
honestly the heat is minimal I'd really
feel<00:02:21.120> anything<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.980> with<00:02:22.980> all<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.430> lights<00:02:23.610> on

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
feel anything and with all the lights on

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.390 
feel anything and with all the lights on
this<00:02:24.060> only<00:02:24.540> draws<00:02:24.870> about<00:02:25.080> 5.5<00:02:26.010> names<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:28.400> they

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
this only draws about 5.5 names and they

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.949 
this only draws about 5.5 names and they
have<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:29.760> line<00:02:30.030> with<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.240> two<00:02:30.690> year<00:02:30.720> warranty

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
have this line with a two year warranty

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.600 
have this line with a two year warranty
and<00:02:31.709> an<00:02:32.160> eighty<00:02:32.430> thousand<00:02:33.120> our<00:02:33.330> expected<00:02:33.900> life

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
and an eighty thousand our expected life

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.060 
and an eighty thousand our expected life
so<00:02:35.610> when<00:02:36.420> we<00:02:36.600> go<00:02:37.020> bring<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.260> into<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.530> tent<00:02:37.830> turn

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
so when we go bring it into a tent turn

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.670 
so when we go bring it into a tent turn
it<00:02:38.160> off<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.400> see<00:02:38.520> how<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.670> plants<00:02:39.000> like<00:02:39.120> it

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.430 

okay<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.000> we<00:02:48.330> brought<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.690> solar<00:02:48.900> storm<00:02:49.230> out

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
okay so we brought the solar storm out

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.770 
okay so we brought the solar storm out
to<00:02:49.620> our<00:02:49.770> hydro<00:02:50.280> Hut<00:02:50.490> that's<00:02:50.910> about<00:02:51.480> three<00:02:51.720> and

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
to our hydro Hut that's about three and

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.660 
to our hydro Hut that's about three and
a<00:02:51.840> half<00:02:51.870> by<00:02:52.200> three<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.530> half<00:02:52.680> feet<00:02:52.920> it's<00:02:53.610> a

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
a half by three and a half feet it's a

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.699 
a half by three and a half feet it's a
little<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.269> little<00:02:54.870> large<00:02:55.110> for<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:55.470> sized

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
little a little large for this sized

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.860 
little a little large for this sized
tent<00:02:56.040> but<00:02:56.340> um<00:02:56.550> we're<00:02:57.330> gonna<00:02:57.420> turn<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.780> on

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
tent but um we're gonna turn it on

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.690 
tent but um we're gonna turn it on
anyways<00:02:58.290> just<00:02:58.320> so<00:02:58.709> we<00:02:58.800> can<00:02:58.950> show<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.160> off<00:02:59.370> under

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
anyways just so we can show it off under

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.699 
anyways just so we can show it off under
our<00:02:59.820> basil<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.300> mint<00:03:00.420> leaves<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:01.350> I'll<00:03:01.560> go

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
our basil and mint leaves so I'll go

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.780 
our basil and mint leaves so I'll go
ahead<00:03:01.739> and<00:03:02.100> plug<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.459> in<00:03:02.580> right<00:03:02.610> now<00:03:02.970> under<00:03:03.600> the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
ahead and plug it in right now under the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.760 
ahead and plug it in right now under the
veg<00:03:05.790> cycle

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.470 

okay<00:03:11.770> and<00:03:12.040> that<00:03:12.190> lights<00:03:12.459> up<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.700> tent<00:03:13.060> quite

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
okay and that lights up the tent quite

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.780 
okay and that lights up the tent quite
nicely<00:03:13.780> I'd<00:03:14.500> probably<00:03:14.770> use<00:03:14.920> this<00:03:15.160> in<00:03:15.370> more<00:03:15.670> of

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
nicely I'd probably use this in more of

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.880 
nicely I'd probably use this in more of
a<00:03:15.880> five<00:03:16.239> by<00:03:16.450> five<00:03:16.480> ten<00:03:17.050> or<00:03:17.290> if<00:03:17.470> using<00:03:17.800> a<00:03:17.860> light

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
a five by five ten or if using a light

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.290 
a five by five ten or if using a light
rail<00:03:18.220> you<00:03:18.370> can<00:03:18.430> probably<00:03:18.640> cover<00:03:18.880> more<00:03:19.120> like<00:03:19.270> a

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
rail you can probably cover more like a

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.280 
rail you can probably cover more like a
four<00:03:19.569> by<00:03:19.780> eight<00:03:20.099> as<00:03:21.150> you<00:03:22.150> can<00:03:22.300> see<00:03:22.569> right<00:03:23.230> now

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
four by eight as you can see right now

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.699 
four by eight as you can see right now
we<00:03:23.739> have<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:23.980> UVB<00:03:24.340> on<00:03:25.080> you<00:03:26.080> can<00:03:26.200> see<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.410> here

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
we have the UVB on you can see it here

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.160 
we have the UVB on you can see it here
on<00:03:26.770> the<00:03:26.890> side<00:03:27.220> I<00:03:27.569> can<00:03:28.569> turn<00:03:28.720> it<00:03:28.840> off<00:03:28.930> for<00:03:29.110> a

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
on the side I can turn it off for a

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.720 
on the side I can turn it off for a
second<00:03:29.560> so<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.680> can<00:03:29.830> see<00:03:30.010> them<00:03:30.160> going<00:03:30.340> on<00:03:30.520> and

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
second so you can see them going on and

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.680 
second so you can see them going on and
off<00:03:30.819> and<00:03:32.730> right<00:03:33.730> now<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:33.940> veg<00:03:34.239> lights<00:03:34.540> are

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
off and right now the veg lights are

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.229 
off and right now the veg lights are
also<00:03:34.810> on<00:03:35.110> so<00:03:35.319> I'll<00:03:35.470> actually<00:03:36.040> move<00:03:36.489> those<00:03:36.790> from

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
also on so I'll actually move those from

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.250 
also on so I'll actually move those from
veg<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:39.610> flower<00:03:39.910> there's<00:03:40.300> the<00:03:40.480> flower<00:03:40.720> so<00:03:41.140> now

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
veg to flower there's the flower so now

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.420 
veg to flower there's the flower so now
you<00:03:41.349> can<00:03:41.470> see<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.709> different<00:03:42.010> spectrums

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
you can see the different spectrums

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.820 
you can see the different spectrums
going<00:03:43.150> back<00:03:43.330> and<00:03:43.510> forth<00:03:45.720> there<00:03:46.720> we<00:03:46.900> are<00:03:46.930> so

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
going back and forth there we are so

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.100 
going back and forth there we are so
that's<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.160> source<00:03:48.370> storm<00:03:48.730> I<00:03:49.030> mean<00:03:49.810> right<00:03:50.080> now

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110
