so<00:00:08.880> we've<00:00:08.970> stopped<00:00:09.240> by<00:00:09.389> Evans<00:00:09.809> cooling<00:00:10.290> here

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
so we've stopped by Evans cooling here

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.259 
so we've stopped by Evans cooling here
at<00:00:10.530> SEMA<00:00:10.679> 2010<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.639> have<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.790> chat<00:00:11.969> with<00:00:12.090> Steve

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
at SEMA 2010 to have a chat with Steve

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.360 
at SEMA 2010 to have a chat with Steve
Presley<00:00:12.750> about<00:00:13.290> waterless<00:00:13.860> cooling<00:00:14.219> mate

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
Presley about waterless cooling mate

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.279 
Presley about waterless cooling mate
this<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.580> actually<00:00:15.330> call<00:00:15.719> me<00:00:15.839> ignorant<00:00:15.929> but<00:00:16.199> if

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
this is actually call me ignorant but if

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.750 
this is actually call me ignorant but if
the<00:00:16.350> first<00:00:16.500> time<00:00:16.590> I've<00:00:16.740> heard<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.160> okay

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
the first time I've heard of it okay

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.310 
the first time I've heard of it okay
well<00:00:18.300> basically<00:00:18.420> what<00:00:18.900> we've<00:00:19.050> been<00:00:19.170> doing

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
well basically what we've been doing

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.929 
well basically what we've been doing
over<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.800> last<00:00:19.830> number<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.369> years<00:00:20.490> is

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
over the last number of years is

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.060 
over the last number of years is
developing<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.660> waterless<00:00:22.289> coolant<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.920> work

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
developing a waterless coolant to work

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.590 
developing a waterless coolant to work
in<00:00:23.250> high-performance<00:00:23.460> race<00:00:24.150> engines

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
in high-performance race engines

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.929 
in high-performance race engines
originally<00:00:25.320> developed<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.859> about<00:00:26.460> building<00:00:26.910> a

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
originally developed it about building a

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.540 
originally developed it about building a
high-output<00:00:27.359> reges<00:00:28.230> for<00:00:28.410> Chevrolet<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:28.920> it

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
high-output reges for Chevrolet and it

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.160 
high-output reges for Chevrolet and it
has<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> much<00:00:29.910> higher<00:00:29.970> boiling<00:00:30.359> point<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:31.019> we're

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
has a much higher boiling point so we're

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.870 
has a much higher boiling point so we're
able<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.619> tolerate<00:00:31.800> much<00:00:32.250> higher<00:00:32.460> compression

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
able to tolerate much higher compression

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.240 
able to tolerate much higher compression
ratios<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.899> much<00:00:34.140> higher<00:00:34.290> horsepower<00:00:34.590> level

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
ratios and much higher horsepower level

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.650 
ratios and much higher horsepower level
sounds<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> little<00:00:36.059> bit<00:00:36.120> about<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> history<00:00:36.420> of

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
sounds a little bit about the history of

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
sounds a little bit about the history of
the<00:00:36.780> company<00:00:36.899> cuz<00:00:37.140> you've<00:00:37.230> been<00:00:37.320> around<00:00:37.469> for<00:00:37.649> a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
the company cuz you've been around for a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.160 
the company cuz you've been around for a
while<00:00:37.739> now<00:00:38.040> yeah<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:38.969> actually<00:00:39.149> i<00:00:39.390> joined<00:00:39.899> Jack

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
while now yeah we actually i joined Jack

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.810 
while now yeah we actually i joined Jack
Evans<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> late<00:00:40.890> 80s<00:00:41.309> we<00:00:41.460> were<00:00:41.550> working

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
Evans in the late 80s we were working

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.310 
Evans in the late 80s we were working
for<00:00:42.000> Corvette<00:00:42.450> group<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.840> Chevrolet

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
for Corvette group of Chevrolet

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.260 
for Corvette group of Chevrolet
developing<00:00:44.010> not<00:00:44.460> only<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.850> waterless

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
developing not only the waterless

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.510 
developing not only the waterless
systems<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:45.930> reverse<00:00:46.320> flow<00:00:46.620> cooling<00:00:47.070> systems

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
systems but reverse flow cooling systems

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.220 
systems but reverse flow cooling systems
and<00:00:47.910> then<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> years<00:00:48.510> since<00:00:48.719> then<00:00:49.020> we've

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
and then in the years since then we've

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.049 
and then in the years since then we've
developed<00:00:49.469> several<00:00:50.219> other<00:00:50.489> waterless

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
developed several other waterless

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.689 
developed several other waterless

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
coordinate and go with it it's basically

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.950 
coordinate and go with it it's basically
really<00:00:56.160> looking<00:00:56.610> at<00:00:56.670> as<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.940> system<00:00:57.539> all<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
really looking at as a system all of the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.270 
really looking at as a system all of the
components<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.649> be<00:00:58.739> working<00:00:59.129> together

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
components have to be working together

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.250 
components have to be working together
what<00:01:00.239> are<00:01:00.329> some<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.539> benefits<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:01.079> using

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
what are some of the benefits of using

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.569 
what are some of the benefits of using
waterless<00:01:01.890> calling<00:01:02.190> versus<00:01:02.460> traditional

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
waterless calling versus traditional

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.359 
waterless calling versus traditional
cord<00:01:03.180> well<00:01:03.780> besides<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.799> fact<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.070> once<00:01:05.280> you

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
cord well besides the fact that once you

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.740 
cord well besides the fact that once you
get<00:01:05.489> rid<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.820> water<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.270> get<00:01:06.390> rid<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.600> all

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
get rid of the water you get rid of all

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.990 
get rid of the water you get rid of all
the<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.320> rust<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.830> corrosion<00:01:08.189> scale<00:01:08.790> and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
the the rust the corrosion scale and

260 our boiling point is 375 to 400
degrees<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.009> racing<00:01:20.369> applications<00:01:20.600> we're

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
degrees so in racing applications we're

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.450 
degrees so in racing applications we're
actually<00:01:21.810> able<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.350> go<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.650> elevated

SEMA is the high-performance water pump
yeah<00:01:34.829> we<00:01:35.159> do<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.340> lot<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.610> high<00:01:35.880> flow<00:01:36.150> coolant

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
yeah we do a lot of high flow coolant

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.270 
yeah we do a lot of high flow coolant
pumps<00:01:36.869> because<00:01:37.170> now<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:37.829> don't<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
pumps because now that we don't have the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.010 
pumps because now that we don't have the
hump<00:01:38.460> cavitation<00:01:39.150> problems<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.810> water

system and benefit from the fact that

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.130 
system and benefit from the fact that
the<00:01:44.880> more<00:01:45.090> coolant<00:01:45.450> we<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.720> pump<00:01:45.899> through<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
the more coolant we can pump through the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.080 
the more coolant we can pump through the
engine<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:47.009> more<00:01:47.189> heat<00:01:47.399> we<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.670> bring<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
engine the more heat we can bring to the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.999 
engine the more heat we can bring to the
radiator<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.689> dissipate<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.680> what<00:01:49.829> we've<00:01:49.979> done

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
radiator to dissipate so what we've done

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.670 
radiator to dissipate so what we've done
is<00:01:50.220> develop<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.880> line<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.420> high<00:01:51.899> flow<00:01:52.229> coolant

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
is develop the line of high flow coolant

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.160 
is develop the line of high flow coolant
pumps<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.159> be<00:01:53.189> able<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.640> increase<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.630> flow<00:01:54.869> to

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170
