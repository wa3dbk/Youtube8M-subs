00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
both let's have a look at this first we

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.580 
both let's have a look at this first we
do<00:01:50.979> get<00:01:51.159> these<00:01:51.310> of<00:01:51.520> soft<00:01:52.229> robot<00:01:53.229> wheels

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
do get these of soft robot wheels

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.590 
do get these of soft robot wheels
because<00:01:54.039> he<00:01:54.249> needs<00:01:54.759> to<00:01:54.969> be<00:01:55.090> able<00:01:55.179> to<00:01:55.359> bounce
