I'm<00:00:22.650> shooting<00:00:22.890> super<00:00:23.430> slow<00:00:23.580> motion<00:00:23.759> takes<00:00:24.210> on

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
I'm shooting super slow motion takes on

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.189 
I'm shooting super slow motion takes on
my<00:00:24.750> NEX<00:00:25.200> fs700<00:00:25.910> so<00:00:26.910> first<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.360> all<00:00:27.450> list<00:00:27.689> let's

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
my NEX fs700 so first of all list let's

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.500 
my NEX fs700 so first of all list let's
take<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> look<00:00:28.680> at<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.890> am<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.369> pal<00:00:29.849> or<00:00:30.090> 50

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
take a look at that I am on pal or 50

at 25 P Full HD resolution and I also I

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.720 
at 25 P Full HD resolution and I also I
have<00:00:37.050> configured<00:00:37.559> my<00:00:37.739> slow<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.220> quick<00:00:38.339> motion

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
have configured my slow and quick motion

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.060 
have configured my slow and quick motion
that<00:00:39.089> is<00:00:39.239> from<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.540> left<00:00:39.720> part<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.710> other

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.850 
that is from the left part of the other
camera<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.030> with<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.750> one<00:00:42.989> press<00:00:43.620> on

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860

camera so that with just one press on
the<00:00:43.979> bottom<00:00:44.220> I<00:00:44.400> turned<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.030> camera<00:00:45.150> not<00:00:45.690> into

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:46.229 
the bottom I turned the camera not into

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:49.670 
the bottom I turned the camera not into
the<00:00:46.350> slow<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.739> quick<00:00:46.949> regular<00:00:48.080> function<00:00:49.080> but

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
the slow and quick regular function but

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.430 
the slow and quick regular function but
into<00:00:49.979> the<00:00:50.159> super<00:00:50.610> slow<00:00:50.790> motion<00:00:51.049> in<00:00:52.049> this<00:00:52.229> case

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
into the super slow motion in this case

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.009 
into the super slow motion in this case
as<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.830> am<00:00:52.979> known<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.400> power<00:00:53.729> 50<00:00:54.239> Hertz<00:00:54.449> mode<00:00:54.750> I

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
as I am known that power 50 Hertz mode I

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.939 
as I am known that power 50 Hertz mode I
was<00:00:55.799> talking<00:00:56.070> about<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.489> can<00:00:57.059> reach<00:00:57.269> up<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.949> 800

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
was talking about I can reach up to 800

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.920 
was talking about I can reach up to 800
frames<00:00:59.460> per<00:00:59.670> second<00:01:00.030> however<00:01:00.299> I<00:01:00.690> have

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
frames per second however I have

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.109 
frames per second however I have
configured<00:01:01.290> it<00:01:01.619> so<00:01:02.220> that<00:01:02.369> I'm<00:01:02.549> shooting<00:01:02.970> at

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:03.119 
configured it so that I'm shooting at

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:05.780 
configured it so that I'm shooting at
200<00:01:03.689> frames<00:01:03.869> per<00:01:04.229> second<00:01:04.559> why<00:01:04.860> because<00:01:05.189> this

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
200 frames per second why because this

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.530 
200 frames per second why because this
is<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> maximum<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.900> maximum<00:01:07.229> speed<00:01:07.860> at<00:01:08.540> Full

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
is the maximum the maximum speed at Full

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.820 
is the maximum the maximum speed at Full

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
were to go into 800 for instance 800

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.340 
were to go into 800 for instance 800
frames<00:01:20.579> per<00:01:20.759> second<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.689> sensor<00:01:22.049> would<00:01:22.229> be

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
frames per second the sensor would be

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.510 
frames per second the sensor would be
scanned<00:01:22.740> about<00:01:22.979> 20<00:01:23.729> or<00:01:24.240> 25%<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.070> lines<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
scanned about 20 or 25% of the lines the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.450 
scanned about 20 or 25% of the lines the
vertical<00:01:27.469> the<00:01:28.469> vertical<00:01:28.890> resolution<00:01:29.009> is

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
vertical the vertical resolution is

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.060 
vertical the vertical resolution is
decreased<00:01:30.079> so<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.560> case<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.009> is

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
decreased so in that case it is

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.039 
decreased so in that case it is
interpolate<00:01:32.789> that<00:01:32.820> or<00:01:33.060> inflated<00:01:33.600> into<00:01:33.719> full

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
interpolate that or inflated into full

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.380 
interpolate that or inflated into full
HD<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.499> the<00:01:34.950> quality<00:01:35.310> obviously<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.880> smaller

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
HD and the quality obviously is smaller

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.260 
HD and the quality obviously is smaller
so<00:01:36.780> for<00:01:37.109> analysis<00:01:37.829> or<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.249> crash<00:01:38.549> test<00:01:38.939> or

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
so for analysis or for crash test or

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.450 
so for analysis or for crash test or
something<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.929> is<00:01:40.049> very<00:01:40.079> useful<00:01:40.710> but

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
something like that is very useful but

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.730 
something like that is very useful but
from<00:01:41.909> my<00:01:41.999> point<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.329> view<00:01:42.390> not<00:01:42.689> for<00:01:43.020> full<00:01:43.409> HD

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
from my point of view not for full HD

from my point of view not for full HD
media<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.819> will<00:01:45.030> be<00:01:45.149> shown<00:01:45.659> or<00:01:46.229> displayed<00:01:46.799> in

a in a bigger screen also you can see on

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.969 
a in a bigger screen also you can see on

the right part of the LCD that the end

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.739 
the right part of the LCD that the end
trigger<00:01:53.280> mode<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.700> activated<00:01:54.179> that<00:01:54.539> and

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:54.749 
trigger mode is activated that and

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:57.109 
trigger mode is activated that and
trigger<00:01:55.020> mode<00:01:55.259> allows<00:01:56.159> me<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.609> record<00:01:56.759> what

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
has happened in the past let me explain

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.969 
has happened in the past let me explain
that<00:01:59.369> because<00:01:59.789> it<00:01:59.939> sounds<00:02:00.749> obviously<00:02:01.530> strange

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
that because it sounds obviously strange

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.730 
that because it sounds obviously strange
as<00:02:02.789> the<00:02:02.939> camera<00:02:03.179> works<00:02:03.689> for<00:02:04.200> super<00:02:04.590> slow

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
as the camera works for super slow

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.580 
as the camera works for super slow
