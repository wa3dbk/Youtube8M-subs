00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
concepts about flowing in Tai Chi in

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.209 
concepts about flowing in Tai Chi in
which<00:00:11.040> when<00:00:11.910> we<00:00:12.059> begin<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.420> learn<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:13.710> Tai<00:00:13.950> Chi

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
which when we begin to learn the Tai Chi

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.910 
which when we begin to learn the Tai Chi
form<00:00:14.519> we<00:00:14.849> learn<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.240> one<00:00:15.870> move<00:00:16.049> at<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> time<00:00:16.650> and

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
form we learn it one move at a time and

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.010 
form we learn it one move at a time and
we<00:00:17.070> add<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.310> move<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:18.060> what<00:00:18.210> we've<00:00:18.390> learned<00:00:18.660> we

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
we add a move to what we've learned we

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.320 
we add a move to what we've learned we
practice<00:00:19.529> we<00:00:19.710> add<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.920> move<00:00:20.220> we<00:00:20.460> go<00:00:20.609> very<00:00:20.910> slowly

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
practice we add a move we go very slowly

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.290 
practice we add a move we go very slowly
very<00:00:22.430> important<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.580> do<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.880> moves<00:00:24.060> very

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
very important to do the moves very

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.620 
very important to do the moves very
slowly<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.820> eventually<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.090> long<00:00:27.269> form

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
slowly and eventually in a long form

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.529 
slowly and eventually in a long form
like<00:00:27.960> loose<00:00:28.199> style<00:00:28.439> long-form<00:00:29.160> we<00:00:29.340> learn<00:00:29.550> 108

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
like loose style long-form we learn 108

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.440 
like loose style long-form we learn 108
moves<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.309> then<00:00:32.309> we<00:00:32.460> run<00:00:32.669> away<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.180> don't

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
moves and then we run away and don't

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.830 
moves and then we run away and don't
take<00:00:34.170> lessons<00:00:34.559> anymore<00:00:35.390> one<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> things

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
take lessons anymore one of the things

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.229 
take lessons anymore one of the things
we<00:00:37.020> want<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.380> strive<00:00:37.680> for<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.340> achieve<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:39.030> Tai

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
we want to strive for and achieve in Tai

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.069 
we want to strive for and achieve in Tai
Chi<00:00:39.980> after<00:00:40.980> we<00:00:41.129> learn<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.520> form<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.329> take

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
Chi after we learn the form is to take

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.670 
Chi after we learn the form is to take
those<00:00:43.290> 108<00:00:44.219> moves<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:45.110> turn<00:00:46.110> them<00:00:46.260> into<00:00:46.410> one

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
those 108 moves and turn them into one

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.869 
those 108 moves and turn them into one
move<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.379> flowing<00:00:49.379> from<00:00:50.370> one<00:00:50.430> move

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
move to have it flowing from one move

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.580 
move to have it flowing from one move
into<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.329> next<00:00:52.610> accentuating<00:00:53.610> postures<00:00:54.590> but

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
into the next accentuating postures but

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.920 
into the next accentuating postures but
then<00:00:55.770> flowing<00:00:56.370> into<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.030> next<00:00:57.329> move<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:57.809> that

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
then flowing into the next move so that

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.660 
then flowing into the next move so that
those<00:00:58.109> 108<00:00:59.039> moves<00:00:59.570> become<00:01:00.570> one<00:01:00.870> move<00:01:01.670> flowing

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
those 108 moves become one move flowing

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.200 
those 108 moves become one move flowing
through<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.059> all<00:01:03.769> like<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> river<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:06.090> I'd<00:01:06.150> like

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
through it all like a river so I'd like

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.850 
through it all like a river so I'd like
to<00:01:06.420> demonstrate<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.960> little<00:01:07.229> bit<00:01:07.380> with<00:01:07.650> both

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
to demonstrate a little bit with both

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.600 
to demonstrate a little bit with both
whoo<00:01:08.159> style<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.760> young<00:01:08.909> style<00:01:09.299> by<00:01:09.689> doing<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
do the form 100 x 99 out of 100 times do

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.890 
do the form 100 x 99 out of 100 times do
it<00:01:27.360> movement<00:01:28.350> by<00:01:28.560> movement<00:01:29.119> very<00:01:30.119> slowly<00:01:30.540> so

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
stars we learn grasp birds tail piece by

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:14.250 
stars we learn grasp birds tail piece by
piece

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.880 

and<00:02:14.650> then<00:02:14.980> we<00:02:15.099> move<00:02:15.310> into<00:02:16.500> single<00:02:17.500> whip<00:02:17.650> with

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
and then we move into single whip with

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:26.490 
and then we move into single whip with
the<00:02:18.010> hook<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:23.620> stuff<00:02:24.519> ok<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.810> that's<00:02:25.989> one<00:02:26.290> by

one piece by piece movement after

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.380 
one piece by piece movement after
movement<00:02:29.470> done<00:02:30.159> very<00:02:30.430> slowly<00:02:30.760> it's<00:02:31.000> really

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
movement done very slowly it's really

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.559 
movement done very slowly it's really
very<00:02:31.540> good<00:02:31.659> for<00:02:31.959> you<00:02:32.049> in<00:02:32.829> young<00:02:33.159> style<00:02:33.569> going

stunna let it flow little circle into
the<00:04:57.680> back<00:04:57.860> pasture<00:05:01.240> circle

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.230 

so<00:05:16.630> there's<00:05:16.870> no<00:05:17.020> stocks<00:05:17.500> and<00:05:19.500> posture<00:05:20.500> okay
