that is why the Apache also used it for

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.760 
that is why the Apache also used it for
another<00:00:38.579> job<00:00:39.030> they<00:00:39.960> took<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> tip<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.649> a

so<00:01:00.350> tal<00:01:00.559> is<00:01:00.590> one<00:01:00.829> of<00:01:00.950> the<00:01:01.040> easiest<00:01:01.430> words<00:01:01.760> that

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
so tal is one of the easiest words that

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.700 
so tal is one of the easiest words that
you<00:01:02.090> can<00:01:02.210> use<00:01:02.390> for<00:01:02.629> friction<00:01:02.870> fire<00:01:03.290> lighting

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
you can use for friction fire lighting

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.010 
you can use for friction fire lighting
once<00:01:04.430> you've<00:01:04.580> mastered<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:05.180> technique<00:01:05.570> you

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
once you've mastered the technique you

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.010 
once you've mastered the technique you
need<00:01:06.140> never<00:01:06.440> carry<00:01:06.740> matches<00:01:07.220> here<00:01:10.900> what<00:01:11.900> I've

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
need never carry matches here what I've

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.430 
need never carry matches here what I've
done<00:01:12.200> is<00:01:12.380> I've<00:01:12.530> drilled<00:01:12.800> in<00:01:13.070> a<00:01:13.690> hole<00:01:14.690> here<00:01:15.050> the

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
done is I've drilled in a hole here the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.560 
done is I've drilled in a hole here the
same<00:01:15.710> diameter<00:01:16.100> as<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:16.940> end<00:01:17.180> of<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.300> drill

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
same diameter as the end of the drill

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.380 
same diameter as the end of the drill
now<00:01:18.560> what<00:01:18.770> I've<00:01:18.860> got<00:01:18.890> to<00:01:19.159> do<00:01:19.310> is<00:01:19.759> cut<00:01:20.060> a<00:01:20.090> notch

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
now what I've got to do is cut a notch

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.630 
now what I've got to do is cut a notch
into<00:01:20.450> this<00:01:20.930> and<00:01:21.500> that's<00:01:21.619> critical<00:01:22.190> because<00:01:22.220> in

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
into this and that's critical because in

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.790 
into this and that's critical because in
that<00:01:22.850> notch<00:01:23.180> a<00:01:23.479> small<00:01:23.960> powder<00:01:24.259> is<00:01:24.500> going<00:01:24.649> to

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
that notch a small powder is going to

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.950 
that notch a small powder is going to
collect<00:01:25.130> that<00:01:25.550> gives<00:01:25.759> us<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.180> ember<00:01:26.509> with

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
collect that gives us the ember with

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.040 
collect that gives us the ember with
which<00:01:27.110> I'll<00:01:27.259> light<00:01:27.440> my<00:01:27.590> fire<00:01:31.840> once<00:01:32.840> it's

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
which I'll light my fire once it's

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.230 
which I'll light my fire once it's
prepared<00:01:33.560> it<00:01:33.920> only<00:01:34.100> takes<00:01:34.399> a<00:01:34.520> few<00:01:34.550> seconds<00:01:35.179> to

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
prepared it only takes a few seconds to

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.840 
prepared it only takes a few seconds to
make<00:01:35.360> fire
