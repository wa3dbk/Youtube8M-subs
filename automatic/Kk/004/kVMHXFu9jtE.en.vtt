00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.479 

now<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.879> might<00:02:21.209> be<00:02:21.239> enough<00:02:22.459> spread<00:02:23.459> it

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
now that might be enough spread it

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.020 
now that might be enough spread it
around<00:02:24.560> it's<00:02:25.560> not<00:02:25.769> even<00:02:26.010> about<00:02:26.159> an<00:02:26.400> inch<00:02:26.640> layer

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030

of course if you have a glass screen if
you<00:02:29.790> don't<00:02:30.030> then<00:02:30.269> you<00:02:30.390> probably<00:02:30.569> don't<00:02:30.750> use<00:02:31.080> a

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
you don't then you probably don't use a

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.000
