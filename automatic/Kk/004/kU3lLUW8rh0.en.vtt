 many thousands of young people in the 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.610
 Brazil has identified with its history 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.010

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.050
 time and with young people need this 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.150

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.990
 we put to the position that thanks to God 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.640
 many difficulties and many years 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.340
 internal resistance because the 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.619
 different style but jesus when it came 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.690
 with the new was watched pops taylor was 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.720
 stoned stoned by themselves 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.830
 religious leaders then it is difficult to stay 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.080
 With us but it's what God wants 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.810
 influence brought the true message 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.289
 and against sin and emphasis on the word of 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.750
 God 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.940
 the singer thalles roberto presented a 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.250
 true spectacle and in one of 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.009
 moments for young people who 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.450
 prostrated worshiped God now when 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.019
 the staff is at home when 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.850
 You said arrive, I choose God, I 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.050
 I believe he has a moment in his life. 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.769
 the people we have to have to decide 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.810
 huh 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.360
 You can not stay on top of the wall. 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.670
 It may be more or less I believe 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.209
 The moment that I used a lot of drugs I drank 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.370
 and became depressed and one 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.400
 shearing but another dose could more 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.570
 feel joy and then one day I me 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.040
 I started to feel like I was going to die 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.950
 any time because he had no more 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.440
 father came out of it is not enough need 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.530
 see jesus know god and went after him 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.170
 and God's response was poured into 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.280
 rainfall and thus marked the first 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.280
 God's most night 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:08.489
 it is a complaint as such 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:11.639
 he came to bring innovation and achieve 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:15.239
 a youth in a language that in fact 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:18.060
 creates a symmetry and causes these 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.909
 young people to know the word of 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.129
 God can learn more from God and 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:26.250
 a certain way to see the show like this 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.799
 a quality that is not lost on any 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.230
 another of those that we ritually 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.419
 knows and the second night of the most god 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.340
 brought the ministry once again 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:39.629
 renewed with the participation of 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.669
 special of several children and the singer 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.469
 fernanda brum was the guest of the evening 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:47.209
 who brought the tour of his younger 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:47.209
 work of eternity 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:58.030
 the second time in tokyo and the second time a 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.830
 Was nothing today? 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.710
 What has been your concern in 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.750
 relation to Brazilian youth with 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:08.110
 awareness of the gospel 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.120
 pure is my great concern for 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.870
 that the people of this generation 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.720
 they do not understand that the gospel show he 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.340
 only artistic but understand that 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.020
 it's a great evangelism strategy 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.780
 to focus youth and 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.810
 mainly bring to feet in 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:30.360
 worship fernanda brum sang songs 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.360
 other works as the song heals me 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:44.940
 angelina jolie meanwhile, hand 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.520
 after raising awareness of the 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.010
 about the persecuted church was the 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.710
 time of the pastor and even pine to bring 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:05:00.080
 a reflection that changed the lives of several 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:05:13.620
 people including the church 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:17.400
 this is a dream of new steps were 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.710
 data in the release corridor of those 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.650
 who chose for more than god 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:26.130
 you can not have the feeling of 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.680
 gratitude to god is to say if god the lord 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.080
 challenged us, you have put a 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.500
 project in our hands for each church 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.560
 He gives us an instrument. It was the most 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.420
 of God to spread the word of the Lord 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.820
 so we have the privilege of 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.280
 renewed family to have this project 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.890
 given by God then the feeling that goes 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.630
 in our hearts sir, thank you very much 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.080
 Why did you choose us for this? 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.080
 time 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:02.400
 oh me 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.610
