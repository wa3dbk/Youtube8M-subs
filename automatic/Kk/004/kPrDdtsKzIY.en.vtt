00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.589 

I'm<00:00:26.919> not<00:00:27.099> quite<00:00:27.339> sure<00:00:27.400> when<00:00:27.939> I<00:00:27.970> got<00:00:28.239> my<00:00:28.419> first

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599

crybaby<00:00:29.140> but<00:00:29.890> I<00:00:30.880> do<00:00:30.970> remember<00:00:31.359> when<00:00:31.689> I<00:00:32.110> think<00:00:32.469> I

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
crybaby but I do remember when I think I

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.080 
crybaby but I do remember when I think I
may<00:00:32.710> have<00:00:32.739> had<00:00:33.010> one<00:00:33.219> before<00:00:33.370> I<00:00:33.640> met<00:00:33.820> the<00:00:33.940> guys

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
may have had one before I met the guys

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.780 
may have had one before I met the guys
analysis<00:00:34.750> but<00:00:35.559> that's<00:00:36.129> when<00:00:36.460> I<00:00:36.489> really

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
analysis but that's when I really

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.970 
analysis but that's when I really
started<00:00:37.120> and<00:00:37.690> I<00:00:37.780> completely<00:00:38.379> fell<00:00:38.710> in<00:00:38.829> love

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
started and I completely fell in love

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.350 
started and I completely fell in love
with<00:00:39.100> it<00:00:39.219> which<00:00:39.430> is<00:00:39.550> probably<00:00:39.850> like<00:00:39.940> you<00:00:40.329> know

of<00:01:53.950> Jerry's<00:01:54.310> recordings<00:01:54.940> and<00:01:55.180> notice<00:01:56.049> that

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
of Jerry's recordings and notice that

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.520 
of Jerry's recordings and notice that
his<00:01:56.860> waa-waa<00:01:57.400> suggests<00:01:58.090> he<00:01:58.570> always<00:01:58.840> stayed<00:01:59.290> in

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
his waa-waa suggests he always stayed in

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.100

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
that really sounded like a human voice

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.630 
that really sounded like a human voice
he<00:02:04.540> didn't<00:02:04.810> get<00:02:04.930> Thai<00:02:05.200> in<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.860> shrilly<00:02:06.280> end<00:02:06.430> of

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
he didn't get Thai in the shrilly end of

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.899 
he didn't get Thai in the shrilly end of
it<00:02:06.760> just<00:02:07.270> like<00:02:07.530> limited<00:02:08.530> sweep<00:02:09.069> almost<00:02:09.580> where

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:09.909 
it just like limited sweep almost where

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.630 
it just like limited sweep almost where
if<00:02:10.030> you<00:02:10.330> imagine<00:02:10.750> this<00:02:11.409> from<00:02:11.860> here<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.099> there

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
if you imagine this from here to there

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.789 
if you imagine this from here to there
keeping<00:02:13.390> there<00:02:13.569> and<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:13.840> realized<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.530> called

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
keeping there and I realized I called

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.229 
keeping there and I realized I called
some<00:02:15.040> of<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.189> texts<00:02:15.610> that<00:02:15.640> worked<00:02:16.030> with<00:02:16.180> him

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
some of the texts that worked with him

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.179 
some of the texts that worked with him
and<00:02:16.599> what<00:02:17.290> they<00:02:17.530> did<00:02:17.799> was<00:02:17.980> actually

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.189 
and what they did was actually

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.449 
and what they did was actually
mechanically<00:02:18.970> move<00:02:19.299> the<00:02:19.780> rack<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.379> gear<00:02:21.010> so

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
mechanically move the rack and gear so

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.170 
mechanically move the rack and gear so
that<00:02:21.489> even<00:02:22.000> full<00:02:22.390> down<00:02:22.659> didn't<00:02:23.290> get<00:02:23.500> full

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
that even full down didn't get full

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.460 
that even full down didn't get full
throw<00:02:25.180> or<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.599> wah<00:02:25.780> Wow

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
throw or the wah Wow

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.190 
throw or the wah Wow
so<00:02:26.890> what<00:02:27.129> I<00:02:27.159> did<00:02:27.340> was<00:02:27.879> I<00:02:28.090> gave<00:02:28.659> you<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:28.989> full

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
so what I did was I gave you the full

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.830 
so what I did was I gave you the full
range<00:02:29.500> or<00:02:30.069> him<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.519> full<00:02:30.730> range<00:02:30.939> but<00:02:31.540> on<00:02:31.689> the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
range or him the full range but on the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.110 
range or him the full range but on the
side<00:02:32.080> have<00:02:32.709> an<00:02:32.859> adjustment<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:33.639> that<00:02:33.790> he<00:02:33.939> can

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
side have an adjustment so that he can

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.909 
side have an adjustment so that he can
actually<00:02:34.419> back<00:02:34.629> the<00:02:34.870> toe<00:02:35.079> frequency<00:02:35.739> down

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:35.919 
actually back the toe frequency down

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.970 
actually back the toe frequency down
just<00:02:36.579> stay<00:02:37.200> within<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.439> vocal<00:02:38.769> range

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
just stay within the vocal range

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.949 
just stay within the vocal range
although<00:02:39.249> using<00:02:39.969> the<00:02:40.060> full<00:02:40.269> sweep<00:02:40.569> of<00:02:40.689> the<00:02:40.810> law

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
although using the full sweep of the law

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.739 
although using the full sweep of the law
which<00:02:41.319> is<00:02:41.349> actually<00:02:42.040> better<00:02:42.879> resolution<00:02:43.299> in

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:43.749 
which is actually better resolution in

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.739 
which is actually better resolution in
much<00:02:43.930> more<00:02:44.200> control<00:02:44.590> so<00:02:44.859> he<00:02:45.310> loved<00:02:45.579> it<00:02:45.760> so<00:02:46.060> you

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:46.749 
much more control so he loved it so you

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:50.039 
much more control so he loved it so you
can<00:02:47.049> now<00:02:47.319> as<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.859> end<00:02:47.980> user<00:02:48.069> can<00:02:48.879> move<00:02:49.060> this<00:02:49.389> to

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
can now as the end user can move this to

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.129 
can now as the end user can move this to
almost<00:02:50.439> a<00:02:50.859> normal<00:02:51.249> response<00:02:51.969> to<00:02:52.299> in<00:02:53.019> the

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
almost a normal response to in the

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.009 
almost a normal response to in the
middle<00:02:53.439> that's<00:02:53.709> where<00:02:53.919> I<00:02:53.950> put<00:02:54.219> Jerry's

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
middle that's where I put Jerry's

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.509 
middle that's where I put Jerry's
setting<00:02:56.019> and<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.590> can<00:02:56.739> even<00:02:56.859> back<00:02:57.159> it<00:02:57.340> down

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
setting and you can even back it down

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.670 
setting and you can even back it down
further<00:02:57.819> to<00:02:58.120> get<00:02:58.239> even<00:02:58.569> more<00:02:58.599> of<00:02:58.870> in<00:02:59.109> a<00:02:59.230> darker

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
further to get even more of in a darker

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:13.860 
further to get even more of in a darker
wah-wah<00:03:00.129> sound<00:03:11.790> basically<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:13.329> set<00:03:13.569> the<00:03:13.689> tone

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
wah-wah sound basically you set the tone

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.739 
wah-wah sound basically you set the tone
frequency<00:03:14.439> so<00:03:14.739> you<00:03:14.769> now<00:03:15.340> are<00:03:15.639> the<00:03:15.790> tech<00:03:15.999> this

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:16.749 
frequency so you now are the tech this

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:21.389 
frequency so you now are the tech this
is<00:03:17.109> JC<00:03:17.319> 95<00:03:18.239> Cantrell<00:03:19.239> wah
