00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.500
 and 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.090
 very good girls neurons guys where 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.230
 is how are you, I hope you are 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.510
 all very well 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.510
 today I tell you a story about the 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.940
 boars that thanks to the telescope 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.670
 orbital hubble astronomers have 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.699
 detected water in the atmosphere of five 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.249
 planets in other solar systems according to 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.140
 has informed the nasa it is about five 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:30.019
 giant planets of the type that the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.669
 scientists call hot jupiters 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:41.450
 that bear very specific names 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:46.530
 spatial like wast 17v hd209458b or was 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.900
 12b was by bar 19 and he wanted one see 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.730
 all planets are at distances 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:57.420
 different from the earth being the most 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:59.610
 nearby the hd209458b which is located at 154 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.880
 light years and the farthest that is the 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:06.210
 huÃ¡scar barradas 17 see how far from 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.640
 us about a thousand light years 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.840
 the astronomers had detected water in 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.630
 other solar planets 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.789
 before but this is the first time 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.799
 have managed to measure and compare the amount 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.810
 of water on these planets according to 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.450
 highlighted the nasa in his statement 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.569
 using a new observation technique 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.920
 and the white camera 3 of jabel capable of 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:29.159
 study the atmosphere of the planets 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.469
 up to billions of light years from us 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.530
 two teams of researchers 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:40.390
 they discovered that the planets weret 17b and 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:43.750
 hd209458b had more water signs 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.579
 pronounced that the others according to 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.220
 commented 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:51.939
 abi mendel which is the ethologist's plan 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.679
 goddard center of the nasa in maryland and 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.050
 he is the main author of the studies 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.720
 about this finding has commented 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.760
 this work really opens the door to 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.790
 the possibility of comparing how much water 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.130
 there are in the atmosphere of various types of 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.250
 exoplanets for example the differences 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.160
 that exist between the hottest and 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.760
 the coldest this this he said 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.760
 this he believes the main author of this 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.600
 study was published in the magazine 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.730
 astrophysical journal really 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.310
 finding water is important but 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.600
 we have a concept of finding water 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:34.030
 very wrong we live 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.920
 we need water to live but it is 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.730
 There may be other organisms that do not 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.500
 the need then the fact that 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.460
 there is water 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.550
 is 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.440
 possible for our life but it is 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.930
 possible on other planets where there is 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.850
 high temperatures and there is no existence 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.850
 of water beech 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.980
 beech creatures are you 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.780
 different and that they survive us and that their 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.400
 principal 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.900
 subsistence be the water so nothing 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.330
 guys, I hope you've been interested 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.430
 news a little kiss all and see you in 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.850
 another video of this channel until the 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.850
 next
