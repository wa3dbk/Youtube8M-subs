00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.729 
and the final imperfection is if I has
got<00:02:23.670> products<00:02:23.999> in<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.239> right<00:02:24.420> now<00:02:25.310> but<00:02:27.349> it's<00:02:28.349> so

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
got products in it right now but it's so

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.459 
got products in it right now but it's so
shiny<00:02:29.609> now<00:02:30.209> I<00:02:30.239> know<00:02:30.389> so<00:02:30.780> many<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.049> you<00:02:31.170> who<00:02:31.379> we

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:31.469 
shiny now I know so many of you who we

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:33.170 
shiny now I know so many of you who we
like<00:02:31.620> if<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:31.829> have<00:02:31.920> naturally<00:02:32.280> shiny<00:02:32.489> air<00:02:32.670> why

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
like if you have naturally shiny air why

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.440 
like if you have naturally shiny air why
don't<00:02:33.329> you<00:02:33.389> just<00:02:33.569> like<00:02:34.069> love<00:02:35.069> it<00:02:35.280> but<00:02:36.239> we<00:02:36.359> will

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
don't you just like love it but we will

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.420 
don't you just like love it but we will
warm<00:02:36.629> it<00:02:36.810> what<00:02:37.049> we<00:02:37.169> don't<00:02:37.379> have<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:38.959> therefore

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
warm it what we don't have and therefore

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.399 
warm it what we don't have and therefore
my<00:02:41.430> hair<00:02:41.579> is<00:02:41.669> too<00:02:41.879> shiny<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.989> if<00:02:43.049> I<00:02:43.169> let<00:02:43.319> it<00:02:43.379> dry

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
my hair is too shiny and if I let it dry

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.140 
my hair is too shiny and if I let it dry
naturally<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:44.189> just<00:02:44.400> sits<00:02:44.730> like<00:02:46.219> flat<00:02:47.219> against

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
naturally it just sits like flat against

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.520 
naturally it just sits like flat against
my<00:02:48.269> face<00:02:49.579> it<00:02:50.579> just<00:02:50.760> pisses<00:02:51.659> me<00:02:51.810> off<00:02:51.930> now<00:02:52.379> and<00:02:52.760> so

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
my face it just pisses me off now and so

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.539 
my face it just pisses me off now and so
that's<00:02:55.530> my<00:02:55.769> final<00:02:55.980> imperfection<00:02:56.669> and<00:02:58.549> things

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
that's my final imperfection and things

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.520 
that's my final imperfection and things
that<00:02:59.760> I<00:02:59.939> do<00:03:00.030> like<00:03:00.209> about<00:03:00.269> myself<00:03:00.719> at<00:03:01.079> my<00:03:01.319> eyes

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.289 

my<00:03:04.530> makeups<00:03:04.949> not<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.280> great<00:03:05.489> today<00:03:05.639> so<00:03:06.090> I

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
my makeups not that great today so I

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.280 
my makeups not that great today so I
think<00:03:06.510> I've<00:03:06.989> exceeded<00:03:07.379> it<00:03:07.680> in<00:03:08.280> 30<00:03:08.579> seconds

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
think I've exceeded it in 30 seconds

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.520 
think I've exceeded it in 30 seconds
just<00:03:10.290> eyeliner<00:03:11.159> mascara<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.900> I<00:03:13.079> just<00:03:13.349> missed
