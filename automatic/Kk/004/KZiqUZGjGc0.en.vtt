00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:05.990 

this<00:00:02.909> is<00:00:03.179> my<00:00:03.620> Arduino<00:00:04.620> greenhouse<00:00:05.580> project

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
this is my Arduino greenhouse project

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.370 
this is my Arduino greenhouse project
seen<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:06.839> lot<00:00:07.290> of<00:00:07.319> greenhouses<00:00:09.110> online<00:00:10.110> there

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
seen a lot of greenhouses online there

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.160 
seen a lot of greenhouses online there
so<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.590> thought<00:00:10.800> I'd<00:00:10.980> put<00:00:11.190> mine<00:00:11.429> on<00:00:11.460> there<00:00:12.170> and

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
so I thought I'd put mine on there and

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.519 
so I thought I'd put mine on there and
see<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.500> got<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.920> mega<00:00:14.519> there<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.150> EPC<00:00:15.900> 220

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
see I got the mega there the EPC 220

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.970 
see I got the mega there the EPC 220
wireless<00:00:16.949> module<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:18.350> power<00:00:19.350> supply<00:00:19.740> right

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
wireless module and power supply right

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.890 
wireless module and power supply right
there<00:00:20.300> basically<00:00:21.380> a<00:00:22.380> piece<00:00:23.070> there<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
there basically a piece there the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.029 
there basically a piece there the
Arduino<00:00:24.900> just<00:00:25.170> runs<00:00:25.380> out<00:00:25.590> puts<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
Arduino just runs out puts the

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.189 
Arduino just runs out puts the
transistors<00:00:26.670> transistors<00:00:27.359> run<00:00:27.660> outputs<00:00:28.019> to

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
transistors transistors run outputs to

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.150 
transistors transistors run outputs to
these<00:00:28.320> relays<00:00:28.710> I've<00:00:29.580> got<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> fan<00:00:30.390> control

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
these relays I've got a fan control

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.190 
these relays I've got a fan control

valve<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.620> right<00:00:37.829> there<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.219> just<00:00:38.309> actually

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
valve is right there it's just actually

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.680 
valve is right there it's just actually
electric<00:00:40.500> over<00:00:40.710> hydraulic<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:41.280> got<00:00:41.690> princess

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
electric over hydraulic I got princess

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.400 
electric over hydraulic I got princess
Otto<00:00:42.980> then<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.190> runs<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.989> irrigation<00:00:45.989> system

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
Otto then that runs a irrigation system

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.330 
Otto then that runs a irrigation system
then<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.640> fan<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.210> course<00:00:48.739> comes<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:49.950> if<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
then the fan of course comes on if the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.279 
then the fan of course comes on if the
temperature<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.000> too<00:00:51.270> high<00:00:51.480> or<00:00:51.840> if<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
temperature is too high or if the

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.189 
temperature is too high or if the
humidity<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.890> too<00:00:53.160> high<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:54.780> watering

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199

whatever<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.789> set<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> timing<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:01.100> and<00:01:02.100> you

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
whatever I set the timing to and you

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.020 
whatever I set the timing to and you
just<00:01:02.250> go<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:04.400> manually<00:01:05.400> turn<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.820> these

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
just go in and manually turn on these

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.530 
just go in and manually turn on these
here<00:01:07.040> see<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> fan<00:01:08.400> automatically<00:01:09.090> opens<00:01:09.390> up

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
here see the fan automatically opens up

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.429 
here see the fan automatically opens up
a<00:01:09.750> louver<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
a louver on the

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.620 
a louver on the
the<00:01:12.649> fan<00:01:13.070> there

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
the princess Otto special I got a phone

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.609 
the princess Otto special I got a phone
wire<00:01:20.360> right<00:01:20.600> there<00:01:20.840> tells<00:01:21.200> whether<00:01:21.439> it's

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
wire right there tells whether it's

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.410 
wire right there tells whether it's
night<00:01:21.830> or<00:01:21.979> day<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.369> set<00:01:22.700> points<00:01:23.119> on<00:01:23.299> the

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
night or day the set points on the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.320 
night or day the set points on the
humidity<00:01:23.840> change<00:01:24.259> and<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.740> watering

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
humidity change and the watering

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.870 
humidity change and the watering
function<00:01:26.330> is<00:01:26.450> actually<00:01:26.840> based<00:01:27.080> off<00:01:27.320> of<00:01:27.380> a

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
function is actually based off of a

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.700 
function is actually based off of a
counter<00:01:28.880> that<00:01:29.030> starts<00:01:29.360> when<00:01:29.600> it<00:01:29.710> gets

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
counter that starts when it gets

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:38.770 
counter that starts when it gets
daylight<00:01:35.770> right<00:01:36.770> now<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.539> the<00:01:38.539> lights

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
daylight right now the the lights

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.830 
daylight right now the the lights
basically<00:01:39.380> come<00:01:39.560> on<00:01:39.740> when<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.100> temperature

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
basically come on when the temperature

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.230 
basically come on when the temperature
drops<00:01:41.840> down<00:01:42.049> to<00:01:42.110> low<00:01:42.470> I<00:01:42.500> live<00:01:42.830> in<00:01:43.240> northern

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
drops down to low I live in northern

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.120 
drops down to low I live in northern
Alberta<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:44.899> gets<00:01:45.049> cold<00:01:45.320> up<00:01:45.470> here<00:01:45.530> so<00:01:45.950> yeah

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
Alberta and it gets cold up here so yeah

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.740 
Alberta and it gets cold up here so yeah
when<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.460> temperature<00:01:46.940> drops<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.360> lights

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
when the temperature drops the lights

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.200 
when the temperature drops the lights
come<00:01:47.990> on<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:48.409> they're<00:01:49.100> actually<00:01:49.280> heat<00:01:49.789> lamps

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
watering status and you can see it's

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.009 
watering status and you can see it's
charting<00:02:51.590> as<00:02:51.709> well<00:02:51.920> so<00:02:52.250> during<00:02:52.849> the<00:02:52.939> day<00:02:53.019> or

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
charting as well so during the day or

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.580 
charting as well so during the day or
during<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.349> night<00:02:54.470> of<00:02:54.620> got<00:02:54.769> cold<00:02:56.319> starts<00:02:57.319> to

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
during the night of got cold starts to

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.420 
during the night of got cold starts to
climb<00:02:58.040> up<00:02:58.190> in<00:02:58.370> temperature<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:59.980> fan<00:03:00.980> kicks<00:03:01.250> on

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
climb up in temperature the fan kicks on

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.250 
climb up in temperature the fan kicks on
this<00:03:01.670> time<00:03:01.849> was<00:03:02.030> obviously<00:03:02.420> from<00:03:02.720> humidity

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
this time was obviously from humidity

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.530 
this time was obviously from humidity
because<00:03:03.319> temperature<00:03:03.920> wasn't<00:03:04.129> that<00:03:04.280> hot<00:03:04.540> then

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
because temperature wasn't that hot then

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.240 
because temperature wasn't that hot then
up<00:03:05.629> here<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.019> faster<00:03:06.500> it's<00:03:06.620> coming<00:03:06.920> off<00:03:07.040> and

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
up here the faster it's coming off and

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.849 
up here the faster it's coming off and
on<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.519> regulate<00:03:08.090> against<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.859> temperature

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
on to regulate against the temperature

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.199 
on to regulate against the temperature
and<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.159> humidity<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.700> you<00:03:10.760> can<00:03:10.909> see<00:03:11.060> every

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
and the humidity and you can see every

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.300 
and the humidity and you can see every
time<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.540> fan<00:03:11.780> kicks<00:03:12.079> in<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.439> humidity<00:03:13.159> will

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
time the fan kicks in the humidity will

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.910 
time the fan kicks in the humidity will
drop<00:03:13.340> down<00:03:13.819> and<00:03:14.329> then<00:03:15.019> kind<00:03:15.290> of<00:03:15.319> regulates<00:03:15.739> the

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
drop down and then kind of regulates the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.440 
drop down and then kind of regulates the
temperature<00:03:15.950> there<00:03:16.549> so<00:03:17.000> either<00:03:17.180> the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
temperature there so either the

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.569 
temperature there so either the
temperature<00:03:17.629> or<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.769> humidity<00:03:19.069> will<00:03:19.430> yeah

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
temperature or the humidity will yeah

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.449 
temperature or the humidity will yeah
kick<00:03:19.879> in<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.239> sand

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
kick in the sand

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.830 
kick in the sand
yeah<00:03:22.459> there<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:22.909> go<00:03:23.000> that's<00:03:23.239> what<00:03:23.450> you<00:03:23.569> can<00:03:23.720> do

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
yeah there you go that's what you can do

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.819 
yeah there you go that's what you can do
with<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.139> Arduino<00:03:24.980> a<00:03:25.190> lot<00:03:25.579> of<00:03:25.670> neat<00:03:25.790> stuff
