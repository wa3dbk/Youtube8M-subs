opposed to holding and you know it's put
the<00:04:48.460> holding<00:04:48.729> and<00:04:48.820> then<00:04:49.000> trimming<00:04:49.419> with<00:04:49.570> your

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
fingers right there it could be a little

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.700 
fingers right there it could be a little
risky<00:04:51.789> you<00:04:52.389> don't<00:04:52.570> want<00:04:52.720> to<00:04:52.810> want<00:04:53.530> to<00:04:53.590> create

risky you don't want to want to create

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:02.219 
risky you don't want to want to create
yourself<00:04:53.860> with<00:04:54.280> it<00:05:00.030> so<00:05:01.030> just<00:05:01.449> trim<00:05:01.690> that<00:05:01.900> a

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
yourself with it so just trim that a

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:37.839 
yourself with it so just trim that a
little<00:05:02.650> bit<00:05:02.800> of<00:05:02.919> liner<00:05:03.190> out

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:43.119 

so<00:05:39.470> oftentimes<00:05:40.470> an<00:05:40.860> older<00:05:41.190> book<00:05:41.400> you'll<00:05:41.759> see

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:43.129 
so oftentimes an older book you'll see

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:48.249 
so oftentimes an older book you'll see
raised<00:05:44.129> chords<00:05:45.650> or<00:05:46.650> real<00:05:47.039> real<00:05:47.550> bands<00:05:48.030> and

raised chords or real real bands and

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:50.960 
raised chords or real real bands and
these<00:05:49.259> are<00:05:49.500> the<00:05:49.740> chords<00:05:50.190> that<00:05:50.400> the<00:05:50.520> signatures

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
these are the chords that the signatures

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.480 
these are the chords that the signatures
were<00:05:51.000> sewn<00:05:51.389> on<00:05:51.680> that<00:05:52.680> are<00:05:52.949> then<00:05:53.099> used<00:05:53.129> to

were sewn on that are then used to

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.240 
were sewn on that are then used to
attach<00:05:53.789> the<00:05:54.000> boards<00:05:54.440> this<00:05:55.440> is<00:05:55.500> still<00:05:55.860> a<00:05:55.889> fairly

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.899 
attach the boards this is still a fairly
old<00:05:56.400> book<00:05:56.669> published<00:05:57.120> in<00:05:57.229> 1877<00:05:58.490> but<00:05:59.490> obviously

00:05:59.899 --> 00:05:59.909 
old book published in 1877 but obviously

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:03.100 
old book published in 1877 but obviously
it<00:06:00.060> didn't<00:06:00.330> have<00:06:00.509> some<00:06:01.280> on<00:06:02.280> cords<00:06:02.759> and<00:06:02.970> the

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
it didn't have some on cords and the

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.869 
it didn't have some on cords and the
boards<00:06:04.110> are<00:06:04.259> attached<00:06:04.560> with<00:06:04.979> something

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:05.879 
boards are attached with something

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:09.830 
boards are attached with something
called<00:06:06.060> Maul<00:06:06.360> and<00:06:06.889> also<00:06:07.889> the<00:06:08.039> end<00:06:08.220> sheets<00:06:08.840> help

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
called Maul and also the end sheets help

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:19.010 
called Maul and also the end sheets help
to<00:06:10.020> attach<00:06:10.289> that

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.930 

so<00:06:19.560> now<00:06:19.860> we've<00:06:20.130> got

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.930 

so<00:06:24.690> non<00:06:24.930> bands<00:06:25.410> I<00:06:25.590> went<00:06:26.370> ahead<00:06:26.430> and<00:06:26.580> pretty

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
so non bands I went ahead and pretty

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.400 
so non bands I went ahead and pretty
measured<00:06:27.240> for<00:06:27.420> a<00:06:27.450> liner<00:06:27.720> because<00:06:27.960> I<00:06:28.140> want<00:06:28.350> to

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
measured for a liner because I want to

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.630 
measured for a liner because I want to
have<00:06:28.500> an<00:06:28.650> additional<00:06:28.860> liner<00:06:29.340> on<00:06:29.580> here<00:06:31.400> to<00:06:32.400> run

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640 
have an additional liner on here to run

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.260 
have an additional liner on here to run
the<00:06:32.790> length<00:06:33.060> of<00:06:33.950> the<00:06:34.950> spine<00:06:35.280> so<00:06:35.640> that<00:06:35.760> way<00:06:36.090> when

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
the length of the spine so that way when

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.570 
the length of the spine so that way when
my<00:06:36.300> leather<00:06:36.660> goes<00:06:36.930> on<00:06:37.170> after<00:06:37.500> it's<00:06:38.130> all<00:06:38.280> dry

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
my leather goes on after it's all dry

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.090 
my leather goes on after it's all dry
and<00:06:39.000> done<00:06:39.240> you<00:06:39.870> won't<00:06:40.020> see<00:06:40.470> this<00:06:40.710> Ridge

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 
and done you won't see this Ridge

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.600 
and done you won't see this Ridge
underneath<00:06:41.760> here<00:06:42.740> so<00:06:43.740> I<00:06:43.770> pre<00:06:44.040> my<00:06:44.160> pre<00:06:44.400> measured

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.610 
underneath here so I pre my pre measured

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:52.460 
underneath here so I pre my pre measured
one<00:06:44.910> i<00:06:44.940> three<00:06:45.240> cut<00:06:45.450> it<00:06:45.600> out<00:06:50.330> so<00:06:51.330> I<00:06:51.810> like<00:06:52.140> to<00:06:52.170> use

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470 
one i three cut it out so I like to use

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:57.620 
one i three cut it out so I like to use
a<00:06:52.500> little<00:06:52.830> PVA<00:06:53.310> as<00:06:54.680> well<00:06:55.680> as<00:06:55.950> paste<00:06:56.400> so<00:06:57.360> I<00:06:57.390> have

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:57.630 
a little PVA as well as paste so I have

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:04.430 
a little PVA as well as paste so I have
some<00:06:57.960> a<00:06:58.290> little<00:06:58.620> bit<00:06:58.800> of<00:06:58.890> a<00:06:58.950> mix<00:06:59.250> here<00:07:03.440> paste

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 
some a little bit of a mix here paste

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.970 
some a little bit of a mix here paste
dries<00:07:04.740> slower<00:07:05.700> and<00:07:06.330> PVA<00:07:06.720> faster<00:07:07.320> so<00:07:07.500> depending

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:07.980 
dries slower and PVA faster so depending

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.670 
dries slower and PVA faster so depending
on<00:07:08.070> how<00:07:08.250> quickly<00:07:08.750> you<00:07:09.750> want<00:07:09.780> to<00:07:10.020> get<00:07:10.170> going<00:07:10.380> on

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 
on how quickly you want to get going on

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.250 
on how quickly you want to get going on
it<00:07:10.740> I<00:07:11.240> like<00:07:12.240> to<00:07:12.360> use<00:07:12.480> a<00:07:12.510> little<00:07:12.840> bit<00:07:12.930> of<00:07:13.020> paste

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:13.260 
it I like to use a little bit of paste

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.310 
it I like to use a little bit of paste
on<00:07:13.590> the<00:07:14.220> spine<00:07:14.550> because<00:07:15.390> it<00:07:15.540> sinks<00:07:15.900> in<00:07:16.050> better

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:16.320 
on the spine because it sinks in better

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.090 
on the spine because it sinks in better

whatever you want to call it the fibers

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.180 
whatever you want to call it the fibers
will<00:07:27.240> make<00:07:27.450> a<00:07:27.480> stronger<00:07:27.960> a<00:07:28.350> stronger<00:07:28.890> bond

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:29.190 
will make a stronger a stronger bond

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.330 
will make a stronger a stronger bond
like<00:07:29.520> a<00:07:29.550> penetrating<00:07:30.330> bonded<00:07:30.810> to<00:07:30.990> the<00:07:31.340> manila

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340 
like a penetrating bonded to the manila

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:38.700 
like a penetrating bonded to the manila
or<00:07:32.940> into<00:07:33.360> the<00:07:33.510> liner<00:07:33.780> and<00:07:34.170> this<00:07:34.440> line<00:07:34.740> here

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:38.710 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.040 

so<00:07:39.190> the<00:07:39.280> reason<00:07:39.520> I<00:07:39.550> mentioned<00:07:39.940> this<00:07:40.030> is<00:07:40.270> I<00:07:40.389> for

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.050 
so the reason I mentioned this is I for

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.900 
so the reason I mentioned this is I for
a<00:07:41.080> liner<00:07:41.350> I'm<00:07:41.560> using<00:07:41.590> a<00:07:41.919> piece<00:07:42.310> of<00:07:42.490> a<00:07:42.580> manila

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:42.910

commonly<00:07:54.000> I<00:07:56.220> think<00:07:57.220> the<00:07:57.310> most<00:07:57.490> interesting

00:07:57.689 --> 00:07:57.699
