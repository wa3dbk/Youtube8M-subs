00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.840
 very young people that I have today I bring you a 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.089
 glitch to have infinite ammunition in 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.550
 multiplayer mode of modern warfare 3 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.009
 for this the only thing we will need are 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.050
 some dual weapons and the jump run of 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.550
 attack drone the first thing we will have 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.019
 what to do is get the drone once 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.510
 that we have it we will have to spend the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.580
 secondary ammunition that we have left 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.320
 zero ammo now we take out the drone 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.809
 without getting it to put it back to 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.360
 save and they will have given us the ammunition 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.640
 of the whole left gun good people 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.530
 this has been the trick of today remember 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.559
 which serves for any dual weapon but 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.750
 that only works with the attack drone 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.640
 good people, this has been all for 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.100
 today I hope you liked it and we 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.100
 we see in the next 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.230
