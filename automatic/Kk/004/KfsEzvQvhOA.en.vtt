00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
holder on my boat but I figured I'd just

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.700 
holder on my boat but I figured I'd just
show<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.070> some<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.429> my<00:00:14.549> stuff<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:15.030> I'm<00:00:15.120> using

show you some of my stuff that I'm using
first<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.859> all<00:00:16.980> it's<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.910> fish<00:00:18.660> cat<00:00:18.900> 10<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.500> are

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
first of all it's a fish cat 10 I are

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.509 
first of all it's a fish cat 10 I are
stand-up<00:00:20.539> 10<00:00:21.539> full<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.779> pontoons<00:00:22.519> pretty

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
stand-up 10 full of pontoons pretty

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.080 
stand-up 10 full of pontoons pretty
stable<00:00:23.930> tracks<00:00:24.930> well<00:00:25.199> it's<00:00:26.160> got<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> stand-up

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
stable tracks well it's got a stand-up

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.310 
stable tracks well it's got a stand-up
platform<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.439> front<00:00:29.929> it's<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> good<00:00:31.109> boat

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
platform in the front it's a good boat

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.560 
platform in the front it's a good boat
the<00:00:32.130> only<00:00:32.189> thing<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.579> don't<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:32.880> about<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.450> is

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
the only thing I don't like about it is

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.470 
the only thing I don't like about it is
that<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:34.020> platform<00:00:34.800> frame<00:00:35.670> kind<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.059> drags<00:00:36.300> in

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
that the platform frame kind of drags in

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.410 
that the platform frame kind of drags in
the<00:00:36.540> water<00:00:37.250> but<00:00:38.250> take<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> good<00:00:39.180> with<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.329> bad

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
the water but take the good with the bad

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.660 
the water but take the good with the bad
I<00:00:39.600> guess<00:00:41.840> back<00:00:42.840> here<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.980> rod<00:00:44.129> holder<00:00:44.489> that

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
I guess back here is the rod holder that

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.389 
I guess back here is the rod holder that
I<00:00:44.700> built<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.390> hope<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.230> get<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.649> good<00:00:46.739> shot<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.129> it

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
I built I hope I get a good shot of it

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.209 
I built I hope I get a good shot of it
here<00:00:47.579> for<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.230> basically<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.530> just<00:00:49.590> PVC

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
here for you basically it's just PVC

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.920 
here for you basically it's just PVC
pipe<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.120> cut<00:00:51.449> out<00:00:52.129> 1<00:00:53.129> inch<00:00:53.309> pipe<00:00:53.930> in

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
pipe that I cut out 1 inch pipe in

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.160 
pipe that I cut out 1 inch pipe in
between<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.680> then<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:56.070> t-joints<00:00:57.170> there's

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
between and then just t-joints there's

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.830 
between and then just t-joints there's
actually<00:00:58.559> eight<00:00:58.770> T<00:00:59.010> joints<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.489> here<00:00:59.760> on<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
actually eight T joints on here on the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.119 
actually eight T joints on here on the
holder<00:01:01.140> itself<00:01:02.660> I've<00:01:03.660> got<00:01:03.899> two<00:01:04.199> down<00:01:04.409> here<00:01:04.470> on

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
holder itself I've got two down here on

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.710 
holder itself I've got two down here on
the<00:01:05.850> bottom<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.950> cut<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.040> half<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:09.540> used

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
the bottom that I cut in half and I used

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.260 
the bottom that I cut in half and I used
radiator<00:01:10.140> clips<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.860> attach<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> frame

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
radiator clips to attach it to the frame

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.210 
radiator clips to attach it to the frame
I'll<00:01:12.750> put<00:01:12.960> some<00:01:13.110> rubber<00:01:13.880> rubber<00:01:16.100> gasket<00:01:17.100> in

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
I'll put some rubber rubber gasket in

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.429 
I'll put some rubber rubber gasket in
there<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.430> guess<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.850> could<00:01:18.030> call<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.869> to

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
there I guess you could call it just to

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.679 
there I guess you could call it just to
keep<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.830> from<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.909> that's<00:01:21.119> not<00:01:21.240> metal<00:01:21.600> on

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
keep it from so that's not metal on

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.870 
keep it from so that's not metal on
metal<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.259> doesn't<00:01:22.560> corrode<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:23.040> me<00:01:23.189> you

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
metal and it doesn't corrode on me you

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.039 
metal and it doesn't corrode on me you
know<00:01:24.000> out<00:01:24.060> here<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.299> California<00:01:24.900> everything

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
know out here in California everything

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.649 
know out here in California everything
roughs<00:01:26.570> same<00:01:27.570> thing<00:01:27.810> over<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.350> side<00:01:29.659> just

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
roughs same thing over on this side just

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.230 
roughs same thing over on this side just
radiator<00:01:31.140> clips<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.579> half<00:01:32.759> piece<00:01:33.030> that's

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
radiator clips on the half piece that's

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.760 
radiator clips on the half piece that's
probably<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.570> better<00:01:33.720> shot<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.320> can<00:01:34.439> see<00:01:34.590> where

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
probably a better shot you can see where

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.880 
probably a better shot you can see where
it's<00:01:34.890> cut<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.189> half<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:37.170> then<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:37.680> comes

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
it's cut in half and then this one comes

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.640 
it's cut in half and then this one comes
up<00:01:38.009> into<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.250> 45<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.150> then<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.540> got<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> 90<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.470> each

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
up into a 45 and then I got a 90 on each

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.859 
up into a 45 and then I got a 90 on each
side<00:01:40.950> obviously<00:01:42.860> well<00:01:43.860> yeah<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.159> just<00:01:44.869> tea
