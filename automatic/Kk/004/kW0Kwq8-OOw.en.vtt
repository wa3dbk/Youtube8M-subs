00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.750
 on June 30 the company that has 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.029
 revolutionized more than once 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.980
 music industry launched with bass drums and 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.290
 Saucers their own service 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:17.310
 streaming so the following minutes 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:20.490
 we will dedicate them to analyze ik apogee 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.590
 through itunes for mac and pc and the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.189
 8.4 version of your operating system 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.710
 japan music mobile is now available in 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.689
 more than 100 countries with the objective of 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.570
 give fight to the current leader of the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.190
 streaming music spotify and back to 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.199
 set trends in this industry 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.510
 also rafa music also means the 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.120
 total renewal of the music application 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.129
 on mobile devices and that is 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.500
 now when I entered this music in your 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.479
 iphone you will not only hear the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.180
 songs that you have saved in your 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:57.299
 device or on itunes but you can 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.610
 access through streaming to all 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:02.369
 apple music music catalog that 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.159
 includes tens of thousands of videos in hd 

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:07.920
 and 37 million subjects that also 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.409
 you can download to listen offline 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.689
 because remember that being a 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.180
 streaming service will consume your plan 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.110
 of data if you are not connected to 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.110
 a wifi network 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.720
 well we here in texas are 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.620
 recontra fans of spotify but by 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.610
 course and we approved paul music though 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.580
 He still has not finished convincing us 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.160
 First of all, we are surprised that 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.890
 in the case of support its interface is so 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.350
 confused and the problems begin if it is 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.690
 that you have music on your iphone and in the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.820
 iTunes of your computer because all these 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.310
 songs are mixed with those of apos 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.530
 music and the first impression you do not know 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.660
 exactly which ones are going to 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.200
 generate data consumption by being in 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.200

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.120

 tastes but also in the opinion of the 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.640
 understood the new section that collects 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.880

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.350
 djs specially hired for this 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.880
 work and connects a kind of network

 social to follow your artists 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.670
 favorites and be aware of their 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.270
 news and activities 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.610
 unless it's super mea archi over fan 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.470
 Taylor Swift's exclusive artist 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.750
 Japan music is not much difference 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.780
 between what apple music offers 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.910
 spotify on the other hand we already know that 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.920
 spotify lets you know that they are 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.840
 listening to your friends share 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.870
 songs with them and follow their 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.630
 playlist well the japo music this 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.569
 social aspect simply does not exist yet 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.300
 and all the toys are made 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.400
 by themselves in terms of quality 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.380
 of sound in the computer there is no greater 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.610
 difference although we think that in the 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:39.620
 smartphone spotify just a little bit better 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.390
 this is to music a service that 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.700
 will surely improve with the 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.890
 elapse of the months and that although 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.360
 seems to offer no news 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.700
 important with respect to their 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.830
 competitors has the backing of a 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.380
 company that has already managed to impose 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.380
 markets that did not arrive first
