is at top dead center now we have to

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.590 
is at top dead center now we have to
remove<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.739> harmonic<00:00:47.219> balancer<00:00:47.670> step<00:00:48.420> number

remove the harmonic balancer step number

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.900 
remove the harmonic balancer step number
one<00:00:48.899> because<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.320> not<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> keyway<00:00:49.980> system<00:00:50.460> we

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
one because it's not a keyway system we

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.750 
one because it's not a keyway system we
have<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.120> stick<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.360> ten<00:00:51.629> millimeter<00:00:51.840> bolt

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
have to stick a ten millimeter bolt

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.189 
have to stick a ten millimeter bolt
through<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.789> homeowner<00:00:54.210> balancer<00:00:54.750> into<00:00:55.079> the

through the homeowner balancer into the
timing<00:00:55.559> cover<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.280> tighten<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.699> hand<00:00:57.000> tight

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
timing cover and tighten it hand tight

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.869 
timing cover and tighten it hand tight
not<00:00:58.379> using<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.800> impact<00:00:59.129> as<00:00:59.309> you'll<00:00:59.460> snap<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
not using it impact as you'll snap the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.830 
not using it impact as you'll snap the
bolt<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.300> snap<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.570> into<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.960> time<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.289> cover

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
bolt and snap it into the time and cover

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.660 
bolt and snap it into the time and cover
once<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.199> tight<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> crank<00:01:05.159> is

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
once that is tight and the crank is

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.179 
once that is tight and the crank is
locked<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.570> harmonic<00:01:07.530> balancer<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.100> to

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
locked so harmonic balancer is going to

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.700 
locked so harmonic balancer is going to
be<00:01:08.280> locked<00:01:08.460> into<00:01:08.700> place<00:01:09.110> now<00:01:10.110> we<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.439> use<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
be locked into place now we can use the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.640 
be locked into place now we can use the
impact<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.880> get<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.119> get<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.990> get<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.260> harmonic

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
impact to get to get to get the harmonic

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.050 
impact to get to get to get the harmonic
balance<00:01:13.950> at<00:01:14.040> all

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.850 

now<00:01:20.600> you<00:01:20.659> can<00:01:20.869> remove<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.320> 10<00:01:21.470> millimeter

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
now you can remove the 10 millimeter

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.100 
now you can remove the 10 millimeter
