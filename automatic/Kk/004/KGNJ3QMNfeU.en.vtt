 accompany him 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.810
 The first thing we are going to do is take the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.770
 melted butter and we throw it 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.770
 the flour 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.230
 the eggs

 the sugar 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.180
 the milk 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.360

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.530
 is one of the we can think ruby 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.530
 Sapphire 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.670
 I'll take the lic and where to eat 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.980
 once the dough is something else or 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.180
 less homogeneous so that what 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.040
 we do is we take a little 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.620
 butter in the pan over medium heat 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.980
 that is done and when everything is 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:03.380
 cast you take a pot 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.670
 it also depends a bit on the pan 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.160
 is for example with a saucepan 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.509
 until you see that the dough is more 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.200
 or less curd you catch 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.480
 Y 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.090
 you turn around 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.650
 and that is done on the other side and now 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.580
