00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.530 
really good for the sport how was it
possible<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.560> as<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> lady<00:02:17.330> ladies<00:02:18.330> ski

possible that you as a lady ladies ski
jumping<00:02:18.840> us<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.320> so<00:02:19.530> much<00:02:19.710> better<00:02:19.920> than<00:02:20.220> the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
jumping us is so much better than the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.290 
jumping us is so much better than the
men<00:02:20.610> like<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.240> have<00:02:21.420> seen<00:02:21.720> today<00:02:21.840> uh<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:24.180> know

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
men like you have seen today uh you know

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.390 
men like you have seen today uh you know
it's<00:02:24.450> kind<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.720> hard<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.930> say<00:02:25.170> just<00:02:25.440> we<00:02:26.220> have<00:02:26.370> a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
it's kind of hard to say just we have a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.550 
it's kind of hard to say just we have a
really<00:02:26.640> strong<00:02:26.760> women's<00:02:27.360> team<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.960> you<00:02:28.470> know

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
really strong women's team and you know

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.410 
really strong women's team and you know
the<00:02:28.710> men<00:02:28.890> are<00:02:29.070> training<00:02:29.490> just<00:02:29.670> as<00:02:29.850> hard<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.330> I

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
the men are training just as hard and I

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.050 
the men are training just as hard and I
think<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.750> will<00:02:30.810> eventually<00:02:31.200> come<00:02:31.680> but

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
think it will eventually come but

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.610 
think it will eventually come but
they've<00:02:33.060> struggled<00:02:33.750> with<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:33.900> lot<00:02:33.990> of<00:02:34.140> funding

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
they've struggled with a lot of funding

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.230 
they've struggled with a lot of funding
just<00:02:34.770> because<00:02:34.920> it's<00:02:35.070> not<00:02:35.250> popular<00:02:35.790> in<00:02:36.030> the

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
just because it's not popular in the

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.090 
just because it's not popular in the
United<00:02:36.420> States<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.350> think<00:02:37.680> in<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.070> couple

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
United States so I think in a couple

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.820 
United States so I think in a couple
years<00:02:38.400> we'll<00:02:39.060> have<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.209> strong<00:02:39.480> team<00:02:39.680> thank<00:02:40.680> you

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
years we'll have a strong team thank you

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.100 
years we'll have a strong team thank you
very<00:02:40.860> much
