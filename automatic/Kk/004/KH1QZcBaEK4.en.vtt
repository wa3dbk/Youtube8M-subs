alright<00:00:27.420> kind<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.930> idea<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.800> that

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950 
alright kind of the idea of this is that

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.589 
alright kind of the idea of this is that
we're<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.279> we<00:00:29.430> have<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> triad<00:00:30.029> with<00:00:30.360> three

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
we're have we have a triad with three

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.610 
we're have we have a triad with three
notes<00:00:30.840> one<00:00:31.770> three<00:00:32.369> five<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.360> then<00:00:33.960> we<00:00:34.440> just

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
notes one three five and then we just

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.740 
notes one three five and then we just
add<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.160> ninth<00:00:35.400> so<00:00:35.820> there's<00:00:35.970> no<00:00:36.150> seventh

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
add in the ninth so there's no seventh

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.720 
add in the ninth so there's no seventh
there's<00:00:36.930> no<00:00:37.050> 11<00:00:37.530> there's<00:00:37.710> nothing<00:00:38.010> else<00:00:38.129> kind

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
there's no 11 there's nothing else kind

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.340 
there's no 11 there's nothing else kind
of<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:38.879> on<00:00:39.030> an<00:00:39.180> extended<00:00:39.720> chord<00:00:39.989> that's<00:00:40.199> why

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
of like on an extended chord that's why

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.189 
of like on an extended chord that's why
it's<00:00:40.470> add<00:00:40.620> nine<00:00:41.370> kind<00:00:42.330> of<00:00:42.390> confused<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:42.989> some

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
really cool shapes so I'm going to go

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.500 
really cool shapes so I'm going to go
through<00:00:50.160> some<00:00:50.340> open<00:00:50.820> first<00:00:51.030> then<00:00:51.300> we'll<00:00:51.390> go

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
through some open first then we'll go

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.819 
through some open first then we'll go
through<00:00:51.540> some<00:00:51.719> moveable<00:00:52.260> Barre<00:00:52.469> chord

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
through some moveable Barre chord

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.970 
through some moveable Barre chord
positions<00:00:53.309> first<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.270> going<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.480> be<00:00:54.540> G<00:00:54.870> kind<00:00:55.860> of

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
positions first is going to be G kind of

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.770 
positions first is going to be G kind of
the<00:00:56.070> idea<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.780> um<00:00:59.300> my<00:01:00.300> second

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the idea of this is that um my second

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.150 
the idea of this is that um my second
finger<00:01:01.110> is<00:01:01.230> going<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> sixth

string third fret my third finger is
going<00:01:04.800> to<00:01:04.979> be<00:01:05.160> on<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.520> first<00:01:05.759> string<00:01:06.060> third

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
going to be on the first string third

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.590 
going to be on the first string third
fret<00:01:07.289> then<00:01:07.920> my<00:01:08.100> second<00:01:08.789> thing<00:01:09.030> or<00:01:09.270> my<00:01:09.420> first

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
this is going to be the C at 9 this is

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.230 
this is going to be the C at 9 this is
basically<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.920> same<00:01:29.100> thing<00:01:29.369> as<00:01:29.490> our<00:01:29.580> normal<00:01:30.030> G

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240

at 9

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.560 
at 9
now<00:01:50.460> then<00:01:50.610> although<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.270> most

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
now then although this is the most

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.749 
now then although this is the most
common<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.170> isn't<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.770> only<00:01:53.009> one

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
common this isn't the only one

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.279 
common this isn't the only one
probably<00:01:54.210> another<00:01:54.300> cool<00:01:54.630> one<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.259> a

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
probably another cool one that I like a

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.160 
probably another cool one that I like a
lot<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.710> kind<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.460> one<00:01:56.700> without<00:01:57.090> my<00:01:57.720> pinky

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
lot is kind of this one without my pinky

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.880 
lot is kind of this one without my pinky
on<00:01:58.289> the<00:01:58.619> first<00:01:58.830> string

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.010 

sometimes<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:04.030> don't<00:02:04.150> even<00:02:04.300> need<00:02:04.570> your<00:02:04.780> first

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
sometimes you don't even need your first

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.120 
sometimes you don't even need your first
thing<00:02:05.230> around<00:02:05.350> their<00:02:05.500> mute<00:02:05.740> that<00:02:05.800> core

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
thing around their mute that core

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.210 
thing around their mute that core
strength<00:02:07.410> find<00:02:08.410> that<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.590> be<00:02:08.679> really<00:02:08.890> pretty

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
strength find that to be really pretty

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.790 
strength find that to be really pretty
important<00:02:09.640> as<00:02:09.789> well<00:02:10.179> all<00:02:10.840> right<00:02:10.899> now<00:02:11.560> here's

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
important as well all right now here's

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.740 
important as well all right now here's
probably<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.220> trickiest<00:02:12.580> one<00:02:12.940> of<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.480> bunch

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
probably the trickiest one of the bunch

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.270 
probably the trickiest one of the bunch
