okay mr. Apple

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.610 
okay mr. Apple
this<00:00:05.890> is<00:00:06.069> your<00:00:06.279> unit<00:00:06.640> repaired<00:00:07.290> this<00:00:08.290> speaker

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:08.620 
this is your unit repaired this speaker

this is your unit repaired this speaker
for<00:00:08.920> here<00:00:09.160> is<00:00:09.340> bad<00:00:10.170> you're<00:00:11.170> gonna<00:00:11.320> have<00:00:11.469> to

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:11.620 
for here is bad you're gonna have to

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.920 
for here is bad you're gonna have to
replace<00:00:11.950> that<00:00:12.280> we're<00:00:13.000> gonna<00:00:13.090> take<00:00:13.360> this<00:00:13.539> up<00:00:13.600> so

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:13.930 
replace that we're gonna take this up so

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.680 
replace that we're gonna take this up so
you<00:00:14.020> don't<00:00:14.110> short<00:00:14.440> it<00:00:14.559> out<00:00:14.709> and<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:16.360> can<00:00:16.510> see

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:16.690 
you don't short it out and you can see

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:17.910 
you don't short it out and you can see
they've<00:00:16.869> got<00:00:16.930> the<00:00:17.140> proper<00:00:17.320> cat's-eye

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
they've got the proper cat's-eye

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.560 
they've got the proper cat's-eye
waveform<00:00:18.490> on<00:00:18.670> the<00:00:18.820> scope

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.480 

and<00:00:21.689> then<00:00:21.839> when<00:00:22.199> you're<00:00:22.560> not<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:23.039> vibrato

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
and then when you're not in vibrato

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.740 
and then when you're not in vibrato
you're<00:00:23.849> alright<00:00:24.210> when<00:00:25.019> we<00:00:25.429> go<00:00:26.429> to<00:00:26.489> a<00:00:26.750> standard

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
snuff and on these two output

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.189 
snuff and on these two output
transistors<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.699> had<00:00:47.909> no<00:00:48.089> heatsink<00:00:48.629> paste<00:00:48.930> on

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
transistors you had no heatsink paste on

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.729 
transistors you had no heatsink paste on
the<00:00:49.320> Michael<00:00:49.710> washer<00:00:50.159> and<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.739> you

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
the Michael washer and on this one you

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.810 
the Michael washer and on this one you
had<00:00:53.070> removed<00:00:53.519> a<00:00:54.199> little<00:00:55.199> plastic<00:00:55.820> insulating

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
had removed a little plastic insulating

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.670 
had removed a little plastic insulating
washer<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.659> this<00:00:57.809> was<00:00:58.019> shorting<00:00:58.409> to<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
washer so this was shorting to the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.390 
washer so this was shorting to the
heatsink<00:00:58.890> that's<00:00:59.699> not<00:01:00.089> helping<00:01:00.720> uni<00:01:01.189> in<00:01:02.189> any

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
heatsink that's not helping uni in any

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.620 
heatsink that's not helping uni in any
case<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.390> rebar<00:01:03.839> is<00:01:04.019> okay<00:01:05.150> we<00:01:06.150> did<00:01:06.360> have<00:01:06.509> to

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
case the rebar is okay we did have to

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.499 
case the rebar is okay we did have to
change<00:01:06.900> all<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.259> other<00:01:07.290> transistors<00:01:08.360> part<00:01:09.360> of

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
change all the other transistors part of

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.859 
change all the other transistors part of
this<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:10.020> not<00:01:10.320> our<00:01:10.530> fault<00:01:11.390> this<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.450> due<00:01:12.840> to

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
this is not our fault this is due to

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.640 
this is not our fault this is due to
your<00:01:13.259> inability<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:14.810> correctly<00:01:15.810> change

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
your inability to correctly change

output transistors and other things and

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.749 
output transistors and other things and
we<00:01:20.310> will<00:01:20.820> not<00:01:21.000> want<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.450> see<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.750> again<00:01:22.759> this

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
we will not want to see this again this

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.700 
we will not want to see this again this
is<00:01:23.820> as<00:01:24.090> far<00:01:24.329> as<00:01:24.360> we're<00:01:24.600> ever<00:01:24.780> going<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.110> go<00:01:25.259> for

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
is as far as we're ever going to go for

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.130 
is as far as we're ever going to go for
you<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:27.240> problem<00:01:27.930> with<00:01:28.140> all<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:29.030> that

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
you the problem with all this is that

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.480 
you the problem with all this is that
you'll<00:01:31.140> have<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.409> get<00:01:31.560> another<00:01:31.650> speaker<00:01:32.280> and

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
you'll have to get another speaker and

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.440 
you'll have to get another speaker and
then<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:33.900> output<00:01:34.560> jack

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450
