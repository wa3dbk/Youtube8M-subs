00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
to get a fuller cheek because as we get

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.799 
to get a fuller cheek because as we get

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
tend to stick with this like with

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.570 
tend to stick with this like with
mineral<00:01:10.049> veils<00:01:10.290> or<00:01:10.619> bronzers<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.400> one<00:01:11.549> I

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
mineral veils or bronzers and this one I

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.270 
mineral veils or bronzers and this one I
keep<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.240> know<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:12.630> blushes<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.530> you

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
keep you know for blushes and and you

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.130 
keep you know for blushes and and you
can<00:01:14.400> use<00:01:14.520> over<00:01:14.549> mineral<00:01:14.939> veil<00:01:15.240> too<00:01:15.509> but<00:01:15.840> you

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
can use over mineral veil too but you

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.310 
can use over mineral veil too but you
know<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:16.500> primarily<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.100> blush<00:01:17.400> brush<00:01:18.020> so<00:01:19.020> I

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
know it's primarily a blush brush so I

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.010 
know it's primarily a blush brush so I
basically<00:01:19.500> take<00:01:19.890> my<00:01:20.040> brush<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.720> dip<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.869> into

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
basically take my brush and dip it into

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.620 
basically take my brush and dip it into
my<00:01:22.320> blush<00:01:23.060> now<00:01:24.500> your<00:01:25.500> blush<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.299> not<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.509> be

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
my blush now your blush is not to be

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.760 
my blush now your blush is not to be
applied<00:01:27.960> wet<00:01:28.729> unlike<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.759> other<00:01:30.770> moist

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
applied wet unlike the other moist

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.219 
applied wet unlike the other moist
method<00:01:32.159> than<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.400> was<00:01:32.549> teaching<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:34.079> is

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
method than I was teaching so this is

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.270 
method than I was teaching so this is
pretty<00:01:34.380> much<00:01:34.500> what<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.890> will<00:01:34.979> look<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.130> on

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
pretty much what it will look like on

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.310 
pretty much what it will look like on
the<00:01:35.549> brush<00:01:35.759> that's<00:01:36.030> that's<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.810> know<00:01:36.930> quite<00:01:37.259> a

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
the brush that's that's you know quite a

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.039 
the brush that's that's you know quite a
big<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.680> loaded<00:01:37.979> up<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.299> smile<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.630> find<00:01:39.869> your

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
big it loaded up and smile to find your

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.520 
big it loaded up and smile to find your
apples<00:01:40.579> so<00:01:41.579> once<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.060> locate<00:01:42.270> my<00:01:42.630> apples<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.229> just

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
apples so once I locate my apples I just

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.760 
apples so once I locate my apples I just
kind<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.860> press<00:01:44.070> again<00:01:44.610> I'm<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.810> presser<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:49.020> I

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
kind of press again I'm a presser and I

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.700 
kind of press again I'm a presser and I
go<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.070> both<00:01:50.310> cheeks<00:01:51.049> now<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.320> may<00:01:52.500> look

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
go on both cheeks now this may look

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.580 
go on both cheeks now this may look
pretty<00:01:52.920> light<00:01:53.869> but<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.110> reason<00:01:55.259> why<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.500> do

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
pretty light but the reason why I do

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.350 
pretty light but the reason why I do
that<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.159> because<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.460> do<00:01:56.610> want<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:57.060> remain

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
that is because I do want to remain

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.310 
that is because I do want to remain
youthful<00:01:57.719> looking<00:01:58.729> so<00:01:59.729> I<00:02:00.210> go<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.780> pretty<00:02:01.110> light

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
tops of the cheeks and that would create

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.160 
tops of the cheeks and that would create
like<00:04:37.130> a<00:04:37.160> highlighting<00:04:37.850> effect<00:04:37.940> so<00:04:38.840> you<00:04:38.930> can

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.280 
a little more shimmery for evening wear
and<00:04:43.640> that's<00:04:44.210> what<00:04:44.390> those<00:04:44.510> colors<00:04:44.870> are<00:04:45.050> ideal

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
and that's what those colors are ideal

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.600 
and that's what those colors are ideal
for<00:04:45.320> so<00:04:45.680> you<00:04:45.740> just<00:04:45.950> kind<00:04:46.100> of<00:04:46.220> would<00:04:46.370> go<00:04:46.520> over

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
for so you just kind of would go over

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.980 
for so you just kind of would go over
the<00:04:46.760> top<00:04:46.940> it<00:04:47.180> doesn't<00:04:47.510> everything<00:04:47.660> to<00:04:47.810> do<00:04:47.870> with

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
the top it doesn't everything to do with

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.530 
the top it doesn't everything to do with
contouring<00:04:48.620> it<00:04:49.130> just<00:04:49.430> has<00:04:49.610> to<00:04:49.760> do<00:04:49.940> with

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
contouring it just has to do with

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.510 
contouring it just has to do with
creating<00:04:50.780> the<00:04:51.080> cheeks<00:04:51.620> to<00:04:51.800> pop<00:04:52.010> out<00:04:52.220> a<00:04:52.250> little

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
creating the cheeks to pop out a little

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.390 
creating the cheeks to pop out a little
bit<00:04:52.700> better<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:53.900> it<00:04:54.260> just<00:04:54.530> gives<00:04:54.800> a<00:04:54.920> very

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
bit better and it just gives a very

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.030 
bit better and it just gives a very
beautiful<00:04:55.790> luminescent<00:04:56.660> glow<00:04:56.980> at<00:04:57.980> night

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
beautiful luminescent glow at night

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.730 
beautiful luminescent glow at night
especially<00:04:58.550> if<00:04:59.300> the<00:04:59.930> lights<00:05:00.170> are<00:05:00.350> turned<00:05:00.590> down

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
especially if the lights are turned down

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.320 
especially if the lights are turned down
low<00:05:00.950> like<00:05:01.160> in<00:05:01.340> your<00:05:01.430> favorite<00:05:01.760> restaurant<00:05:02.240> or

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
low like in your favorite restaurant or

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.550 
low like in your favorite restaurant or
something<00:05:02.420> like<00:05:02.690> that<00:05:02.750> so<00:05:03.740> and<00:05:05.530> anyway<00:05:06.530> I

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
something like that so and anyway I

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.590 
something like that so and anyway I
think<00:05:06.710> that's<00:05:06.980> pretty<00:05:07.190> much<00:05:07.400> it<00:05:07.460> so<00:05:07.970> the<00:05:08.570> next

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
think that's pretty much it so the next

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.140 
think that's pretty much it so the next
one<00:05:08.930> will<00:05:09.200> be<00:05:09.230> on<00:05:09.410> mineral<00:05:09.770> veils<00:05:09.980> and<00:05:10.280> I<00:05:10.970> look

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
one will be on mineral veils and I look

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.140 
one will be on mineral veils and I look
