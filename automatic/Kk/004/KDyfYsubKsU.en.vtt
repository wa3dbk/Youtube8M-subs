00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.590
 hello everyone I find 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.719
 today for a whole new episode 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.160
 2 draws in fitness so I remind you 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.529
 that in this series of videos I you 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.510
 presents an exercise of finesse I you 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.670
 explains how to do it what it serves 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.590
 calmus that he targets and what are the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.130
 main mistakes to avoid to avoid 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.080
 To hurt you 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.390
 so today we're going to talk about slabs 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.010
 lift so also called in France 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.170
 she is raised from the ground so it's a 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.010
 bodybuilding exercise that helps 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.180
 really muscling the buttocks the back 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.190
 donated thighs so is the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.840
 hamstring is also the bottom of the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.579
 back flap we lose so I'm going to you 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.899
 show how to do well my 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.250
 movements and I will explain to you at 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.030
 as mistakes do not 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.920
 make 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.570
 so to do the exercise you will have 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.969
 need a weight since if you 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.660
 done in a vacuum without anything it did not 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.020
 high interest 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.809
 so you can use a bar 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.210
 like this so a weight bar 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.129
 you can also use a pair 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.520
 of dumbbells so there my bar she is 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.229
 empty 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.369
 so I'm going to do it empty but you 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.380
 can put records a good 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.090
 obviously it's better to have some weight 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.119
 the more you put on weight the more you 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.320
 go to solicit the commander the muscle 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.180
 in depth and you will increase 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.640
 your coming your muscle volume 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.049
 so I invite you to put on weight 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.479
 ladies, do not be afraid if he wanted 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.009
 round up your glutes and not in 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.700
 put too much in fact either according to 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.049
 your abilities 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.150
 you can also take a pair 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.430
 dumbbells or a quest a beautiful 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.540
 like those you use in the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.460
 holding between your legs 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.670
 so I showed the movement with a 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.530
 bar so you take the bar that 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.479
 normally if you do it indoors 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.899
 where the load and quite a heavy 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:48.960
 so to give you an idea month in 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.420
 room I take 20 bar of 20 kilos 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.420
 more 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.990
 ten on each side of which 40 kg for you 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.030
 give an idea 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.100
 So here I am taking the helm 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.939
 so usually me the room she is 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.070
 directly on the ground 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.159
 so we lower our tone right in 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.210
 squats position the buttocks back 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.520
 the buttocks back the knees that 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.190
 not exceed in the feet the back well 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.470
 right we ride monte rides 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.020
 and here we will lock the basin 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.209
 before that it's for the rise in 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.700
 going down the buttocks well in the back 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.269
 the back straight that leans forward 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.890
 we go down his knees down but hey 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.110
 I touched the ground 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.250
 have the bar hit the ground otherwise you 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.200
 do not manage by this movement 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.510
 but then you go back blowing 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.269
 and you will push the pelvis forward 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.850
 so in fact the main mistakes 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:40.600
 that it is necessary to avoid these lots at all costs 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.450
 So there you running like that for the 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.239
 hall with rounded clothes you go 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.410
 you hurt it's really bad 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.660
 you are going to hurt your lumbar 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.880
 back pain you see that it's really 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.010
 not correct as movement then the 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.720
 second mistake to never do is 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.910
 first the knees that will settle 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.730
 quietly in front of the toes 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.280
 would do something like that 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.260
 and that's not good at all and the more you 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.579
 will have weight on the bar over it will be 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.280
 dangerous because you will 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.269
 downright tumbling forward and I leave 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.269
 imagine the damage 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:16.180
 so really the main instructions the 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.340
 back straight buttocks back on 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.790
 goes down along the young people along 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.390
 shins 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.370
 looking at the look in front of you and in 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.859
 having knees that are well behind 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.109
 the toes we slowly go back a 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:32.200
 slow and controlled movement has arrived 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:34.030
 at the top we will give a basin in 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.019
 doing a retro version of the basin so 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.510
 there to show you that you are well 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.709
 buttocks and abs and give you a 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.609
 a little bit of narration 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.519
 solicited buttocks 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:44.620
 So that's up to the movement quickly 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.280
 done with dumbbells it's exactly 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.290
 the same thing 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.940
 you go down the legs 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.069
 and we 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.870
 December ascent with beautiful tutelage 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.840
 for those who have the oil you 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.860
 get off you go back sense of 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.080
 lifts 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.700
 so you have plenty of variations for 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.340
 this exercise I will not go into 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.660
 the details i'm just going to tell you that 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.430
 the variance found most often 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.590
 it's doing the legs exercise 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:14.000
 strained therefore to make that of this 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.750
 way like that and in fact we can not 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.790
 no longer legs 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.950
 I do not like it at all if you like 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.359
 well do it me I do not like since I 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.340
 find that it's not a full name and 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.630
 it's a bit dangerous because you can 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.580
 locking your knees it's a little 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.020
 dangerous for the knees and by doing 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.000
 this exercise second way work 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.040
 that back I really like to think 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.680
 make a complete movement and this 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.930
 way we go down a little squat 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:39.200
 to and we go back this is what allows us 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.970
 to solicit also the buttocks and 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.530
 the back of the thigh and not just 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.450
 the lower back so the difference 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.729
 really main between the squat and that 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.590
 remind you that what you get 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.610
 right while the blood they live 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.190
 everything would be rather in this 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.770
 position there the squat but more like that 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.400
 and we go back so we leave ourselves well 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.169
 back so that's game I'm done for this 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.180
 little exercise do not hesitate to put a 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.400
 little green thumb if you liked this 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.950
 video me I find you the week 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.660
 next for a new move to 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.190
 explain to you a movement that I like 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.200
 so do not hesitate to subscribe 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.880
 if it's not already done, do not hesitate 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.260
 to put a little comment for me 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.120
 tell what you think of this exercise 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.830

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.550
 you prefer them that you would like that 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.289
 I explain to you 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.289
 pressed on two ciao videos
