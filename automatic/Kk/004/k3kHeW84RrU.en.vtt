promoter of nuclear warfare he loves

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.850 
promoter of nuclear warfare he loves
that<00:01:29.220> stuff<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.939> he's<00:01:30.570> used<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.590> almost

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
that stuff and he's used it in almost

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.670 
that stuff and he's used it in almost
every<00:01:32.280> tvt<00:01:32.729> I've<00:01:32.880> seen<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.900> think<00:01:34.200> nuclear

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
every tvt I've seen and I think nuclear

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.560 
every tvt I've seen and I think nuclear
warfare<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.369> lot<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.150> going<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.390> come

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
warfare a lot of that is going to come

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.660 
warfare a lot of that is going to come
down<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.590> evolution<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.130> starcraft<00:01:38.579> I

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
down to the evolution of starcraft I

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.069 
down to the evolution of starcraft I
think<00:01:38.880> nukes<00:01:39.150> are<00:01:39.299> all<00:01:39.450> about<00:01:39.810> positioning

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
think nukes are all about positioning

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.160 
think nukes are all about positioning
and<00:01:40.710> forcing<00:01:41.700> your<00:01:41.790> opponent<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.390> unpin<00:01:43.049> his

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
and forcing your opponent to unpin his

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.109 
and forcing your opponent to unpin his
unit<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.740> relocate<00:01:44.640> them<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.820> different

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
unit and relocate them to different

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.480 
unit and relocate them to different
areas<00:01:45.530> so<00:01:46.530> that's<00:01:46.680> why<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.860> think<00:01:46.979> nukes<00:01:47.280> are

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
areas so that's why I think nukes are

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.609 
areas so that's why I think nukes are
really<00:01:47.880> good<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.119> starcraft<00:01:48.600> 2<00:01:48.750> i<00:01:48.780> really<00:01:49.439> like

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
really good in starcraft 2 i really like

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.620 
really good in starcraft 2 i really like
them<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.890> terran<00:01:50.130> vs<00:01:50.369> terran<00:01:50.610> as<00:01:50.820> well<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.450> can

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
them in terran vs terran as well you can

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.240 
them in terran vs terran as well you can
use<00:01:51.750> them<00:01:51.899> against<00:01:52.110> siege<00:01:52.350> tanks<00:01:52.740> foursome<00:01:53.159> to

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
use them against siege tanks foursome to

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.789 
use them against siege tanks foursome to
unseat<00:01:53.700> we've<00:01:54.270> seen<00:01:54.450> countless<00:01:54.720> games<00:01:55.259> where

get you guys hopes up too much because

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.639 
get you guys hopes up too much because
it<00:01:59.880> might<00:02:00.360> not<00:02:00.600> they<00:02:00.869> might<00:02:01.049> not<00:02:01.200> even<00:02:01.350> use

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
it might not they might not even use

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.020 
it might not they might not even use
nukes<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.100> game<00:02:02.310> which<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.759> know<00:02:02.850> that

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
nukes this game which you know that

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.520 
nukes this game which you know that
would<00:02:03.119> kind<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.329> be<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> bummer<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.960> most

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
would kind of be a bummer and most

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.350 
would kind of be a bummer and most
likely<00:02:04.649> they<00:02:04.950> won't<00:02:05.159> i've<00:02:05.640> only<00:02:05.820> seen<00:02:06.030> very

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
likely they won't i've only seen very

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.290 
likely they won't i've only seen very
very<00:02:06.780> few<00:02:07.049> players<00:02:07.320> use<00:02:08.099> nukes<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:08.789> i<00:02:08.819> think

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
very few players use nukes but i think

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.510 
very few players use nukes but i think
that<00:02:09.899> more<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.259> more<00:02:10.349> are<00:02:10.619> going<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.950> start<00:02:11.220> to

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
that more and more are going to start to

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.040 
that more and more are going to start to
use<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
use the

his SUVs to this Reaper getting one kill
the<00:03:32.600> other<00:03:32.720> kill<00:03:32.959> was<00:03:33.170> from<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.650> SUV<00:03:33.860> at<00:03:34.310> the

the other kill was from the SUV at the

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.220 
the other kill was from the SUV at the
xel'naga<00:03:34.880> so<00:03:35.090> I<00:03:35.120> guess<00:03:35.270> that<00:03:35.450> was<00:03:35.630> two<00:03:35.959> kills

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230

Reaper<00:03:37.010> here<00:03:37.220> is<00:03:37.400> just<00:03:37.640> floating<00:03:38.209> around<00:03:38.330> the

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
Reaper here is just floating around the

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.479 
Reaper here is just floating around the
base<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.170> i<00:03:39.709> think<00:03:39.980> that<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.250> Marauder

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
base and i think that the Marauder

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.160 
base and i think that the Marauder
coming<00:03:40.850> out<00:03:40.940> there<00:03:41.060> is<00:03:41.209> going<00:03:41.420> to<00:03:41.480> help<00:03:41.720> ward

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
that away it looks like the point is

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.449 
that away it looks like the point is

is a great build i think this is the

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.780 
is a great build i think this is the

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
right technology choice because of their

right technology choice because of their

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
look at this main base you think that

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.420
