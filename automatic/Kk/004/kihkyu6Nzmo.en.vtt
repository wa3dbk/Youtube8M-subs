00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.929
 so hello to everyone continue in general I 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:12.440
 to mount my car and today we will 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:19.279
 prepare painting 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.279
 doors for this, I bought just such a thing 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.579
 this 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.189
 paint remover here we are today 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:31.309
 will test 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:34.430
 I read I already somehow not 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:38.000
 it is written about how and the benefits of sleep think 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.129
 just put on the old paint, and she had her 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.909
 must somehow 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:47.110
 wash off or to do here but I read 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:49.970
 here the composition here is direct only radioactive 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.930
 waste they are nâ€™t exactly 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:57.170
 so very dangerous well today we will 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:01.150
 put on old paint and try it 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:05.950
 wash here 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:08.770
 that is what i did with the door that is 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.030
 here many have seen the disease nines 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:16.570
 Here are the corners of the front doors, they are straight 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.350
 starts to rot very quickly here I did 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.840
 her as follows 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:28.530
 ill-fated corner that has already rotted 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:33.090
 we completely welded the attack here 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.090
 did my old washing machine 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:43.390
 even white paint there and this 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.890
 parties, too, swallow new turned out 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.820
 that's about all that's so 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.910
 I covered them for nonsense posts 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.660
 I think you can see that there is some kind of tray 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:59.410
 Well, it should not be here, but now I have this 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:04.560
 I will remove the door from the car and try the stimulus 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.560
 That line will see how it works 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.430
 we will make it out of this 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:16.840
 shorter now remove the door mirrors 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:16.840
 someone's gum handle 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.170
 you are everything 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.860
 inside 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.440
 not so generally prepared I was looking for the door 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.900
 brush damn yes I have and have not found 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:40.150
 we will take a break so I poured 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:43.680
 a little wash here in the mug she here 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.680
 how are you I do not know 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.200
 show what is liquid 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.950
 scattered tank 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.950
 so here and apply 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.180
 already 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.830
 on 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.969
 possibly 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.709
 age difference 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.010
 in places where the layer would be bigger she 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.600
 moves away from where less 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:23.430
 there is still holding on for more 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.430
 apply once 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.060
 but this snow is not antigravel layer 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:43.800
 was he holding his will have a gift dar 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.800
 brushes need to be cleaned 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.240
 at all 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:28.520
 In general, you need to apply more. 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.910
 Found although old paintbrush now 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.910
 Little 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:17.090
 but now we will wait another 20 minutes 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:20.479
 then try to brush the metal well 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:24.650
 in general, all I finished here 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:26.690
 small minutes left seals such 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.870
 who will need me then de bau brush 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.099

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:36.139
 Well, one door left me 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:39.139
 Well, about this jar 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:41.990

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:45.340
