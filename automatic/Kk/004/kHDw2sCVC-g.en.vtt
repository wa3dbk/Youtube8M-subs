00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
incredible for trickshotting in itself

they're kind of boxes but you can go off

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.539 
they're kind of boxes but you can go off
those<00:01:32.670> um<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.390> can<00:01:33.509> jump<00:01:33.750> up<00:01:33.930> here<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.549> this

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
those um you can jump up here and this

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.030 
those um you can jump up here and this
is<00:01:35.610> probably<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.180> highest<00:01:36.439> box<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> game

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
is probably the highest box in the game

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.640 
is probably the highest box in the game
that<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.340> go<00:01:38.520> off<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.729> or<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.380> map

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
that you can go off of or in on this map

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.160 
that you can go off of or in on this map
at<00:01:40.860> least<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.340> as<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.509> see<00:01:42.540> they're<00:01:42.990> just

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
at least and as you can see they're just

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.050 
at least and as you can see they're just
really<00:01:43.770> an<00:01:43.920> awful<00:01:44.280> places<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.790> get<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
really an awful places to get to the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.350 
really an awful places to get to the
bombs<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.630> bombs<00:01:45.840> are<00:01:46.020> all<00:01:46.170> elevated<00:01:46.710> and

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
bombs the bombs are all elevated and

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.210 
bombs the bombs are all elevated and
these<00:01:48.360> walls<00:01:48.750> around<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.470> might<00:01:49.710> be<00:01:49.829> okay

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
these walls around it it might be okay

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.889 
these walls around it it might be okay
to<00:01:50.280> go<00:01:50.490> for<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> wall<00:01:50.939> bang<00:01:51.180> or<00:01:51.360> something<00:01:51.659> for

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
to go for a wall bang or something for

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.929 
to go for a wall bang or something for
but<00:01:52.350> all<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.740> walls<00:01:52.950> are<00:01:53.189> really<00:01:53.460> difficult

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
but all the walls are really difficult

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.910 
but all the walls are really difficult
to<00:01:54.030> shoot<00:01:54.210> through<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.710> main

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
to shoot through and that's the main

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.010 
to shoot through and that's the main
reason<00:01:55.950> i<00:01:56.310> don't<00:01:56.520> recommend<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.719> map

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
reason i don't recommend this this map

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.679 
reason i don't recommend this this map
too<00:01:58.320> much<00:01:58.500> for<00:01:58.829> search<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.369> definitely<00:02:00.180> try<00:02:00.600> and

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
too much for search I definitely try and

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.539 
too much for search I definitely try and
get<00:02:00.810> one<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.079> other<00:02:01.200> ones<00:02:01.409> one<00:02:02.340> really

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
get one of the other ones one really

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.609 
get one of the other ones one really
cool<00:02:02.729> spot<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.210> do<00:02:03.299> like<00:02:03.630> back<00:02:03.869> here<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.439> if

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
cool spot that I do like back here is if

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.160 
cool spot that I do like back here is if
you<00:02:04.740> climb<00:02:04.950> up<00:02:05.159> on<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.460> wall<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.140> over<00:02:07.140> here

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
you climb up on this wall and over here

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.740 
you climb up on this wall and over here
on<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:07.950> little<00:02:08.009> railing<00:02:08.459> thing<00:02:08.879> gives

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
on to this little railing thing gives

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.630 
on to this little railing thing gives
you<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.899> little<00:02:10.080> bit<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.319> extra<00:02:10.679> height<00:02:10.920> because

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
you a little bit of extra height because

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.700 
you a little bit of extra height because
you<00:02:11.819> can<00:02:12.030> go<00:02:12.239> for<00:02:12.420> your<00:02:12.510> trick<00:02:12.720> shot<00:02:12.959> and

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
you can go for your trick shot and

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.440 
you can go for your trick shot and
you<00:02:13.890> can<00:02:14.010> fall<00:02:14.250> into<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:14.550> little<00:02:14.850> hole<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.390> if

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
you can fall into this little hole so if

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.390 
you can fall into this little hole so if
there's<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.690> guy<00:02:15.840> going<00:02:16.110> over<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:17.220> can

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
there's a guy going over to a you can

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.130 
there's a guy going over to a you can
kind<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.760> drop<00:02:18.060> down<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.330> little<00:02:18.570> bit<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.960> gives

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
kind of drop down a little bit it gives

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.610 
kind of drop down a little bit it gives
you<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.260> little<00:02:19.530> extra<00:02:19.620> dish<00:02:19.980> distance<00:02:20.790> but

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
you a little extra dish distance but

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.350 
you a little extra dish distance but
overall<00:02:22.620> on<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.610> map<00:02:23.820> you're<00:02:24.030> just<00:02:24.150> going<00:02:24.300> to

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
overall on this map you're just going to

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.720 
overall on this map you're just going to
want<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.510> stick<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:24.990> top<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.530> map

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
want to stick to the top of the map

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.680 
want to stick to the top of the map
that's<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.910> fastest<00:02:27.270> way<00:02:27.300> you're<00:02:27.510> going<00:02:27.630> to

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
that's the fastest way you're going to

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.720 
that's the fastest way you're going to
clear<00:02:27.900> out<00:02:28.050> on<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.320> map<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.740> again<00:02:28.980> TDM<00:02:29.460> is

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
clear out on this map and again TDM is

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.150 
clear out on this map and again TDM is
this<00:02:29.940> map<00:02:30.150> strong<00:02:30.540> point<00:02:30.840> in<00:02:30.990> my<00:02:31.140> opinion<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:32.130> I

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
this map strong point in my opinion so I

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.520 
this map strong point in my opinion so I
don't<00:02:33.000> worry<00:02:33.150> guys<00:02:33.330> there<00:02:33.780> are<00:02:33.810> other<00:02:34.080> maps<00:02:34.350> to

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
don't worry guys there are other maps to

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.140 
don't worry guys there are other maps to
come<00:02:34.740> today<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.010> I'm<00:02:35.460> going<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.670> try<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:35.970> get
