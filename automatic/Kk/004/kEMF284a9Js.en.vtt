00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.080 
because once you get to certain mounted
dogs<00:00:10.469> as<00:00:10.650> many<00:00:10.830> people<00:00:11.010> know<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.370> basically

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
dogs as many people know is basically

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.060 
dogs as many people know is basically
well<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:12.809> Xbox<00:00:13.200> versions<00:00:13.559> in<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.679> lead<00:00:13.860> stuff

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
well on Xbox versions in the lead stuff

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.099 
well on Xbox versions in the lead stuff

spawning<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.710> your<00:00:16.830> area<00:00:17.130> because<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
spawning in your area because of the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.700 
spawning in your area because of the
fact<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:18.029> have<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.270> many<00:00:18.390> don't<00:00:19.109> know<00:00:19.170> why<00:00:19.380> but

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
fact you have so many don't know why but

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.970 
fact you have so many don't know why but
I<00:00:19.770> guess<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.130> just<00:00:20.279> does<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:21.650> basically<00:00:22.650> just

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
I guess it just does so basically just

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.200 
I guess it just does so basically just
the<00:00:23.070> trick<00:00:23.310> for<00:00:23.490> those<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.029> have<00:00:24.180> a

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
I said because of the fact that so many

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.910 
I said because of the fact that so many
dogs<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.449> have<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:31.320> won't<00:00:31.529> be<00:00:31.679> able<00:00:31.830> to

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
dogs that you have you won't be able to

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.799 
dogs that you have you won't be able to
get<00:00:32.099> more<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.700> what<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.880> want<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.540> well

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
get more so what you want to do is well

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.920 
get more so what you want to do is well
there's<00:00:33.960> two<00:00:34.079> ways<00:00:34.110> one<00:00:35.070> way<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.719> that<00:00:36.719> if<00:00:36.840> you

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
there's two ways one way is that if you

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.619 
there's two ways one way is that if you
kill<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> dog<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:38.030> more<00:00:39.030> animals<00:00:39.329> will<00:00:39.420> spawn

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
kill a dog and more animals will spawn

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.930 
kill a dog and more animals will spawn
you'll<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:39.930> just<00:00:40.260> kill<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> dog<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.070> like

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
you'll be just kill a dog and like

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.010 
you'll be just kill a dog and like
hopefully<00:00:42.180> it'll<00:00:42.420> be<00:00:42.510> under<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.750> limits

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
hopefully it'll be under the limits

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.540 
hopefully it'll be under the limits
where<00:00:43.110> more<00:00:43.260> animals<00:00:43.530> will<00:00:43.620> spawn<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.280> you'll

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
where more animals will spawn and you'll

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.130 
where more animals will spawn and you'll
be<00:00:44.610> able<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.789> find<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.969> pack<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.390> dogs<00:00:45.570> will<00:00:46.050> have

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
be able to find a pack of dogs will have

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.229 
be able to find a pack of dogs will have
four<00:00:46.379> or<00:00:46.469> five<00:00:46.620> dogs<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.250> basically<00:00:48.149> you're

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
four or five dogs and basically you're

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.479 
four or five dogs and basically you're
just<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.629> sacrificing<00:00:49.350> one<00:00:49.530> for<00:00:49.829> three<00:00:50.399> or

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
just like sacrificing one for three or

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.369 
just like sacrificing one for three or
four<00:00:50.670> more<00:00:50.879> I'm<00:00:51.480> not<00:00:51.690> really<00:00:51.809> into<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.350> I

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
four more I'm not really into that so I

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.200 
four more I'm not really into that so I
don't<00:00:52.530> do<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.649> one<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.219> basically<00:00:53.789> what<00:00:54.180> you

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
don't do that one but basically what you

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.139 
don't do that one but basically what you
can<00:00:54.449> do<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> easier<00:00:55.110> way<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.640> basically<00:00:56.640> have

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
can do the easier way is basically have

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.090 
can do the easier way is basically have
somebody<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.899> your<00:00:57.930> game<00:00:58.230> or<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.800> your<00:00:58.949> world
