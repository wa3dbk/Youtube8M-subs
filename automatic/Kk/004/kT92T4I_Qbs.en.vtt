00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the sniper rifles it just as is but I do

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.469 
the sniper rifles it just as is but I do
find<00:01:25.439> them<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.740> pretty<00:01:25.979> effective<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.700> tend

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
find them to be pretty effective I tend

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.179 
find them to be pretty effective I tend
to<00:01:27.540> like<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.869> semi-automatic<00:01:28.290> rifle<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.950> lot

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
to like the semi-automatic rifle a lot

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.249 
to like the semi-automatic rifle a lot
better<00:01:29.460> then<00:01:30.150> bolt<00:01:30.420> action<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:31.110> think

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
better then bolt action I just think

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.770 
better then bolt action I just think
it's<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.409> lot<00:01:31.560> more<00:01:31.590> effective<00:01:32.220> but<00:01:32.430> uh<00:01:32.540> down<00:01:33.540> to

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
it's a lot more effective but uh down to

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.620 
it's a lot more effective but uh down to
the<00:01:34.020> downloadable<00:01:34.680> guns<00:01:34.890> which<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.340> the

don't really mean to but the other

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:31.469 
don't really mean to but the other
reason<00:07:30.310> is<00:07:30.610> is<00:07:30.819> because<00:07:30.849> it's<00:07:31.330> the<00:07:31.449> easiest
