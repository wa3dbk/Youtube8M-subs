00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.320
 there I work a little the look have 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.789
 an area over one's eyes around for 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.160
 better bring out a little bit the 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:21.910
 look and we'll put him a little 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:22.960
 shade a little yellow in the eyes we have 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.499
 started sketching 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.169
 we did not want characters 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:30.849
 clown and we really want is for 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.500
 variants there is one who has a face 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.990
 of bandits is another who looks 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.790
 a little cow boys incas look bewildered 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.860
 finally here we were trying to find like 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.450
 that's characteristics and then we've got them 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.450
 worked put them back to draw 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.610
 I did not work with teenagers 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.280
 of insects and I was taking elements 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.250
 real in for example a detail 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.500
 of antenna a drawing on the nose but I 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.150
 took a real element and I did 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.420
 something else 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.240
 for example ants 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.890
 red is long on their carapace a 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.710
 little bit this side crab crustaceans 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.049
 slightly with some materials a little 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.119
 grainy kiki who take the light 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:36.560
 they are a little shiny but not 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.270
 Too much must be given a realism in 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.020
 the more we integrate it into sets of 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.789
 real shots 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.090
 even if in the avs in reality one 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:46.549
 account if you find ants 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.810
 red like that I believe no after the 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.340
 names a little scared and eyes in the 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.380
 eyes it's really the bridge between us 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.259
 and we know the old whites with the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.569
 black goose that kind of look a little 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:10.190
 naive that's really the element that makes 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:11.600
 we attach to them the storyboard him 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.690
 allowed to find ideas this is to 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.260
 to say that when drawing ideas 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.260
 narrative arrives she
