extremely simple indicator I found it

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.280 
extremely simple indicator I found it
because<00:01:36.040> i<00:01:36.100> had<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.369> sp500<00:01:37.030> long-term<00:01:37.900> I'm<00:01:38.110> on

for the baby boom on the other side and

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.900 
for the baby boom on the other side and
I<00:01:41.590> realized<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.250> charts<00:01:42.580> looked<00:01:42.790> identical

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
I realized the charts looked identical

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:51.500 
I realized the charts looked identical
put<00:01:43.479> them<00:01:43.570> together<00:01:43.690> 45<00:01:44.649> to<00:01:44.800> 50<00:01:45.100> year<00:01:45.250> lack

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.510 

take<00:01:52.510> 1961<00:01:53.500> which<00:01:53.710> was<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:53.980> peak<00:01:54.190> here<00:01:54.400> of

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
take 1961 which was the peak here of

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.910 
take 1961 which was the peak here of
baby<00:01:54.700> boomers<00:01:54.940> before<00:01:55.630> births<00:01:56.380> turned<00:01:56.680> out

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
baby boomers before births turned out

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.730 
baby boomers before births turned out
and<00:01:57.160> add<00:01:57.670> 48<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.540> average<00:01:58.720> spending<00:01:59.320> that<00:01:59.530> get

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
and add 48 the average spending that get

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.740 
and add 48 the average spending that get
that<00:01:59.920> gives<00:02:00.160> you<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:00.340> peek<00:02:00.640> around<00:02:00.850> late<00:02:01.510> two

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
that gives you a peek around late two

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.000 
that gives you a peek around late two
thousand<00:02:02.260> nine<00:02:02.290> so<00:02:02.590> it<00:02:02.650> really<00:02:02.830> is<00:02:02.920> that

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
thousand nine so it really is that

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.370 
thousand nine so it really is that
simple<00:02:03.160> baby<00:02:04.060> boomers<00:02:04.390> earn<00:02:04.750> and<00:02:04.960> spend<00:02:05.050> more

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
simple baby boomers earn and spend more

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.070 
simple baby boomers earn and spend more
money<00:02:05.590> till<00:02:05.920> around<00:02:06.220> late<00:02:06.550> 2009<00:02:07.330> and<00:02:07.540> then

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
money till around late 2009 and then

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.840 
money till around late 2009 and then
they<00:02:08.200> slowly<00:02:08.410> earn<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:09.310> spend<00:02:09.399> less<00:02:09.640> money

they slowly earn and spend less money

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.330
