00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.390
 so what I advise for departure 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.039
 swimming according to your level 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.750
 if you have a good level you can 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.130
 from where you go, go quickly 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.419
 two to three hundred meters and once 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.220
 you will have taken your island you will be 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.640
 place and here you are you would slow down 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.809
 a little bit and then where to go on your 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.890
 cruising pace for beginners 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.690
 what I advise you is from you 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.610
 place behind in order to avoid costs 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.440
 and not just going away too much 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.960
 fast for you and common save at 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.010
 maximum during your run or power 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.449
 to meet several scenarios 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.699
 especially a group that catches you 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.269
 so if you still have a little bit 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.070
 energy 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.210
 there it will be necessary to try to accelerate and 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.760
 take the feet or take the wave 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.780
 it depends a little bit so no 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.049
 not swim alone and take 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.049
 aspiration 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.000
 in the wave is benefiting from 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.150
 the swimmer's aspiration which is in front 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.119
 you therefore as a rule I advocate 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.000
 swimming and not behind the swimmer 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.010
 that is to say 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.950
 just behind his feet because there we 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.810
 will be disrupted by beat of 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.460
 kick but rather to swim 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.350
 on the side at the level of at the level of 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.580
 hips so head to your head at 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.320
 level of the swimmer's hip that is 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.140
 right in front of you in order to benefit from 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.210
 suction and swim as fast as him 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.630
 and in addition to saving for the rest 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.630
 of the race 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.770
 approaching a buoy he confessed on the 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.740
 swimming course will inevitably 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.270
 slow down that much if the boe is found 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.750
 near the start swimming you go 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.750
 to be numerous 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.290
 so it is advisable we will say 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.490
 to accelerate a little bit 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.600
 before approaching a scramble is 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.160
 past buoys and then from 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.890
 re-accelerate to find a 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.360
 swimming speed ok for that I 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.890
 advise you to increase your 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.160
 leg frequency and your frequency 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.160
 of arms
