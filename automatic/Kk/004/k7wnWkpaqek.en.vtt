you take the steak out it shouldn't be

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.380 
you take the steak out it shouldn't be
fully<00:02:24.680> cooked<00:02:24.980> yet<00:02:25.219> it<00:02:25.489> should<00:02:25.519> be<00:02:26.120> almost

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
fully cooked yet it should be almost

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.110 
fully cooked yet it should be almost
cooked<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.170> then<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.549> take<00:02:28.549> it<00:02:28.579> out<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:29.030> put

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
cooked and then you take it out and put

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.420 
cooked and then you take it out and put
on<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.019> plate<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.470> it's<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.799> for<00:02:30.980> though<00:02:31.099> let

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
on the plate that it's it for though let

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.250 
on the plate that it's it for though let
the<00:02:31.519> juices<00:02:31.879> run<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.390> when<00:02:32.569> that<00:02:32.720> happens<00:02:33.140> it

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
the juices run and when that happens it

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.940 
the juices run and when that happens it
cooks<00:02:33.439> a<00:02:33.560> little<00:02:33.769> more

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.089

so<00:04:03.650> I'm<00:04:03.709> pretty<00:04:04.010> happy<00:04:04.280> about<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.940> point

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
so I'm pretty happy about the point

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.879 
so I'm pretty happy about the point
eight<00:04:05.359> plus<00:04:05.799> today<00:04:06.799> I<00:04:07.130> spotted<00:04:07.639> tom<00:04:08.530> so<00:04:09.530> that's

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
eight plus today I spotted tom so that's

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.569 
eight plus today I spotted tom so that's
another<00:04:10.190> reason<00:04:10.760> I<00:04:11.209> usually<00:04:12.040> gain<00:04:13.040> weight

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
another reason I usually gain weight

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.460 
another reason I usually gain weight
right<00:04:13.940> before<00:04:14.450> Tom<00:04:14.630> starts<00:04:14.989> and<00:04:15.109> then<00:04:15.200> when

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
right before Tom starts and then when

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.060 
right before Tom starts and then when
Tom<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:16.100> start<00:04:16.519> I<00:04:16.760> start<00:04:16.910> to<00:04:17.739> get<00:04:18.739> rid<00:04:18.919> of<00:04:18.979> that

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
Tom the start I start to get rid of that

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.310 
Tom the start I start to get rid of that
water<00:04:19.400> weight<00:04:19.609> so<00:04:20.359> that's<00:04:20.599> good<00:04:20.810> I<00:04:21.019> didn't

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
water weight so that's good I didn't

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.110 
water weight so that's good I didn't
want<00:04:21.440> to<00:04:21.620> clear<00:04:21.859> up<00:04:21.979> yesterday's<00:04:22.490> exercise

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
want to clear up yesterday's exercise

thing I was primarily talking about

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.450 
thing I was primarily talking about
sometimes<00:04:27.410> it<00:04:27.530> goes<00:04:27.650> off<00:04:27.950> like<00:04:28.130> when<00:04:28.370> the

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
sometimes it goes off like when the
