a new set of chords this doesn't work
for<00:00:18.330> every<00:00:18.539> song<00:00:19.010> but<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.160> does<00:00:20.340> work<00:00:20.520> for<00:00:20.789> a

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
for every song but it does work for a

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.269 
for every song but it does work for a
lot<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.150> them<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.480> it's<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.560> technique<00:00:22.920> which<00:00:23.130> I

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
lot of them and it's a technique which I

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.439 
lot of them and it's a technique which I
use<00:00:23.580> because<00:00:24.109> I<00:00:26.000> might<00:00:27.000> be<00:00:27.090> playing<00:00:27.269> with<00:00:27.390> a

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
use because I might be playing with a

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.859 
use because I might be playing with a
guitarist<00:00:27.810> or<00:00:29.240> somebody<00:00:30.240> who<00:00:30.359> knows<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> song

those courts the next step to being able

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.850 
those courts the next step to being able
to<00:01:14.340> transpose<00:01:14.970> them<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.619> playing<00:01:16.619> them

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
to transpose them is playing them

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.850 
to transpose them is playing them
without<00:01:17.580> your<00:01:17.729> index<00:01:17.850> finger<00:01:18.740> you<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:19.830> only

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
without your index finger you can only

well yeah watch me use my pinky my
middle<00:01:28.590> finger<00:01:28.890> my<00:01:29.070> ring<00:01:29.280> finger

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.620 

and<00:01:43.130> again<00:01:43.400> there<00:01:43.820> are<00:01:43.909> some<00:01:44.090> chords<00:01:44.450> that<00:01:44.600> are

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
and again there are some chords that are

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.880 
and again there are some chords that are
going<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:44.869> be<00:01:44.930> very<00:01:45.110> difficult<00:01:45.290> to<00:01:45.590> do<00:01:45.770> this

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
going to be very difficult to do this

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.390 
going to be very difficult to do this
with<00:01:46.220> an<00:01:46.700> F<00:01:46.880> minor<00:01:47.180> for<00:01:47.479> example<00:01:48.340> is<00:01:49.340> really

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
with an F minor for example is really

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.760 
with an F minor for example is really
difficult<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.420> play<00:01:50.600> without<00:01:50.869> your<00:01:51.380> index

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
difficult to play without your index

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.690 
difficult to play without your index
finger<00:01:52.250> so<00:01:53.680> now<00:01:54.680> what<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:54.979> can<00:01:55.009> do<00:01:55.310> is<00:01:55.460> you<00:01:55.580> can

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
finger so now what you can do is you can

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.490 
finger so now what you can do is you can
take<00:01:55.910> your<00:01:55.970> index<00:01:56.810> finger<00:01:57.080> which<00:01:57.229> you're<00:01:57.380> not

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
take your index finger which you're not

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.790 
take your index finger which you're not
using<00:01:57.680> for<00:01:57.800> the<00:01:57.979> song<00:01:58.190> anymore<00:01:58.430> and<00:01:58.970> bar<00:01:59.810> the

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
using for the song anymore and bar the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.800 
using for the song anymore and bar the
the<00:02:01.130> frets<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:02.000> strings<00:02:02.270> on<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.570> fret

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
the frets the strings on the fret

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.350 
the frets the strings on the fret
anywhere<00:02:04.390> what<00:02:05.390> was<00:02:05.509> a<00:02:05.540> c2<00:02:06.050> ukulele<00:02:07.360> now

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
anywhere what was a c2 ukulele now

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:16.830 
anywhere what was a c2 ukulele now
becomes<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:09.110> thr<00:02:09.950> B<00:02:10.220> or<00:02:11.950> B<00:02:13.239> c-sharp<00:02:14.239> c-sharp

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
becomes a thr B or B c-sharp c-sharp

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.990 
becomes a thr B or B c-sharp c-sharp
really<00:02:17.840> whatever<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:18.769> want<00:02:19.070> so<00:02:19.370> that<00:02:19.700> same

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
really whatever you want so that same

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.750 
really whatever you want so that same
song<00:02:20.269> latency<00:02:21.260> maybe<00:02:21.980> I'm<00:02:22.160> playing<00:02:22.459> it<00:02:22.610> with<00:02:22.730> a

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
song latency maybe I'm playing it with a

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.850 
song latency maybe I'm playing it with a
trumpet<00:02:23.570> player<00:02:23.750> when<00:02:24.110> we<00:02:24.230> knows<00:02:24.380> in<00:02:24.560> e-flat

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
trumpet player when we knows in e-flat

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.630 
trumpet player when we knows in e-flat
that's<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.700> common<00:02:26.030> trumpet<00:02:26.360> key<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:28.280> I<00:02:28.310> just

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
that's a common trumpet key so I just

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.699 
that's a common trumpet key so I just
bar<00:02:29.540> at<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.260> third<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:32.660> exact<00:02:32.930> same<00:02:33.110> way<00:02:33.230> my<00:02:33.440> C

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
bar at the third the exact same way my C

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:40.660 
bar at the third the exact same way my C
becomes<00:02:34.550> any<00:02:34.790> flat<00:02:35.060> my<00:02:36.019> e7<00:02:36.739> becomes<00:02:39.670> whatever

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
becomes any flat my e7 becomes whatever

00:02:40.670 --> 00:03:20.190 
becomes any flat my e7 becomes whatever
that<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:41.739> g7<00:02:42.739> so<00:02:43.640> let's<00:02:43.970> try<00:02:44.209> it

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.449 

this<00:03:21.200> is<00:03:21.319> useful<00:03:21.500> in<00:03:21.799> a<00:03:21.859> lot<00:03:21.889> of<00:03:22.099> different

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
this is useful in a lot of different

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:23.890 
this is useful in a lot of different
situations<00:03:22.579> not<00:03:23.180> just<00:03:23.419> like<00:03:23.540> I<00:03:23.659> was<00:03:23.750> talking

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
situations not just like I was talking

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.319 
situations not just like I was talking
about<00:03:24.260> you<00:03:24.469> know<00:03:24.620> I'm<00:03:24.859> with<00:03:25.189> with<00:03:26.060> horn

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
g-string or D tuning I mean it doesn't

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.990 
g-string or D tuning I mean it doesn't
really<00:04:57.570> matter<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:58.410> in<00:04:59.310> a<00:04:59.400> lot<00:04:59.550> of<00:04:59.580> ways<00:04:59.820> it

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
really matter and in a lot of ways it

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.580
