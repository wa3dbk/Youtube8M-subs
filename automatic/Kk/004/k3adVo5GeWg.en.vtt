00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 one and in this we have until removed 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.210
 software that is a game in which 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.280
 we are in a giant tower in another 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.559
 we have a board with one hand and the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.330
 another hand we use to hit on 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.950
 Far away he asked what they want 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.960
 attack and take out the delicious tacos 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.160
 we have two movements attack and 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.410
 defend 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.029
 there are strange monsters all 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.769
 we have to defend our taco and 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.810
 leave the tower those are the two 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.849
 objectives that they propose to us in this game 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.590
 this is a truth is very simple but the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.380
 true that is very entertaining game and 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.270
 play then there were some good beating 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.550
 the monsters that are quite strange 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.110
 or nor can it be the tacos and we have more 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.809
 blue of images good here is 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.000
 Chiquito tower here he puts a 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.100
 this game that is a lot more 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.559
 basic than the other because we have to 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.780
 by rooms and shooting the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.180
 enemies that is the main objective 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.190
 tour the room is kill renovate 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.480
 your weapons this game against many 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.730
 levels so it's pretty 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.219
 entertaining we can play a good time 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.170
 it makes us have a lot of good in this 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.579
 you have jet location and Hunter 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.489
 which is a game in which we have to 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.070
 hunt the yeti himself the man of the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.140
 snow 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.659
 we are in the forest we are traveling 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.640
 all of us who have a sniper and 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.920
 if we get to see this spawn we have 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.630
 that point and shoot is the only 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.460
 objective of this game but the truth 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.560
 which is quite entertaining 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.420
 I cataloged it more or less as a game 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.940
 of terror because grace is a game 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.520
 horror because you enjoyed being stressed 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.320
 with the music the atmosphere after you 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.030
 Jet and Giant show up and have to 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.280
 shoot the face that gives a little bit of 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.890
 susto I recommend it to all lovers 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.700
 of good terror of course I could not 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.710
 miss minecraft in this position 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.990
 when we could say that this 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.960
 is the manga clone the truth that 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.880
 minecraft is the pixelated sps that wins 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.880
 all but good I did not want to put 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.110
 minecraft because it's going to be too 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.509
 always the same then I put a 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.610
 small clone and it should be mentioned that the 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.009
 best clone of minecraft that I found is 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.720
 very entertaining is the same as manga is 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.340
 can build has to survive the 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.110
 I really recommend them to everyone 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.179
 that you like minecraft but that 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.600
 they want to try something a little more different 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.910
 cell fucking 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.190
 ok here we find mega man 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.530
 8-bit good match this is a remake 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.540
 of the mega man but in the first person 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.730
 this game is great because it's the game that 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.120
 changed the entire generation of video games 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.560
 and provides a genius did this remake the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.430
 so great game because it entertains us 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.950
 very much 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.500
 we can play a lot of time because in 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.390
 reality is the complete game but 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.490
 obviously as I mentioned in 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.070
 first person the only difference is 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.570
 the story the textures the characters 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.650
 the enemies are all completely 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.060
 same 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.800
 This is one of the games that most 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.010
 I like it and I really recommend it to 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.080
 all all good people well we get to the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.470
 end of this video remember to give me 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.470
 like 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.540
