00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:14.879
 the phytoplankton money how much is worth a minute 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:16.449
 for those who lose a goal 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.570
 the value of a business and not closed 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.600
 to who sends a gift with a smile so that in the fourth time the talent 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:25.640
 of an exam 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.949
 a relief 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:34.150
 for those who expect an ambulance life a minute is worth a lot for their operation 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.120
 further spread to your customer this concept was the starting point 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.290
 for the creation of the WMO in New York 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.960
 and to eliminate every minute is unnecessary we created a system that 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.770
 allows you to manage that optimize Santa's field operation 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.270
 lula estimated that it is possible to record that exactly the 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.450
 field as it runs 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.530
 creating each event 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.470
 from the dispatch of the field service order to completion 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.560
 the information regarding the execution of the service order also 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.790
 are all recorded by the field professional directly in the system 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.040
 eliminating rework and reducing verbs in the information record 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.229
 simple and intuitive 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.010
 the process is executed step by step 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.010
 independent of the coverage of the mobile operator 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.590
 all information about the execution of the service order 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.740
 are automatically forwarded to the team 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.010
 because he wears interactive jeans directly on his cell phone 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.080
 eliminating an error of understanding and waiting time 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.990
 with this new reality location 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.149
 of all field teams in real time 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.660
 offering operation management 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.109
 cut off the information you need 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:02.639
 to choose the best team to execute a 

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:04.610
 scheduled 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.259
 the order of execution of field services can also be established 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.430
 avoiding deviations and ensuring that the routing will effectively 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.919
 performed 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:21.069
 the system also confers the terms of service so the management of the 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.790
 operation can act preventively 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.010
 with the objective of guaranteeing the execution of the work 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:33.249
 the set of all states stored by the 10th largest 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.840
 the performance evaluation at various levels of the operation 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.319
 the system also highlights the best and worst performances 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.689
 allowing the definition of goals 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.829
 both for the field teams 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.829
 operating households 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:55.519
 with all this always has the tiny wasted by staff are 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.580
 completely eliminated 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.580
 which makes the operation more efficient and cheaper 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:06.849
 besides reducing the time of service in the goal of the quality control and the 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.579
 security of the service you lend your customer 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.509
 paul house in new york 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:16.029
 I really trust it, it was worth a lot. 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:16.859
 ever
