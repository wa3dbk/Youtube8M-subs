thing<00:02:27.990> I<00:02:28.110> noticed<00:02:28.500> obviously<00:02:29.250> about<00:02:29.490> this

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
thing I noticed obviously about this

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.810 
thing I noticed obviously about this
deck<00:02:29.970> was<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.570> Joker's<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.260> they<00:02:31.410> are

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
deck was the Joker's and they are

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.350 
deck was the Joker's and they are
standard<00:02:33.020> be<00:02:34.020> Joker's<00:02:34.730> you<00:02:35.730> get<00:02:35.910> two<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.120> them

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
standard be Joker's you get two of them

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.050 
standard be Joker's you get two of them
and<00:02:37.070> everybody's<00:02:38.070> pretty<00:02:38.250> much<00:02:38.490> seen<00:02:38.790> these

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
and everybody's pretty much seen these

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.660 
and everybody's pretty much seen these
so<00:02:39.480> there<00:02:39.690> nothing<00:02:40.820> nothing<00:02:41.820> new<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:43.670> deck

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
so there nothing nothing new the deck

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.370 
so there nothing nothing new the deck
also<00:02:45.210> comes<00:02:45.540> with<00:02:45.840> two<00:02:47.210> ask<00:02:48.380> Alexander

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
dot-org cards these these could probably

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.300 
dot-org cards these these could probably
do<00:02:54.660> double<00:02:55.080> as<00:02:55.200> Joker's<00:02:55.680> as<00:02:55.860> well<00:02:56.040> because
