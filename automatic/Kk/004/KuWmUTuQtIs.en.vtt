and it's a mini moon stick what's not to
love<00:04:17.489> about<00:04:17.549> it<00:04:20.630> the<00:04:21.630> only<00:04:21.959> downside<00:04:22.500> was

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740

premium<00:04:23.490> band<00:04:23.730> I<00:04:23.940> set<00:04:24.390> a<00:04:24.630> quantity<00:04:25.290> limit<00:04:25.710> of

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
premium band I set a quantity limit of

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.180 
premium band I set a quantity limit of
three<00:04:26.520> I<00:04:26.730> think<00:04:27.260> so<00:04:28.260> I<00:04:28.290> made<00:04:28.740> it<00:04:28.770> really

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
three I think so I made it really

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.030 
three I think so I made it really
difficult<00:04:29.430> for<00:04:29.850> people<00:04:30.300> outside<00:04:31.110> of<00:04:31.380> Japan<00:04:31.830> to

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
difficult for people outside of Japan to
