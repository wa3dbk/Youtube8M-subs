take<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> screwdriver<00:00:46.020> or<00:00:46.230> something<00:00:46.469> else

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
take a screwdriver or something else

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.340

I<00:00:47.100> got<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> butter<00:00:47.610> knife<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.950> you<00:00:49.950> got<00:00:50.129> a

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
I got a butter knife and you got a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.770 
I got a butter knife and you got a
figure<00:00:52.350> out<00:00:52.530> there<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.390> manually<00:00:54.390> flip

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
figure out there so you manually flip

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.389 
figure out there so you manually flip
the<00:00:54.989> switch<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.620> actually<00:00:55.890> do<00:00:56.250> that

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
the switch and you can actually do that

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.139 
the switch and you can actually do that
back<00:00:56.670> here

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
back here

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.750

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.889 
so if I need my defroster I'm going to
be<00:00:59.879> screwed<00:01:00.379> for<00:01:01.379> now<00:01:01.530> because<00:01:02.660> it<00:01:03.660> just

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899

myself<00:04:07.040> and<00:04:08.040> well<00:04:08.520> I<00:04:09.350> might<00:04:10.350> have<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.740> be<00:04:10.890> using

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
myself and well I might have to be using

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.520 
myself and well I might have to be using
a<00:04:11.610> rag<00:04:11.910> to<00:04:12.390> wipe<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.840> frost<00:04:13.110> off<00:04:13.350> my

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
windshield when it does become a problem

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.479 
windshield when it does become a problem
because<00:04:15.840> I<00:04:16.109> don't<00:04:16.500> have<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:16.980> money<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.250> pay

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
because I don't have the money to pay

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.539 
because I don't have the money to pay
hundreds<00:04:17.940> of<00:04:18.030> dollars<00:04:18.090> to<00:04:18.660> have<00:04:19.040> this<00:04:20.040> piece

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
hundreds of dollars to have this piece

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.690 
hundreds of dollars to have this piece
of<00:04:20.940> heating<00:04:21.540> and<00:04:21.660> air<00:04:21.750> system<00:04:21.959> fixed<00:04:24.050> so

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
of heating and air system fixed so

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.070 
of heating and air system fixed so
that<00:04:26.700> really<00:04:27.180> sucks<00:04:27.450> I<00:04:27.720> was<00:04:27.840> hoping

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
that really sucks I was hoping

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.140 
that really sucks I was hoping
it<00:04:28.200> would<00:04:28.290> be<00:04:28.320> a<00:04:28.820> do-it-yourself<00:04:29.820> kind<00:04:30.000> of

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
it would be a do-it-yourself kind of

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.700 
it would be a do-it-yourself kind of
thing<00:04:30.360> but<00:04:30.630> obviously<00:04:31.080> it's<00:04:31.290> not<00:04:31.470> going<00:04:31.650> to

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
thing but obviously it's not going to

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.940 
thing but obviously it's not going to
turn<00:04:31.830> out<00:04:31.890> that<00:04:32.310> way<00:04:33.410> but<00:04:34.410> oh<00:04:34.650> well<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:36.270> car<00:04:36.510> is
