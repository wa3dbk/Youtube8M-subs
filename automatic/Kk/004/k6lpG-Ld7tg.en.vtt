00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Y 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.720
 as this exercise we are going to work 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.349
 back the position we look for the vertical 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.349
 with the trunk 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.080
 the grip we look for there are knees 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.760
 flexed open chest you calculate 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.790
 back always connected long 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.869
 column we take air taking the grip 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.939
 to the waist 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.869
 we breathe is the second of perception 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.869
 national and we take air 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.970
 they all pass next to the trunk, not what 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.830
 we will know and only play to do 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.750
 taking air by bringing the grip towards 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.750
 me releasing the air 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.930
 and working with the weight 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.090
 they always control limping 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.890
 it should not be made to reflect they worked 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.480
 in flexion with the faults always 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.470
 we look for the correct position all 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.820
 streams to look first for the 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.160
 security and safety gives it to us 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.090
 find a correct position then of 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.010
 a straight back the open chest 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.470
 we always manage and dominate others the 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.150
 weight no weight dominates us us I 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.350
 when I catch my breath I bring this weight 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.540
 fernando braking movement with the 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.860
 muscles not letting the weight of the 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.210
 machine take me forward always 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.860
 motion control both the easy 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.860
 positive that would be is with the phases 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.500
 negative that carrying weight again to 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.490
 your position wrong we choose air and we throw 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.770
 air tendency to not accelerate and fast and 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.570
 play do not handle me taking air and 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.550
 throwing air trying to clear themselves in 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.500
 the back on the contrary everything else 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.300
 we have to take a breath with a service 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.160
 resistance and we breathe in a point 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.500
 contrary to when we work a chest 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.270
 with shoulder with more natural leg 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.479
 you take air is more natural energy of 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.369
 country because it's having here closing 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.600
 but above all keep the position 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.490
 correct we do not care about the ones to 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.440
 who maintains the correct position and 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.860
 not for want to overcome a greater weight of 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.720
 that I want small I can 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.130
 but what is the exposure in the 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.070
 techniques while adopting a good 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.320
 technique the weight can handle who wants 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.460
 always with good technique and weight 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.460
 and always looking for security 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.830
 I'm france or olympique tour director 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.500
 and today I'm going to tell you how to use the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.920
 machines the correct technique of 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.920
 execution 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.709
 'I'm screen 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.260
 nothing
