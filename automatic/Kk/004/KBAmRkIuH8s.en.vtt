00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.299
 hello everyone here pokémon madoff 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.069
 and we are for a new video 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.380
 so today it will be how 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.500
 differentiate a card a strength cards 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.030
 pokemon of a real map then 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.880
 the english expression a fake card 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.449
 so here we have a real map 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.840
 then a flame card add cards 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.390
 French 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.699
 you see how old on it 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.510
 make it very simple a normal card 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.800
 when you see is still blu to 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.980
 some blues anyway dark if the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.739
 terminals are all equal and here is a 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.980
 fake card 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:48.300
 see what the most is not and that it is not 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.100
 not quite the same on video is going 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.390
 maybe theirs but it is not 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.739
 not for example the card pec saw it goes 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.489
 see that it's very clear that it's 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:08.670
 one that if you only do the energies 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:13.080
 are not the same, go good, that does not mean 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.720
 liked to go good so it shows when 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.500
 even though good the energies are not 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.810
 at all such stars count more green 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.860
 at the bottom the writing styles is not 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:30.979
 no longer the same for example another 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.979
 card that is fake féhik stars love 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.470
 it shows automatically that it is not 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.320
 not new anymore to find out if nor 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.600
 a map is fake or no example you 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.490
 take a real because pokemon maybe 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.439
 just took a little bit you see is 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.180
 that much more can done away 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:55.070
 contrary had a lot and without them 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.070
 appoint - client 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.860
 so asked why I have so many 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.040
 cards that are made 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.870
 is that a person with whom I am going 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.979
 make an exchange had a lot of 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.869
 carcela all his cards were 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.729
 facts because he had taken in a 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.790
 flea market flea market 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:18.160
 then you have what do we do to 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.160
 cards that are made us the costs 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.020
 ever we must keep 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.250
 cards that are fake because that could 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.860
 hurt your collection 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.450
 so we cut a lot had been done 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.250
 so do not be afraid of the cuts and 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.410
 it's not like I'll cut flaming 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.410
 or never choose a card evil 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.360
 pokemon talking about that have you already 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.750
 had I received somebody's cards and 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.959
 I've never seen a map of 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.290
 cards also spoiled my life the map 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.800
 visa mimicry and I have in my possession 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:57.680
 that I received from someone and acrobats 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:59.930
 was really fun but good then 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.209
 not you keep the cards fake must 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.480
 that you do everything for them the 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.040
 destroy or no matter you see 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.410
 the inside of a fake card is not 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.310
 seem to shift material from a map only 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:16.670
 is not from what I've seen it's 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:21.079
 like more black not a pokemon card 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:24.799
 normal then the section is not done 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:27.430
 at all the same then it's a way of 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.660
 see if the card is a real one or not 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.260
 so do not look at the cards actually 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.880
 to be worn where of course everything is the 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.940
 exchange and not because of the people that 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.500
 it's really not very nice of your 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.260
 share 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.610
 so yeah that was to show you 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.560
 how to differentiate a card made 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.450
 of a grid charts so I hope that 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.800
 it's not going to have you to be able to you 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.910

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.500
 so I still do not say indoors 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.520

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.680
