 For his strong imagination, class was running its course 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.650
 Home race only on starting position ten 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.840
 the fastest Werner Daemen on the bmw board of Nebel on the map m

 Panda Cloud Protection three round trips Margret Schröder Honda in the series 1

 Jörg Teuchert after several injuries on his fingers after one 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.819
 Training crash unfortunately at the races 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:26.539
 not at the start 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.640
 but was worried anyway 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.359
 the many visitors ready 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.820
 takes on the artificial turf in Salzburg 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.930
 with such in short supply 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.290
 Jürgen Fuchs 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.390
 by the way, being the starter on a series BMW around the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.700
 Performance of this area in racing 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.260
 to prove 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.910
 that military was the ex-profi pilot Jürgen Fuchs 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.620
 it is always difficult to brake so-called multi-channel providers 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.130
 also the Salzburgring 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.270
 the damage would 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.350
 Werner Daemen then I was then seemed to make 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.350
 and Stefan Nebel tries to keep up 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.420
 the driver stock curve 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.730
 he was one of the key people 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.960
 also for the last round 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.190
 the question 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.610
 BRA if someone could break away 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.540
 Werner Daemen the Belgian 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.140
 with spectacular line selection 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.150
 or was not here on the Salzburgring 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.450
 the fastest man 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.520
 The weekend is Karl Markovic's almost crash almost all of his in the 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.670
 chicane 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.800
 and then the pursuers 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.000
 this depression 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.590
 so difficulties had the pace 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.840
 the two fastest 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.440
 that's Meier 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.800
 with this spectacular 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.270
 the Italians have long been firstly recognizable are therefore the driver 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.760
 group 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.290
 most urgently needed 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.760
 this fight 4 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.760
 with now Melcher 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.890
 but that Meier 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.100
 who did not deliver the spectacular shots in terms of performance 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.489
 not correct 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.469
 last season 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:14.609
 that is Werder Bremen Corbat Image of the former can be done then I will 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:16.169
 his goods 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:17.309
 their thesis represented 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:18.949
 with the only one 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:22.459
 Ducati prepares Wiedemann from Denis Hertrampf and his team 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:25.969
 and this website 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:28.779
 again with a strong race last yes n 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:29.949
 finally again 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.939
 after much bad luck 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.859
 been on the podium 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.169
 also Filip Altendorfer 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:38.599
 with a good race 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.809
 here at the Salzburgring front that the top 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:43.109
 Werner Daemen 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.109
 Men 1 also praised here with half the pursuers this falls 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:48.469
 the Altendorfer 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:52.629
 Meanwhile, Robert did not die at all for the amas 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.169
 no chance here 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:56.819
 Sascha Hommel 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.529
 or the one in the absence of Jörg Teuchert into the race 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:04.249
 Even Malte is now reminded to intervene 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:06.049
 Although nicely put into the picture 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.049
 but already with 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.019
 Urban advertised Pitt Altendorfer 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.899
 Wilfried f 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:15.899
 the pursuers 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:17.789
 could also with the two 

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:19.679
 fight the last podium finish 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.919
 not Mittal 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.299
 the drivers short 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.299
 Roman tribe 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.299
 led the group 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.239
 Klose remains her and Altendorf 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.639
 that gripping fight 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.739
 for the last podium place 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.229
 Werner Daemen and also moderate front 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:43.029
 were Andritz 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:45.779
 to the PC with the Ducati 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:48.719
 Of course, with light jobs lies to Zeil 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:50.309
 and surprise surprise 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:51.579
 Margreth Schär 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.219
 could not keep up with the pace of Werner Daemen 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:58.569
 the Belgian played here at the Salzburgring absolutely 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.829
 in his two carers 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.140
 Uta PC against Altendorfer still place 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.159
 the most exciting duel 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.429
 Praise of both of them 

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:12.529
 faster and faster on the uphill section 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:14.579
 the bmw driver Altendorfer 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.579
 and then in the chicane dario Giuseppetti 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.779
 but Altendorfer would pass 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:27.349
 That should be the next podium place for the Ducati rider from Berlin 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:28.199
 suffice 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.829
 that was enough in any case first for the victory of the Belgian 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:33.889
 Werner Daemen 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.969
 a demonstration 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:39.279
 his strength karma bushes on the two and Filip Altendorfer 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.909
 Steven Zuber and cleared the way 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:44.620
 Dario Giuseppetti 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.909
 who got a new one on the podium 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:52.449
 Filip Altendorfer was his best the DM result what quite possible 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.859
 would be thrown away and in the end no counter got 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.379
 the winner and absolutely unchallenged 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:02.659
 which suits what he does not follow anymore 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:05.599
 under the name of the beginning but when technical made fast 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.599
 May have entered and the performers are the people want 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.639
 Arcor is the forest and then I have a lot 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:12.680
 so last 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.249
 a10 and where men are concerned and no longer give 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:18.369
 as a result, it was that he was still the Viennese the Empire with Lohr 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.859
 At that time, it was okay, but the two-time ice-skated stayed almost twice 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.199
 that does not fit so easily 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.800
 that share with prospect Sager super-time Sam Ronson and if you had one 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:31.629
 tried to stay tuned 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:33.599
 So now has to achieve 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.919
 "Intel Inside" keep the animal in Kempten's possible port 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.999
 and in the end so that Alba and so looked but is but already today so 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:44.199
 far more than you want more 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.330
 The mouse never talks for a long time 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.350
 as part of the solution, there are still some strange things left 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:55.800
 that show that Maradona has the media on the occasion of a pond Euro 

00:05:56.559 --> 00:06:01.289
 Matti Breschel to learn this is he and his party from the game 

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:05.080
 "We have on the podium 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.300
 so Marcel Schnabel scored points 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.940
 for the championship with and Werner Daemen beamed after his victory
