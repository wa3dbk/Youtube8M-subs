00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.780 

so<00:00:01.740> we're<00:00:01.890> going<00:00:01.979> to<00:00:02.040> talk<00:00:02.190> about<00:00:02.370> coupling

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
so we're going to talk about coupling

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.510 
so we're going to talk about coupling
alignment<00:00:03.449> this<00:00:03.870> is<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.170> coupling<00:00:04.410> half<00:00:04.770> that

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
alignment this is the coupling half that

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.280 
alignment this is the coupling half that
has<00:00:05.700> attached<00:00:06.150> to<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.480> output<00:00:06.810> shaft<00:00:07.049> your

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
has attached to the output shaft your

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.530 
has attached to the output shaft your
transmission<00:00:08.040> this<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.940> coupling<00:00:09.179> 1/2

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
transmission this is the coupling 1/2

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.749 
transmission this is the coupling 1/2
that<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:09.960> on<00:00:10.559> your<00:00:10.800> propeller<00:00:11.130> shaft<00:00:11.490> and

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
that is on your propeller shaft and

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.549 
that is on your propeller shaft and
these<00:00:12.300> are<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.509> two<00:00:12.690> halves<00:00:12.960> that<00:00:13.200> we<00:00:13.290> have<00:00:13.440> to

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
these are the two halves that we have to

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.770 
these are the two halves that we have to
put<00:00:13.710> together<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:14.309> such<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.089> way<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.360> they're

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
put together in such a way that they're

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.470 
put together in such a way that they're
properly<00:00:16.020> aligned<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:17.310> as<00:00:17.430> not<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.640> put<00:00:17.970> undue

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
properly aligned so as not to put undue

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.910 
properly aligned so as not to put undue
stress<00:00:18.810> on<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.230> bearing<00:00:19.619> in<00:00:19.770> the

stress on the bearing in the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.140 
stress on the bearing in the
transmission<00:00:20.609> or<00:00:22.189> actually<00:00:23.189> put<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.430> bend<00:00:23.760> in

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
transmission or actually put a bend in

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.000 
transmission or actually put a bend in
the<00:00:24.269> shaft<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.840> will<00:00:25.380> work<00:00:25.529> hard<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:25.890> the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
the shaft that will work hard in the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.620 
the shaft that will work hard in the
shaft<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.430> cause<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.760> shaft<00:00:27.000> break<00:00:27.269> as<00:00:27.510> we

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
shaft and cause the shaft break as we

metal<00:01:59.549> right<00:01:59.640> here<00:01:59.700> has<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> curve<00:02:01.079> on<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.640> okay

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
metal right here has a curve on it okay

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.280 
metal right here has a curve on it okay
so<00:02:03.180> enough<00:02:03.450> about<00:02:03.570> engine<00:02:04.020> mounts<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:07.049> next

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
so enough about engine mounts the next

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.919 
so enough about engine mounts the next
thing<00:02:07.469> we<00:02:07.590> do<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.069> back<00:02:08.459> here<00:02:08.700> on<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.910> hub<00:02:09.119> we

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
thing we do is back here on the hub we

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.990 
thing we do is back here on the hub we
remove<00:02:10.319> three<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.920> four<00:02:11.160> fasteners<00:02:11.670> and

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
remove three of the four fasteners and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.760 
remove three of the four fasteners and
loosen<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.660> fourth<00:02:12.930> fastener

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
loosen the fourth fastener

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.980 
loosen the fourth fastener
so<00:02:14.130> if<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.370> hub<00:02:14.550> can<00:02:14.790> spread<00:02:15.060> apart<00:02:15.390> if<00:02:15.780> it

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
so if the hub can spread apart if it

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.440 
so if the hub can spread apart if it
needs<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.460> now<00:02:17.460> I'm<00:02:17.610> going<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.850> use<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.120> feeler

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
needs to now I'm going to use the feeler

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.110 
needs to now I'm going to use the feeler
gauge<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.980> can't<00:02:20.340> get<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.580> feeler<00:02:20.790> gauge

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
gauge and I can't get the feeler gauge

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.360 
gauge and I can't get the feeler gauge
in<00:02:21.450> at<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.020> top<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.410> this<00:02:22.500> mound<00:02:22.770> at<00:02:22.950> all<00:02:23.100> I

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
in at the top of this mound at all I

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.040 
in at the top of this mound at all I
can't<00:02:23.940> get<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.180> between<00:02:24.360> these<00:02:24.570> two<00:02:24.630> flanges

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
can't get it between these two flanges

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.540 
can't get it between these two flanges
but<00:02:25.980> look<00:02:26.160> here<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.580> can<00:02:26.910> get<00:02:27.060> my<00:02:27.150> fuel<00:02:27.450> gauge<00:02:29.540> in

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
but look here I can get my fuel gauge in

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.040 
but look here I can get my fuel gauge in
about<00:02:32.550> halfway<00:02:32.730> down<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.120> can<00:02:33.480> get<00:02:33.600> it<00:02:33.690> in<00:02:33.810> here

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
about halfway down I can get it in here

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.160 
about halfway down I can get it in here
and<00:02:34.950> it's<00:02:35.430> quite<00:02:35.730> loose<00:02:36.090> at<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.330> bottom<00:02:36.810> which

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
and it's quite loose at the bottom which

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.130 
and it's quite loose at the bottom which
means<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:38.310> my<00:02:38.520> ain't<00:02:38.850> much<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.510> angle<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:39.960> my

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
means that my ain't much the angle of my

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.770 
means that my ain't much the angle of my
engine<00:02:40.650> does<00:02:41.220> not<00:02:41.430> match<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.790> angle<00:02:42.480> of<00:02:42.630> the

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
engine does not match the angle of the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.680 
engine does not match the angle of the
prop<00:02:42.990> shaft<00:02:43.020> I<00:02:43.620> either<00:02:43.860> need<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.480> lower<00:02:45.480> the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
prop shaft I either need to lower the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.410 
prop shaft I either need to lower the
front<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.200> my<00:02:46.320> engine<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:46.890> close<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.940> gap<00:02:48.180> at

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
front of my engine and close that gap at

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.670 
front of my engine and close that gap at
the<00:02:48.480> bottom<00:02:49.160> to<00:02:50.160> make<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:51.480> same<00:02:51.750> as<00:02:52.020> to

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
the bottom to make it the same as to

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
coupling 1/2 parallel or I could raise

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
the back side of my engine to do the

the back side of my engine to do the
same<00:02:59.400> thing<00:02:59.730> I<00:03:00.000> have<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.810> make<00:03:00.990> that<00:03:01.230> choice

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
same thing I have to make that choice

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.610 
same thing I have to make that choice
about<00:03:01.800> whether<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.280> raise<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:03.840> back<00:03:04.050> or<00:03:04.350> lower

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
about whether I raise the back or lower

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.860 
about whether I raise the back or lower
the<00:03:04.830> front<00:03:05.040> by<00:03:05.460> how<00:03:05.730> close<00:03:06.060> this<00:03:06.330> prop<00:03:06.630> shaft

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
the front by how close this prop shaft

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.180 
the front by how close this prop shaft
