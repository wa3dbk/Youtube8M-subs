the<00:00:29.849> top<00:00:30.060> up<00:00:30.240> here<00:00:30.449> look<00:00:30.630> there's<00:00:30.810> varying

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the top up here look there's varying

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.770 
the top up here look there's varying
degrees<00:00:31.590> from<00:00:32.219> here<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.850> further<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.420> go<00:00:33.600> up

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
degrees from here the further you go up

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.139 
degrees from here the further you go up
the<00:00:34.649> more<00:00:34.950> chance<00:00:35.399> you're<00:00:35.610> going<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:35.880> it

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
the more chance you're going to have it

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.090 
the more chance you're going to have it
being<00:00:36.329> able<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.570> put<00:00:36.809> topspin<00:00:37.410> on<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.590> ball<00:00:37.680> so

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
being able to put topspin on the ball so

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.920 
being able to put topspin on the ball so
it<00:00:38.640> really<00:00:38.910> depends<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.329> what<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.690> want<00:00:39.870> to

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
it really depends on what you want to

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.840 
it really depends on what you want to
what<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.379> want<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.590> achieve<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.129> we<00:00:41.730> don't

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
what you want to achieve so we don't

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.069 
what you want to achieve so we don't
want<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.030> go<00:00:42.090> too<00:00:42.149> far<00:00:42.570> because<00:00:42.780> then<00:00:42.989> it

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
want to go too far because then it

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.750 
want to go too far because then it
becomes<00:00:43.170> really<00:00:43.590> difficult<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.250> hit<00:00:44.399> power

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
becomes really difficult to hit power

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.880 
becomes really difficult to hit power
through<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> shot<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:45.930> if<00:00:46.320> we<00:00:46.500> can<00:00:46.620> get<00:00:46.739> that

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
through the shot so if we can get that

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.470 
through the shot so if we can get that
top<00:00:47.190> knuckle<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.640> aim<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.059> top<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.420> I've

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
top knuckle I aim for this top and I've

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.729 
top knuckle I aim for this top and I've
got<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.690> be<00:00:48.750> sitting<00:00:48.930> somewhere<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> top

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
got to be sitting somewhere on the top

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.470 
got to be sitting somewhere on the top
of<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:49.980> racket<00:00:50.760> there<00:00:50.910> if<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.090> look<00:00:51.239> along

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
of that racket there if we look along

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.660 
of that racket there if we look along
that<00:00:51.629> line<00:00:51.809> then<00:00:52.079> we<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.739> get<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.010> top

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
that line then we can get that top

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.340 
that line then we can get that top
knuckle<00:00:54.000> sitting<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.360> top<00:00:54.510> careful<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.320> don't
