balls<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:15.960> use<00:00:16.260> when<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.500> repair<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
balls that I use when I repair the

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.179 
balls that I use when I repair the
carburetors<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:18.619> you'll<00:00:19.619> notice<00:00:19.770> some<00:00:20.039> one

likely be used on a lawn mower though
some<00:00:47.579> lawn<00:00:47.760> mowers<00:00:48.059> do<00:00:48.360> use<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.809> other<00:00:48.899> bowl

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
some lawn mowers do use the other bowl

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.510 
some lawn mowers do use the other bowl
that<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.440> just<00:00:49.680> showed<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.100> with<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.399> smaller

hole here with the bigger hole in the
center<00:00:55.110> its<00:00:55.320> part<00:00:55.590> number<00:00:57.020> 63124<00:01:00.500> what<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
center its part number 63124 what the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.490 
center its part number 63124 what the
size<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:01.890> well<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:02.960> 2164<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.260> i<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.470> a

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
size is well it's 2164 and i have a

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.740 
size is well it's 2164 and i have a
drill<00:01:04.860> bit<00:01:05.070> over<00:01:05.519> here<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.880> fits<00:01:06.090> perfectly

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
drill bit over here that fits perfectly

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.630 
drill bit over here that fits perfectly
in<00:01:06.990> there<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.860> when<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.159> take<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.460> off<00:01:08.610> just

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
in there so when you take it off just

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.039 
in there so when you take it off just
put<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> drill<00:01:09.360> bit<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.659> there

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
put a drill bit in there

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.130 
put a drill bit in there
the<00:01:10.530> 2164<00:01:11.520> drill<00:01:12.030> bit<00:01:12.210> fits<00:01:12.450> perfectly<00:01:12.960> in

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
the 2164 drill bit fits perfectly in

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.570 
the 2164 drill bit fits perfectly in
there<00:01:13.350> then<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.860> notice<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> ball<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.549> a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
there then you notice the ball with a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.850 
there then you notice the ball with a
smaller<00:01:14.939> hole<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.509> need<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.930> again

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
smaller hole that you need and again

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.719 
smaller hole that you need and again
that<00:01:17.070> one<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.250> number<00:01:17.729> 6<00:01:18.000> 3<00:01:18.240> 1/8<00:01:18.750> 67<00:01:19.610> when<00:01:20.610> it

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
that one is number 6 3 1/8 67 when it

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.249 
that one is number 6 3 1/8 67 when it
comes<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.150> ball<00:01:21.330> with<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> bigger<00:01:21.810> hole<00:01:22.049> a

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
comes to the ball with a bigger hole a

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.969 
comes to the ball with a bigger hole a
25<00:01:23.250> 64th<00:01:23.970> drill<00:01:24.450> bit<00:01:24.659> will<00:01:24.900> fit<00:01:25.140> perfectly<00:01:25.740> in

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
25 64th drill bit will fit perfectly in

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.640 
25 64th drill bit will fit perfectly in
there<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.970> again<00:01:27.240> measure<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.900> hole<00:01:28.110> if<00:01:28.439> it's

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
there so again measure the hole if it's

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.609 
there so again measure the hole if it's
25<00:01:28.979> 64th<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.600> know<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.079> hole<00:01:31.290> with<00:01:31.590> a

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
25 64th you know it's the hole with a

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.140 
25 64th you know it's the hole with a
bigger<00:01:31.890> hole<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.310> center<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.000> need

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
bigger hole in the center that you need

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.330 
bigger hole in the center that you need
and<00:01:33.420> again<00:01:34.409> it's<00:01:34.650> part<00:01:34.950> number<00:01:35.900> 63124<00:01:37.340> more

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and again it's part number 63124 more

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.700 
and again it's part number 63124 more
like<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:38.790> one<00:01:39.030> or<00:01:39.299> newer<00:01:39.630> one<00:01:39.900> it's<00:01:40.200> probably

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
like this one or newer one it's probably

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.929 
like this one or newer one it's probably
going<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.950> take<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> ball<00:01:41.369> with<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> smaller

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
going to take the ball with a smaller

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.969 
going to take the ball with a smaller
hole<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.229> recommend<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.799> bookmark

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
hole so I recommend that you bookmark
