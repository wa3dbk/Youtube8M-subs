00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.909
 virus has become an epidemic which 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.820

 aggressive cheaters without any 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:20.370
 morality each one having its own 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.260
 special combat abilities some to

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.260
 much more powerful creatures 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:33.360
 they represent a source 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.950
 of imagination and those of very power 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.860
 very seriously besides by our 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.070
 young people while giving their powers 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.550
 and of course it's not hard 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:48.690
 satan who proposes to young people to become 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.510
 one day the pokemon master in order to 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.760
 possess a supernatural power so 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:00.390
 to defraud to succeed and kill for 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:04.020
 win you have to know that pokÃ©mons 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.959
 is also an initiation into the term 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.790
 and the practices of occultism we 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.350
 know that occultism does not come from 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.220
 god of energy or power cards 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:20.670
 making the child appear invulnerable 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:23.989
 hidden ritual forms that children 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:28.320
 pronounce without knowing the exact meaning 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:30.690
 simply by playing signs and logo of 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.510
 black magic such as hands to 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.000
 monogram of the devil of the stars 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.050
 the inverted pyramids trident and 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.690
 other esoteric symbols and that's 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:48.440
 to the point of view of sacred numerology 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:53.160
 since the 151st pokemon is called miu mw 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.769
 and also fits famous 666 which is 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.190

 parentheses if you're not baptized but 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.870
 it may be any time to go 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:07.250

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:31.020
 by the powers of those cards that are going 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:33.330
 to georges bring him to confession and 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.710
