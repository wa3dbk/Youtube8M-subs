00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
the batter it's important that again you

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.529 
the batter it's important that again you
stay<00:01:48.170> balanced<00:01:48.909> get<00:01:49.909> as<00:01:50.030> low<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.329> the<00:01:50.479> ground

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
stay balanced get as low to the ground

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.580 
stay balanced get as low to the ground
as<00:01:50.869> possible<00:01:50.929> so<00:01:51.590> you're<00:01:51.920> in<00:01:52.039> control

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.770 

and<00:01:56.590> how<00:01:56.770> did<00:01:56.890> you<00:01:56.950> practice<00:01:57.190> that<00:01:57.780> cover

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
and how did you practice that cover

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.880 
and how did you practice that cover
point<00:01:59.110> position<00:01:59.970> well<00:02:00.970> I<00:02:01.000> would<00:02:01.540> have<00:02:01.710> again<00:02:02.710> a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
point position well I would have again a

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.490 
point position well I would have again a
batter<00:02:03.160> in<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:03.430> feeder<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.750> feeder<00:02:05.380> just

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
batter in a feeder the feeder just

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.060 
batter in a feeder the feeder just
throwing<00:02:05.920> over<00:02:06.640> arms<00:02:07.080> in<00:02:08.080> and<00:02:08.290> around<00:02:08.500> waist

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
throwing over arms in and around waist

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.300 
throwing over arms in and around waist
high<00:02:09.280> and<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:10.149> batter<00:02:10.330> just<00:02:10.509> cut<00:02:10.869> in<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:12.220> I'm

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
high and the batter just cut in and I'm

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.520
