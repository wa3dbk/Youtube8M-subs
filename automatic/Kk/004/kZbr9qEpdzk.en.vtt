00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
days out I still want to lose roughly

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.939 
days out I still want to lose roughly
about<00:00:20.970> half<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.510> kg<00:00:21.720> before<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.199> step<00:00:22.500> on<00:00:22.650> stage

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
about half a kg before I step on stage

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.390 
about half a kg before I step on stage
next<00:00:23.279> week<00:00:23.640> um<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.619> then<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.710> kind<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.070> wouldn't

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
next week um and then I kind of wouldn't

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.120 
next week um and then I kind of wouldn't
reach<00:00:26.550> my<00:00:26.820> goal<00:00:27.060> for<00:00:27.199> these<00:00:28.199> waikato<00:00:28.680> champs

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
reach my goal for these waikato champs

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.950 
reach my goal for these waikato champs
so<00:00:29.720> instead<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.779> proof<00:00:31.080> about<00:00:31.230> 18<00:00:31.890> weeks<00:00:32.160> ago

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
so instead of proof about 18 weeks ago

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.790 
so instead of proof about 18 weeks ago
basically<00:00:34.880> probably<00:00:35.880> before<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.020> prick

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
basically probably before the in a prick

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.819 
basically probably before the in a prick
maybe<00:00:38.100> for<00:00:38.430> like<00:00:38.570> seven<00:00:39.570> eight<00:00:39.809> week<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.500> quite

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
maybe for like seven eight week so quite

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.030 
maybe for like seven eight week so quite
a<00:00:40.860> short<00:00:41.129> prick<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:41.850> quite<00:00:42.090> different

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
a short prick so it's quite different

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.979 
a short prick so it's quite different
but<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.640> be<00:00:44.789> honest<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.270> it's<00:00:45.570> been<00:00:45.719> amazing

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
but to be honest like it's been amazing

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.420 
but to be honest like it's been amazing
and<00:00:47.360> just<00:00:48.360> slowly<00:00:48.750> creeping<00:00:49.530> slowly<00:00:49.829> cutting

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
and just slowly creeping slowly cutting

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.790 
and just slowly creeping slowly cutting
down<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> stage<00:00:51.480> instead<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.530> trying<00:00:52.739> to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
down to the stage instead of trying to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.889 
down to the stage instead of trying to
do<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.160> know<00:00:53.190> relatively<00:00:53.789> fast<00:00:54.210> going<00:00:54.780> on

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
do it you know relatively fast going on

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.380 
do it you know relatively fast going on
low<00:00:55.050> calories<00:00:55.559> doing<00:00:55.860> high<00:00:56.129> cardio<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.270> it's

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
low calories doing high cardio so it's

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.150 
low calories doing high cardio so it's
kind<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.780> opposite<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.590> my<00:00:58.770> calories

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
kind of in the opposite so my calories

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.680 
kind of in the opposite so my calories
are<00:00:59.309> still<00:00:59.489> quite<00:00:59.699> high<00:01:00.000> they've<00:01:00.359> only<00:01:00.510> been

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
are still quite high they've only been

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.640 
are still quite high they've only been
cut<00:01:00.960> by<00:01:01.199> about<00:01:02.059> 12<00:01:03.059> 150<00:01:03.780> calories<00:01:03.989> maybe<00:01:04.350> since

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
cut by about 12 150 calories maybe since

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.310 
cut by about 12 150 calories maybe since
I<00:01:04.769> started<00:01:05.010> cutting<00:01:05.460> like<00:01:05.729> 18<00:01:06.119> weeks<00:01:06.299> ago<00:01:06.540> so

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320

so<00:02:51.370> yeah<00:02:51.609> it<00:02:51.939> just<00:02:51.970> meant<00:02:52.359> I<00:02:52.450> didn't<00:02:52.689> have<00:02:52.720> to

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
so yeah it just meant I didn't have to

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.089 
so yeah it just meant I didn't have to
prep<00:02:53.019> my<00:02:53.139> nails<00:02:53.319> for<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.590> week<00:02:53.739> which<00:02:53.919> was

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
prep my nails for the week which was

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.179 
prep my nails for the week which was
awesome<00:02:54.310> because<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:54.819> takes<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.299> lot<00:02:55.480> of<00:02:55.510> time

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
awesome because it takes a lot of time

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.009 
awesome because it takes a lot of time
so<00:02:57.189> like<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:57.459> say<00:02:57.700> in<00:02:57.790> terms<00:02:57.939> of<00:02:58.090> energy<00:02:58.329> being

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
so like I say in terms of energy being

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.809 
so like I say in terms of energy being
pretty<00:02:59.379> good<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.829> whole<00:03:00.099> time<00:03:00.370> because<00:03:00.579> my

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
pretty good the whole time because my

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.539 
pretty good the whole time because my
calories<00:03:01.269> are<00:03:01.419> still<00:03:01.599> quite<00:03:01.780> high<00:03:02.049> and<00:03:02.549> still

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
calories are still quite high and still

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.509 
calories are still quite high and still
got<00:03:03.669> my<00:03:03.790> cubs<00:03:04.120> four<00:03:05.079> out<00:03:05.439> of<00:03:05.470> six<00:03:05.829> meals<00:03:06.099> every

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.420 
got my cubs four out of six meals every
day<00:03:06.750> yeah<00:03:07.750> just<00:03:08.139> the<00:03:08.470> last<00:03:08.769> who<00:03:09.010> doesn't<00:03:09.310> just

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
day yeah just the last who doesn't just

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.520 
day yeah just the last who doesn't just
being<00:03:09.609> tired<00:03:09.849> but<00:03:10.150> that's<00:03:10.329> probably<00:03:10.989> purely

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
being tired but that's probably purely

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.629 
being tired but that's probably purely
because<00:03:11.680> of<00:03:11.859> a<00:03:11.980> lettuce<00:03:12.310> sleep<00:03:13.769> mmm<00:03:14.769> people

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
because of a lettuce sleep mmm people

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.039 
because of a lettuce sleep mmm people
will<00:03:15.729> probably<00:03:15.849> think<00:03:16.150> that<00:03:16.269> I'm<00:03:16.479> this<00:03:16.690> crazy

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049

suppose it's getting closer and closer

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.780 
suppose it's getting closer and closer
to<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:26.919> comp<00:03:27.310> in<00:03:27.699> you<00:03:28.030> know<00:03:28.949> I've<00:03:29.949> got<00:03:30.549> so<00:03:30.699> much

cardio<00:03:31.239> to<00:03:31.359> do<00:03:31.629> and<00:03:32.379> I<00:03:32.909> normally<00:03:33.909> leave<00:03:34.060> it<00:03:34.180> to

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
cardio to do and I normally leave it to

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.069 
cardio to do and I normally leave it to
like<00:03:34.479> 7-8<00:03:35.079> p.m.<00:03:35.109> at<00:03:35.440> night<00:03:35.620> so<00:03:36.040> in<00:03:36.870> terms<00:03:37.870> of

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
like 7-8 p.m. at night so in terms of

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.349 
like 7-8 p.m. at night so in terms of
