00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:12.240
 Today I show you with the hot air 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.360
 for really great effects and as 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.100
 First I quarrel a tour and know 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.320
 then I paint like dark green and 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.789
 then caresses you to help 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.859
 in between that, of course I always 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.199
 dry but if it's a light green 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.300
 then I do only small pieces the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.269
 because I'm with the then 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.500
 this fan though the cultivation 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.180
 I'll keep that there 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.980
 that lasts a bit now 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.850
 ccm real time you have to do a bit 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.010
 waiting 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.239
 then at some point the color gets through 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.050
 to throw the heat and throw this heat 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.910
 blow 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.950
 I can really nice then 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.980
 edit so here you see it exactly 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.210
 Of course, I do not want to come 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.789
 just so have a spot because of that 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.039
 move the hair dryer or blower like that 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.780
 back and forth I can then like a 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.629
 I almost make it like this 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.420
 I wish and then I take it 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.330
 small knife and a spatula 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.610
 Of course, too, and scratch that 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.950
 bit then then you see there solves 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.630
 the color yes because several layers 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.100
 it will also come off right away 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.970
 sometimes dissolves a little differently 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.130
 you only the top layer and here 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.049
 Can I do that when I contrast 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.030
 blatantly find what I found here now so 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.310
 a bit bad brown I am with the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.470
 sponge and with very diluted paint 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.049
 gone over it again and now 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.710
 because I have this worn effect yes 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:38.040
 but these are really me 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.720
 have power perfect color and he so 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.009
 you just have to go a bit 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.659
 scratch a bit to try 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.149
 Feel a bit and then you get 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.649
 great vintage effects like now at 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.909
 my box right here again 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:54.380
 picture and there you have to just where 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.380
 we just that's totally awesome
