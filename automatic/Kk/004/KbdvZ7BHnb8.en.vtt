00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.530
 the 25th mission accomplished its mission an emotional feeding workshop 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.550
 imparted by joaquín azpiri méndez director general of ing 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.360
 started yesterday 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.350
 yes he spoke about the will and its direct relationship with food 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.949
 emotional from the different instances as the social life life to 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:23.849
 my 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.009
 as well as the maintenance operability and the build that everyone is looking for 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:30.839
 starts 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:33.579
 to not bother the other because he does not get angry the other half eat is although 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:34.490
 I do not like 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.630
 begins to disappear contact with the busts 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.100
 which is here when it develops 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.840
 the personal taste 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.000
 and then you eat for the taste 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.820
 That the others 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.820
 it is not food that changes our body 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.980
 is our intention in fact a wink you can make 500 kilos of bread and the 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.130
 tremendous muscle and added com is an evil has animosity 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.760
 I'm not me, I'm not talking 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.620
 why in this investigation what he likes 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.800
 On January 5 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.600
 our sling where is 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.110
 our memory that we have inside 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.380
 what we have to assume 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.190
 to do an exercise 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.800
 totally 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.620
 because we lost and 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.620
 if we think that food to change 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.880
 missing we have to separate 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.210
 will of food 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.670
 we have to separate you must half of the food 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.670
 the amount with which it is 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.790
 that does not mean we do not have to stop eating 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.110
 when the man does not agree with its complexity 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.340
 and I know he got sick 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.230
 of those parts of the confession that does not recognize 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.060
 emotional feeding knowing that we have evolved learned a way 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.100
 and that we can recover that way of learning 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.820
 meet with her 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.100
 to find the best way to correct our food deviations not 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.750
 it is decided loving deviations our deviations on the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.689
 knowledge 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.689
 because in reality we are not happy for three things 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:22.489
 because we do not do what we want 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.049
 because we are not next to the person we love 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.049
 and because we are not able to learn what we want 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:33.209
 if in the end we are always like in a country and permanent age towards something 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:36.149
 what seems unattainable 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:40.559
 and we want people who do not reach us we seem super enviable 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:43.429
 We are like lost because I do not 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:46.659
 for you not only and exclusively because your will 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.659
 the stasi working outside of your code of will 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:54.699
 and that is important that we understand there is a way to access goodness there is no 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:56.489
 other 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.839
 that way you find the incorporation 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:00.869
 and immediately that works 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:03.869
 something that they did not let themselves see 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:08.489
 and he did not forgive him or in love 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.249
 do not forgive him 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:13.249
 the work and us zone or with your body 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.399
 that within the system 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:18.879
 the locals 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.389
 however as something that loses Alvaro stay and suddenly fails you 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.159
 and every year we have a tornado 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.159
 haiti - the will to feed 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.429
 there is a subject of fault 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:33.469
 but great 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:35.429
 for SMEs 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:38.429
 and there who we have we did not have 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.429
 cinch debt 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:44.269
 some of these things 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.599
 iker note of the year 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.389
 use of ideas makes you lose
