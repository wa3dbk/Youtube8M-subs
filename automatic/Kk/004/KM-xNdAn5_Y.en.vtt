00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.590 

the<00:00:55.199> texture<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> little<00:00:56.519> different<00:00:57.089> from

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the texture is a little different from

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.930 
the texture is a little different from
the<00:00:57.809> others<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.199> feels<00:00:58.499> different<00:00:58.769> and<00:00:59.429> it

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the others it feels different and it

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.719 
the others it feels different and it
actually<00:01:00.140> Falls<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.530> lot<00:01:01.769> different<00:01:02.280> than<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
actually Falls a lot different than the

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.690 
actually Falls a lot different than the
other<00:01:02.940> units<00:01:04.130> the<00:01:05.130> shape<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.670> different

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
other units the shape is different

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.969 
other units the shape is different
