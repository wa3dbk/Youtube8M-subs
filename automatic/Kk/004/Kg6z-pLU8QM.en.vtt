00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.710
 100 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:15.000
 after transfer of insurance funds 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.920
 next perpetual strategy 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.589
 approached with caution 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:19.449
 especially 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.179
 I also got to know her closely on 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.589
 the past is strong itself it is too strong for us 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:24.859
 liked 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.980
 what if for a beautiful press release version 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.970
 hiding a nightmare that just 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.800
 it was impossible to see for half an hour 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.050
 games 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.720
 generally scared and full 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.100
 all sorts of expectations, I allowed a global 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.100
 empire strategy is troubled time 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.070
 new project from studio ground like 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.990
 and especially 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.480
 but on the other hand he wants to look like the others 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.600
 genre projects is a global strategy 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.550
 in real time and the sum of the pause 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.190
 not as much a dog for example can 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.790
 she is only stopping the game when 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.990
 you give the order but nevertheless also means 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.520
 presmana want in the framework 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.720
 power in this particular kg 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.160
 unlike the paradoxes of this strategy here 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.680
 everything is not so severely abstract 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.760
 Here, for example, take the last day of victory 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.640
 while in it you will sort thousand week will pass 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.840
 and before that there were that group of cueps 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.500
 reveal some kind of notation around 10 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.800
 thousand mapping military and 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.590
 economic biographical 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.930
 real game for the harsh suffered from 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.480
 politicians organize here 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.400
 make up the toilet bowl 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.890
 but the empire is more kindly to her 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.480
 learned recycling 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.710
 and generally similar to this child environment 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.120
 May Rosati Paradoxes 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.930
 no matter how scary it was 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.410
 in the text review told by mechanics 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.880
 and the features of the game read his son not 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.140
 in vain is 8000 characters written true 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.950
 so here we will not repeat 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.210
 better talk about how the empire is played 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.210
 justice 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.500
 one of its main advantages is the house 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.590
 that it does not let the player get lost and 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.599
 get confused 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.679
 that is, the developers are not only on the bench 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.319
 and then they just wait when finally 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.879
 is over 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.319
 all much think oil interesting 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.689
 first new 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.409
 the governor is given a global assignment 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.719
 for example merge Russian comes 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.700
 penny principality and then constantly 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.739
 throws small new boilers 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:26.999
 Minsk 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:29.619
 came in traffic for goods dudamel with 300 not 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:32.099
 cope from the ottawa declare of course without 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.779
 what is worth cooking 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:35.689
 or suddenly western comrades 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.469
 november 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.609
 urgently need a local alexander to find and 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.259
 what no ice slaughter 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:42.889
 to arrange 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.009
 yes like other strategies their war 

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:47.099
 it is the cornerstone of the whole game 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.529
 process 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:51.139
 and when we get another assignment but 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.139
 roads to collect Kiev and the new government 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.780
 oh my gosh what I turned on 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.780
 more precisely 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:04.899
 hun now Salerno for now we are still 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:07.899
 we believe 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:23.979
 target 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.579
 cold we will assume that the frost is not 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:32.910
 interrupted the character 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.899
 we will all be silent right 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:38.039
 as you already understood empire to distinguish 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:39.230
 paradox is her 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.739
 carefully considered before 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.159
 feudal fragmentation and 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.370
 reunion of Russia near Moscow flag 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.220
 so here the story knows where it ends in 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.069
 the second you sit on the throne 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.599
 for if need be and around and occupied three 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.279
 our country will meet the player because the main thing is he 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:57.629
 may all 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.489
 and besides pure military methods 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.459
 religion plays an important role here 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:02.240
 diplomacy 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.880
 can send other principalities 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.780
 priests or ambassadors to conclude 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.490
 negotiating unions 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.439
 and unite into a coalition 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:10.849
 and as with the Slavic peoples 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.539
 so with Europeans 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:15.339
 and no one will hurt you the gentiles 

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:17.149
 half the country a punch promises if they 

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:19.489
 you with the union of Russia will help 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.979
 I would like to 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.979
 in outline 

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:26.999
 this policy will be carried out 

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:30.139
 in the Kiev region fought say 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.749
 it will have something like that so on you 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:34.680
 until 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.180
 so the question 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.449
 he took 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:38.210
 she is 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.349
 as Natalya Yakovlev explains many articles 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.289
 how it is 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.210
 he knows what he is doing 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.210
 five days take and 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.940
 if empire besides large scale difference 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.490
 principal ticks 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.499
 same day victory or europe 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:58.299
 famous historical 

00:04:58.299 --> 00:05:00.009
 personalities are represented 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.139
 but irrelevant do not play 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.710
 in the empire, the wife is not all built 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.120
 we are the king, but the king all sorts of characteristics 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.930
 and parameters 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.289
 who help them about battles involved 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:11.389
 nor strange to lead 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.330
 and if they kill the sovereign 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.749
 dark times will come 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:17.109
 sadness sadness about the generals 

00:05:17.109 --> 00:05:19.789
 priests of scientists and trailers all exactly 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:20.310
 same 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.470
 and if they successfully execute orders 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.710
 who get new levels and raise 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.710
 own characteristics 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.169
 and yet every hero he has street Oleg 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.029
 Chirkunov jury will look kind of endured 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:36.369
 She developed to trifles such 

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:39.369
 cooperation 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:42.370
 in Saransk 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.370
 March 7 and 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.580
 agree 

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:58.809
 itar tass here 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:02.759
 and the second when for example comes out 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:05.090
 the priest outside and calls the probe pier 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.020
 international conflict 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.279
 Further, this is just an opinion 

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:11.459
 if not all the heroes are from the great ruler 

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:14.459
 yes spy 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.990
 Here is such a game 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.250
 partly using the familiar for a long time 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.659
 we have some ideas 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:27.020
 completely innovative 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.810
 but overall it's a very worthy strategy 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.410
 which will appeal to many lovers 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.410
 genre all recommend 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.650
 Thanks for the views, we are waiting for your feedback and 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.789
 comments but we still only remove 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:41.320
 for you 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.760
 and by the way we say hello to a person with a nickname 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.499
 sexologists 

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:46.489
 he very much asked to be mentioned and saw 

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:46.979
 many years 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:48.180
 why not 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.680
 good luck to all
