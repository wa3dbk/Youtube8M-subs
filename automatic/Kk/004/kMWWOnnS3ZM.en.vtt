I'm<00:00:17.190> very<00:00:17.609> reliant<00:00:18.029> on<00:00:18.180> mobile<00:00:18.539> technology

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
I'm very reliant on mobile technology

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.890 
I'm very reliant on mobile technology
one<00:00:20.039> time<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.279> was<00:00:20.430> out<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.640> my<00:00:20.850> house<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.689> had

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
one time I was out of my house and I had

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.840 
one time I was out of my house and I had
my<00:00:22.050> cell<00:00:22.289> phone<00:00:22.529> but<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.949> battery<00:00:23.340> died<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.609> I

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
my cell phone but the battery died and I

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.460 
my cell phone but the battery died and I
had<00:00:23.880> no<00:00:24.240> way<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.600> calling<00:00:24.810> my<00:00:24.990> parents<00:00:25.170> of

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
had no way of calling my parents of

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.150 
had no way of calling my parents of
calling<00:00:25.769> anyone

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
calling anyone

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.349 
calling anyone
so<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.550> had<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.699> figure<00:00:26.849> out<00:00:27.029> how<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.150> use<00:00:27.330> a

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
so I had to figure out how to use a

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.060 
so I had to figure out how to use a
payphone<00:00:27.630> which<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.410> not<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> very<00:00:28.859> fun

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
payphone which is not a very fun

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.580 
payphone which is not a very fun
experience<00:00:29.420> that<00:00:30.420> really<00:00:30.689> inspired<00:00:31.080> me<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.410> go

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
experience that really inspired me to go

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.290 
experience that really inspired me to go
out<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:31.920> do<00:00:32.309> something<00:00:32.520> about<00:00:32.700> my<00:00:32.820> cell<00:00:33.120> phone

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
out and do something about my cell phone

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.750 
out and do something about my cell phone
battery<00:00:33.590> I'm<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.860> developer<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.460> super

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
battery I'm the developer of a super

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.270 
battery I'm the developer of a super
capacitor<00:00:36.329> energy<00:00:36.750> storage<00:00:37.050> device<00:00:37.380> this

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
capacitor energy storage device this

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.310 
capacitor energy storage device this
believe<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.879> or<00:00:38.969> not<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> super<00:00:39.750> capacitor

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
believe it or not is the super capacitor

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.940 
believe it or not is the super capacitor
and<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> future<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.399> energy<00:00:41.820> storage

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
and it is a future of energy storage

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.200 
and it is a future of energy storage
super<00:00:43.950> capacitors<00:00:44.520> are<00:00:44.730> cutting<00:00:45.059> edge

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
super capacitors are cutting edge

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.270 
super capacitors are cutting edge
because<00:00:45.780> they<00:00:45.989> use<00:00:46.200> nanotechnology<00:00:46.620> which

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
because they use nanotechnology which

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.610 
because they use nanotechnology which
really<00:00:47.520> maximizes<00:00:48.300> surface<00:00:48.690> area<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.530> they

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
really maximizes surface area so they

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.260 
really maximizes surface area so they
can<00:00:49.649> utilize<00:00:49.920> both<00:00:50.309> battery<00:00:50.789> electric

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
can utilize both battery electric

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.029 
can utilize both battery electric
chemical<00:00:51.420> reactions<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.289> super<00:00:52.559> capacitor

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
chemical reactions and super capacitor

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.540 
chemical reactions and super capacitor
electrostatic<00:00:53.730> interactions<00:00:55.219> it<00:00:56.219> takes

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
electrostatic interactions it takes

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.959 
electrostatic interactions it takes
about<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.539> day<00:00:58.350> or<00:00:58.530> two<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.739> make<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.670> I

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
about a day or two to make one and I

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:00.939 
about a day or two to make one and I
went<00:01:00.149> through<00:01:00.300> multiple<00:01:00.719> iterations

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
went through multiple iterations

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.260 
went through multiple iterations
multiple<00:01:01.949> different<00:01:02.129> trial<00:01:02.550> conditions<00:01:03.090> to

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
multiple different trial conditions to

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.969 
multiple different trial conditions to
see<00:01:03.449> what<00:01:03.719> would<00:01:03.899> be<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.140> optimized<00:01:04.589> super

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
see what would be the optimized super

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.359 
see what would be the optimized super
capacitor<00:01:06.110> my<00:01:07.110> goal<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:08.070> super

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
capacitor my goal is to have a super

that<00:01:14.220> she<00:01:14.400> was<00:01:14.549> working<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.600> really<00:01:15.840> what<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
that she was working on is really what a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.149 
that she was working on is really what a
PhD<00:01:17.880> candidate<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.110> doing<00:01:19.560> their<00:01:19.740> work<00:01:19.920> on

PhD candidate is doing their work on
that's<00:01:21.150> what<00:01:21.420> makes<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:21.869> special

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
that's what makes it so special

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.490 
that's what makes it so special
until<00:01:23.700> powered<00:01:24.030> mobile<00:01:24.600> devices<00:01:25.020> allow<00:01:25.110> me<00:01:25.350> to

take my research forever ago technology
really<00:01:28.799> makes<00:01:29.159> my<00:01:29.490> data<00:01:29.759> valuation<00:01:30.390> much

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
really makes my data valuation much

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.929 
really makes my data valuation much
easier<00:01:31.020> much<00:01:31.200> faster<00:01:31.740> allowing<00:01:32.460> me<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.670> see
