00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
let's get a map shadow up here this is a

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.559 
let's get a map shadow up here this is a
matte<00:03:24.410> shadow<00:03:25.750> fits<00:03:26.750> right<00:03:26.840> in<00:03:27.049> there<00:03:28.269> so<00:03:29.269> it's

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
matte shadow fits right in there so it's

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.190 
matte shadow fits right in there so it's
a<00:03:29.629> pretty<00:03:29.810> decent<00:03:30.349> sized<00:03:30.590> um<00:03:31.160> I<00:03:31.780> shadow<00:03:32.780> refill

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
a pretty decent sized um I shadow refill

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.350 
a pretty decent sized um I shadow refill
it's<00:03:33.950> a<00:03:34.010> little<00:03:34.250> bit<00:03:34.340> smaller<00:03:34.519> than<00:03:34.670> a<00:03:34.819> Mac<00:03:35.030> one

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
it's a little bit smaller than a Mac one

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.990 
it's a little bit smaller than a Mac one
but<00:03:35.720> it's<00:03:36.709> still<00:03:37.099> pretty<00:03:37.160> decent<00:03:37.640> sized<00:03:37.790> first

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
but it's still pretty decent sized first

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.369 
but it's still pretty decent sized first
thing<00:03:38.180> I<00:03:38.420> felt<00:03:38.660> was<00:03:38.750> pretty<00:03:39.049> cool<00:03:39.230> because

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
thing I felt was pretty cool because

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.470 
thing I felt was pretty cool because
it's<00:03:39.680> really<00:03:40.010> big<00:03:40.250> it's<00:03:40.940> not<00:03:41.060> like<00:03:41.209> a<00:03:41.269> full

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
it's really big it's not like a full

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.720 
it's really big it's not like a full
size<00:03:41.660> but<00:03:41.900> it's<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:42.019> really<00:03:42.140> big<00:03:42.519> sample<00:03:43.519> i

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
size but it's a really big sample i

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.520 
size but it's a really big sample i
guess<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.299> is<00:03:44.420> air<00:03:44.660> travel<00:03:45.049> friendly<00:03:45.170> and

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
guess and it is air travel friendly and

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.210 
guess and it is air travel friendly and
is<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:45.920> dry<00:03:46.879> shampoo<00:03:46.989> which<00:03:47.989> I<00:03:48.230> love<00:03:48.920> dry

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
is the dry shampoo which I love dry

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
bottle of this and I like it it's not

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.059 
bottle of this and I like it it's not
the<00:04:02.599> best<00:04:02.750> thing<00:04:03.019> in<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.230> entire<00:04:03.319> world<00:04:03.560> but<00:04:04.040> i

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
the best thing in the entire world but i

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.229 
the best thing in the entire world but i
think<00:04:04.310> i<00:04:04.370> just<00:04:04.400> tried<00:04:04.760> so<00:04:04.970> many<00:04:05.120> different

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
think i just tried so many different

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.449 
think i just tried so many different
ones<00:04:05.660> that<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:05.900> kind<00:04:06.440> of<00:04:06.590> rested<00:04:07.160> this<00:04:07.280> to<00:04:07.370> the

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
ones that I kind of rested this to the

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:08.860 
ones that I kind of rested this to the
side<00:04:07.639> but<00:04:07.970> I<00:04:08.180> thought<00:04:08.450> this<00:04:08.569> is<00:04:08.630> pretty

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
side but I thought this is pretty

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.240 
side but I thought this is pretty
awesome<00:04:09.049> because<00:04:09.290> if<00:04:09.500> you<00:04:09.590> don't<00:04:09.829> have<00:04:10.069> this

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
awesome because if you don't have this

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.940 
awesome because if you don't have this
this<00:04:10.489> is<00:04:10.549> great<00:04:11.269> to<00:04:11.419> try<00:04:11.630> a<00:04:12.290> lot<00:04:12.650> of<00:04:12.739> people

minerals<00:05:34.750> blush<00:05:35.750> I<00:05:35.960> think<00:05:36.199> it<00:05:36.289> is<00:05:36.460> just<00:05:37.460> looks

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
minerals blush I think it is just looks

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.990 
minerals blush I think it is just looks
like<00:05:37.850> that<00:05:38.180> and<00:05:38.780> it<00:05:39.229> says<00:05:39.500> Girl<00:05:40.070> Friday<00:05:40.460> blush

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.969 
so I guess the color is Girl Friday is
that<00:05:44.330> what<00:05:44.510> it<00:05:44.600> is<00:05:44.720> is<00:05:45.440> that<00:05:45.680> what<00:05:45.800> you<00:05:45.889> guys
