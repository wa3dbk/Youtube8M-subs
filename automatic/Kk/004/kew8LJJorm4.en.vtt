00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
home every day but why does it do that

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.750 
home every day but why does it do that
why<00:00:06.899> does<00:00:06.960> it<00:00:07.290> why<00:00:07.890> would<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.130> dog<00:00:08.370> get<00:00:08.580> so

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
why does it why would a dog get so

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.890 
why does it why would a dog get so
excited<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.330> jump<00:00:09.570> around<00:00:09.719> be<00:00:10.290> just<00:00:11.160> just

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
excited and jump around be just just

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.940 
excited and jump around be just just
well<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.990> opposite<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.380> cat<00:00:13.590> when<00:00:13.830> it's

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
well the opposite of a cat when it's

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.099 
well the opposite of a cat when it's
easy<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.519> would<00:00:14.820> had<00:00:15.000> person<00:00:15.389> myself<00:00:15.780> but

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
easy so I would had person myself but

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.540 
easy so I would had person myself but
it's<00:00:16.619> interesting<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.160> say<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.430> this

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
it's interesting to say that this

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.870 
it's interesting to say that this
happens<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.539> consistently<00:00:19.439> yes<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.789> may

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
happens so consistently yes and it may

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.390 
happens so consistently yes and it may
go<00:00:21.029> back<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.480> where<00:00:22.320> dogs<00:00:22.560> came<00:00:22.920> from<00:00:23.160> from

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
go back to where dogs came from from

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.519 
go back to where dogs came from from
wolves<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.510> way<00:00:24.630> wolves<00:00:24.990> great<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.410> each

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
wolves so the way wolves great to each

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.380 
wolves so the way wolves great to each
other<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:26.010> through<00:00:26.220> licking<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.910> will<00:00:27.269> that

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
other is through licking and will that

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.259 
other is through licking and will that
also<00:00:27.539> males<00:00:28.160> be<00:00:29.160> able<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.460> tell<00:00:29.640> if<00:00:29.880> they<00:00:30.000> found

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
also males be able to tell if they found

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.569 
also males be able to tell if they found
food<00:00:30.510> recently<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.349> what<00:00:31.859> kind<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.130> food<00:00:32.340> and

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
food recently and what kind of food and

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.240 
food recently and what kind of food and
give<00:00:32.969> me<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> food<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.630> am<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.079> dog<00:00:34.290> wolf<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.190> I

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
give me the food I am a dog wolf and I

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.310 
give me the food I am a dog wolf and I
want<00:00:35.460> food<00:00:35.640> but<00:00:36.329> different<00:00:36.630> kinds<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.930> wolves

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
want food but different kinds of wolves

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.920 
want food but different kinds of wolves
evolved<00:00:37.800> into<00:00:38.070> different<00:00:38.399> well<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.690> wolves

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
evolved into different well the wolves

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.750 
evolved into different well the wolves
that<00:00:40.050> were<00:00:40.260> social<00:00:40.770> with<00:00:40.920> humans<00:00:41.309> eventually

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
that were social with humans eventually

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.850 
that were social with humans eventually
became<00:00:42.210> dogs<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:43.110> wolves<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.379> stayed<00:00:43.620> away

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
became dogs the wolves that stayed away

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.459 
became dogs the wolves that stayed away
stayed<00:00:44.340> wolves<00:00:44.760> yeah<00:00:45.180> which<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:45.930> it's

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
stayed wolves yeah which is it's

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.209 
stayed wolves yeah which is it's
interesting<00:00:46.890> because<00:00:47.430> uh<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:48.149> think<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.710> rib

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
interesting because uh I think the rib

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.590 
interesting because uh I think the rib
essentially<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:50.969> look<00:00:51.149> at<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.329> reason

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
essentially you can look at the reason

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.779 
essentially you can look at the reason
the<00:00:51.690> dogs<00:00:51.930> became<00:00:52.379> dogs<00:00:52.710> hey<00:00:53.340> yeah<00:00:53.610> they're

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the dogs became dogs hey yeah they're

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.310 
the dogs became dogs hey yeah they're
social<00:00:54.180> but<00:00:54.329> be<00:00:54.510> like<00:00:54.719> they<00:00:54.930> were<00:00:54.960> like<00:00:55.140> you

and bred and reinforced that over time

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.780 
and bred and reinforced that over time
there<00:01:10.380> was<00:01:10.470> ten<00:01:10.680> thousand<00:01:11.189> years<00:01:11.310> ago<00:01:11.460> and

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
there was ten thousand years ago and

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.670 
there was ten thousand years ago and
they're<00:01:12.119> different<00:01:12.390> they're<00:01:12.930> literally<00:01:13.439> just

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
they're different they're literally just

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
they're not even like it's not like the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.219 
they're not even like it's not like the
wolves<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:17.909> are<00:01:18.030> around<00:01:18.450> today<00:01:18.570> are<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
wolves that are around today are the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.719 
wolves that are around today are the
wolves<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.590> were<00:01:19.830> around<00:01:20.100> when<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.520> two

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
wolves that were around when the two

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.370 
wolves that were around when the two
species<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.330> know<00:01:21.450> they<00:01:21.630> split<00:01:21.960> into<00:01:22.170> two

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
species you know they split into two

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.539 
species you know they split into two
different<00:01:22.530> categories

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
different categories

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.429 
different categories
what<00:01:23.880> subspecies<00:01:24.270> or<00:01:24.479> whatever<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:25.380> uh

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
what subspecies or whatever but uh

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.340 
what subspecies or whatever but uh
that's<00:01:26.340> that's<00:01:26.700> one<00:01:27.000> aspect<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:27.990> I

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
that's that's one aspect of it so I

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.179 
that's that's one aspect of it so I
think<00:01:28.560> when<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.729> get<00:01:30.329> back<00:01:30.540> those<00:01:31.259> dogs<00:01:31.710> who

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
think when we get back those dogs who

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.760 
think when we get back those dogs who
thought<00:01:32.460> we<00:01:32.490> were<00:01:32.790> dead<00:01:33.409> when<00:01:34.409> we<00:01:34.530> left

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
thought we were dead when we left

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.990 
thought we were dead when we left
they're<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.100> oh<00:01:35.250> he's<00:01:35.490> gone<00:01:35.729> forever

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
they're like oh he's gone forever
