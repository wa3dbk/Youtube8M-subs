00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 but smaller than I have loin ball 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.520
 so that I do not complicate the 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.230
 existence of the spine ball being 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.519
 can divide a little bit has been divided 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.110
 only the other one we keep everything 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.240
 recycle everything is transformed I go to 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.119
 through a little paper today from here 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.070
 for a piece of plastic and you give him a 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.410
 tap to crush it well not 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.820
 break just crush look like I'm like 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.820
 being if the covers 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.099
 when you have a rectangle or more or 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.129
 minus a rectangle we're going to be 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.620
 well filled sack this we will 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.350
 specify everything as appropriate with 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.789
 creeping with griffin 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.460
 from that barbecue that is 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:46.140
 previously cooked directly here 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.090
 every time there 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.350
 I was surprised because we are playing a 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.430
 little morrón cited the roasted red morrón 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.470
 sends very well can not be far from 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.230
 the grill to a madrid and amadito 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.930
 No grill recipe can be 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.180
 galaxy does not surprise you the centers for 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.310
 and I'm still surprising day by day 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.750
 what happens that juanes accident in the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.140
 pocket is that it is some clay 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.140
 grill 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.670
 of soil says 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.670
 green onion on top of the 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.640
 Grill that is made reassures 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.530
 a little bit of cheese but this case is 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.570
 that that sea ​​type of the semiduro silver 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.610
 any semiidid cage fontina mar del 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.929
 crutcher silver if we want picantito and 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.820
 that because it 's not too too 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:32.990
 soft on purpose you could exactly 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.009
 put a little bit of show the person 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.020
 after the previous one so in this 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.659
 case it's fine and it's not going to melt so 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.390
 easy as you learn from cook and you 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.979
 we are giving not now because he has years 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.759
 in all this and is incorporating 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.759
 incorporating 20 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:55.009
 but so when you can 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.710
 very many some years a few years but 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.039
 let's say a general producer of 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.039
 gourmet 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:13.700
 discover everything and know that we are going to 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:19.239
 put to cook 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.239
 and he as guest jury president 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.019
 in a physical click but too much 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:29.350
 a little touch with parsley and now 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.880
 be like to go closing all this 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.740
 I'm not going to put pass taken because 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.740
 it will be pretty good 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.050
 we usually take good care of someone 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.050
 promo taiana 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.670
 above 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.950
 I thought that they send us help we can 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.650
 ask 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.689
 asked resting but I hope 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.030
 who is watching the program in this 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:59.189
 moment with the people of the parador the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.939
 carp in food on route 7 a hug 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.340

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:04.879
 Federico if you are on holiday luck and 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.879
 fruits 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.130
 we have a promoter too 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.990
 there has not been anything 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.760
 and we also appreciate the aprons 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.390
 and repasadores of today that is where they give to 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.430
 Bernard 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.600
 thank you very much now that he did what 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.600
 what do you want for certain successes 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:39.160
 yes bye bye bye 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:45.300
 come out there is a little bit and we're going 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.300
 to wrap in cree ping-pong 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.390
 but we must parallel and tommy with this 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.390
 it 's like that 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.310
 with irons forward because the first 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.250
 stop 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.440
 if nothing is too much that a 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.050
 turn around and arm you 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.560
 short here all in a race with little 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.210
 return 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.210
 we make a vision we made minimum 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:23.920
 in the program as well as for events 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.720
 birthday and I do not know that they are tremendous 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.860
 It is chiquitito is barbarian is the same 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.260
 but miniature 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.310
 this is so inward that it closes 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.530
 all right 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.540
 always the part of this that I'm 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.190
 closing inward is the first 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.750
 is in contact with the grill and since 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.920
 we are with everything to say of course 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.920
 what changes waiting 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.530
 come, come, come 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.160
 then to almost everything he trains for 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.010
 be cured 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.230
 to see him as a runner there is everything 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.300
 Here there is chicken and pork there is meat 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.580
 vaccine filled several all covered 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.590
 jorge team the technique is more or less 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.390
 the same technique is the same everything 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.550
 below average that is going to close that 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.470
 behavior that is not sewing that closure is 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.790
 going to finish melting the fat is going to 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.160
 be closed since it is 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.140
 wrapped here the fat melts and from 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.440
 blow because it melted it ends 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.170
 falling into the capacity to leave you everything 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.010
 in there then you are going to cook it 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.010
 approximately to a moderate fire 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.020
 in 30 minutes because little girl is that 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.389
 they are bigger a little bit more 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.370
 you have to rotate one two three 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:34.620
 four times with the golden one in all 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.620
 sides and cook well but well even
