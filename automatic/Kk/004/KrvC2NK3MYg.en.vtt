before<00:04:23.150> it<00:04:23.360> I<00:04:23.570> think<00:04:23.960> there's<00:04:24.110> something<00:04:24.320> to

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
before it I think there's something to

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.340 
before it I think there's something to
be<00:04:24.740> said<00:04:24.770> for<00:04:25.039> the<00:04:25.310> hardcore<00:04:25.580> and<00:04:25.880> even

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
be said for the hardcore and even

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.440 
be said for the hardcore and even
itself<00:04:26.680> you<00:04:27.160> know<00:04:27.280> I<00:04:27.490> think<00:04:27.670> about<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.180> glory

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
itself you know I think about the glory

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.510 
itself you know I think about the glory
days<00:04:28.510> of<00:04:28.840> wow<00:04:29.050> when<00:04:29.320> was<00:04:29.860> difficult<00:04:30.370> in

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
days of wow when was difficult in

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.970 
days of wow when was difficult in
vanilla<00:04:30.910> there<00:04:31.360> was<00:04:31.540> a<00:04:31.570> time<00:04:31.900> and<00:04:32.260> as<00:04:32.410> i

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
vanilla there was a time and as i

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.590 
vanilla there was a time and as i
continue<00:04:33.040> to<00:04:33.550> play<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:33.850> game<00:04:34.000> over<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.360> years

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
continue to play the game over the years

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.450 
continue to play the game over the years
and<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:34.870> new<00:04:35.080> expansions<00:04:35.680> it<00:04:35.860> seems<00:04:36.130> to<00:04:36.310> just

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
and the new expansions it seems to just

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.650 
and the new expansions it seems to just
get<00:04:36.610> simpler<00:04:37.030> and<00:04:37.180> simpler<00:04:37.450> or<00:04:37.630> more

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
get simpler and simpler or more

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.650 
get simpler and simpler or more
streamlined<00:04:38.380> more<00:04:39.040> mainstream<00:04:39.490> and<00:04:40.180> it<00:04:40.450> makes

streamlined more mainstream and it makes

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.600 
streamlined more mainstream and it makes

sense because it's a big game it has to

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.940 
sense because it's a big game it has to
