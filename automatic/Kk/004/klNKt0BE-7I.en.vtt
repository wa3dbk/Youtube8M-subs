seriously cause damage that's less way
about<00:03:21.920> you<00:03:22.040> put<00:03:22.220> in<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.610> that<00:03:22.640> I<00:03:23.120> chose

about you put in it and that I chose

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.110 
about you put in it and that I chose
this<00:03:23.720> map<00:03:23.990> because<00:03:24.260> fish<00:03:24.650> map<00:03:24.890> is<00:03:25.400> perfect<00:03:26.000> the

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
this map because fish map is perfect the

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.310 
this map because fish map is perfect the
reason<00:03:26.360> why<00:03:26.450> I<00:03:26.480> like<00:03:26.750> this<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:27.080> not<00:03:27.140> many

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
reason why I like this and not many

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.070 
reason why I like this and not many
people<00:03:27.590> I<00:03:27.890> actually<00:03:28.130> do<00:03:28.400> it's<00:03:28.820> got<00:03:28.970> some<00:03:29.180> with

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
people I actually do it's got some with

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.900 
people I actually do it's got some with
some<00:03:30.260> stuff<00:03:30.800> at<00:03:30.950> you<00:03:30.980> can<00:03:31.220> actually<00:03:31.340> use<00:03:31.520> your

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
some stuff at you can actually use your

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.730 
some stuff at you can actually use your
advantage<00:03:32.360> I<00:03:32.390> mean<00:03:32.630> there<00:03:32.780> has<00:03:32.960> some<00:03:33.170> stupid

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
advantage I mean there has some stupid

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.230 
advantage I mean there has some stupid
egg<00:03:33.860> glitches<00:03:34.220> but<00:03:34.310> literally<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:34.940> can<00:03:35.090> see

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
egg glitches but literally you can see

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.480 
egg glitches but literally you can see
the<00:03:35.330> tops<00:03:35.540> on<00:03:35.780> this<00:03:35.900> fringe<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.440> I<00:03:36.500> can<00:03:37.340> shoot

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
the tops on this fringe and I can shoot

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.520 
the tops on this fringe and I can shoot
you<00:03:37.550> from<00:03:37.670> it<00:03:37.850> however<00:03:38.450> if<00:03:38.600> you<00:03:38.810> use<00:03:39.050> that<00:03:39.080> if

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
you from it however if you use that if

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.100 
you from it however if you use that if
you<00:03:39.770> use<00:03:40.090> another<00:03:41.090> head<00:03:41.300> glitch<00:03:41.480> to<00:03:41.630> like<00:03:41.840> kind

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
you use another head glitch to like kind

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.620 
you use another head glitch to like kind
of<00:03:42.230> put<00:03:42.410> yourself<00:03:42.800> in<00:03:43.430> like<00:03:43.700> a<00:03:43.940> situation

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
of put yourself in like a situation

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.120 
of put yourself in like a situation
where<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:44.930> know<00:03:44.990> maybe<00:03:45.230> on<00:03:45.380> an<00:03:45.740> equal<00:03:46.070> playing

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
where you know maybe on an equal playing

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.640 
where you know maybe on an equal playing
field<00:03:46.670> or<00:03:46.880> maybe<00:03:47.390> you've<00:03:47.840> got<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.530> advantage

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
field or maybe you've got the advantage

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.199 
field or maybe you've got the advantage
and<00:03:49.100> like<00:03:49.220> that<00:03:49.370> convo<00:03:49.670> maybe<00:03:49.910> your<00:03:50.030> head

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
and like that convo maybe your head

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.730 
and like that convo maybe your head
glitching<00:03:50.390> maybe<00:03:50.660> you're<00:03:50.840> sniffing<00:03:51.290> if<00:03:51.560> you

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
glitching maybe you're sniffing if you

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.080 
glitching maybe you're sniffing if you
try<00:03:51.920> and<00:03:51.980> blend<00:03:52.190> in<00:03:52.459> with<00:03:52.550> a<00:03:52.640> background<00:03:52.820> of

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
try and blend in with a background of

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.090 
try and blend in with a background of
course<00:03:53.300> it's<00:03:53.750> a<00:03:53.840> fairly<00:03:54.080> dark<00:03:54.410> map<00:03:54.680> if<00:03:54.830> you<00:03:54.950> go

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
course it's a fairly dark map if you go

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.860 
course it's a fairly dark map if you go
and<00:03:55.160> suck<00:03:55.340> at<00:03:55.520> that<00:03:55.550> corner<00:03:56.000> when<00:03:56.240> like<00:03:56.450> yeah

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
and suck at that corner when like yeah

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.600 
and suck at that corner when like yeah
you're<00:03:57.260> hurt<00:03:57.500> you<00:03:57.620> can<00:03:57.770> actually<00:03:58.070> like<00:03:58.220> he'll

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
you're hurt you can actually like he'll

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.460 
you're hurt you can actually like he'll
back<00:03:58.880> so<00:03:59.480> these<00:03:59.750> are<00:03:59.810> like<00:04:00.050> a<00:04:00.080> few<00:04:00.320> things

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
back so these are like a few things

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.660 
back so these are like a few things
which<00:04:00.680> can<00:04:00.860> actually<00:04:01.130> implement<00:04:01.340> in<00:04:01.640> your

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
which can actually implement in your

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.510 
which can actually implement in your
like<00:04:02.000> game<00:04:02.209> style<00:04:02.540> and<00:04:02.780> then<00:04:03.290> can<00:04:04.130> survive<00:04:04.459> a

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
like game style and then can survive a

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.880 
like game style and then can survive a
little<00:04:04.790> bit<00:04:05.000> longer<00:04:05.209> on<00:04:05.510> this<00:04:05.930> map<00:04:06.200> I<00:04:06.380> mean<00:04:06.709> you

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
little bit longer on this map I mean you

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:07.960 
little bit longer on this map I mean you
saw<00:04:07.100> that<00:04:07.280> I<00:04:07.340> think<00:04:07.580> there's<00:04:07.700> a<00:04:07.760> guy<00:04:07.940> that

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
saw that I think there's a guy that

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.790 
saw that I think there's a guy that
keeps<00:04:08.360> them<00:04:08.600> for<00:04:09.110> whatever<00:04:09.230> reason<00:04:09.650> its

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
keeps them for whatever reason its

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.680 
keeps them for whatever reason its

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
not many people like this map we don't

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.130 
not many people like this map we don't
really<00:04:22.760> play<00:04:23.090> it<00:04:23.210> and<00:04:23.330> prosper<00:04:23.810> they'll<00:04:23.930> play

you<00:04:27.200> always<00:04:27.410> seen<00:04:27.590> this<00:04:27.680> game<00:04:27.860> play<00:04:28.130> I'm<00:04:28.280> not

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
you always seen this game play I'm not

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.160 
you always seen this game play I'm not
sure<00:04:28.580> if<00:04:28.670> you<00:04:28.760> actually<00:04:28.850> knows<00:04:29.120> it<00:04:29.360> all<00:04:29.510> he's

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
sure if you actually knows it all he's

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.300 
sure if you actually knows it all he's
done<00:04:30.350> this<00:04:30.470> so<00:04:30.650> much<00:04:30.830> so<00:04:30.980> it's<00:04:31.100> kind<00:04:31.280> of

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
done this so much so it's kind of

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.890 
done this so much so it's kind of
subconscious<00:04:31.550> but<00:04:32.120> he's<00:04:32.210> always<00:04:32.630> giving
