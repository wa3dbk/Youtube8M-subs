00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 Hello everyone , I am progressing now 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.410
 could have looked like an egg but because i 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.500
 it was necessary to take hair for today 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.460
 there will be a video about cooking you very much 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.950
 asked to do 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.750
 like cooking videos I thought why 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.550
 understand Islam is interesting then I 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.050
 I will definitely do today to teach you 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.609
 cook a simple thing like that 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.960
 called crazy cake 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.480
 if literally translate it 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.609
 crazy cake I called these pieces 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.930
 and craig is a lazy cake because to 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.740
 didn't notice do need to be complete 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.109
 an idiot 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.669
 the cake itself is quite large 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.399
 size enough to feed your 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.260
 company and getting ready very quickly and 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.809
 the recipe is pretty simple but come on 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.170
 finally do the cooking and so to me 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.600
 need vegetable oil sugar 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.920
 cocoa powder just what should be 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.899
 insoluble flour soda vinegar but also 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.199
 ordinary drinking water and so for a start 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.899
 we need sugar flour soda and cocoa 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:03.809
 we will need 3 cups of flour that is 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:09.570
 somewhere around 600 grams we also need 2 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:11.240
 cups of sugar is also somewhere half the glass 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.869
 cocoa 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.520
 but I usually add a little more 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:26.960
 also need somewhere teaspoon 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:28.340
 soda and all this we mix now in 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.439
 this mixture and we have to do two 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.710
 grooves one big and the other 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.710
 slightly less 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.189
 in that which we pour more and 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.539
 about three quarters of a glass 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:47.179
 vegetable oil bus smaller 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:55.539
 about 2 teaspoons of vinegar 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:55.539
 Now we add there 2 glasses of water 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.900
 and mix until smooth 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.050
 Now our form must be oiled and 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.020
 now we need to sprinkle our 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.760
 form the flour and distribute the arm throughout 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:29.120
 form and now we have got out our 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:34.610
 dough into shape and now we ship our 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:38.350
 pie in the oven you need to bake approximately 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.570
 30 minutes at 180 degrees and 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.540
 so here's what our pie looks like in the finished 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.610
 you can sprinkle this kind of cake 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:54.019
 on top with powdered sugar or with 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:56.209
 some fresh berries what 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.130
