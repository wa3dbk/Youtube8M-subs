00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.740
 in search of a healthy industry a 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.510
 of the actions of the sesi is the promotion of 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.469
 rustic racing circuit of the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.420
 industries 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.820
 we were in the third stage of this 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.220
 year that new games happened with a 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.830
 course of 10 kilometers and which 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.109
 around 600 runners in the world 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.080
 corporate- oriented physical activity 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.930
 gains more and more space 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.590
 alex how is bosch's scheme 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.969
 to add employees to this project 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.980
 from street races to people through 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.630
 sport in the race is one of the teams 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.430
 more organized we have structured 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.540
 so of all the sports of the boule 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.789
 athletics do not people do people organize 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.969
 in the sense that he gives you advice in the 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.000
 An entry with registration is all 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.160
 this logistics free of convenience 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.620
 same athlete and during the week we 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.840
 conducts physical fitness classes 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.180
 weekly training follow -up is 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.160
 everything for the betterment of the athlete 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.719
 in tests then he has more return 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.659
 where there are more participants 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.220
 in the then it 's a cheerful team 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.260
 already has more than ten years of 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.479
 insured the team so I went show of 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.909
 ball 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.189
 the course of this step has a certain degree 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.430
 difficulty with some climbs 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.500
 descents that require attention and preparation 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.240
 I thought you found the proof is there 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.310
 a difficult test I think that after 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.320
 copel this is the proof that I consider 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.299
 more difficult because the start has already 12 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.710
 kilometers of climb after the terrain is 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.900
 very irregular with some climbs and 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.270
 descents not tired enough to account 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.250
 You just do the circuit, I'll tell you. 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.439
 usually participate in races in general 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.840
 I aim to do 12 tests 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.470
 per year of 10 kilometers then makes 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.860
 sesi at 6 o'clock and make some others is given 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.200
 adidas that they 1 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.930
 the one of the track &amp; field and the marathon of curitiba 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.080
 but the 10 km and then and you 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.870
 prefers to take the kit somewhere is a 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.120
 shop somewhere out before the race 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.070
 or would you like to take the kit on the day 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.229
 of proof, what do you think is easiest to 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.540
 you, I think that getting better sooner 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.610
 easy because of the many people in it 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.330
 Arriving day staff arrive late than 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.400
 the cdu chose to withdraw before is better 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.010
 and if you still do not run anymore you have 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.250
 want to start the more 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.380
 experienced give the hint any great 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.570
 Tip for what you would give to those who are 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.450
 starting now want to get in the race o 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.940
 what is important is the person 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.550
 if you take care of a medical examination, you 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.959
 heart do the tread test for 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.540
 know the type of footwear suitable for 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.100
 kind of stepped on and train him up there 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.870
 You did not want to keep up with the 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.850
 which have been taking place for some time now 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.720
 following the pace of the long life line in 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.850
 sport 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.250
 what's the tip you give to anyone who wants 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.980
 get in to this good racing world 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.430
 The first tip is to look for a 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.970
 nutritionist is a one there one person 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.980
 that you can do a good evaluation 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.280
 doctor to see how you are 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.400
 health, everything will then start over and 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.140
 race time there any secret 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.480
 to support 10 kilometers of climb and 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.299
 to keep calm does not work 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.620
 wanting to go out on that one in the 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.060
 first few miles you will not 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.519
 able to complete the stories of the 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.620
 hallways are always very motivating 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.260
 such as the minoru who, after a 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.989
 career in engineering decided to come back 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.560
 to college because of your passion 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:35.080
 by the huge race that tells you how 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.510
 the team of you came how many people 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.440
 have how I like to run this 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.209
 in 2004 but then the staff asked 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.829
 to register had no time there 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.410
 was to apply when you are 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.209
 making the registration of 20 people 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.489
 school otto a team 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.290
 at that time the Azimuth team and from there 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.060
 was born the team had no name is 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.270
 Like I did not have the fla and put my name 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.550
 So 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.060
 and then this team has grown and today you 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:05.990
 They are a practical family, it's not us. 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.240
 registered 750 active is up to 200 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.740
 but I'm always variable because the 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.720
 staff of most of my staff who 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.070
 works here is history with 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.670
 physical education 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:19.220
 Well I started running in 2004, right? 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.230
 as I went I liked the race planned 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.360
 do physical education because staff 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.330
 will work with physical activity and 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.130
 then I started to focus on the association of 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.090
 pec coach after thiago silva be 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.210
 formed right 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.770
 Then I started to study and I graduated with 62 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.480
 years the individual course in the 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.460
 positive university 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.100
 It does not mean that you after a 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.680
 engineering engineering career not 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.900
 even imaginary and even healthy 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.850
 volunteer work I have not earned 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.040
 money in this business and where we 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.930
 we run in the race of the boyfriends to 8 km 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.640
 and my wife is today , my wife is 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.800
 we're just here she runs more than 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.340
 I actually started running because 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.180
 I was very poor health okay I have 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:05.720
 hepatitis b has a problem in the spine 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:09.080
 I have had a bad time calculating tuberculosis 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.930
 who admitted four years includes anything 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.190
 of bad things there when they wait high 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.110
 had headquarters 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.840
 everything was spoiled rotten and the 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.980
 I ran and escaped from head surgery 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.680
 already the friendship health fun and much 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.750
 are some of the benefits of 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.450
 who decides to leave the sedentary lifestyle and 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:32.150
 start running around but do not forget 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:35.320
 of the tip do a medical evaluation before 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.320
 to put on the shoes 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:44.119
 hello guys exposed team I am hair hansen 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.830
 vimax design today I 'm talking about 

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:48.229
 another great hairstyle technique to 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.939
 Do you play sports? 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.610
 regardless of where you are in a 

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:55.039
 coke a very practical touch you do 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.319
 pulling all your hair back always 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:59.029
 pull lots of hair all over the hairstyle 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:01.219
 independent of coke tail I think 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:03.169
 It's cool, you do not push too much. 

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:05.869
 hair because otherwise you will 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:09.050
 generating more perspiration in the hair in the 

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:10.759
 scalp and it ends up getting dirtier 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.300
 for those who transpire a lot the more 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:16.239
 You better conserve health. 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.919
 of the son and if the aspect of him is clean 

00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:20.929
 You pulling it will make a tail of 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:23.929
 horse all the coke I think it's cool to you 

00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:26.179
 from a ponytail I'll do 

00:06:23.929 --> 00:06:29.409
 a trapdoor with elastic according to people 

00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:34.659
 saw in the previous tip of the ponytail 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:36.619
 wraps hair and fastens clamp 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:39.409
 after you made the ponytail 

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:44.499
 You'll twist your hair so he will not 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:48.699
 release around ciel this amarradinho 

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:48.699
 and fasten with some grains 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.780
 the cool of sicó what time you 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.790
 need to drop it you're still going to have 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.919
 a part of the movement of your hair and 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.630
 you loosing the elastic the clamp 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:04.430
 elastic I think to get loose with 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.760
 without breaking any kind of 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.760
 thread 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.479
 then there is the individual dispute of the 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.830
 children's shoes worth the title 

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:17.840
 paranaense 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.380
 so the subject is basketball, the people 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.380
 back now
