00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:10.830
 guys but a video there now demonstrate 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:13.590
 How do you adjust current is? 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.780
 The very important component of the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.800
 bamba 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.660
 neither much show nor much that results 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.570
 to the extent that the manufacturer 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.180
 movement has to take place between two 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.160
 centimeters and two centimeters and mail 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.320
 If you look at mine, it's very much a band. 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.120
 bubble on the central stall is fashionable 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.790
 gets high 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.050
 You'll have to do here O 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.050
 this one for everything 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.960
 I'm from here on the other side 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.210
 of the eight shacks here 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:58.000
 three screws you will use own 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:00.340
 key that comes with a kit of the girl 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.520
 and if I took another side at least from my 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:09.490
 kit I do not read I'm using a key 27 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:13.930
 a bit loose but add 3026 to 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:17.320
 ideal and this screw here with your own 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.869
 you can unscrew the other key 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.850
 side you will have to back up with the 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:45.100
 sorry for the kit in that safe hole 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:53.070
 on the other side with the key 2 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:53.070
 make the adjustment clockwise 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.570
 he advanced 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:11.899
 advancing another advance that happens the 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.319
 imagining 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:25.370
 It appears herein and observing the chain O 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:28.540
 shop exactly improve notice already 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:33.620
 You're better off doing touring now. 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:41.450
 means can not be modified has 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:46.519
 that being in it it stays the same 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.980
 which may have some points in the 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.120
 our tensioned tensioned is dangerous 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.129
 to burst 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.739
 you stand in the middle of the street suffered 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:59.660
 a serious accident made after the 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:05.060
 chain links 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:08.260
 You see these islands here, where they are 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.260
 just like that side 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.440
 that other side 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.379
 to fight equally for the galley has to 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.310
 be aligned you have no problem 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:28.739
 How am I the first to leave? 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:32.750
 of course to tighten the same process 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.750
 of life runs 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:43.829
 this movement may be able to show 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:51.799
 You can put it on the ruler. 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:51.799
 even on the 27 year old brother-in-law 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.580
 the chain will make a move to 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.100
 up and down and damaged if you have 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:06.290
 two directions between two centimeters and 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:08.300
 two centimeters and a half what is 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.960
 extreme importance and something else 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:15.710
 guarantees no problems in the system 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.910
 is not adjusted in the manual 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.280
 from the galley 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:25.300
 It's very important that you do not want to do it. 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.300
 was simple and easy mechanic
