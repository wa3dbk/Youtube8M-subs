in<00:01:06.240> gustafson<00:01:07.049> for<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.650> decent<00:01:08.220> amount<00:01:08.280> of

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
in gustafson for a decent amount of

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.429 
in gustafson for a decent amount of
pucks<00:01:08.729> but<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.240> know<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.360> figured<00:01:09.720> rather<00:01:10.200> than

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
pucks but you know I figured rather than

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.109 
pucks but you know I figured rather than
risk<00:01:10.740> not<00:01:11.159> getting<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.610> players<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:11.970> I

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
risk not getting the players that I

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.580 
risk not getting the players that I
needed<00:01:12.360> into<00:01:12.630> certain<00:01:12.900> positions<00:01:13.260> i<00:01:13.350> might<00:01:13.500> as

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
needed into certain positions i might as

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.810 
needed into certain positions i might as
well<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:13.830> go<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.280> get<00:01:14.430> some<00:01:14.670> decent

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
well just go in and get some decent

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.580 
well just go in and get some decent
players<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:15.479> low<00:01:15.630> pucks<00:01:15.900> because<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.470> know<00:01:16.560> I

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
players for low pucks because you know I

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.050 
players for low pucks because you know I
figured<00:01:16.979> those<00:01:17.070> players<00:01:17.340> are<00:01:17.520> pretty<00:01:17.939> good

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
figured those players are pretty good

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.420
