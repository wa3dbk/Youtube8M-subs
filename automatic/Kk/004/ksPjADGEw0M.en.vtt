00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:02.369 
check them out but it is really

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:06.170 
check them out but it is really
mind-boggling<00:01:03.150> I'm<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:04.650> not<00:01:04.949> these<00:01:05.820> big

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
mind-boggling I'm is it's not these big

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.700 
mind-boggling I'm is it's not these big
as<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.390> might<00:01:06.540> imagine<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.320> really

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
as you might imagine but it's really

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.080 
as you might imagine but it's really
bigger<00:01:08.100> than<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.490> might<00:01:08.610> imagine<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.970> don't

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
bigger than you might imagine I don't

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.120 
bigger than you might imagine I don't
know<00:01:09.180> if<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.390> makes<00:01:09.420> sense<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.380> probably

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
know if that makes sense but I probably

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.859

the best time would be to go you no sign
of<00:05:53.900> even<00:05:54.199> you<00:05:54.259> don't<00:05:54.409> display<00:05:54.949> you<00:05:55.250> can<00:05:55.370> pay

of even you don't display you can pay
and<00:05:55.969> then<00:05:56.569> you<00:05:56.779> know<00:05:56.870> you<00:05:56.960> can<00:05:57.199> go<00:05:57.229> there

00:05:57.579 --> 00:05:57.589 
and then you know you can go there

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:00.399 
and then you know you can go there
during<00:05:58.009> the<00:05:58.099> off<00:05:58.339> hours<00:05:58.610> and<00:05:59.330> you<00:05:59.539> get<00:05:59.750> to<00:05:59.900> have

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:02.539 
a chance to win a bunch of free Lego I

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.110 
a chance to win a bunch of free Lego I
think<00:06:02.779> one<00:06:03.589> of<00:06:03.620> the<00:06:03.800> guys<00:06:03.979> in<00:06:04.370> my<00:06:04.400> log<00:06:04.849> there

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
think one of the guys in my log there

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.969 
think one of the guys in my log there
was<00:06:05.210> a<00:06:05.240> couple<00:06:05.629> of<00:06:05.810> Mike<00:06:05.990> the<00:06:06.169> guys<00:06:06.349> in<00:06:06.620> my<00:06:06.650> lug

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
was a couple of Mike the guys in my lug

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:08.649 
was a couple of Mike the guys in my lug
the<00:06:07.250> Kansas<00:06:07.669> City<00:06:07.789> lug<00:06:08.120> that<00:06:08.330> were<00:06:08.449> there

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:08.659 
the Kansas City lug that were there

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:10.629 
the Kansas City lug that were there
displaying<00:06:09.199> they<00:06:09.710> weren't<00:06:10.009> with<00:06:10.219> a<00:06:10.250> lot<00:06:10.610> I

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 
displaying they weren't with a lot I

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:12.070 
displaying they weren't with a lot I
mean<00:06:10.879> they<00:06:11.150> weren't<00:06:11.300> displaying<00:06:11.569> with<00:06:11.960> the

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
mean they weren't displaying with the

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.230 
mean they weren't displaying with the
loggers<00:06:12.439> is<00:06:12.589> doing<00:06:12.860> their<00:06:12.979> own<00:06:13.009> thing<00:06:13.129> but<00:06:13.550> I

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
loggers is doing their own thing but I

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.749 
loggers is doing their own thing but I
think<00:06:14.300> one<00:06:14.629> of<00:06:14.659> them<00:06:14.900> one<00:06:15.529> like<00:06:15.919> the<00:06:16.189> new

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759 
think one of them one like the new

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.390 
think one of them one like the new
ferris<00:06:17.180> wheel<00:06:17.419> so<00:06:17.810> did<00:06:18.259> they<00:06:18.830> were<00:06:18.889> giving

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
ferris wheel so did they were giving

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.790 
ferris wheel so did they were giving
away<00:06:19.460> a<00:06:19.639> lot<00:06:19.939> of<00:06:19.969> nice<00:06:20.360> LEGO<00:06:20.900> sets<00:06:21.289> from<00:06:21.560> what<00:06:21.770> I

this<00:06:58.670> play<00:06:58.880> with<00:06:59.060> skyscrapers<00:06:59.570> I<00:06:59.870> mean<00:07:00.050> they

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:00.200 
this play with skyscrapers I mean they

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.340 
this play with skyscrapers I mean they
made<00:07:00.380> cig<00:07:01.010> tower<00:07:01.280> look<00:07:01.669> like<00:07:01.850> a<00:07:01.880> baby<00:07:02.240> so<00:07:02.960> that

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.350 
made cig tower look like a baby so that

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.440 
made cig tower look like a baby so that
was<00:07:03.560> really<00:07:03.800> cool<00:07:04.400> to<00:07:04.460> see<00:07:04.639> that<00:07:05.060> and<00:07:05.419> they

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.450 
was really cool to see that and they

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.570 
was really cool to see that and they
probably<00:07:06.020> weren't<00:07:06.290> I<00:07:06.560> don't<00:07:06.980> they're<00:07:07.340> like

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:07.580 
probably weren't I don't they're like

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.670 
probably weren't I don't they're like
hollowed-out<00:07:08.000> buildings<00:07:08.720> they're<00:07:09.380> not<00:07:09.530> going

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 
hollowed-out buildings they're not going

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.440 
hollowed-out buildings they're not going
to<00:07:09.770> have<00:07:09.919> levels<00:07:10.370> with<00:07:10.610> apartments<00:07:11.360> or

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:11.450 
to have levels with apartments or

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.020 
to have levels with apartments or
nothing<00:07:11.770> when<00:07:12.770> you<00:07:12.860> get<00:07:13.010> in<00:07:13.130> that<00:07:13.160> big<00:07:13.520> and

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.030 
nothing when you get in that big and

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.150 
nothing when you get in that big and
they<00:07:14.660> had<00:07:14.810> that<00:07:14.960> big<00:07:15.169> of<00:07:15.260> a<00:07:15.320> layout<00:07:15.530> you<00:07:15.860> really

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 
they had that big of a layout you really

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.710 
they had that big of a layout you really
they<00:07:16.430> probably<00:07:16.669> don't<00:07:16.850> do<00:07:17.120> too<00:07:17.300> much<00:07:17.450> with

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:17.720 
they probably don't do too much with

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.990 
they probably don't do too much with
interior<00:07:18.350> but<00:07:18.950> you<00:07:19.310> know<00:07:19.400> that<00:07:19.610> was<00:07:19.760> pretty

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 
interior but you know that was pretty

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.050 
interior but you know that was pretty
cool<00:07:20.300> I<00:07:20.600> learned<00:07:20.840> a<00:07:20.960> lot<00:07:21.169> of<00:07:21.350> you<00:07:21.800> know

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.060
