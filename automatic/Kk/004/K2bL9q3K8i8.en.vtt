that we've got the machine in the
relative<00:00:48.399> position<00:00:48.879> we're<00:00:49.030> going<00:00:49.059> to<00:00:49.210> take<00:00:49.360> a

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
relative position we're going to take a

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.240 
relative position we're going to take a
basic<00:00:49.629> level<00:00:50.170> we're<00:00:50.500> going<00:00:50.530> to<00:00:50.710> set<00:00:50.920> it<00:00:51.040> on<00:00:51.129> the

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
basic level we're going to set it on the

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.910 
basic level we're going to set it on the
arm<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:52.510> we're<00:00:52.690> going<00:00:52.809> to<00:00:52.839> rotate<00:00:53.350> this<00:00:53.589> arm

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
arm and we're going to rotate this arm

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.759 
arm and we're going to rotate this arm
in<00:00:54.159> all<00:00:54.699> four<00:00:55.089> positions<00:00:55.320> there<00:00:56.320> are<00:00:56.470> four

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
in all four positions there are four

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.859 
in all four positions there are four
leveling<00:00:57.460> positions<00:00:58.000> that<00:00:58.390> come<00:00:58.570> off<00:00:58.720> from

00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:58.869 
leveling positions that come off from

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:02.340 
leveling positions that come off from
the<00:00:59.049> base<00:00:59.339> so<00:01:00.339> ideally<00:01:00.939> if<00:01:01.299> the<00:01:01.809> shaft<00:01:02.080> is

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
the base so ideally if the shaft is

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.580 
the base so ideally if the shaft is
plumb<00:01:02.909> the<00:01:03.909> level<00:01:04.299> should<00:01:04.720> be<00:01:04.839> the<00:01:04.989> same<00:01:05.290> in

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
plumb the level should be the same in

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.399 
plumb the level should be the same in
all<00:01:06.159> four<00:01:06.520> positions<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:07.990> way<00:01:08.079> we<00:01:08.200> want<00:01:08.350> to

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
all four positions so the way we want to

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.310 
all four positions so the way we want to
look<00:01:08.530> at<00:01:08.680> this<00:01:08.860> is<00:01:09.450> simply<00:01:10.450> this<00:01:10.600> pretend<00:01:11.200> that

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
look at this is simply this pretend that

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.100 
look at this is simply this pretend that
I'm<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.619> main<00:01:11.740> shaft<00:01:12.070> and<00:01:12.460> my<00:01:12.880> arms<00:01:13.270> are<00:01:13.479> the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
I'm the main shaft and my arms are the

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.370 
I'm the main shaft and my arms are the
pallet<00:01:14.470> arms<00:01:14.740> with<00:01:15.250> a<00:01:15.280> level<00:01:15.520> if<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.990> arms<00:01:17.259> are

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
pallet arms with a level if the arms are

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.130 
pallet arms with a level if the arms are
tilted<00:01:17.829> the<00:01:18.369> bubble<00:01:18.729> on<00:01:18.850> this<00:01:19.090> side<00:01:19.360> would<00:01:19.960> be

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
tilted the bubble on this side would be

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.350 
tilted the bubble on this side would be
all<00:01:20.259> the<00:01:20.409> way<00:01:20.439> up<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:21.549> bubble<00:01:21.820> on<00:01:21.939> this<00:01:22.119> side

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
all the way up the bubble on this side

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.690 
all the way up the bubble on this side
would<00:01:22.780> be<00:01:22.960> all<00:01:23.079> the<00:01:23.229> way<00:01:23.320> in<00:01:23.590> so<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.460> first

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
would be all the way in so the first

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.440 
would be all the way in so the first
thing<00:01:25.240> we<00:01:25.360> want<00:01:25.509> to<00:01:25.540> accomplish<00:01:25.840> is<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.829> get

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
thing we want to accomplish is to get

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.440 
thing we want to accomplish is to get
this<00:01:28.450> level<00:01:29.200> this<00:01:29.710> way<00:01:29.950> once<00:01:30.670> we<00:01:30.850> have<00:01:31.060> two

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
this level this way once we have two

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.200 
this level this way once we have two
legs<00:01:31.720> level<00:01:32.170> then<00:01:32.950> we<00:01:33.130> can<00:01:33.310> rotate<00:01:33.580> that<00:01:33.850> and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
legs level then we can rotate that and

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.410 
legs level then we can rotate that and
work<00:01:34.840> on<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.620> level<00:01:35.920> in<00:01:36.010> this<00:01:36.159> direction<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
work on the level in this direction the

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.780 
work on the level in this direction the
end<00:01:37.630> result<00:01:38.110> would<00:01:38.350> be<00:01:38.409> that<00:01:38.799> the<00:01:39.220> bubble

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
end result would be that the bubble

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.600 
end result would be that the bubble
would<00:01:40.270> be<00:01:40.420> in<00:01:40.510> the<00:01:40.630> same<00:01:40.870> physical<00:01:41.170> location

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
would be in the same physical location

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.270 
would be in the same physical location
all<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.670> way<00:01:43.450> around<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:44.020> machine<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:44.799> we

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
all the way around the machine and we

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.410 
all the way around the machine and we
have<00:01:45.430> four<00:01:45.729> leveling<00:01:46.240> feet<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:47.110> adjust<00:01:47.470> that

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
have four leveling feet to adjust that

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.450 
have four leveling feet to adjust that
okay<00:01:49.420> most<00:01:49.930> manufacturing<00:01:50.560> facilities<00:01:51.159> the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
okay most manufacturing facilities the

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.430 
okay most manufacturing facilities the
floor<00:01:51.700> is<00:01:51.850> not<00:01:52.030> level<00:01:52.299> so<00:01:52.930> we<00:01:53.020> want<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.229> start

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
floor is not level so we want to start

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.080 
floor is not level so we want to start
off<00:01:53.560> with<00:01:53.619> at<00:01:53.860> least<00:01:54.010> having<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.520> base<00:01:54.760> of<00:01:55.000> the

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
off with at least having the base of the

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.240 
off with at least having the base of the
machine<00:01:55.350> level<00:01:56.350> as<00:01:56.470> we<00:01:56.680> set<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:57.010> on<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.220> floor

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
machine level as we set it on the floor

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.490 
machine level as we set it on the floor
so<00:01:57.760> up<00:01:58.240> next<00:01:58.540> what<00:01:58.659> I'm<00:01:58.750> going<00:01:58.780> to<00:01:58.960> show<00:01:59.110> you<00:01:59.140> is

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
so up next what I'm going to show you is

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.680 
so up next what I'm going to show you is
with<00:02:00.010> the<00:02:00.100> basic<00:02:00.490> carpenter<00:02:00.909> square<00:02:01.060> we<00:02:01.510> can

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
with the basic carpenter square we can

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.899 
with the basic carpenter square we can
set<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:02.020> feet<00:02:02.290> so<00:02:03.070> that<00:02:03.310> we<00:02:03.400> know<00:02:03.549> that<00:02:03.760> all

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
set the feet so that we know that all

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.969 
set the feet so that we know that all
the<00:02:04.180> feet<00:02:04.390> are<00:02:04.869> in<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.049> same<00:02:05.260> relative

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
the feet are in the same relative

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.240 
the feet are in the same relative
relationship<00:02:06.549> to<00:02:06.700> each<00:02:06.820> other<00:02:07.799> okay<00:02:08.799> so<00:02:08.860> a

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
relationship to each other okay so a

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.250 
relationship to each other okay so a
basic<00:02:10.060> carpenter<00:02:10.479> square<00:02:10.599> and<00:02:10.989> we're<00:02:11.140> going

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
basic carpenter square and we're going

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.140 
basic carpenter square and we're going
to<00:02:11.290> set<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.920> we're<00:02:12.489> going<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.670> use<00:02:12.760> it<00:02:12.970> as<00:02:13.090> a

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
to set it and we're going to use it as a

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.259 
to set it and we're going to use it as a
depth<00:02:13.720> gauge<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.950> we<00:02:15.010> place<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.400> here<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.760> it's

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
depth gauge so we place it here and it's

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.699 
depth gauge so we place it here and it's
just<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.510> matter<00:02:16.659> of<00:02:16.870> simply<00:02:17.170> adjusting<00:02:17.590> the

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
just a matter of simply adjusting the

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.030 
just a matter of simply adjusting the
nut<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:18.790> where<00:02:18.879> it<00:02:18.939> touches<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.390> ruler

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
nut to where it touches the ruler

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.400 
nut to where it touches the ruler
locking<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.129> bottom<00:02:21.459> in<00:02:21.670> place

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
locking the bottom in place

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.800 
locking the bottom in place
and<00:02:23.550> making<00:02:24.550> sure<00:02:24.700> that<00:02:24.850> all<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.390> feet<00:02:25.600> are

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
and making sure that all of the feet are

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.380 
and making sure that all of the feet are
set<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.440> same<00:02:26.650> way<00:02:26.890> so<00:02:27.610> we<00:02:27.730> know<00:02:27.880> that<00:02:27.910> the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
set the same way so we know that the

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.140 
set the same way so we know that the
base<00:02:28.570> is<00:02:28.600> at<00:02:28.900> least<00:02:29.080> initially<00:02:29.380> flat<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.520> then

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
base is at least initially flat and then

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.060 
base is at least initially flat and then
from<00:02:31.390> there<00:02:31.690> we're<00:02:32.230> going<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.410> look<00:02:32.560> at<00:02:32.710> the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
from there we're going to look at the

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.010 
from there we're going to look at the
floor<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.610> make<00:02:34.090> adjustments<00:02:34.240> based<00:02:34.780> on<00:02:34.960> the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
floor and make adjustments based on the

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.390 
floor and make adjustments based on the
floor<00:02:36.660> ok<00:02:37.660> so<00:02:37.720> basically<00:02:38.020> now<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.070> we've<00:02:39.190> got

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
floor ok so basically now that we've got

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.510 
floor ok so basically now that we've got
the<00:02:39.640> main<00:02:39.850> shaft<00:02:40.180> fairly<00:02:40.900> level<00:02:41.400> we're<00:02:42.400> going

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
the main shaft fairly level we're going

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.640 
the main shaft fairly level we're going
to<00:02:42.610> want<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.820> be<00:02:43.420> able<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.720> have<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.870> very<00:02:44.080> finite

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
to want to be able to have a very finite

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.800 
to want to be able to have a very finite
adjustment<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:45.760> if<00:02:45.910> we<00:02:46.030> look<00:02:46.210> at<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.420> bubbl

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
adjustment so if we look at the bubbl

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.710 
adjustment so if we look at the bubbl
it's<00:02:47.290> not<00:02:48.160> quite<00:02:48.490> close<00:02:48.940> enough<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.510> line

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
it's not quite close enough to the line

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.990 
it's not quite close enough to the line
to<00:02:49.960> be<00:02:50.080> able<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.320> tell<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.710> variance<00:02:51.190> so<00:02:51.880> we

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
to be able to tell the variance so we

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.480 
to be able to tell the variance so we
take<00:02:52.180> basically<00:02:52.750> some<00:02:53.050> shim<00:02:53.320> stock<00:02:53.560> standard

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
take basically some shim stock standard

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.970 
take basically some shim stock standard
shims<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.570> we<00:02:55.690> slip<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.050> a<00:02:56.140> little<00:02:56.410> under<00:02:56.860> the

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
shims and we slip it a little under the

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.410 
shims and we slip it a little under the
level<00:02:57.190> like<00:02:58.180> this<00:02:59.580> until<00:03:00.580> we<00:03:00.700> raise<00:03:00.850> it<00:03:01.060> up<00:03:01.150> to

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
level like this until we raise it up to

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.420 
level like this until we raise it up to
where<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.750> bubble<00:03:02.050> just<00:03:02.410> barely<00:03:02.770> touches<00:03:03.280> the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
where the bubble just barely touches the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.100 
where the bubble just barely touches the
line<00:03:03.610> and<00:03:03.940> that<00:03:04.240> will<00:03:04.390> give<00:03:04.570> us<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.870> ability

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
line and that will give us the ability

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.800 
line and that will give us the ability
like<00:03:05.470> in<00:03:05.680> but<00:03:05.920> registration<00:03:06.610> of<00:03:06.730> printing<00:03:07.150> how

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
like in but registration of printing how

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.570 
like in but registration of printing how
close<00:03:08.230> we<00:03:08.440> are<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.860> how<00:03:08.980> much<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.310> bubble

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
close we are and how much the bubble

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.640 
close we are and how much the bubble
might<00:03:09.760> be<00:03:09.910> moving<00:03:10.270> slightly<00:03:10.660> off<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.470> line

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
might be moving slightly off the line

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.900 
might be moving slightly off the line
which<00:03:11.950> will<00:03:12.100> give<00:03:12.220> us<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.400> very<00:03:12.610> finite

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
which will give us a very finite

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.800 
which will give us a very finite
adjustment<00:03:14.610> okay<00:03:15.610> so<00:03:15.670> basically<00:03:15.970> when<00:03:16.780> you

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
adjustment okay so basically when you

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.630 
adjustment okay so basically when you
tighten<00:03:17.170> this<00:03:17.410> just<00:03:17.950> make<00:03:18.100> sure<00:03:18.280> that<00:03:18.400> you<00:03:18.520> get

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
tighten this just make sure that you get

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.480 
tighten this just make sure that you get
these<00:03:18.820> extremely<00:03:19.500> tight<00:03:20.500> because<00:03:21.310> any

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
these extremely tight because any

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.730 
these extremely tight because any
vibration<00:03:22.180> from<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.390> machine<00:03:22.810> can<00:03:23.500> cause

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
vibration from the machine can cause

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.860 
vibration from the machine can cause
them<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.100> loosen<00:03:24.280> up<00:03:27.210> we're<00:03:28.210> here<00:03:28.390> working<00:03:28.750> on

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
them to loosen up we're here working on

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.830 
them to loosen up we're here working on

a<00:03:35.200> squeegee<00:03:35.560> and<00:03:35.920> a<00:03:36.070> flood<00:03:36.340> bar<00:03:36.580> out<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:37.030> I

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
a squeegee and a flood bar out and I

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.410 
a squeegee and a flood bar out and I
want<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.870> explain<00:03:38.320> how<00:03:38.830> critical<00:03:39.430> what<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:40.120> call

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
want to explain how critical what I call

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.660 
want to explain how critical what I call
head<00:03:40.690> linear<00:03:41.110> is<00:03:41.350> and<00:03:41.860> what<00:03:41.980> head<00:03:42.160> linear<00:03:42.490> is

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
head linear is and what head linear is

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.600 
head linear is and what head linear is
is<00:03:42.880> this<00:03:43.060> travel<00:03:43.720> of<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.710> actual<00:03:45.100> printhead

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
is this travel of the actual printhead

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.870 
is this travel of the actual printhead
back<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.090> forth<00:03:46.360> so<00:03:47.110> as<00:03:47.410> as<00:03:48.130> you<00:03:48.520> flood<00:03:48.850> the

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
back and forth so as as you flood the

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.900 
back and forth so as as you flood the
ink<00:03:49.240> and<00:03:49.620> then<00:03:50.620> on<00:03:50.770> top<00:03:50.980> of<00:03:51.160> that<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.610> squeegee

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
ink and then on top of that the squeegee

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.660 
ink and then on top of that the squeegee
comes<00:03:52.209> along<00:03:52.600> and<00:03:52.900> actually<00:03:53.800> prints<00:03:54.160> the

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
comes along and actually prints the

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.090 
comes along and actually prints the
screen<00:03:54.970> now<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.870> path<00:03:56.260> in<00:03:56.620> which<00:03:56.680> the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
screen now the path in which the

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.530 
screen now the path in which the
squeegee<00:03:57.910> is<00:03:58.030> traveling<00:03:58.750> is<00:03:58.930> very<00:03:59.740> critical

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
squeegee is traveling is very critical

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.150 
squeegee is traveling is very critical
but<00:04:01.540> this<00:04:01.810> path<00:04:02.170> is<00:04:02.470> not<00:04:02.500> something<00:04:03.070> the

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
but this path is not something the

but this path is not something the
operator<00:04:03.670> can<00:04:03.880> adjust<00:04:04.140> so<00:04:05.140> during<00:04:05.500> a<00:04:05.620> proper

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
operator can adjust so during a proper

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.420 
operator can adjust so during a proper
installation<00:04:06.580> we<00:04:07.390> have<00:04:07.420> to<00:04:07.690> make<00:04:07.900> sure<00:04:08.140> that

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
installation we have to make sure that

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.730 
installation we have to make sure that
every<00:04:09.430> printhead<00:04:09.970> is<00:04:10.150> at<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:10.630> same<00:04:10.900> angle<00:04:11.260> the

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
every printhead is at the same angle the

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.670 
every printhead is at the same angle the

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
relation to the main shaft and we're

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.400 
relation to the main shaft and we're
going<00:04:17.140> to<00:04:17.230> demonstrate<00:04:17.410> how<00:04:17.770> to<00:04:17.799> do<00:04:18.010> that<00:04:18.160> next
