 hi friends of 3 rain review we are in 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.530
 yesterday in the provisioning of 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.470
 italy the first refreshment 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.470
 Italian that you can get assistance 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.390
 with sergio gimeno sergio good word 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.820
 night as you can guess 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.610
 Sergio is part of the Luis team 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.920
 Alberto and we want you to explain a 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.130
 little what is all this menu that you have 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.660
 prepared here for luÃ­s good well in 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.970
 first place to eat here a little 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.290
 sitting a bit standing still something salty 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.910
 because it takes many hours of racing 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.460
 eating at best jeresey bars 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.190
 sweet and wanted to keep what more 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.500
 he likes almost to eat is tortilla 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.260
 potato as a sandwich or skewer tortilla 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.780
 of potato and a little white macaroon 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.670
 with oil if you want to ask before and 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.170
 if it would crack me all the sandwich 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.469
 He said that maybe if he gets married, 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.230
 It's good that in the race you never know what 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.140
 better arrives and does not feel like it and does not eat and 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.070
 eat potatoes chips 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.409
 you just want to eat with wine the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.760
 sandwich is normal bimbo bread with 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:18.430
 cheese and quince that normally 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:22.570
 we put and as not the cut that also 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.729
 is fixed and amateur is worth after I see 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.640
 that you already have as things more for 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:30.840
 take away then to take we have 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.240
 another two mini- tanguillos de sallado de 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.390
 ham with cheese cape with cheese 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.060
 Quince with cheese so that they are few 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.310
 next and then good then typical the 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.740
 gels groups to some bar of 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.880
 protein for because it already takes many 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:52.899
 hours and you are combined the typical figs 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.250
 that I also like and apricots that 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.140
 change 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.050
 I see here that you have as a kind of 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.130
 pack of ice sees good this is in case 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.220
 feel 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.750
 then just change shoes because 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.210
 if you sit down to change sneaker I'll 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.640
 I put here and cool amount you put it 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.090
 nothing is that then here in the neck not in 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.489
 momentary to cool down 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.030
 you tell us before you have not run with 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:20.010
 boost because it has had some chafing of 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.260
 last minute if you have not wanted to risk 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.640
 exactly in the last intern what 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.849
 long he did to come here 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.620
 They have gotten some chafing and have 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.510
 preferred many hours and preferred 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.280
 secure because yes we have seen it 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.319
 run with bush for example in norway 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.060
 with the ran with him and yes yes yes he runs 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.890
 with games and there has been selling ando 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:46.850
 with bush all month of August but expensive 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.790
 I told him about the topic, last training lengthened 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.630
 Measures chafing and has scared us 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.790
 risk 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.730
 then before I asked you if I 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.300
 changed is the clock by the battery and 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.300
 good 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:07.230
 in principle not because it takes point 3 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.069
 peek and should reach this goal just 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:14.180
 but should arrive what happens that 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:17.810
 in contamine he told us that he was 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.340
 measuring wrong that gave him more errors in 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.930
 some piece maybe to why he pointed 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.510
 it is and we will change we will 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.840
 put 1.3 is by normal we go normal is 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.239
 the three worst by louis does not run with 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.879
 tape usually does not run with tape 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:35.120
 heart rate monitor is only to carry the track 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:38.019
 and kilometers and altitude and all how much 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.549
 time do you think louis will be here 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.159
 you depend on changing shoes more here 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.200
 we also have anti anti ruber cream 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.659
 rubs yes I know that if you change 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.150
 sneakers then a couple of minutes but 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:52.040
 just a couple of minutes here if they continue 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.810
 a couple of minutes you're going to make the 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.550
 sneakers while at the same time going 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.700
 eating something and loading 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.610
 water and things to carry and we change 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.550
 the front also and by the battery this 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.890
 yes yes to also ensure that the 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.240
 battery last after last already 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.880
 I say that the drums you have them as 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.239
 marked each one if I have done 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:20.739
 left because it was this one has water 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:22.750
 normal because we do not use isotonic 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.790
 for these long runs for the 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.670
 made of digital stomach stir 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.160
 uses salts of said being and this is 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.410
 recovery this you are the shake of 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.430
 typical recovery with some protein and 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.500
 so that it helps to recover a little 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.200
 muscularly with sergio then many 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.000
 thank you was teaching to teach us what is 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.670
 what the menu has prepared for today 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.710
 for for louis although there's a lot 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:54.360
 and we hope you can then 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:57.629
 explain live when louis comes 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:01.370
 they get pregnant everything they have here does not 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:01.370
 thank you friends until next time
