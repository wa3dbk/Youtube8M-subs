00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
every week we release a build of

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.379 
every week we release a build of
overgrowth<00:00:02.250> for<00:00:02.490> everyone<00:00:02.760> who<00:00:02.850> pre-ordered

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
overgrowth for everyone who pre-ordered

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.480 
overgrowth for everyone who pre-ordered
and<00:00:03.629> now<00:00:04.170> I'm<00:00:04.290> trying<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.650> make<00:00:04.890> weekly<00:00:05.370> videos

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
and now I'm trying to make weekly videos

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.450 
and now I'm trying to make weekly videos
to<00:00:06.299> demonstrate<00:00:06.420> new<00:00:06.899> features<00:00:07.309> the<00:00:08.309> first

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
to demonstrate new features the first

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.459 
to demonstrate new features the first
new<00:00:08.700> feature<00:00:08.730> this<00:00:09.120> week<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.570> accurate<00:00:10.230> shadow

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
new feature this week is accurate shadow

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.470 
new feature this week is accurate shadow
coloring<00:00:10.950> here<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:11.880> may<00:00:12.000> look<00:00:12.210> like<00:00:12.330> the

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
coloring here it may look like the

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.379 
coloring here it may look like the
shadow<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.840> gray<00:00:13.080> but<00:00:13.830> it's<00:00:14.730> really<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.059> sort<00:00:15.330> of

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
shadow is gray but it's really a sort of

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.180 
shadow is gray but it's really a sort of
dark<00:00:15.660> blue<00:00:15.929> because<00:00:16.289> it's<00:00:16.590> lit<00:00:16.770> by<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.949> blue

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
dark blue because it's lit by the blue

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.950 
dark blue because it's lit by the blue
sky<00:00:17.460> here's<00:00:18.150> how<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.449> looks<00:00:18.660> when<00:00:18.810> it's

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
sky here's how it looks when it's

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.220 
sky here's how it looks when it's
actually<00:00:19.350> great<00:00:22.970> and<00:00:23.970> here<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.510> again<00:00:25.050> with

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
actually great and here it is again with

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.450 
actually great and here it is again with
the<00:00:25.289> new<00:00:25.500> coloring<00:00:27.830> next<00:00:28.830> up<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.189> have<00:00:29.310> some

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
the new coloring next up we have some

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.560 
the new coloring next up we have some
new<00:00:29.609> particle<00:00:30.060> effects<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.800> jump<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:31.949> slide<00:00:32.570> or

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
new particle effects I jump in slide or

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.560 
new particle effects I jump in slide or
fall<00:00:33.840> over<00:00:37.430> then<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.520> kick<00:00:38.730> up<00:00:38.850> some<00:00:39.059> sand<00:00:39.329> or

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
fall over then I kick up some sand or

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.360 
fall over then I kick up some sand or
some<00:00:39.809> dirt<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.530> cracked<00:00:40.860> Mike

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
some dirt in this cracked Mike

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.080 
some dirt in this cracked Mike
depending<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.030> what<00:00:42.210> material<00:00:42.660> I'm<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:44.090> this

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
depending on what material I'm on this

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.479 
depending on what material I'm on this
effect<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.629> still<00:00:45.780> pretty<00:00:45.989> early<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.469> but<00:00:47.160> I

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
effect is still pretty early on but I

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.069 
effect is still pretty early on but I
think<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.879> helps<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.270> materials<00:00:48.870> read

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
think it helps that the materials read

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.500 
think it helps that the materials read
better<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:49.590> now<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.950> also<00:00:50.399> added<00:00:50.730> some<00:00:50.879> decal

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
better for now I also added some decal

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.569 
better for now I also added some decal
material<00:00:52.170> effects<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:52.980> they're<00:00:53.129> disabled

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
material effects but they're disabled

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.600 
material effects but they're disabled
for<00:00:53.730> now<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.620> can<00:00:55.620> enable<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.070> pretty<00:00:56.250> easily<00:00:56.370> in

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
for now I can enable it pretty easily in

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:05.679 
for now I can enable it pretty easily in
the<00:00:56.699> script<00:00:56.940> here<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.239> show<00:00:57.390> you

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.690 

so<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.320> material<00:01:06.770> decals<00:01:07.159> let<00:01:07.429> me<00:01:07.520> leave

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
so the material decals let me leave

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.149 
so the material decals let me leave
marks<00:01:08.030> in<00:01:08.359> soft<00:01:08.600> surfaces<00:01:09.109> like<00:01:09.619> on<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:09.920> dirt

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
marks in soft surfaces like on the dirt

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.179 
marks in soft surfaces like on the dirt
here<00:01:10.460> or<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:11.030> sand<00:01:11.630> I'll<00:01:12.619> have<00:01:12.799> to<00:01:12.920> do<00:01:13.009> more

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
here or the sand I'll have to do more

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.679 
here or the sand I'll have to do more
work<00:01:13.369> though<00:01:13.579> before<00:01:13.819> it's<00:01:14.090> fast<00:01:14.270> enough<00:01:14.420> to

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
work though before it's fast enough to

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.620 
work though before it's fast enough to
be<00:01:14.810> really<00:01:15.079> practical<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:16.210> I'd<00:01:17.210> like<00:01:17.390> to<00:01:17.509> get

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
be really practical and I'd like to get

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.149 
be really practical and I'd like to get
more<00:01:17.810> of<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:18.020> gameplay<00:01:18.439> working<00:01:18.829> before<00:01:19.130> I

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
more of the gameplay working before I

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.800 
more of the gameplay working before I
spend<00:01:19.429> too<00:01:19.520> much<00:01:19.640> time<00:01:19.700> on<00:01:20.299> these<00:01:20.479> kinds<00:01:20.749> of

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
spend too much time on these kinds of

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.709 
spend too much time on these kinds of
details<00:01:21.170> to<00:01:21.700> make<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.850> particle<00:01:23.270> effects<00:01:23.600> for

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
details to make the particle effects for

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.139 
details to make the particle effects for
the<00:01:23.840> ground<00:01:24.079> I<00:01:24.380> created<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:24.890> new<00:01:24.920> particle<00:01:25.579> XML

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
the ground I created a new particle XML

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.419 
the ground I created a new particle XML
file<00:01:26.390> system<00:01:26.869> this<00:01:27.649> lets<00:01:27.859> me<00:01:28.009> change<00:01:28.189> the

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
file system this lets me change the

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:30.880 
file system this lets me change the
particle<00:01:28.819> parameters<00:01:29.299> in<00:01:29.509> real<00:01:29.630> time<00:01:29.899> so<00:01:30.560> I

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
particle parameters in real time so I

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.620 
particle parameters in real time so I
can<00:01:31.490> pretty<00:01:31.609> easily<00:01:31.849> combine<00:01:32.299> it<00:01:32.450> with<00:01:32.479> the

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
can pretty easily combine it with the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.480 
can pretty easily combine it with the
scripting<00:01:33.049> to<00:01:33.319> show<00:01:33.740> off<00:01:33.890> all<00:01:34.099> the<00:01:34.189> different

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
scripting to show off all the different

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.980 
scripting to show off all the different
kinds<00:01:34.729> of<00:01:34.759> particles<00:01:35.030> we<00:01:35.329> have<00:01:35.450> here<00:01:35.689> and

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
kinds of particles we have here and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.660 
kinds of particles we have here and
change<00:01:36.709> their<00:01:36.920> parameters<00:01:37.340> around<00:01:39.489> so<00:01:40.489> here's

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
change their parameters around so here's

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.059 
change their parameters around so here's
a<00:01:40.759> basic<00:01:41.000> spark<00:01:41.719> effect<00:01:42.140> so<00:01:42.709> this<00:01:42.829> head<00:01:42.950> is

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
a basic spark effect so this head is

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.089 
a basic spark effect so this head is
sparkling<00:01:43.520> I<00:01:43.729> can<00:01:44.329> go<00:01:44.420> in<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:44.629> spark<00:01:44.929> XML<00:01:45.799> file

00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:46.099 
sparkling I can go in the spark XML file

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:47.889 
sparkling I can go in the spark XML file
and<00:01:46.429> change<00:01:46.849> different<00:01:47.060> parameters<00:01:47.629> like

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
and change different parameters like

00:01:47.899 --> 00:02:04.560 
and change different parameters like
change<00:01:48.140> its<00:01:48.289> color<00:01:48.530> or<00:01:55.539> its<00:01:56.539> size

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.290 

it<00:02:05.290> can<00:02:05.409> also<00:02:05.560> add<00:02:05.770> various<00:02:06.100> wind<00:02:06.340> effects<00:02:06.820> so

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
it can also add various wind effects so

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.060 
it can also add various wind effects so
it's<00:02:07.420> affected<00:02:07.810> by<00:02:07.990> different<00:02:08.800> kinds<00:02:09.009> of

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
it's affected by different kinds of

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:16.740 
it's affected by different kinds of
noise<00:02:09.250> in<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.580> air<00:02:09.929> direction<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:16.480> can<00:02:16.630> also

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
noise in the air direction it can also

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.870 
noise in the air direction it can also
affect<00:02:16.959> how<00:02:17.200> its<00:02:17.440> size<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:18.040> opacity<00:02:18.280> and

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
affect how its size and opacity and

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.370 
affect how its size and opacity and
various<00:02:19.120> other<00:02:19.270> parameters<00:02:19.450> change<00:02:20.050> over

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
various other parameters change over

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.320 
various other parameters change over
time<00:02:23.459> so<00:02:24.459> here<00:02:24.610> they<00:02:24.700> start<00:02:24.940> out<00:02:25.030> small<00:02:25.090> and

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
time so here they start out small and

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.780 
time so here they start out small and
get<00:02:25.540> bigger

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.360 

so<00:02:32.330> now<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:32.510> have<00:02:32.659> sort<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:32.959> a<00:02:33.049> weird

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
so now I have sort of a weird

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.569 
so now I have sort of a weird
Ghostbusters<00:02:34.370> kind<00:02:34.580> of<00:02:34.640> effect<00:02:36.040> anyway<00:02:37.040> back

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
Ghostbusters kind of effect anyway back

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.130 
Ghostbusters kind of effect anyway back
to<00:02:37.790> more<00:02:38.000> normal<00:02:38.239> effects

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
to more normal effects

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.750 
to more normal effects
I'll<00:02:39.319> show<00:02:39.560> off<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.829> different<00:02:40.129> presets<00:02:40.640> I

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
I'll show off the different presets I

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:53.180 
I'll show off the different presets I
have<00:02:40.909> so<00:02:41.299> here<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.569> smoke<00:02:41.870> effect

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:00.059 

this<00:02:54.190> is<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.610> sand<00:02:55.300> effect<00:02:58.769> this<00:02:59.769> is<00:02:59.860> what<00:02:59.980> you

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
this is the sand effect this is what you

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.880 
this is the sand effect this is what you
kick<00:03:00.250> up<00:03:00.430> when<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:00.730> run<00:03:01.180> around<00:03:01.300> on<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:01.660> sand

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
kick up when you run around on the sand

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:12.119 
kick up when you run around on the sand
let's<00:03:02.890> slide<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.860> dirt<00:03:09.099> effects<00:03:10.890> from<00:03:11.890> meat

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
let's slide the dirt effects from meat

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:21.309 
let's slide the dirt effects from meat
bunny<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.459> had<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.700> flood<00:03:13.330> effect

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.199 

I<00:03:21.349> think<00:03:22.129> that's<00:03:22.280> enough<00:03:22.459> particles<00:03:22.939> for<00:03:23.090> now

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
I think that's enough particles for now

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.780 
I think that's enough particles for now
else<00:03:23.959> I<00:03:24.140> did<00:03:24.319> some<00:03:24.439> new<00:03:24.590> sound<00:03:24.829> effects<00:03:25.310> like

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
else I did some new sound effects like

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.899 
else I did some new sound effects like
the<00:03:25.969> clothing<00:03:26.209> sounds<00:03:30.489> this<00:03:31.489> helped<00:03:31.730> tied

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:31.909 
the clothing sounds this helped tied

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.099 
the clothing sounds this helped tied
together<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.329> sounds<00:03:32.750> of<00:03:32.810> different

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
together the sounds of different

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.720 
together the sounds of different
surfaces<00:03:33.500> because<00:03:34.159> even<00:03:34.430> my<00:03:34.549> name<00:03:34.700> is

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
surfaces because even my name is

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.780 
surfaces because even my name is
footsteps<00:03:35.209> change<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:37.280> movement<00:03:37.640> of<00:03:37.700> his

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
footsteps change the movement of his

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.640 
footsteps change the movement of his
clothes<00:03:38.120> stays<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:39.109> same

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
clothes stays the same

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.589 
clothes stays the same
he<00:03:40.159> also<00:03:40.250> has<00:03:40.489> new<00:03:40.609> sounds<00:03:40.970> for<00:03:41.120> following<00:03:41.480> on

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
he also has new sounds for following on

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:48.120 
he also has new sounds for following on
different<00:03:41.900> surfaces

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.680 

so<00:03:49.130> he<00:03:49.250> falls<00:03:49.430> in<00:03:49.640> the<00:03:49.760> dirt<00:03:49.970> it<00:03:50.360> sounds

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
so he falls in the dirt it sounds

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.470 
so he falls in the dirt it sounds
different<00:03:50.870> than<00:03:51.170> when<00:03:51.290> he<00:03:51.350> falls<00:03:51.560> on<00:03:51.740> the<00:03:51.830> sand

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
different than when he falls on the sand

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.790 
different than when he falls on the sand
the<00:03:53.480> biggest<00:03:53.780> new<00:03:53.900> gameplay<00:03:54.319> feature<00:03:54.560> is

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
the biggest new gameplay feature is

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.150 
the biggest new gameplay feature is
active<00:03:55.220> blocking<00:03:56.470> you<00:03:57.470> always<00:03:57.709> have<00:03:57.890> sort<00:03:58.100> of

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
active blocking you always have sort of

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.340 
active blocking you always have sort of
a<00:03:58.250> passive<00:03:58.459> block<00:03:58.910> if<00:03:59.840> you're<00:03:59.990> just<00:04:00.140> standing

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
a passive block if you're just standing

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.810 
a passive block if you're just standing
still<00:04:03.459> except<00:04:04.459> for<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:04.670> first<00:04:04.850> couple<00:04:05.060> hits

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
still except for the first couple hits

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.220 
still except for the first couple hits
he'll<00:04:07.820> just<00:04:07.970> get<00:04:08.090> staggered<00:04:08.600> instead<00:04:09.140> of

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
he'll just get staggered instead of

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.030 
he'll just get staggered instead of
getting<00:04:09.470> knocked<00:04:09.620> over<00:04:09.950> it<00:04:11.530> if<00:04:12.530> you<00:04:12.709> press<00:04:12.920> the

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
getting knocked over it if you press the

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.229 
getting knocked over it if you press the
right<00:04:13.160> mouse<00:04:13.220> button<00:04:13.400> at<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:13.940> right<00:04:14.060> time

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
right mouse button at the right time

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.780 
right mouse button at the right time
then<00:04:14.480> you<00:04:14.570> do<00:04:14.690> an<00:04:14.810> act<00:04:14.989> in<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.230> back<00:04:15.640> just<00:04:16.640> like

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
then you do an act in the back just like

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:32.710 
then you do an act in the back just like
this<00:04:30.490> the<00:04:31.490> active<00:04:31.760> block<00:04:31.940> stuns<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.510> attack

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
this the active block stuns the attack

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.420 
this the active block stuns the attack
is<00:04:32.930> slightly<00:04:33.169> picking<00:04:33.860> them<00:04:33.980> up<00:04:34.070> into<00:04:34.280> a

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
is slightly picking them up into a

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:54.670 
is slightly picking them up into a
counter-attack<00:04:53.110> so<00:04:54.110> that's<00:04:54.290> about<00:04:54.440> it<00:04:54.560> for

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
counter-attack so that's about it for

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.860 
counter-attack so that's about it for
this<00:04:54.919> alpha<00:04:55.310> I<00:04:55.520> should<00:04:56.180> have<00:04:56.270> another<00:04:56.479> video

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
this alpha I should have another video

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.740 
this alpha I should have another video
for<00:04:56.930> you<00:04:57.140> next<00:04:57.500> week
