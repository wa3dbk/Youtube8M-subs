Liverpool I've got my doubts regarding
Barry<00:00:20.369> Bannan<00:00:21.590> because<00:00:22.590> it's<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.920> growing<00:00:23.160> and

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
Barry Bannan because it's a growing and

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
third will be more clinical and he also

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.619 
third will be more clinical and he also
needs<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.350> eradicate<00:00:50.010> some<00:00:50.300> stupid<00:00:51.300> errors

improving in terms of passing and
movement<00:00:58.430> preparation<00:01:01.550> but<00:01:02.550> there's<00:01:02.760> some

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
areas obviously what we have to keep

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.910 
areas obviously what we have to keep
improving<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:06.140> mean<00:01:07.140> obviously<00:01:07.560> we've<00:01:07.770> been

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
improving I mean obviously we've been

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.850 
improving I mean obviously we've been
hit<00:01:08.130> by<00:01:08.369> injuries<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.720> sickness<00:01:09.930> even<00:01:10.619> and

complain i mean that's would say you
know<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.290> happens<00:01:20.570> all<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.689> have<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.049> do<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.320> to

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
know it happens all you have to do is to

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.840 
know it happens all you have to do is to
work<00:01:22.680> harder<00:01:23.240> get<00:01:24.240> together<00:01:24.950> maybe<00:01:25.950> stick

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
work harder get together maybe stick

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.690 
work harder get together maybe stick
together<00:01:27.320> have<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.380> mentality<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:29.100> window<00:01:29.520> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
together have a mentality of window and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.789 
together have a mentality of window and
say<00:01:30.000> well<00:01:30.210> we<00:01:30.600> don't<00:01:30.750> give<00:01:30.990> up<00:01:31.140> when<00:01:31.530> we<00:01:31.710> know

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
say well we don't give up when we know

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.140 
say well we don't give up when we know
it's<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.189> difficult<00:01:32.610> time<00:01:34.280> we<00:01:35.280> are<00:01:35.369> with<00:01:35.610> 17

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
it's a difficult time we are with 17

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.350 
it's a difficult time we are with 17
points<00:01:36.979> maybe<00:01:37.979> three<00:01:38.430> or<00:01:38.460> five<00:01:38.759> points<00:01:39.030> more

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
points maybe three or five points more

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.010 
points maybe three or five points more
will<00:01:39.630> be<00:01:39.799> practically<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.920> near<00:01:41.280> europe<00:01:41.579> and

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
will be practically a near europe and

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.420 
will be practically a near europe and
three<00:01:43.020> points<00:01:43.439> less<00:01:43.649> would<00:01:43.920> be<00:01:43.950> impractical

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
three points less would be impractical

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.120 
three points less would be impractical
in<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.939> relegation<00:01:45.210> zone<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.890> very

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
in the relegation zone so it's very

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.039 
in the relegation zone so it's very
compact<00:01:47.670> very<00:01:47.820> tight<00:01:48.290> all<00:01:49.290> i<00:01:49.350> know<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:51.049> we

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
compact very tight all i know is that we

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.080 
compact very tight all i know is that we
could<00:01:52.200> have<00:01:52.320> done<00:01:52.439> better<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:53.490> terms<00:01:53.909> of

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
could have done better in terms of

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.899 
could have done better in terms of
points<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.720> we<00:01:55.140> should<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.729> not

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
points and we should be and this is not

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.600 
points and we should be and this is not
something<00:01:57.420> which<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.229> an<00:01:58.350> insult<00:01:58.710> or<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.430> take

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
something which is an insult or to take

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.510 
something which is an insult or to take
any<00:02:00.030> credit<00:02:00.360> from<00:02:00.890> permanent<00:02:01.890> but<00:02:02.009> i<00:02:02.159> think<00:02:02.399> we

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
any credit from permanent but i think we

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.240 
any credit from permanent but i think we
should<00:02:02.700> be<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.030> semi-final<00:02:03.829> I<00:02:04.829> wouldn't

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
should be in the semi-final I wouldn't

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.310 
should be in the semi-final I wouldn't
say<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.729> changing<00:02:06.360> room<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.600> quiet<00:02:06.930> i

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
say that the changing room is quiet i

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.020 
say that the changing room is quiet i
would<00:02:07.890> say<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.390> for<00:02:09.390> them<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.690> change

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
would say that for them is to change

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.020 
would say that for them is to change
and<00:02:11.180> I<00:02:11.300> assume<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:12.250> because<00:02:13.250> we<00:02:13.550> change<00:02:13.819> the

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
and I assume that because we change the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.710 
and I assume that because we change the
mentality<00:02:14.180> we<00:02:14.840> change<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:16.060> probably<00:02:17.060> the

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
mentality we change the probably the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.470 
mentality we change the probably the
work<00:02:17.959> ethic<00:02:18.170> that<00:02:18.620> we<00:02:18.770> want<00:02:19.040> we<00:02:19.310> change<00:02:20.180> tell

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
work ethic that we want we change tell

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.949 
work ethic that we want we change tell
the<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.470> football<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.490> we<00:02:22.640> want<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.940> play<00:02:23.150> as

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
the the football that we want to play as

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.229 
the the football that we want to play as
many<00:02:24.319> changes<00:02:25.720> maybe<00:02:27.760> that's<00:02:28.760> why<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.000> have

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
many changes maybe that's why you have

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.470 
many changes maybe that's why you have
to<00:02:29.360> be<00:02:29.390> patient<00:02:30.020> and<00:02:30.410> indulgent<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.480> listen

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
to be patient and indulgent and listen

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.520 
to be patient and indulgent and listen
to<00:02:32.600> your<00:02:32.690> plans<00:02:32.959> I<00:02:33.520> know<00:02:34.520> where<00:02:34.850> we're<00:02:35.030> going

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
to your plans I know where we're going

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.420 
to your plans I know where we're going
and<00:02:36.530> I'm<00:02:37.280> not<00:02:37.550> going<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:38.030> go<00:02:38.180> back<00:02:38.390> I<00:02:39.400> know<00:02:40.400> that

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
and I'm not going to go back I know that

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.509 
and I'm not going to go back I know that
I<00:02:40.850> mean<00:02:41.540> don't<00:02:41.720> expect<00:02:42.260> me<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:43.190> go<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.489> other

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
I mean don't expect me to go the other

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.720 
I mean don't expect me to go the other
