00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.569 
a smooth consistency similar to a powder
we're<00:02:15.659> going<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.019> add<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.439> yogurt<00:02:16.859> to<00:02:17.069> the

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
we're going to add the yogurt to the

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.849 
we're going to add the yogurt to the
meat<00:02:17.879> that's<00:02:18.060> been<00:02:18.180> marinating<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.200> now

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859 
meat that's been marinating and now

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.649 
meat that's been marinating and now
we're<00:02:20.040> going<00:02:20.189> to<00:02:20.310> add<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.670> garam<00:02:20.819> masala<00:02:21.329> and

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
garlic as well and we're going to rub it

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.360 
garlic as well and we're going to rub it
into<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.390> meat<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.930> we're<00:02:28.650> going<00:02:28.859> to<00:02:28.920> just

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
into the meat and we're going to just

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.940 
into the meat and we're going to just
leave<00:02:29.700> it<00:02:29.730> overnight<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.019> can<00:02:31.200> marinate

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
leave it overnight so it can marinate

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.339 
leave it overnight so it can marinate
so<00:02:32.400> our<00:02:32.519> meat<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:32.849> now<00:02:33.030> marinated<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.989> now

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
so our meat is now marinated and now

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.410 
so our meat is now marinated and now
we're<00:02:34.500> going<00:02:34.739> to<00:02:34.890> slice<00:02:35.129> it<00:02:35.159> it's<00:02:36.030> better<00:02:36.269> if

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
we're going to slice it it's better if

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.720 
we're going to slice it it's better if
you<00:02:36.569> do<00:02:36.720> this<00:02:36.900> step<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.739> slicing<00:02:38.159> step<00:02:38.430> before

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
you do this step the slicing step before

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.629 
you do this step the slicing step before
you<00:02:39.180> add<00:02:39.510> all<00:02:39.689> the<00:02:39.840> spices<00:02:40.040> but<00:02:41.040> our<00:02:41.280> initial

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
you add all the spices but our initial

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.030 
you add all the spices but our initial
plan<00:02:42.030> was<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.299> just<00:02:42.540> cook<00:02:43.049> the<00:02:43.230> whole<00:02:43.439> meat<00:02:43.739> but

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
plan was to just cook the whole meat but

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.649 
plan was to just cook the whole meat but
now<00:02:44.159> we've<00:02:44.340> decided<00:02:44.609> to<00:02:44.819> put<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.120> on<00:02:45.239> skewers

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
now we've decided to put it on skewers

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:46.789 
now we've decided to put it on skewers
as<00:02:45.840> thin<00:02:46.139> strips

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
as thin strips

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.339 
as thin strips
this<00:02:47.489> will<00:02:47.819> make<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.090> cook<00:02:48.450> faster<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.109> easier

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
this will make it cook faster and easier

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.490 
this will make it cook faster and easier
and<00:02:49.829> the<00:02:50.609> thinner<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:51.030> strip's<00:02:51.389> the<00:02:52.290> better

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
and the thinner the strip's the better

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.619 
and the thinner the strip's the better
and<00:02:52.829> we<00:02:53.189> want<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.459> loosely<00:02:53.849> put<00:02:54.150> them<00:02:54.329> on<00:02:54.510> the

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
and we want to loosely put them on the

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.360 
and we want to loosely put them on the
skewer<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.139> not<00:02:55.260> very<00:02:55.379> tightly<00:02:55.709> because<00:02:56.220> then

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
skewer and not very tightly because then

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.649 
skewer and not very tightly because then
the<00:02:56.489> outside<00:02:56.669> of<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.209> meat<00:02:57.329> will<00:02:57.510> be<00:02:57.629> cooked

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
the outside of the meat will be cooked

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.349 
the outside of the meat will be cooked
but<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.109> inside<00:02:58.500> won't<00:02:58.769> be<00:02:59.010> we<00:02:59.909> want<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.180> cook

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
but the inside won't be we want to cook

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.520 
but the inside won't be we want to cook
this<00:03:00.510> on<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.780> medium<00:03:01.439> heat<00:03:01.680> on<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:03.239> barbecue<00:03:03.780> we
