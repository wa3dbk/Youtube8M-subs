00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.640
 horse 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.559
 How are we, goodnight, inside? 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.200
 of this cultural space that is like a 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.809
 oasis within the banality of football 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.259
 that is lived in this program we are with 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:21.850
 the teacher the teacher the philosopher 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:24.439
 putting together master holes very good night 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.779
 young teacher we want that we 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.750
 I talked about your experiences in this 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.599
 world football what yes but I 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.559
 pay close attention 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.810
 tell me if the Bulgarians are so good 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.740
 for the stomach 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:46.090
 because they walking the Mexicans 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.090
 I wonder 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:56.630
 the small area is the daughter of the large area 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:59.810
 the wife of don hilario the engineer 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:03.680
 I also say no 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:06.560
 or tell me when a player is achieved 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:11.750
 remove the brand gets angry on their 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.930
 sponsors that fields that fields so 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.240
 wide you handle master but follow 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.190
 talking about the people who have 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.070
 seen outside the stadiums talk about it 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.160
 a little bit more of all kinds of people there 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.550
 people who only come to scream nonsense and 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.340
 but I have also found philosophers 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.010
 people with very advanced thoughts 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.910
 I even have trouble understanding 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.320
 I do not want you to come with me to see 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.590
 some testimonies that are recorded 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.840
 of people with those thoughts so 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.530
 wonderful company 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.090
 unfortunately in the selection it 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.090
 prepared how the preparation should be prepared 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.570
 and that's what failed or that the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.960
 selection had to be prepared as it should not 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.060
 have prepared 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.600
 he should not have prepared himself as he prepared 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.289
 but it is the premise again 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.880
 unfortunately in the selection it 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.140
 prepared how the preparation should be prepared 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.150
 Now I think we can understand what 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.760
 we ask because unfortunately the 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.270
 selection was prepared as it should have been 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.480
 prepared but let's keep hearing the 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.180
 premises of this great Mexican thinker 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.740
 the truth to lose is to lose or that is 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.120
 one thing that we have to analyze that 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:38.200
 debutantes clear yes we must 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.560
 analyze what losing is losing 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.970
 and when we understand this, life will be 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:50.379
 easier for us but there will be 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:53.730
 times that you lose to win or that 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.730
 win to lose 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.049
 lose is always lose now if you already 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.810
 it's very clear we continue with the 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.790
 next paper we have to be 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.620
 prepared if I lose if I win 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.750
 we have to be prepared in case 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.750
 I lose in case I win we have to be 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.500
 prepared if I lose if I win 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.960
 is the boor 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.000
 picture we are going to put in italy if we 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.180
 we all agree once was batista 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.240
 at the door but the problem is that we 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.490
 we all agreed as two 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.230
 boys in row 8 I do not know 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.800
 they agreed 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.900
 that's why we tied with italy but now 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:40.020
 let's go with another small paper 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.610
 Little girl is the conformist mentality 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.990
 little risky little you have to 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.990
 losing on the court do not have you 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:04:00.660
 Little girl, it's very clear to me, she said in 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.660
 penalties or not in penalties 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.950
 and is that the mentality is better 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:18.660
 Little girl, now I'm going to introduce you to a 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.660
 philosopher of the existentialist current 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:25.960
 and he let himself be carried away by another current and 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:31.600
 disappearance we see again in your 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:33.910
 last appearance the audience looks 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.150
 he clearly was not carried away by the 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.150
 current 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:44.849
 let's move on to the last premise this 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:49.609
 next thought dates from a beach 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:49.609
 Spanish beyond the sixties 

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:57.229
 Americus this is how a tear fell on 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:59.519
 the sand in the sand fell a tear 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.619
 let's see it again 

00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:05.119
 america of the covenant of change change it 

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:08.339
 Missed Mexico Mexico 

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:11.969
 america wonderful testimonies our 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:14.779
 because he talks to us about Hermosillo 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:14.779
 California 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:20.879
 teacher his philosophical appreciation about 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:24.360
 the penalties that were failed and of course 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:27.249
 yes but pay attention is important if 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:32.889
 maradona throws of wonder 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:36.219
 Bernal pulls the habit of asking me 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:40.979
 master your final comment about the 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:43.779
 Mexican national team as has already happened not 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:47.340
 happened they eliminated us and that has us very 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:47.340
 sad of an attack 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:56.050
 at a pace of people 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.050
