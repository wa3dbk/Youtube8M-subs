00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
side of the rack but anyway I used the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.510 
side of the rack but anyway I used the
other<00:00:48.420> board<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:48.930> had<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.920> repair<00:00:50.309> this

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
other board that I had to repair this

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.250 
other board that I had to repair this
unit<00:00:50.930> and<00:00:52.100> it<00:00:53.100> was<00:00:53.309> not<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.730> same<00:00:53.910> board<00:00:54.270> that

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
unit and it was not the same board that

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.860 
unit and it was not the same board that
is<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.219> one<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.360> made<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.750> work

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
is in that one but I made it work

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.010 
is in that one but I made it work
they're<00:00:58.350> pretty<00:00:58.680> close<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.719> one<00:01:00.930> though

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
they're pretty close the this one though

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.950 
they're pretty close the this one though
as<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.440> see<00:01:01.590> has<00:01:02.120> five<00:01:03.120> terminals<00:01:03.510> back

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
as you can see has five terminals back

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.810 
as you can see has five terminals back
there<00:01:04.229> I'm<00:01:04.799> not<00:01:05.100> sure<00:01:05.309> what<00:01:05.460> they<00:01:05.549> all<00:01:05.640> do

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
there I'm not sure what they all do

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.250 
there I'm not sure what they all do
because<00:01:06.119> they're<00:01:06.270> not<00:01:06.390> labeled<00:01:06.630> they're<00:01:07.049> just

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
because they're not labeled they're just

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.679 
because they're not labeled they're just
one<00:01:07.680> through<00:01:07.860> five<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.310> them<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:09.330> then<00:01:09.479> that

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
one through five on them and then that

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.359 
one through five on them and then that
when<00:01:09.869> there<00:01:10.049> only<00:01:10.170> has<00:01:10.380> three<00:01:10.680> terminals<00:01:11.159> so

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
when there only has three terminals so

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.630 
when there only has three terminals so
this<00:01:11.520> one<00:01:11.700> had<00:01:11.939> an<00:01:12.570> extra<00:01:12.900> plug<00:01:13.310> on<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.460> bad

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
this one had an extra plug on the bad

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.359 
this one had an extra plug on the bad
board<00:01:14.970> which<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:16.290> does<00:01:16.470> not<00:01:16.619> now<00:01:16.860> it's<00:01:17.159> just

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
board which it does not now it's just

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.580 
board which it does not now it's just
got<00:01:17.549> three<00:01:17.820> terminals<00:01:18.240> active<00:01:18.600> back<00:01:19.320> here

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
got three terminals active back here

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.859 
got three terminals active back here
your<00:01:19.770> regular<00:01:20.159> three<00:01:21.150> terminals<00:01:21.509> you'd<00:01:21.659> find

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
your regular three terminals you'd find

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.289 
your regular three terminals you'd find
in<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:21.990> back<00:01:22.170> when<00:01:22.320> opener<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.880> was<00:01:24.119> told

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
in the back when opener this I was told

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.240 
in the back when opener this I was told
by<00:01:24.420> my<00:01:24.450> boss<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:25.110> one<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.500> first<00:01:25.770> units

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
by my boss is one of the first units

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.609 
by my boss is one of the first units
that<00:01:26.369> had<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.729> board<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.930> from<00:01:28.110> Alistair

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
that had the board in it from Alistair

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.760 
that had the board in it from Alistair
so<00:01:29.610> whether<00:01:30.420> or<00:01:30.540> not<00:01:30.600> that's<00:01:30.780> right<00:01:31.079> couldn't

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
so whether or not that's right couldn't

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.140 
so whether or not that's right couldn't
tell<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.009> but<00:01:32.130> I'm<00:01:32.280> assuming<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.729> probably<00:01:33.060> is

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
tell you but I'm assuming it probably is

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.590 
tell you but I'm assuming it probably is
so<00:01:34.670> there's<00:01:35.670> something<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.000> run<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.240> here<00:01:36.420> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
so there's something to run in here a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.100 
so there's something to run in here a
roller<00:01:36.900> should<00:01:37.140> work<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.380> fine<00:01:37.670> here<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:38.759> go

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
roller should work just fine here we go

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.810 
roller should work just fine here we go
if<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.229> could<00:01:40.350> find<00:01:40.650> terminals<00:01:41.130> 1<00:01:41.250> &amp;<00:01:41.430> 2

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
we can get a good view as limits there

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.760 
we can get a good view as limits there
