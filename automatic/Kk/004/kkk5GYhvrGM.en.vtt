okay here we have the 2002 regis ace
almost<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.029> same<00:00:06.210> as<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.569> other<00:00:06.720> house<00:00:07.290> that

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
almost the same as the other house that

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.379 
almost the same as the other house that
we<00:00:07.770> have<00:00:08.010> but<00:00:08.340> this<00:00:08.970> one's<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.269> little

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
different it's a just low which means

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.490 
different it's a just low which means
that<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.059> back<00:00:12.269> tires<00:00:12.599> are<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.960> little<00:00:13.080> smaller

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
that the back tires are a little smaller

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.340 
that the back tires are a little smaller
which<00:00:13.799> we'll<00:00:14.009> see<00:00:14.219> here<00:00:14.490> but<00:00:15.049> it's<00:00:16.049> also<00:00:16.199> a

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
which we'll see here but it's also a

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
5-door right here you can see there's a

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:32.150 
5-door right here you can see there's a
little<00:00:22.170> bit<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.470> rust

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.890 

three<00:00:33.160> seats<00:00:33.400> up<00:00:33.640> front<00:00:33.850> there's<00:00:34.420> another<00:00:34.690> in

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:05.730 

space

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.359 

here<00:01:06.369> you<00:01:06.549> can<00:01:06.700> see<00:01:06.939> the<00:01:07.180> the<00:01:08.170> tires<00:01:08.470> a<00:01:08.680> little

bit smaller get in the back there's a

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.140 
bit smaller get in the back there's a
good<00:01:12.729> amount<00:01:12.970> of<00:01:13.030> space

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:32.240 

here<00:01:18.160> who's<00:01:19.160> not<00:01:19.430> so<00:01:19.670> much<00:01:19.850> space

houses right here
small<00:01:37.590> tires<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.520> low<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:39.240> don't<00:01:39.960> know<00:01:40.050> why

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
small tires just low I don't know why

and here's the seats you have

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:10.060 
and here's the seats you have
demonstrated<00:02:00.410> folding<00:02:08.200> so<00:02:09.200> six<00:02:09.530> people<00:02:09.890> can

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
demonstrated folding so six people can

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:33.220 
demonstrated folding so six people can
ride<00:02:12.550> if<00:02:13.630> need<00:02:14.630> be<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:30.560> that's<00:02:30.980> it
