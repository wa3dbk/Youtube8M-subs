let that sit for about five minutes make

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.750 
let that sit for about five minutes make
sure<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.159> system<00:00:39.150> is<00:00:39.269> discharged<00:00:40.049> and<00:00:40.760> we'll

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
sure the system is discharged and we'll

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.240 
sure the system is discharged and we'll
look<00:00:41.940> at<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.449> instrument<00:00:43.140> cluster<00:00:43.440> removed

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
look at the instrument cluster removed

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.759 
look at the instrument cluster removed
okay<00:00:44.909> after<00:00:45.180> about<00:00:45.540> ten<00:00:45.960> minutes<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.470> let<00:00:46.710> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
that out of the way it may vary a little

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.130 
that out of the way it may vary a little
bit<00:01:23.520> from<00:01:23.670> one<00:01:24.180> model<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.750> other<00:01:24.900> but

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
bit from one model to the other but

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.350 
bit from one model to the other but
you've<00:01:25.710> got<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.040> most<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.880> them<00:01:27.000> you'll<00:01:27.150> find

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
you've got the most of them you'll find

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.290 
you've got the most of them you'll find
the<00:01:27.540> two<00:01:27.750> screws<00:01:29.840> now<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.760> cluster<00:01:32.760> itself<00:01:33.030> is

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
the two screws now the cluster itself is

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.200 
the two screws now the cluster itself is
held<00:01:33.510> in<00:01:33.690> by<00:01:33.870> four<00:01:34.290> screws<00:01:34.760> get<00:01:35.760> two<00:01:36.000> at<00:01:36.120> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
held in by four screws get two at the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.830 
held in by four screws get two at the
bottom<00:01:36.920> two<00:01:37.920> at<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.190> top<00:01:41.360> so<00:01:42.360> we'll<00:01:42.570> go<00:01:42.720> ahead

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
bottom two at the top so we'll go ahead

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.560 
bottom two at the top so we'll go ahead
and<00:01:43.370> take<00:01:44.370> them<00:01:44.580> out<00:01:46.940> and<00:01:47.940> then<00:01:48.270> we'll<00:01:48.450> get

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and take them out and then we'll get

and take them out and then we'll get
back<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.050> next<00:01:49.320> step<00:01:50.240> okay<00:01:51.240> after

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
back to the next step okay after

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.460 
back to the next step okay after
removing<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.510> four<00:01:54.510> screws<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.229> cluster

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
removing the four screws in the cluster

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:03.080 
removing the four screws in the cluster
itself<00:01:57.890> should<00:01:58.890> just<00:01:59.280> come<00:02:00.150> right<00:02:00.180> out

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.140 

they<00:02:03.690> have<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.110> reposition<00:02:04.950> wiggle<00:02:05.940> it<00:02:06.060> around

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
they have to reposition wiggle it around

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.070 
they have to reposition wiggle it around
a<00:02:06.390> little<00:02:06.479> bit<00:02:07.670> you'll<00:02:08.670> find<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.450> number<00:02:09.780> of

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
a little bit you'll find a number of

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.290 
a little bit you'll find a number of
connectors<00:02:10.830> on<00:02:11.039> here<00:02:11.340> there's<00:02:11.580> five<00:02:11.910> on<00:02:12.120> this

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
connectors on here there's five on this

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:22.120 
connectors on here there's five on this
particular<00:02:12.720> model<00:02:14.870> locate<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.940> lock<00:02:17.940> tab<00:02:20.360> and

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
particular model locate the lock tab and

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:32.360 
particular model locate the lock tab and
carefully<00:02:24.530> unplug<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:30.920> some<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:31.950> them<00:02:32.220> are<00:02:32.280> a

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
carefully unplug it some of them are a

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.640 
carefully unplug it some of them are a
little<00:02:32.640> tighter<00:02:33.600> than<00:02:33.840> others<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:36.320> try<00:02:37.320> not<00:02:37.350> to

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
little tighter than others so try not to

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.080 
little tighter than others so try not to
force<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.220> because<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.610> don't<00:02:38.760> want<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:38.940> break

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
force it because you don't want to break

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.130 
force it because you don't want to break
anything<00:02:43.910> this<00:02:44.910> one<00:02:45.209> we<00:02:45.360> had<00:02:45.480> three<00:02:45.840> on<00:02:45.989> the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
anything this one we had three on the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.910 
anything this one we had three on the
top<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:48.720> down<00:02:49.530> at<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.830> bottom<00:02:51.350> we<00:02:52.350> have<00:02:52.560> two

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
top and down at the bottom we have two

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.680 
top and down at the bottom we have two
more<00:02:57.769> now<00:02:58.769> I'll<00:02:58.920> just<00:02:58.980> slide<00:02:59.489> straight<00:03:00.300> into

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
more now I'll just slide straight into

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.570 
more now I'll just slide straight into
the<00:03:00.810> socket<00:03:02.660> once<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.810> get<00:03:03.930> everything

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
the socket once you get everything

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
the socket once you get everything
unplugged<00:03:09.170> move<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.350> around<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.760> there<00:03:15.480> we

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
unplugged move it around and there we

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.360 
unplugged move it around and there we
got<00:03:15.780> our<00:03:15.860> instrument<00:03:16.860> cluster<00:03:17.310> out<00:03:17.489> so<00:03:19.370> not

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
got our instrument cluster out so not

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.710 
got our instrument cluster out so not
too<00:03:20.610> hard<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:21.090> do<00:03:21.269> if<00:03:22.049> you're<00:03:22.290> replacing<00:03:22.769> one

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
too hard to do if you're replacing one

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:31.190 
too hard to do if you're replacing one
or<00:03:24.720> adding<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.590> custom<00:03:26.600> panel<00:03:29.930> pretty<00:03:30.930> quick

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
or adding a custom panel pretty quick
