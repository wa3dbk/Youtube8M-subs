00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.760

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.619

 my eyelid I will blur slightly 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.400
 because this is going to be my first shadow 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.510
 that will help me to blur 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.539
 the colors 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.850

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.879
 Capuchin type girls and I'll apply it 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.890
 with a smaller brush and I'm going to 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.009
 centralize well well in what is the 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.250

 I will be applying with a brush 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.570
 pretty little I'm going to try 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.850
 center it without trying to blur 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.850

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.360
 see pretty highlighted and you see the 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.700
 transition of the three tones I will 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.710
 Apply a white pencil on the line 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.539
