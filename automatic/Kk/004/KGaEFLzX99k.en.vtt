the<00:00:13.950> sport<00:00:14.280> when<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.519> started<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.299> today<00:00:15.630> can

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
the sport when I started to today can

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.189 
the sport when I started to today can
you<00:00:16.500> sum<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:16.740> up<00:00:16.890> for<00:00:16.949> us<00:00:17.190> real<00:00:17.400> quick<00:00:18.199> well

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
you sum it up for us real quick well

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.099 
you sum it up for us real quick well
it's<00:00:19.380> really<00:00:19.680> progressing<00:00:20.750> more<00:00:21.750> cookie

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
it's really progressing more cookie

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.870 
it's really progressing more cookie
quickly<00:00:22.590> they're<00:00:22.769> not<00:00:22.890> even<00:00:23.130> thought<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.640> had

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
quickly they're not even thought it had

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.929 
quickly they're not even thought it had
a<00:00:23.910> very<00:00:24.529> slow<00:00:25.529> beginning<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.070> course<00:00:26.250> we<00:00:26.519> just

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
a very slow beginning of course we just

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.339 
a very slow beginning of course we just
display<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.390> trucks<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.779> then<00:00:27.930> just<00:00:28.109> barely

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
display the trucks and then just barely

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.070 
display the trucks and then just barely
drive<00:00:28.740> over<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.130> cars<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.390> now<00:00:30.480> it's<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.929> an

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
drive over the cars and now it's to an

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.200 
drive over the cars and now it's to an
all-out<00:00:31.260> racing<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:31.980> it's<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.279> we're<00:00:33.090> just

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
all-out racing and it's just we're just

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.459 
all-out racing and it's just we're just
scratching<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.690> surface<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.290> racing

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
scratching the surface in the racing

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.680 
scratching the surface in the racing
field<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.670> think<00:00:36.239> we're<00:00:36.329> going<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.510> see<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.630> lot

we<00:00:58.289> don't<00:00:58.469> know<00:00:58.530> which<00:00:58.710> one<00:00:59.039> yet<00:00:59.309> will<00:00:59.520> best

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760

suit us and that's going to take a

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.830 
suit us and that's going to take a
little<00:01:02.100> more<00:01:02.309> R&amp;D<00:01:02.730> because<00:01:03.420> we're<00:01:03.600> going

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
little more R&amp;D because we're going
