00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 and what we would like to comment on brought 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.250
 more on how to create your own world today 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.830
 we go to heaven with a little signal 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.080
 basic file management so that 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.599
 you can change something of the game 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.859
 something physical for example if you want 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.740
 destroy a block and give it to you 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.660
 give a diamond that you created with a diamond 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.849
 something simple something easy to start 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.400
 with that second game later they 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.050
 I will bring that so that you can 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.420
 create a new blocks so that 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.300
 you can create your your items for 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.870
 that you can create your in the pnpc 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.149
 or constituted this is a scream this 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.250
 will come later first to the 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.590
 simple for people who are going to 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.579
 see very good first thing 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.960
 we have to do is open our 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.590
 eclipse we open it we give it to now 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.850
 we give him ok 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.570
 remember that it must be in there is a 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.570
 folder from before 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:09.700
 and once already open here in client what 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.700
 open let's go here the crs and down here 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:19.830
 and this is where we are going to look for our 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.830
 it's called block stones 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.350
 what to look for is 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.630
 well this should not be like this 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.370
 Blog 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.380
 here is ok this does not open it opens 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.880
 this good window unlike 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.120
 you to me is that you are going to come 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.120
 A) Yes 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:48.509
 the mouse block point 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.509
 of this sorry 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.789
 that's how it will come to you 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.530
 here what they do is that every time 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.229
 we destroy it we will give a block of 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.570
 Copper are ok because he wakes up because 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.289
 we want you to give us a diamond 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.319
 so what are we going to do here is 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.660
 put item with upper case lavÃ­n first 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.209
 together and that all the items appear 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.739
 they can choose any one but in my case 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.739
 and I'm going to choose diamond that is let 's say 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.150
 because we put a point and this once 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.250
 that we already have this what we are going to 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.770
 do is compile the program and you 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.080
 we apply here tells us error disappears 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.760
 this gives the ok 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.620
 and those who have this will open the 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.260
 minecraft thematically what are they going to 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.080
 do if they do not have something they believe they open 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.510
 something and we are already in the world now what 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.280
 what we have to do is look is so 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.510
 Clear 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.510
 we apply equipment 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.520
 because you see that here you lose what 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.960
 we break and there it is not giving away 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:06.000
 Diamonds are already seeing that the 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.000
 diamond bar 4 5 6 7 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.450
 especially it can be with any 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.000
 of the game if you have hope and they 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.040
 has served a little is already basic 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.569
 file editing 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.569
 and see you in the next
