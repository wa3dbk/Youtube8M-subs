00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.280 
three quarters of the way through and it
was<00:01:32.700> something<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.060> was<00:01:33.180> waiting<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.200> I

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
was something I was waiting for and I

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.810 
was something I was waiting for and I
think<00:01:34.470> if<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.680> started<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.310> store<00:01:35.520> if<00:01:35.670> she

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
think if it started the store if she

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.069 
think if it started the store if she
started<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.180> story<00:01:36.390> like<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> halfway<00:01:36.900> point

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
started the story like the halfway point

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.319 
started the story like the halfway point
and<00:01:37.409> just<00:01:37.590> wrote<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> book<00:01:38.460> from<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.970> starting

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
and just wrote a book from that starting

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.870 
and just wrote a book from that starting
point<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.590> continued<00:01:41.189> task<00:01:41.490> what

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
point and on like continued task what

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.210 
point and on like continued task what
happens<00:01:42.270> at<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.570> end<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.960> think<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:44.009> would

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
happens at the end I think it just would

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.010 
happens at the end I think it just would
have<00:01:44.250> been<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.759> much<00:01:44.820> better<00:01:45.000> that's<00:01:45.720> really

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
have been so much better that's really

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.569 
have been so much better that's really
just<00:01:46.170> my<00:01:46.320> opinion<00:01:46.740> i'm<00:01:46.890> sure<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> ton<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.340> people

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579
