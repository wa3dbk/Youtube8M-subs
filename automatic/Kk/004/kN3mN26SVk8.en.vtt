dedicated called the ghosts and my
overall<00:00:48.690> opinion<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.559> game<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.010> what

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
overall opinion on the game and what

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.340 
overall opinion on the game and what
Infinity<00:00:50.760> Ward<00:00:50.940> did<00:00:51.210> alright<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.809> first<00:00:52.079> off

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
Infinity Ward did alright so first off

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.049 
Infinity Ward did alright so first off
cold<00:00:52.739> for<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:52.980> ghosts<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.430> definitely<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
cold for the ghosts is definitely a

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.479 
cold for the ghosts is definitely a
different<00:00:54.629> game<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.590> my<00:00:55.739> opinion<00:00:56.219> but

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
different game this is my opinion but

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.099 
different game this is my opinion but
the<00:00:56.610> game<00:00:56.820> feels<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.420> much<00:00:57.600> different<00:00:58.050> than

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
the game feels so much different than

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.779 
the game feels so much different than
other<00:00:58.260> Call<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.620> Duty's<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.160> does<00:00:59.309> not<00:00:59.489> feel

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
other Call of Duty's it does not feel

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.400 
other Call of Duty's it does not feel
like<00:00:59.820> modern<00:01:00.300> warfare<00:01:00.420> 3<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.809> me<00:01:00.930> at<00:01:01.050> all

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
like modern warfare 3 to me at all

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.869 
like modern warfare 3 to me at all
modern<00:01:01.649> warfare<00:01:01.710> 3<00:01:01.949> was<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.550> much<00:01:02.699> more

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
modern warfare 3 was so much more

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.939 
modern warfare 3 was so much more
fast-paced<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.719> found<00:01:04.080> myself<00:01:04.260> getting<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.799> lot

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
fast-paced I found myself getting a lot

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.070 
fast-paced I found myself getting a lot
more<00:01:04.979> kills<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.700> mw3<00:01:06.299> compared<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.900> Call<00:01:07.049> of

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
more kills in mw3 compared to Call of

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.810 
more kills in mw3 compared to Call of
Duty<00:01:07.290> ghosts<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.830> cold<00:01:08.130> Duty<00:01:08.340> ghosts<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.700> all

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
Duty ghosts in cold Duty ghosts we all

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.490 
Duty ghosts in cold Duty ghosts we all
know<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.180> maps<00:01:09.390> are<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.869> much<00:01:10.049> bigger<00:01:10.290> than<00:01:10.380> we

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
know the maps are so much bigger than we

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.219 
know the maps are so much bigger than we
used<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.100> there's<00:01:11.640> only<00:01:11.880> six<00:01:12.360> v6<00:01:12.900> there<00:01:13.140> is

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
used to and there's only six v6 there is

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.950 
used to and there's only six v6 there is
no<00:01:13.380> ground<00:01:13.619> war<00:01:13.920> as<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.369> now<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:15.299> these<00:01:15.479> these

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
no ground war as of now so these these

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.190 
no ground war as of now so these these
maps<00:01:16.350> these<00:01:16.619> massive<00:01:17.070> maps<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:18.060> only<00:01:18.360> six<00:01:18.659> v6

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
maps these massive maps with only six v6

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.859 
maps these massive maps with only six v6
makes<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.799> games<00:01:20.009> seem<00:01:20.670> very<00:01:20.970> slow-paced<00:01:21.330> and

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
makes the games seem very slow-paced and

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.980 
makes the games seem very slow-paced and
slow-paced<00:01:22.619> games<00:01:22.979> are<00:01:23.659> boring<00:01:24.659> they're<00:01:24.869> not

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
slow-paced games are boring they're not

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.120 
slow-paced games are boring they're not
fun<00:01:25.259> because<00:01:25.560> you're<00:01:25.650> not<00:01:25.770> getting<00:01:25.890> many

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
fun because you're not getting many

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.440 
fun because you're not getting many
kills<00:01:26.400> you're<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:26.729> getting<00:01:26.909> many<00:01:27.030> points

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
kills you're not getting many points

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.340 
kills you're not getting many points
you're<00:01:27.540> not<00:01:27.630> getting<00:01:27.810> into<00:01:27.900> kill<00:01:28.110> streaks

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
you're not getting into kill streaks

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.469 
you're not getting into kill streaks
you're<00:01:28.439> not<00:01:28.530> doing<00:01:28.740> anything<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.610> same<00:01:29.880> as<00:01:30.150> we

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
you're not doing anything the same as we

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.840 
you're not doing anything the same as we
used<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.110> believe<00:01:31.619> Infinity<00:01:32.250> Ward<00:01:32.400> came<00:01:32.670> out

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
used to I believe Infinity Ward came out

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.160 
used to I believe Infinity Ward came out
and<00:01:33.090> made<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.329> game<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.600> way<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:33.960> purpose

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
and made the game this way on purpose

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.050 
and made the game this way on purpose
they've<00:01:34.650> made<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> Maps<00:01:35.189> figure<00:01:35.549> they<00:01:35.790> made

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
they've made the Maps figure they made

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.760 
they've made the Maps figure they made
the<00:01:36.210> guns<00:01:36.390> more<00:01:36.570> powerful<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.290> kill<00:01:37.530> fests

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
the guns more powerful that kill fests

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.140 
the guns more powerful that kill fests
are<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.100> easier<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.520> use<00:01:38.670> there's<00:01:38.970> less

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
are the easier to use there's less

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.420 
are the easier to use there's less
recoil<00:01:39.390> they<00:01:39.990> did<00:01:40.290> all<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.560> because<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
recoil they did all this because it's a

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.399 
recoil they did all this because it's a
different<00:01:41.640> call<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.240> duty<00:01:42.540> people<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
different call of duty people in the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.260 
different call of duty people in the
