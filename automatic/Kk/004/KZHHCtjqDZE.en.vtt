00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:01:20.150 

then<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.460> will<00:00:41.700> eat<00:00:41.969> 50

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:50.260 

I'll<00:01:21.160> just<00:01:21.280> put<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.550> battery<00:01:21.729> back<00:01:21.940> in<00:01:22.180> here

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.440 

the<00:01:50.810> e<00:01:51.250> 550<00:01:53.020> as<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:54.140> can<00:01:54.290> see<00:01:54.909> they<00:01:55.909> added<00:01:56.270> a

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
the e 550 as you can see they added a

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.520 
the e 550 as you can see they added a
feature<00:01:56.750> that<00:01:56.899> they<00:01:57.110> had<00:01:57.290> in<00:01:57.439> a<00:01:57.500> previous

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
feature that they had in a previous

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.340 
feature that they had in a previous
generation<00:01:58.299> back<00:01:59.299> to<00:01:59.540> the<00:01:59.720> current<00:02:00.649> model<00:02:01.030> and

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
generation back to the current model and

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.100 
generation back to the current model and
I<00:02:03.350> don't<00:02:03.950> really<00:02:04.130> know<00:02:04.310> much<00:02:04.460> about<00:02:04.520> specs<00:02:05.270> but

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
I don't really know much about specs but

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.419 
I don't really know much about specs but
this<00:02:06.320> is<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.680> way<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:07.189> 550<00:02:07.909> looks<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:09.500> the

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
this is the way the 550 looks and the

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.240 
this is the way the 550 looks and the
edges<00:02:10.759> seem<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.239> be<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.360> bit<00:02:11.569> more<00:02:11.780> curvier<00:02:12.680> in

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
edges seem to be a bit more curvier in

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.370 
edges seem to be a bit more curvier in
the<00:02:13.400> last<00:02:13.640> model<00:02:14.120> as<00:02:14.690> you<00:02:14.810> can<00:02:14.959> see<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:21.200> our

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
the last model as you can see and so our

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.940 
the last model as you can see and so our
side<00:02:21.709> of<00:02:21.739> you<00:02:23.440> don't<00:02:24.440> really<00:02:24.650> have<00:02:24.739> a<00:02:24.799> good

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
side of you don't really have a good

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.979 
side of you don't really have a good
view<00:02:25.160> but<00:02:27.580> that's<00:02:28.580> what<00:02:28.910> it's<00:02:29.569> currently<00:02:29.780> on

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
view but that's what it's currently on

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:53.190 
view but that's what it's currently on
the<00:02:30.200> e<00:02:30.230> 550<00:02:36.069> turn<00:02:37.069> it<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.489> other<00:02:37.640> side

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.660 

and<00:02:54.200> that's<00:02:54.590> about<00:02:54.739> it
