as a background for that you can set
that<00:02:26.069> aside<00:02:26.989> and<00:02:27.989> then<00:02:28.409> I<00:02:28.530> have<00:02:28.739> my<00:02:28.950> melon

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
that aside and then I have my melon

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.030 
that aside and then I have my melon
Mambo<00:02:29.819> ink<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.810> I'm<00:02:30.959> going<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.349> stamp<00:02:31.890> my

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
Mambo ink that I'm going to stamp my

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.800 
Mambo ink that I'm going to stamp my
flower<00:02:32.519> in<00:02:34.159> and<00:02:35.159> I<00:02:35.700> just<00:02:36.000> thought<00:02:36.180> maybe<00:02:36.239> I'd

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
flower in and I just thought maybe I'd

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.770 
flower in and I just thought maybe I'd
stamp<00:02:37.230> one<00:02:37.530> or<00:02:37.680> two<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.099> these<00:02:38.220> flowers<00:02:39.030> just

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
stamp one or two of these flowers just

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:52.280 
stamp one or two of these flowers just
right<00:02:40.079> on<00:02:40.319> top<00:02:43.579> there<00:02:44.579> I<00:02:50.840> don't<00:02:51.840> really<00:02:52.079> like

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
right on top there I don't really like

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.740 
right on top there I don't really like
that<00:02:52.549> so<00:02:53.549> I<00:02:53.579> think<00:02:53.939> I'm<00:02:54.209> gonna<00:02:54.329> flip<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.629> over

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
that so I think I'm gonna flip it over

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.869 
that so I think I'm gonna flip it over
and<00:02:54.989> do<00:02:55.079> it<00:02:55.169> again<00:02:58.430> stamp<00:02:59.430> here<00:02:59.639> or<00:02:59.790> my

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
and do it again stamp here or my

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.610 
and do it again stamp here or my
certainly<00:03:00.329> celery<00:03:00.720> back<00:03:03.049> stamp<00:03:04.049> that<00:03:04.319> that's

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
certainly celery back stamp that that's

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.349 
certainly celery back stamp that that's
the<00:03:04.769> great<00:03:04.980> thing<00:03:05.220> about<00:03:05.250> cardstock<00:03:06.030> there's

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
the great thing about cardstock there's

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.390 
the great thing about cardstock there's
two<00:03:06.629> sides<00:03:06.930> if<00:03:07.319> you're<00:03:07.500> nuts<00:03:07.680> that<00:03:07.859> you<00:03:08.040> still
