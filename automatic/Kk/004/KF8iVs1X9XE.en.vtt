00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
under Rex Ryan during his tenure so you

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.189 
under Rex Ryan during his tenure so you
know<00:00:56.430> if<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:56.969> Raiders<00:00:57.480> offensive<00:00:58.020> line

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
know if if the Raiders offensive line

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.779 
know if if the Raiders offensive line
can<00:00:58.410> hold<00:00:58.649> up<00:00:58.859> which<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.219> what<00:00:59.399> I'm<00:00:59.489> doubting

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
can hold up which is what I'm doubting

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.420 
can hold up which is what I'm doubting
in<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.239> game<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.840> give<00:01:01.379> Derek<00:01:01.739> our<00:01:01.949> time<00:01:02.250> to

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
in this game and give Derek our time to

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.130 
in this game and give Derek our time to
throw<00:01:02.699> he<00:01:03.210> may<00:01:03.390> be<00:01:03.449> able<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.840> be<00:01:03.960> successful

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
throw he may be able to be successful

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.710 
throw he may be able to be successful
but<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.189> look<00:01:05.400> at<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> biggest<00:01:05.850> mismatch<00:01:06.510> in

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
but I look at the biggest mismatch in

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.200 
but I look at the biggest mismatch in
this<00:01:06.900> game<00:01:07.140> as<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.500> jets<00:01:08.310> defensive<00:01:08.970> line

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
this game as that jets defensive line

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.600 
this game as that jets defensive line
and<00:01:09.510> pass<00:01:09.840> rush<00:01:10.200> verse<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.250> Raiders

and pass rush verse the Raiders

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.789 
and pass rush verse the Raiders
offensive<00:01:12.299> line<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.930> Raiders<00:01:13.260> offensive

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
offensive line the Raiders offensive

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.219 
offensive line the Raiders offensive
line<00:01:13.979> still<00:01:14.340> suspect<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.150> don't<00:01:15.840> know<00:01:16.020> that

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
line still suspect I don't know that

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.249 
line still suspect I don't know that
they'll<00:01:16.409> give<00:01:16.710> Derek<00:01:17.130> Carr<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:18.030> time<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:19.020> step

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
they'll give Derek Carr the time to step

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.289 
they'll give Derek Carr the time to step
up<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> pocket<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.220> deliver<00:01:20.729> his<00:01:20.909> throws

up in the pocket and deliver his throws

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.480 
up in the pocket and deliver his throws
like<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.320> think<00:01:22.530> he's<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.009> need<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.369> this

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
like I think he's going to need in this

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.249 
like I think he's going to need in this
one<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.000> when<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.600> look<00:01:24.780> at<00:01:24.930> Maurice

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
one and when you look at Maurice

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.440 
one and when you look at Maurice
jones-drew<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.979> Darren<00:01:26.280> McFadden<00:01:26.850> running

jones-drew and Darren McFadden running
behind<00:01:27.570> what<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:27.900> think<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> suspect

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
behind what I think is a suspect

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.620 
behind what I think is a suspect
offensive<00:01:29.400> line<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.909> don't<00:01:30.420> think<00:01:30.600> that

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
offensive line I don't think that

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.270 
offensive line I don't think that
running<00:01:30.900> game<00:01:31.079> will<00:01:31.320> get<00:01:31.409> established<00:01:31.740> enough

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
running game will get established enough

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.600 
running game will get established enough
again<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.210> aid<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.200> young<00:01:34.409> quarterback<00:01:34.950> you

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
the defensive coordinator that you know

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.050 
the defensive coordinator that you know
is<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:41.040> defensive<00:01:41.549> coach<00:01:41.759> and

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
is just the defensive coach and

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.929 
is just the defensive coach and
coordinator<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.229> are<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.500> salivating<00:01:43.939> to

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
coordinator that are just salivating to

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.670 
coordinator that are just salivating to
get<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> Raiders<00:01:45.570> in<00:01:45.750> there<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.380> think

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
get the Raiders in there so I think

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.230 
get the Raiders in there so I think
that's<00:01:46.950> where<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.220> biggest<00:01:47.579> mismatch<00:01:47.970> lies

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
that's where the biggest mismatch lies

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.270 
that's where the biggest mismatch lies
in<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.600> game<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.110> think<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.770> Jets<00:01:49.979> will<00:01:50.130> do

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
in this game I think the Jets will do

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.950 
in this game I think the Jets will do
enough<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.820> jets<00:01:51.030> offense<00:01:51.180> will<00:01:51.570> do<00:01:51.689> enough

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
enough the jets offense will do enough

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.050 
enough the jets offense will do enough
against<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.439> Raiders<00:01:52.770> defense<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.729> Raiders

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
against the Raiders defense the Raiders

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.630 
against the Raiders defense the Raiders
defense<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.659> me<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:55.470> an<00:01:55.680> average<00:01:56.040> unit<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.549> know

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
defense to me is an average unit I know

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.910 
defense to me is an average unit I know
they<00:01:57.000> added<00:01:57.329> Justin<00:01:57.719> talk<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.229> LaMarr

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
they added Justin talk and LaMarr

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.880 
they added Justin talk and LaMarr
Woodley<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.640> some<00:02:00.149> other<00:02:00.299> veterans<00:02:00.869> but<00:02:01.680> I

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
Woodley and some other veterans but I

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.620 
Woodley and some other veterans but I
still<00:02:02.219> think<00:02:02.430> they're<00:02:02.579> an<00:02:02.700> average<00:02:03.060> unit<00:02:03.299> I

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
still think they're an average unit I

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.690 
still think they're an average unit I
think<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> Jets<00:02:04.500> are<00:02:04.680> improved<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.250> offense

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
think the Jets are improved on offense

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.310 
think the Jets are improved on offense
they're<00:02:05.969> still<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.240> an<00:02:06.540> average<00:02:06.869> unit<00:02:07.079> as

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
they're still just an average unit as

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.800 
they're still just an average unit as
well<00:02:07.350> though<00:02:08.090> but<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.119> give<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.360> little<00:02:09.599> bit<00:02:09.780> of

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
well though but I give a little bit of

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.720 
well though but I give a little bit of
advantage<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.470> jets<00:02:10.709> offense<00:02:10.860> over<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
advantage to the jets offense over the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.130 
advantage to the jets offense over the
Raiders<00:02:12.030> offense

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
Raiders offense

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.809 
Raiders offense
because<00:02:13.380> I<00:02:13.410> think<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.800> Jets<00:02:14.040> offensive<00:02:14.610> line

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
because I think the Jets offensive line

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.240 
because I think the Jets offensive line
while<00:02:15.120> not<00:02:15.360> great<00:02:15.720> can<00:02:16.560> at<00:02:16.680> least<00:02:16.770> protect

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
while not great can at least protect

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.100 
while not great can at least protect
Geno<00:02:17.550> Smith<00:02:17.819> enough<00:02:18.120> where<00:02:18.690> he<00:02:18.780> can<00:02:18.930> take

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
Geno Smith enough where he can take

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.860 
Geno Smith enough where he can take
advantage<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:20.220> weaker<00:02:20.640> rate<00:02:21.180> or<00:02:21.360> secondary

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
advantage of a weaker rate or secondary

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.680 
advantage of a weaker rate or secondary
certainly<00:02:22.500> but<00:02:23.459> again<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.120> think<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.480> biggest

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
certainly but again I think the biggest

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.870 
certainly but again I think the biggest
thing<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.140> watch<00:02:25.319> for<00:02:25.350> in<00:02:25.709> this<00:02:25.740> game<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.340> how

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
thing to watch for in this game is how

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.570 
thing to watch for in this game is how
that<00:02:27.150> Raiders<00:02:27.630> offensive<00:02:28.319> line<00:02:28.530> plays<00:02:28.950> can

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
that Raiders offensive line plays can

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.280 
that Raiders offensive line plays can
they<00:02:29.700> even<00:02:29.850> get<00:02:30.090> any<00:02:30.270> semblance<00:02:30.630> against<00:02:31.170> the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
they even get any semblance against the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.350 
they even get any semblance against the
Jets<00:02:31.530> rushing<00:02:31.950> defense<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.850> was<00:02:32.970> in<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.209> top

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
Jets rushing defense that was in the top

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.510 
Jets rushing defense that was in the top
three<00:02:33.750> in<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.870> league<00:02:34.110> last<00:02:34.350> year<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.980> can

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
three in the league last year and can

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.449 
three in the league last year and can
they<00:02:35.700> keep<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:37.200> jets<00:02:37.500> defensive<00:02:38.010> line<00:02:38.220> and

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
they keep the jets defensive line and

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.390 
they keep the jets defensive line and
linebackers<00:02:38.930> away<00:02:39.930> from<00:02:40.200> Derek<00:02:40.530> Carr<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:41.010> I

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
linebackers away from Derek Carr and I

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.530 
linebackers away from Derek Carr and I
don't<00:02:41.640> think<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:41.850> we<00:02:42.030> able<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.270> do<00:02:42.420> it

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
don't think that we able to do it

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.920 
don't think that we able to do it
consistently<00:02:42.810> enough<00:02:43.709> I<00:02:44.670> like<00:02:45.300> Derek<00:02:45.690> Carr

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
consistently enough I like Derek Carr

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.180 
consistently enough I like Derek Carr
but<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.230> think<00:02:46.410> he's<00:02:46.500> just<00:02:46.620> in<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.830> tough<00:02:47.070> spot

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
but I think he's just in a tough spot

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.640 
but I think he's just in a tough spot
here<00:02:47.370> with<00:02:48.150> limited<00:02:48.570> weapons<00:02:49.020> a<00:02:49.200> bad

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
here with limited weapons a bad

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.740 
here with limited weapons a bad
offensive<00:02:50.100> line<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:51.090> really<00:02:51.360> get<00:02:51.480> anything

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
offensive line to really get anything

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.990 
offensive line to really get anything
done<00:02:52.019> here<00:02:52.320> in<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.500> opener<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.100> like<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.670> Jets

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
done here in the opener I like the Jets

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.860 
done here in the opener I like the Jets
