00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.270 
well no I thought he did well tonight
you<00:01:33.180> know<00:01:33.299> for<00:01:33.479> his<00:01:33.570> first<00:01:33.780> game<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.079> thought<00:01:34.409> um

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
you know for his first game I thought um

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.950 
you know for his first game I thought um
you<00:01:35.790> know<00:01:35.909> they<00:01:36.030> had<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.180> cut<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> big<00:01:36.420> boys<00:01:36.720> back

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
you know they had to cut a big boys back

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.200 
you know they had to cut a big boys back
there<00:01:37.020> they've<00:01:37.290> got<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.439> big<00:01:37.619> back<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:38.210> tonight

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
there they've got a big back for tonight

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.840 
there they've got a big back for tonight
and<00:01:39.740> yeah<00:01:40.740> thought<00:01:40.979> he<00:01:41.070> took<00:01:41.220> his<00:01:41.369> goal<00:01:41.579> well<00:01:41.820> I

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
and yeah thought he took his goal well I

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.370 
and yeah thought he took his goal well I
mean<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.450> think<00:01:42.750> he<00:01:42.990> should<00:01:43.140> have<00:01:43.170> had<00:01:43.350> a

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
mean I think he should have had a

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.719 
mean I think he should have had a
hatrocks<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:43.979> think<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.250> keep<00:01:44.430> her<00:01:44.520> pulled

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
hatrocks and I think to keep her pulled

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.100 
hatrocks and I think to keep her pulled
off<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.939> really<00:01:45.090> good<00:01:45.270> saving<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.659> first<00:01:45.840> half

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
off a really good saving the first half

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.350 
off a really good saving the first half
from<00:01:46.799> his<00:01:46.950> header<00:01:47.159> when<00:01:47.970> he<00:01:48.060> was<00:01:48.149> cleaned

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
from his header when he was cleaned

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.700 
from his header when he was cleaned
through<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.600> fancied<00:01:49.079> him<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.290> score<00:01:49.530> actually

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
through I fancied him to score actually

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.410 
through I fancied him to score actually
so<00:01:50.189> he<00:01:50.579> could<00:01:50.790> have<00:01:50.880> easily<00:01:51.000> had<00:01:51.180> three

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
so he could have easily had three

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.060 
so he could have easily had three
tonight<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.930> maybe<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.560> another<00:01:52.770> day<00:01:53.009> you

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
tonight and maybe on another day you

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.069 
tonight and maybe on another day you
might<00:01:53.310> have<00:01:53.430> done<00:01:53.549> but<00:01:53.729> not<00:01:54.570> delighted<00:01:54.899> with

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
might have done but not delighted with

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.990 
might have done but not delighted with
the<00:01:55.170> boys<00:01:55.320> tonight<00:01:55.560> really<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.040> think<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.520> you
