that's<00:00:10.889> me<00:00:13.219> here<00:00:14.219> we<00:00:14.429> have<00:00:14.549> some<00:00:14.730> dry<00:00:14.969> ice<00:00:15.000> and

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
that's me here we have some dry ice and

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.349 
that's me here we have some dry ice and
acetone<00:00:16.890> we<00:00:17.460> work<00:00:17.609> with<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.820> driest<00:00:18.210> and

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
acetone we work with the driest and

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.380 
acetone we work with the driest and
acetone<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.320> make<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.920> colder<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.180> when

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
acetone to make it colder so that when

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.570 
acetone to make it colder so that when
we<00:00:21.420> put<00:00:21.510> our<00:00:21.689> Apple<00:00:22.020> into<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.220> Apple<00:00:23.490> will

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
we put our Apple into it the Apple will

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.200 
we put our Apple into it the Apple will
freeze<00:00:23.820> some<00:00:24.000> things<00:00:24.830> jinke<00:00:25.849> don't<00:00:26.849> want<00:00:27.150> to

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
freeze some things jinke don't want to

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:43.580 
freeze some things jinke don't want to
put<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.449> Apple<00:00:27.779> back<00:00:28.289> toes<00:00:42.350> right<00:00:43.350> now<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
put the Apple back toes right now the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.920 
put the Apple back toes right now the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
liquid molecules inside of the Apple are

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.340 
liquid molecules inside of the Apple are
slowing<00:00:46.500> down<00:00:46.860> causing<00:00:47.719> which<00:00:48.719> restricts<00:00:49.230> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
assault are slowing down now we're going

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:43.170 
assault are slowing down now we're going
to<00:01:03.840> get<00:01:04.049> FM<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.100> drop<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.909> see<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.600> brakes

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.060 

geez<00:01:45.550> no<00:01:46.550> we're<00:01:46.910> gonna<00:01:47.090> freeze<00:01:47.330> a<00:01:47.390> tomato

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
geez no we're gonna freeze a tomato

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.400 
geez no we're gonna freeze a tomato
right<00:01:49.070> shaggy<00:01:49.400> this<00:01:50.090> one's<00:01:50.270> all<00:01:50.390> you<00:01:50.570> got

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
right shaggy this one's all you got

00:01:51.410 --> 00:02:08.169 
right shaggy this one's all you got
about<00:01:51.530> many<00:01:52.010> buckets<00:01:52.430> do<00:01:53.030> for<00:01:53.330> skill<00:01:53.600> set

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:23.089 

points<00:02:09.179> now<00:02:10.080> we're<00:02:10.380> going<00:02:10.819> tomato<00:02:21.830> what<00:02:22.830> the

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
points now we're going tomato what the

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.110 
points now we're going tomato what the
tomato<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.610> completely<00:02:24.090> frozen<00:02:24.300> solid<00:02:26.120> don't

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
tomato is completely frozen solid don't

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.040 
tomato is completely frozen solid don't
make<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.269> salad<00:02:27.599> out<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:29.450> so<00:02:30.450> gang<00:02:30.690> what

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
make a salad out of that so gang what

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.339 
make a salad out of that so gang what
did<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.170> learn<00:02:31.319> today<00:02:35.959> when<00:02:36.959> we<00:02:37.080> put<00:02:37.260> the

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
did you learn today when we put the

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.229 
did you learn today when we put the
Apple<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:37.830> tomato<00:02:38.220> in<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.580> dry<00:02:38.790> ice<00:02:38.819> it

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
Apple and tomato in the dry ice it

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.789 
Apple and tomato in the dry ice it
caused<00:02:39.480> molecules<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:40.170> slide<00:02:40.349> down<00:02:40.380> making

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
caused molecules to slide down making

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.820 
caused molecules to slide down making
that<00:02:41.180> brittle<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.810> reason<00:02:43.200> why<00:02:43.349> they<00:02:43.530> crashed

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
that brittle the reason why they crashed

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.220 
that brittle the reason why they crashed
my<00:02:44.310> own<00:02:44.760> in<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.030> hammer<00:02:45.239> is<00:02:45.599> because<00:02:46.080> the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
my own in the hammer is because the

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.229 
my own in the hammer is because the
molecules<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.040> solid<00:02:47.459> objects<00:02:47.940> were

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
molecules in the solid objects were

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.210 
molecules in the solid objects were
closer<00:02:48.450> together<00:02:48.690> this<00:02:49.500> caused<00:02:49.739> them<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.099> be

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
closer together this caused them to be

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.240 
closer together this caused them to be
less<00:02:50.459> loud<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:52.500> made<00:02:53.099> them<00:02:53.400> break<00:02:54.060> on<00:02:54.239> impact

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
less loud and made them break on impact

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:08.300 
less loud and made them break on impact
okay<00:02:56.250> let's<00:02:56.610> get<00:02:56.849> up

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.310
