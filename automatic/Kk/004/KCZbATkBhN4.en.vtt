00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
to upgrade this to an LED one before

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.150 
to upgrade this to an LED one before
doing<00:00:15.000> this<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.660> want<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.929> actually<00:00:16.109> keep<00:00:16.440> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
light off because the bulb will heat up

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.269 
light off because the bulb will heat up
and<00:00:20.930> it'll<00:00:21.930> be<00:00:22.080> really<00:00:22.320> hot<00:00:22.590> whenever<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.130> go

and it'll be really hot whenever you go
in<00:00:23.400> there<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.609> touch<00:00:23.789> it

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
in there and touch it

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.550 
in there and touch it
here's<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.170> LED<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.529> have<00:00:25.769> then<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.160> put<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:27.560> cut

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
here's the LED I have then I put in cut

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.810 
here's the LED I have then I put in cut
this<00:00:28.680> off<00:00:28.859> Amazon

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.720 

so<00:00:32.820> first<00:00:33.059> removing<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.309> you<00:00:35.309> can<00:00:35.460> do<00:00:35.550> this

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
so first removing this you can do this

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:44.229 
so first removing this you can do this
with<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> Gerber<00:00:36.210> or<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.600> very<00:00:37.440> small<00:00:37.559> flat-head

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.580 

you<00:00:45.239> can't<00:00:45.480> open<00:00:45.629> their<00:00:45.899> part<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> Gerber

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
you can't open their part of the Gerber

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.560 
you can't open their part of the Gerber
there<00:00:47.489> are<00:00:47.640> small<00:00:48.350> slots<00:00:49.640> in<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.789> plastic<00:00:51.329> I

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
there are small slots in the plastic I

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:01.479 
there are small slots in the plastic I
actually<00:00:52.379> want<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.739> go<00:00:52.860> on<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.129> side<00:00:56.000> behind

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.710 

we<00:01:02.489> got<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.789> piece<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:07.080> then<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.350> bulb

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
we got this piece and then the bulb

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.690 
we got this piece and then the bulb
there's<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.840> metal<00:01:10.049> tab<00:01:10.229> right<00:01:10.409> here<00:01:10.580> push<00:01:11.580> that

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.109 

now<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.960> then<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> bulb<00:01:17.030> there's<00:01:18.030> a

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
now and then you have the bulb there's a

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.320 
now and then you have the bulb there's a
stock<00:01:18.360> bolt<00:01:18.659> right<00:01:18.810> there<00:01:19.790> if<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:20.970> was<00:01:21.180> on

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
stock bolt right there if this was on

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.300 
stock bolt right there if this was on
for<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> while<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.990> would<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:23.040> bulb

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
for a while this would be this bulb

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.730 
for a while this would be this bulb
would<00:01:23.490> be<00:01:23.610> scalding<00:01:24.149> hot<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.560> want<00:01:25.680> to

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
would be scalding hot so you want to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.160 
would be scalding hot so you want to
make<00:01:25.830> sure<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:26.280> cool<00:01:26.899> where<00:01:27.899> you<00:01:27.990> going

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
make sure it's cool where you going

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.800 
make sure it's cool where you going
there<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.409> take<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.649> out<00:01:28.790> inside<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:30.630> is

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
there to take it out inside this is

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.180 
there to take it out inside this is
gonna<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.409> piece<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.369> need<00:01:34.190> looks

just like the stock bulb but it has a
spring<00:01:37.380> inside<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:38.039> compresses<00:01:38.580> and<00:01:39.200> that

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
spring inside that compresses and that

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:57.800 
spring inside that compresses and that
fits<00:01:40.530> into<00:01:43.130> here

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.520

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
you know that piece is sitting in there

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:10.800 
you know that piece is sitting in there
grab<00:02:02.530> an<00:02:02.710> LED<00:02:03.130> board<00:02:08.310> match<00:02:09.310> up<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:10.360> red<00:02:10.569> wire

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
grab an LED board match up the red wire

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:22.770 
grab an LED board match up the red wire
to<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.230> red<00:02:11.260> wire

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780
