00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
it's a version of Minecraft that was

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.990 
it's a version of Minecraft that was
designed<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.830> actually<00:02:17.040> be<00:02:17.430> able<00:02:17.460> to

run on a mobile device which in itself

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.310 
run on a mobile device which in itself
is<00:02:20.970> pretty<00:02:21.360> darn<00:02:21.600> shocking<00:02:22.170> because

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
is pretty darn shocking because

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.980 
is pretty darn shocking because
minecraft<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.190> very<00:02:23.610> very<00:02:24.030> power<00:02:24.480> intensive

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
minecraft is a very very power intensive

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.590 
minecraft is a very very power intensive
game<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.530> it's<00:02:26.370> not<00:02:26.790> really<00:02:27.090> one<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.540> you

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
game and it's not really one that you

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.740 
game and it's not really one that you
would<00:02:27.690> expect<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:28.200> see<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.650> mobile<00:02:28.890> platform

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
would expect to see on a mobile platform

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.600 
would expect to see on a mobile platform
but<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.960> being<00:02:31.290> said<00:02:31.350> they've<00:02:31.980> made<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.340> work

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
but that being said they've made it work

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.820 
but that being said they've made it work
they've<00:02:32.940> designed<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.170> version<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.620> will

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
they've designed a version that will

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.270 
they've designed a version that will
make<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.040> happen<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.900> many<00:02:37.650> props<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.160> them

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
make it happen and many props to them

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.310 
make it happen and many props to them
like<00:02:38.520> it<00:02:38.820> you<00:02:39.209> can<00:02:39.330> also<00:02:39.480> taken<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.930> lot<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.140> work

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
like it you can also taken a lot of work

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.720 
like it you can also taken a lot of work
for<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:41.660> however<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:43.070> feel<00:02:44.070> like<00:02:44.220> apparently

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
for it however I feel like apparently

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.190 
for it however I feel like apparently
they<00:02:44.940> they<00:02:45.120> are<00:02:45.300> working<00:02:45.540> on<00:02:45.780> getting<00:02:45.959> the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
they they are working on getting the

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.870 
they they are working on getting the
game<00:02:46.380> like<00:02:46.650> closer<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.340> what<00:02:47.430> we<00:02:47.550> currently

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
game like closer to what we currently

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.660 
game like closer to what we currently
see<00:02:48.270> inside<00:02:48.630> like<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.840> PC<00:02:49.410> or<00:02:49.440> console<00:02:50.310> version

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
see inside like a PC or console version

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.280 
see inside like a PC or console version
but<00:02:51.360> here's<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.660> thing<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:52.020> makes<00:02:52.200> me

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
but here's the thing that makes me

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.470 
but here's the thing that makes me
worried<00:02:53.300> why<00:02:54.590> why<00:02:55.850> kind<00:02:56.850> of<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.060> makes<00:02:57.239> no

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
worried why why kind of it makes no

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.760 
worried why why kind of it makes no
sense<00:02:57.510> but<00:02:58.350> why<00:02:58.620> are<00:02:58.980> we<00:02:59.010> like<00:03:00.500> why<00:03:01.500> is<00:03:01.560> this

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
sense but why are we like why is this

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.170 
sense but why are we like why is this
mobile<00:03:02.130> version<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:02.700> important<00:03:03.060> I<00:03:03.090> know

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
mobile version so important I know

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.430 
mobile version so important I know
there's<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:03.690> many<00:03:03.810> people<00:03:03.989> out<00:03:04.170> there<00:03:04.320> that

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
there's so many people out there that

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.900 
there's so many people out there that
aren't<00:03:04.620> only<00:03:04.800> able<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.220> play<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.580> mobile

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
aren't only able to play the mobile

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.990 
aren't only able to play the mobile
version<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.920> guess<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.190> is<00:03:08.459> something

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
version and I guess that is something

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.540 
version and I guess that is something
for<00:03:09.239> them<00:03:09.420> but<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.290> feel<00:03:10.620> like<00:03:10.650> we<00:03:11.250> should<00:03:11.430> be

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
for them but I feel like we should be

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.380 
for them but I feel like we should be
focusing<00:03:12.000> less<00:03:12.360> on<00:03:13.850> making<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:14.940> version<00:03:15.360> that

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
focusing less on making a version that

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.120 
focusing less on making a version that
can<00:03:15.660> be<00:03:15.780> played<00:03:16.050> on<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.260> phone<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:16.650> maybe

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
can be played on a phone and maybe

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.660 
can be played on a phone and maybe
working<00:03:17.430> more<00:03:17.790> on<00:03:19.130> expanding<00:03:20.130> where<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.550> can

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
working more on expanding where it can

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.550 
working more on expanding where it can
be<00:03:20.700> played<00:03:20.970> other<00:03:21.270> than<00:03:21.540> phones<00:03:21.870> like<00:03:22.350> on<00:03:22.530> a

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
be played other than phones like on a

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.550 
be played other than phones like on a
system<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.130> could<00:03:23.280> actually<00:03:23.489> run<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:23.910> game

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
system that could actually run the game

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.330 
system that could actually run the game
consistently<00:03:25.560> pretty<00:03:25.739> well<00:03:25.830> I<00:03:25.950> know<00:03:26.010> phones

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
consistently pretty well I know phones

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.410 
consistently pretty well I know phones
are<00:03:26.489> getting<00:03:26.700> more<00:03:26.820> advanced<00:03:27.090> they<00:03:27.330> are

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
are getting more advanced they are

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.360 
are getting more advanced they are
getting<00:03:27.600> more<00:03:27.810> advanced<00:03:28.230> every<00:03:28.799> day<00:03:29.070> and

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
getting more advanced every day and

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.670 
getting more advanced every day and
they're<00:03:29.850> getting<00:03:30.090> more<00:03:30.209> powerful<00:03:30.530> but<00:03:31.530> they

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
they're getting more powerful but they

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.640 
they're getting more powerful but they
still<00:03:32.070> not<00:03:32.250> as<00:03:32.430> powerful<00:03:32.760> as<00:03:33.209> a<00:03:33.239> modern<00:03:33.750> age<00:03:33.900> pc

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
still not as powerful as a modern age pc

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.270 
still not as powerful as a modern age pc
or<00:03:34.860> even<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.340> game<00:03:35.610> console<00:03:36.180> so<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:37.230> mean<00:03:37.799> yes

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
or even a game console so I mean yes

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.310 
or even a game console so I mean yes
it's<00:03:38.489> an<00:03:38.580> option<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.269> I'm<00:03:39.870> not<00:03:40.049> going<00:03:40.230> to

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
it's an option and I'm not going to

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.530 
it's an option and I'm not going to
knock<00:03:40.950> them<00:03:41.190> for<00:03:41.459> for<00:03:41.640> making<00:03:41.970> this<00:03:42.090> version

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
knock them for for making this version

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.990 
knock them for for making this version
because<00:03:43.230> it's<00:03:43.769> definitely<00:03:43.980> been<00:03:44.580> some<00:03:44.610> of<00:03:44.940> the

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
because it's definitely been some of the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.910 
because it's definitely been some of the
people<00:03:45.299> have<00:03:45.420> used<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.080> made<00:03:46.110> them<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.560> lot<00:03:46.799> of

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
people have used and made them a lot of

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.170 
people have used and made them a lot of
money<00:03:46.950> probably<00:03:47.400> as<00:03:47.700> well<00:03:47.880> but<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.870> feel<00:03:49.739> like

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180

it could be time bet best put into other
places<00:03:54.180> it's<00:03:55.140> a<00:03:55.290> it's<00:03:55.500> a<00:03:55.590> good<00:03:55.769> use<00:03:55.920> of<00:03:56.010> time

it's<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.200> best<00:03:58.410> way<00:03:58.590> i<00:03:58.620> can<00:03:58.739> probably<00:03:59.430> word<00:04:00.090> it

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
it's the best way i can probably word it

it's the best way i can probably word it
I<00:04:01.910> know<00:04:02.910> it's<00:04:03.209> a<00:04:03.269> stupid<00:04:03.480> opinion<00:04:03.959> I<00:04:04.079> mean<00:04:04.260> I

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
I know it's a stupid opinion I mean I

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.900 
I know it's a stupid opinion I mean I
have<00:04:04.650> never<00:04:04.799> used<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.190> mobile<00:04:05.459> version<00:04:05.489> I've

have never used the mobile version I've

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.509 
have never used the mobile version I've
had<00:04:06.150> no<00:04:06.450> reason<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:07.110> I've<00:04:07.560> also<00:04:07.799> never<00:04:08.040> tried

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519

had no reason to I've also never tried
out<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.700> xbox<00:04:09.420> 360<00:04:09.840> version<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.500> when<00:04:10.620> the

out the xbox 360 version and when the
ps4<00:04:10.950> version<00:04:11.400> comes<00:04:11.579> out<00:04:11.670> I<00:04:11.730> probably<00:04:12.120> won't

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
ps4 version comes out I probably won't

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.500 
ps4 version comes out I probably won't
try<00:04:12.630> that<00:04:12.660> because<00:04:13.049> I<00:04:13.320> just<00:04:13.380> have<00:04:13.910> no<00:04:14.910> reason

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
try that because I just have no reason

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.289 
try that because I just have no reason
to<00:04:15.660> it's<00:04:15.959> just<00:04:16.109> I<00:04:16.620> mean<00:04:16.829> but<00:04:17.370> I<00:04:17.430> guess<00:04:17.880> I<00:04:18.150> am

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
to it's just I mean but I guess I am

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.770 
to it's just I mean but I guess I am
only<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.989> portion<00:04:19.470> of<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.859> audience<00:04:20.100> like

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
only a portion of the audience like

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.060 
only a portion of the audience like
there's<00:04:21.780> large<00:04:22.049> portion<00:04:22.440> lawdy<00:04:22.590> instead<00:04:22.979> is

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
there's large portion lawdy instead is

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.440 
there's large portion lawdy instead is
probably<00:04:23.370> watching<00:04:23.520> right<00:04:23.820> now<00:04:23.850> on<00:04:24.120> a<00:04:24.150> mobile

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
probably watching right now on a mobile

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.120 
probably watching right now on a mobile
device<00:04:24.600> if<00:04:25.050> they<00:04:25.169> don't<00:04:25.380> have<00:04:25.560> access<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:26.099> a

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130
