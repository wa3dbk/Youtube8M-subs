isn't too bad and has very little
problems<00:02:04.520> um<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:05.330> wasn't<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.780> best<00:02:05.930> you<00:02:06.110> know

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.510 
but it was okay the one cool move that I

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.080 
but it was okay the one cool move that I
saw<00:02:08.840> was<00:02:09.020> like<00:02:09.230> doing<00:02:09.500> a<00:02:09.890> upwards<00:02:10.490> back<00:02:10.760> flip

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
saw was like doing a upwards back flip

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.760 
saw was like doing a upwards back flip
to<00:02:11.240> the<00:02:11.270> next<00:02:11.390> edge<00:02:11.780> sort<00:02:12.200> of<00:02:12.260> like<00:02:12.380> a<00:02:12.410> shimmy

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
to the next edge sort of like a shimmy

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.910 
to the next edge sort of like a shimmy
moving<00:02:13.130> away<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:14.080> yeah<00:02:15.080> that's<00:02:15.380> pretty<00:02:15.650> much

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
moving away and yeah that's pretty much

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.170 
moving away and yeah that's pretty much
the<00:02:16.040> only<00:02:16.160> cool<00:02:16.370> thing<00:02:16.430> about<00:02:16.700> this<00:02:16.910> game<00:02:17.120> the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180
