you don't go too close to the root with

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.200 
you don't go too close to the root with
it<00:00:54.809> try<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.350> keep<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.710> about<00:00:55.920> from<00:00:56.219> Midway<00:00:56.609> then

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
working that down to the end take the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.689 
working that down to the end take the
hair<00:00:59.699> then<00:01:00.059> you're<00:01:00.179> going<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.359> cross<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:01.699> from

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
hair then you're going to cross it from

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.619 
hair then you're going to cross it from
there<00:01:02.879> I'm<00:01:02.969> bringing<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.329> through<00:01:03.359> my<00:01:03.570> fingers

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
there I'm bringing it through my fingers

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.930 
there I'm bringing it through my fingers
as<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.589> see<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:05.309> making<00:01:05.580> sure<00:01:05.730> that<00:01:05.850> I

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
as you can see but making sure that I

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.700 
as you can see but making sure that I
keep<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.480> going<00:01:06.810> over<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.500> nice<00:01:07.650> and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
keep on going over so that it's nice and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.390 
keep on going over so that it's nice and
smooth<00:01:08.160> once<00:01:08.940> I<00:01:09.060> actually<00:01:09.210> have<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.690> in<00:01:10.400> it

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
smooth once I actually have it in it

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.010 
smooth once I actually have it in it
creates<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:11.880> bit<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.300> a<00:01:12.360> loop<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.870> can

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
creates this bit of a loop that you can

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.570 
creates this bit of a loop that you can
see<00:01:13.200> right<00:01:13.230> here<00:01:13.590> but<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.130> notice<00:01:14.400> how<00:01:14.520> we

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
see right here but you notice how we

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.980 
see right here but you notice how we
keep<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.910> little<00:01:15.150> bit<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> ends<00:01:15.660> out<00:01:15.810> you

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
keep a little bit of the ends out you

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.860 
keep a little bit of the ends out you
just<00:01:16.200> kind<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.380> wrap<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.800> bit<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:20.660> then<00:01:21.660> from

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
just kind of wrap it a bit and then from

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.870 
just kind of wrap it a bit and then from
there<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.080> take<00:01:22.500> your<00:01:22.650> pen

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:32.849

now just start moving towards the front
and<00:02:02.299> see<00:02:02.509> take<00:02:02.780> that<00:02:02.989> get<00:02:03.170> out<00:02:03.349> of<00:02:03.500> your<00:02:03.590> way

from there you just kind of want to let
it<00:02:05.869> fall<00:02:06.110> you<00:02:07.009> can<00:02:07.159> see<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.369> type<00:02:07.549> of<00:02:07.610> finish

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
it fall you can see the type of finish

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.999 
it fall you can see the type of finish
that<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.269> gives<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:08.869> it's<00:02:09.019> a<00:02:09.049> very<00:02:09.079> razzled

that it gives you so it's a very razzled
bit<00:02:10.429> of<00:02:10.519> a<00:02:10.610> texture<00:02:13.060> remember<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.150> thing<00:02:14.299> that

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
bit of a texture remember the thing that

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.089 
bit of a texture remember the thing that
we're<00:02:14.629> not<00:02:14.780> trying<00:02:14.989> to<00:02:15.110> do<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.379> remove<00:02:15.709> all<00:02:15.950> of

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.440 
we're not trying to do is remove all of
the<00:02:16.220> wave<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.640> all<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.000> text<00:02:17.269> you<00:02:17.420> just

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
the wave and all of the text you just

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.300 
the wave and all of the text you just
want<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.780> actually<00:02:17.900> get<00:02:18.260> just<00:02:18.709> a<00:02:18.799> bit<00:02:18.980> more<00:02:19.190> of

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
arousal approach to it remember it's

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.869 
arousal approach to it remember it's
about<00:02:21.620> showing<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:22.040> bit<00:02:22.190> more<00:02:22.370> of<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.579> matted

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
about showing a bit more of the matted

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.119 
about showing a bit more of the matted
up<00:02:22.940> Phil<00:02:23.360> but<00:02:24.140> it<00:02:24.230> still<00:02:24.410> should<00:02:24.650> be<00:02:24.799> quite

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
up Phil but it still should be quite

up Phil but it still should be quite
soft<00:02:25.489> and<00:02:25.700> quite<00:02:25.940> fluid<00:02:26.329> quite<00:02:26.540> beautiful<00:02:27.099> so

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
soft and quite fluid quite beautiful so

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.610 
soft and quite fluid quite beautiful so
the<00:02:28.310> pulling<00:02:28.609> out<00:02:28.730> with<00:02:29.000> brush<00:02:29.560> actually<00:02:30.560> is

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
the pulling out with brush actually is

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.840 
the pulling out with brush actually is
going<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.829> help<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.130> header<00:02:31.310> bounced<00:02:31.579> back

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
going to help the header bounced back

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.150 
going to help the header bounced back
and<00:02:32.120> create<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:32.959> bit<00:02:33.230> more<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:33.500> nicer<00:02:33.829> texture

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
and create a bit more of a nicer texture

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.430 
and create a bit more of a nicer texture
with<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.780> from<00:02:35.780> there<00:02:35.840> what<00:02:36.170> we're<00:02:36.260> going<00:02:36.350> to

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
with it from there what we're going to

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.729 
with it from there what we're going to
do<00:02:36.560> is<00:02:36.709> just<00:02:36.739> go<00:02:37.010> back<00:02:37.250> in<00:02:38.350> make<00:02:39.350> sure<00:02:39.380> that<00:02:39.680> you

have<00:02:39.889> all<00:02:40.069> of<00:02:40.130> that<00:02:40.220> texture<00:02:40.730> back<00:02:41.000> in<00:02:41.180> the

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
have all of that texture back in the

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.360 
have all of that texture back in the
forefront<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:42.260> then<00:02:42.650> just<00:02:42.859> take<00:02:43.010> some<00:02:43.190> of<00:02:43.310> the

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
forefront and then just take some of the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.770 
forefront and then just take some of the
finishing<00:02:43.819> spray<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:45.620> just<00:02:45.650> dust<00:02:46.099> and<00:02:46.280> get<00:02:46.400> in

just creating that filled with the

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:52.390 
just creating that filled with the
texture<00:02:49.220> of<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:50.650> so<00:02:51.650> now<00:02:51.799> that<00:02:51.950> we<00:02:52.040> finished

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
texture of it so now that we finished

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.920 
texture of it so now that we finished
applying<00:02:52.639> the<00:02:52.880> finishing<00:02:53.000> spray<00:02:53.450> now<00:02:53.750> we're
