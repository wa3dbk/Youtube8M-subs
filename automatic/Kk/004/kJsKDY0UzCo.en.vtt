00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:12.329
 xbox 720 and how you can read the title 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:15.059
 xbox 720 and xbox media center hobby 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:17.370
 dotcom consoles puts a name to what 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.470
 I was talking and I was in the video 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.780
 answer that is down here is worth the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.750
 video that I made the other day about that in 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.540
 the microsoft plans wanted 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.970
 divide in two is worth today the point of 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.300
 another way he commented on new things that 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.940
 hobby consoles dotcom comments and is that 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.510
 last November 18th let's remember 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.250
 all that the xbox world magazine 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.420
 I discovered that what was supposed to be 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.050
 the xbox 720 in what the web page of 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.680
 berge 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.239
 of reveals a new platform that 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.280
 would be being developed by the 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.649
 microsoft and that would come on par with the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.630
 next generation console though 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.719
 is focused on a different audience 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:04.409
 is worth this rumor is taking more and more 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.650
 force even up to national media 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:12.720
 very high level like young console 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.970
 at a very high speed xbox 720 according to 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.150
 the data remember all would show a 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.970
 CPU of four logical cores for each 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.180
 one of its four cores its memory of 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.590
 8 gb of ram would be enough 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.330
 powerful as to move games 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.910
 developed with the most engines 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.070
 pointers of the moment and in the absence of knowing 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.530
 what will your graphics card be 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.860
 we find before really an advance 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.740
 pretty important technological for a 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.270
 console is ok but it seems that this is not 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.210
 it will be the only console on which 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.340
 working microsoft according to the reports 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.760
 of this web page those of redmond have 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.760
 is developing a set up box is 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:57.030
 say a kind of media center based 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.040
 in the xbox 720 but somewhat layered in 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.290
 hardware its working its 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.240
 performance forgiveness would be the 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.210
 any mediacenter reproduction of 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.520
 music video images and navigation by 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.470
 internet but with the added power 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.160
 execute certain games 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.070

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.680

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.100
 pronounced about it and we had already 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.900
