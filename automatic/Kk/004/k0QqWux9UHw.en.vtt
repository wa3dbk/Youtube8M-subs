 200 and dolomites 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.310
 spells 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.810
 here I have all the ingredients morning there 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:21.170
 you just have to go there you just 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.310
 to go which one is to a minor me I 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.819
 myself kite sailing but 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.830
 farm m 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.160
 I just want to go back but 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.260
 mine so that's it I left after 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.050
 the ore on the other hand I made sense of it 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.830
 of each that I spent good 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:39.519
 so I do not know about you so I have 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.519
 taken by 100 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.700
 here I am going to start there I have 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.290
 done 10 and I will go back but 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.230
 without them staying in the bank 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.050
 so there with the 10 to resell them and 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.520
 to sell in that it's okay 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.910
 lose will allow you to roccat 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.430
 nietzsche if you bought with a 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.050
 small profit but does not want much 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.460
 but basically you're basically you do not 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.460
 did it said gerard for free 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.200
 it's patricia understood but you're going 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.940
 see 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.840
 so I resume the 10 keys 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.819
 as I have resumed I will go 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.019
 stay the deminers or you will ask 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.019
 better than his passer-by 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:27.470
 so I'm going to remake 10 is in all 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.470
 case I will have 20 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.150
 my time 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.110
 so here I am going to go get mixed race 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.890
 that I put in the bank 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:48.040
 so here I am my 28 street they are 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.040
 the 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.790
 in the mornings you just have to wing it 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.080
 romande 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.000
 you think that your needs you 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.280
 keep euros you go back 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.140
 free of charge compared to the Belgians 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.480
 so had to for those who fly and 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.599
 serves kamas you will resell them 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.599
 so I'm going to look at how it costs 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:13.750
 and ruth that's 320 miles 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.750
 yeah I'm going to resell them we 're going 310000 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:22.060
 and that's it it drives me crazy I'll have 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.380
 600 billion more so I'll have a 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.270
 million eight hundred thousand and I had 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.180
 started with a million five or so 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.520
 so that will make me 3 seems that ahmad more 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.930
 and if you art is doing more and more 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.570
 you would do more of that you will do more than 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.540
 comas this is a very simple trick 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.949
 that I did from time to time and I'm 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.570
 sorry for not having done more than 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:44.050
 videos but here I'm going to redo 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.830
