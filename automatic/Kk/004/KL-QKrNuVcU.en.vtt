00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:14.539
 hello and welcome back to 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.609
 a video so today once the budget 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:21.370
 plugin lures chain and this plug-in 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:24.170
 protects your boxes 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.180
 I am now on the blood on the 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.580
 Paper will protect you anyway 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.320
 can also protect it with world editors 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.360
 but for security you can do that now 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.219
 also doing so and very much 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.280
 Practically, I can give you a short march 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:45.379
 show why this plug-in is good too 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:48.859
 namely here the funnel to this 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.639
 one says to protect 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:55.789
 because on the pilot mika man 

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:58.760
 open funnel and that is not so good 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.319
 because there a lot of scrap do purely 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.359
 yes, now I can show you how 

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:04.519
 that works now and I will 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.560
 Although not the complete package show 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.840
 but already the most important things 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.369
 So we just have to shake that up 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.890
 do it and then the private and 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.079
 My name is only me 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.520
 I can access 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:18.320
 If I were a player I could do it myself 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.899
 Ohner not access would have to or 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.820
 then kill this kills and if 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.000
 he breaks this shield and comes for 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.509
 everyone on the server a message me 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.740
 have broken my fault but 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.240
 of course, which as without without any 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.219
 idea of a player doing the work 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:45.280
 then there is xxxx has from this 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:47.359
 player yes the box destroyed that is yes 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.619
 not so, too 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:53.179
 and yes, when I add a friend 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.649
 you would just do a right click and 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:59.990
 makes / chain like that also the city 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.149
 numbers so the number so we have 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.729
 this will be my name on the first 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.310
 the second and third and can stop 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.380
 easy abc 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.670
 now abc can also be added with build 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.220
 and yes you can also do the fourth 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.220
 Doing it is there was rich then 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.800
 dpa and now I can abc and 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.330
 cp on this box to grab 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.330
 yes that was it again with the 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.720
 project to the tournament and you're new 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.720
