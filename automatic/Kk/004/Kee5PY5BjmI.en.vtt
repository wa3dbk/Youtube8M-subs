a hammer or something just to show you
how<00:00:20.730> strong<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.150> could<00:00:21.270> be<00:00:21.680> standard<00:00:22.680> door<00:00:22.830> no

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100

how strong it could be standard door no
internal<00:00:23.580> zarif<00:00:23.939> though<00:00:24.060> all<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.480> internals

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
internal zarif though all the internals

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.890 
internal zarif though all the internals
are<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:24.990> but<00:00:25.109> no<00:00:25.230> no<00:00:25.590> parts<00:00:25.890> or<00:00:26.039> anything<00:00:26.189> on<00:00:26.460> it
