not have a ds4 aiming down sights

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.599 
not have a ds4 aiming down sights
however<00:01:35.049> if<00:01:35.229> you<00:01:35.320> use<00:01:35.469> a<00:01:35.499> sniper<00:01:35.829> rifle<00:01:35.979> and

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
none of the guns with scope you would be

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.880 
none of the guns with scope you would be
able<00:01:39.640> to<00:01:39.789> aim<00:01:40.030> down<00:01:40.299> the<00:01:40.359> site<00:01:40.810> with<00:01:40.990> bet<00:01:41.319> or

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
able to aim down the site with bet or

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.399 
able to aim down the site with bet or
zooming<00:01:42.340> it<00:01:42.520> so<00:01:43.299> there's<00:01:43.659> that<00:01:43.899> advantage<00:01:44.170> now

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
zooming it so there's that advantage now

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.109 
zooming it so there's that advantage now
obviously<00:01:45.219> if<00:01:45.340> you're<00:01:45.520> real<00:01:45.729> good<00:01:45.759> at<00:01:45.909> hip

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
obviously if you're real good at hip

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.209 
obviously if you're real good at hip
firing<00:01:46.420> then<00:01:47.170> you<00:01:47.319> should<00:01:47.499> have<00:01:47.530> no<00:01:47.649> problems

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
firing then you should have no problems

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:49.040 
firing then you should have no problems
game<00:01:48.429> now
