00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 exactly two years ago a castaway 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.450
 gay 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.090
 in this dam here if you do not remember is 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.700
 a giant origami boat that ended up 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.009
 folding in half and sinking in both 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.929
 first seconds navigation 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.940
 then for the beginning of 2013 was 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.220
 building another boat much more 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.160
 more resistant more prepared 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.099
 pebbles of this size here prevented 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.890
 the first video of the year was the canoe 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.939
 giant but you know it here in the manual 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.840
 of the world 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:39.629
 we never gave up I'm going to use it only 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.969
 cardboard brown paper glue 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:58.500
 it is enough to stick the paper and a little 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:01:01.230
 varnish to waterproof the boat to 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.660
 part of the structure is over and now 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.350
 It's time to take those screws out here. 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.119
 unable to kraft the boat for him 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.710
 become a little more globalized after 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.470
 pass the cream if I have an attention 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.729
 special to the background that was part of bro 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.220
 the other time 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.740
 I put 12 layers of cardboard here in the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.560
 and will also pay particular attention to the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.659
 edge that was another weakness of the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.670
 boat from two years ago 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.820
 so in this fashion here are six layers 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.210
 of cardboard and has a bit here 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.210
 inside 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.530

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.459
 and now it's time for truth 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.440
 First I'll put the guilherme is that 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.650
 Nephew time the gem at the end of 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.710
 videos and then we'll see if this barcon 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:03:05.390
 here my mother

 then about a couple of hours 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.990
 sailing with the boat started to drop 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.990
 the first old- fashioned jacks 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:05:19.020
 [Music] 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:25.240
