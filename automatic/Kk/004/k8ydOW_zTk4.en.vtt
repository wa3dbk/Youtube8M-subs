00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.150
 hello friends today in my recipes we are going to 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.580
 make a dough for crepes 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.679
 when we have the mesh we will only have 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.240
 have to prepare a pan and start 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.750
 believing enjoy sweets or crepes 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.750
 salty for that we need 2 eggs 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.869
 we have washed them before 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.589
 a pinch of salt 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.870
 some liquor if you have juice 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.210
 Orange also leaves a very flavor 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.690
 good some oil 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.690
 Y 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.850
 then we will pour the milk first 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.850
 let's move 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.329
 this 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.530
 so that the flour 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.530
 take the good 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.950
 we have to make sure there are no lumps 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.010
 and now as we have the flour 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.830
 let's add in the milk 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.390
 and taking into account that you do not have to 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.820
 to be a dough like the biscuits 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:29.600
 it has to be a liquid mass 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.110
 it will already be done in the pan with the 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.110
 Butter 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.880
 to the fire 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.690
 but as you can see the dough has to go 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.690
 staying 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.729
 with if you do not have rods you do not want 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.729
 doing it with rods can be done 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.290
 perfectly with the arm of the 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.950
 normal blender 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.020
 each one makes the pancake dough as more 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.180
 he likes and likes me with the touch that 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.910
 give the liquor 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.149
 and with a little orange juice or if 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:12.480
 you have a lemon lemon zest that 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:17.040
 already it is to taste of each the 4 usually 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.860
 leave a pretty special flavor 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.930
 and when we have the mass as you see a 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.040
 mass that is 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.550
 liquid 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.580
 then we can put the pan on the fire 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.700
 and the pan must be very hot 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.700
 we put with a piece of napkin the 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.090
 butter and when we have the fire 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.550
 we will have some perfect crepes we take 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.190
 with a saucepan to serve and we use that 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.280
 measure and each believes in one more pan or 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.750
 less than this of this diameter and then 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.819
 we just have to turn it around and 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.650
 put sweet milk nocilla what 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.650
 more you like it until soon
