00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.400 
one is they've got active inrush current
limiting<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.630> can<00:00:30.900> sort<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.170> stick<00:00:31.289> it

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
limiting so you can sort of stick it

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.780 
limiting so you can sort of stick it
over<00:00:31.500> them<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.859> one<00:00:32.279> circuit<00:00:32.669> without

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
over them on one circuit without

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.280 
over them on one circuit without
worrying<00:00:33.059> about<00:00:33.149> tripping<00:00:33.570> circuit<00:00:33.899> breakers

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
worrying about tripping circuit breakers

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.979 
worrying about tripping circuit breakers
they've<00:00:35.010> also<00:00:35.190> got<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.850> short-term<00:00:36.570> overload

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
they've also got a short-term overload

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.350 
they've also got a short-term overload
they're<00:00:37.140> guaranteed<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.680> supply<00:00:38.160> 50%<00:00:38.969> extra

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
they're guaranteed to supply 50% extra

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.799 
they're guaranteed to supply 50% extra
power<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.530> four<00:00:40.739> seconds<00:00:41.450> which<00:00:42.450> often

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
power for up to four seconds which often

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.540 
power for up to four seconds which often
means<00:00:42.989> there's<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.320> lot<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.620> design<00:00:43.800> margin

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
means there's a lot of design margin

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.040 
means there's a lot of design margin
built<00:00:44.730> into<00:00:45.120> things<00:00:45.270> like<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.480> magnetics<00:00:45.960> and

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
built into things like the magnetics and

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.990 
built into things like the magnetics and
the<00:00:46.110> capacitor<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.550> know<00:00:47.640> even<00:00:47.879> if<00:00:47.940> you're

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the capacitor so you know even if you're

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.029 
the capacitor so you know even if you're
not<00:00:48.149> taking<00:00:48.480> making<00:00:48.750> use<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.260> then<00:00:49.649> you

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
not taking making use of that then you

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.740 
not taking making use of that then you
know<00:00:50.160> give<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.460> good<00:00:50.640> confidence<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.510> yeah

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
know give you good confidence that yeah

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.000 
know give you good confidence that yeah
they're<00:00:51.960> not<00:00:52.079> being<00:00:52.260> over<00:00:52.469> stretched<00:00:52.770> when

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
they're not being over stretched when

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.479 
they're not being over stretched when
they're<00:00:53.160> running<00:00:53.250> even<00:00:53.730> at<00:00:53.820> their<00:00:53.910> full<00:00:54.149> load

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
they're running even at their full load

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.410 
they're running even at their full load
and<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.610> these<00:00:56.760> are<00:00:56.910> designed<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.270> mounting

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
and so these are designed for mounting

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.119 
and so these are designed for mounting
your<00:00:57.600> din<00:00:57.840> rail<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.260> idea<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.620> they<00:00:58.770> sort

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
your din rail so the idea is they sort

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.130 
your din rail so the idea is they sort
of<00:00:59.219> sit<00:00:59.579> vertically<00:00:59.969> like<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:00.989> get

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
of sit vertically like that and you get

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.840 
of sit vertically like that and you get
some<00:01:01.320> clear<00:01:01.620> air<00:01:01.649> flow<00:01:02.010> through<00:01:02.219> from<00:01:02.609> bottom

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
some clear air flow through from bottom

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.899 
some clear air flow through from bottom
to<00:01:02.879> top<00:01:03.000> with<00:01:03.329> no<00:01:03.449> fan<00:01:03.719> again<00:01:04.530> year<00:01:04.739> for<00:01:04.979> nearly

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
to top with no fan again year for nearly

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.490 
to top with no fan again year for nearly
a<00:01:05.970> thousand<00:01:06.270> watt<00:01:06.390> power<00:01:06.510> supply<00:01:06.570> no<00:01:07.110> fan<00:01:07.380> this

the<00:01:43.740> other<00:01:43.890> nice<00:01:44.070> feature<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.759> well<00:01:45.329> where

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
the other nice feature is well where

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.319 
the other nice feature is well where
they're<00:01:45.810> traumatic<00:01:46.259> as<00:01:46.409> well<00:01:47.090> they're<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:48.210> at

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
they're traumatic as well they're all at

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.080 
they're traumatic as well they're all at
the<00:01:48.390> bottom<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.350> they're<00:01:49.829> going<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.100> giving<00:01:50.970> it

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
the bottom so they're going to giving it

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.090 
the bottom so they're going to giving it
all<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.360> cold<00:01:51.570> air<00:01:51.750> coming<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.619> all<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
all the cold air coming in and all the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.800 
all the cold air coming in and all the
hot<00:01:53.250> components<00:01:53.909> are<00:01:54.060> above<00:01:54.270> them<00:01:54.450> yeah<00:01:54.659> there

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
hot components are above them yeah there

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.200 
hot components are above them yeah there
isn't<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> single<00:01:55.290> electrolytic<00:01:56.210> anywhere

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
isn't a single electrolytic anywhere

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.359 
isn't a single electrolytic anywhere
above<00:01:58.140> any<00:01:58.409> other<00:01:58.590> component<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.159> going<00:01:59.310> to

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
above any other component is going to

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.910 
above any other component is going to
get<00:01:59.490> hot<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.060> yeah<00:02:00.899> these<00:02:01.469> electric

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
get hot so yeah these electric

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.620 
get hot so yeah these electric
electrolytic<00:02:02.759> cell<00:02:03.000> shipping<00:02:03.329> designed

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
electrolytic cell shipping designed

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.990 
electrolytic cell shipping designed
specifically<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.200> be<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.740> know<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
specifically to be in that you know the

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.290 
specifically to be in that you know the
lowest<00:02:06.000> temperature<00:02:06.149> part<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:08.300> package

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
lowest temperature part of the package

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.530 
lowest temperature part of the package
to<00:02:09.660> maximize<00:02:10.530> reliability<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.540> they're

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
to maximize reliability so they're

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.700 
to maximize reliability so they're
little<00:02:12.720> bit<00:02:12.810> more<00:02:12.930> expensive

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
little bit more expensive

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.680 
little bit more expensive
the<00:02:13.950> in<00:02:14.010> real<00:02:14.160> power<00:02:14.400> supplies<00:02:14.760> but<00:02:15.030> Zoe's

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
the in real power supplies but Zoe's

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.690 
the in real power supplies but Zoe's
these<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.930> couple<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.200> times<00:02:16.290> before<00:02:16.560> they<00:02:17.040> you

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
these a couple of times before they you

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.310 
these a couple of times before they you
know<00:02:17.820> that<00:02:18.000> their<00:02:18.210> own<00:02:18.390> very<00:02:18.750> nice<00:02:18.930> piece<00:02:19.170> of

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
know that their own very nice piece of

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.050 
know that their own very nice piece of
kit<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.130> because<00:02:20.400> they're<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.880> they've

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
kit and so because they're that they've

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.570 
kit and so because they're that they've
got<00:02:21.180> high<00:02:21.300> efficiency<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:23.250> know<00:02:23.340> you've<00:02:23.490> got

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
got high efficiency you know you've got

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.660 
got high efficiency you know you've got
less<00:02:23.790> concerns<00:02:24.210> of<00:02:24.450> eighty<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.020> so<00:02:25.260> on<00:02:25.320> but

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
less concerns of eighty and so on but

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.820 
less concerns of eighty and so on but
yeah<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.260> construction<00:02:28.260> confuse<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.770> I

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
yeah the construction confuse and I

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.220 
yeah the construction confuse and I
think<00:02:29.100> yeah<00:02:29.250> they'd<00:02:29.430> given<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:30.120> sort<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.450> give

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
think yeah they'd given I sort of give

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.960 
think yeah they'd given I sort of give
you<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.380> nice<00:02:31.560> warm<00:02:31.860> fuzzy<00:02:32.520> feeling<00:02:32.850> of

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
you a nice warm fuzzy feeling of

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.400 
you a nice warm fuzzy feeling of
confidence<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.660> they<00:02:33.810> could<00:02:33.960> just<00:02:33.990> going<00:02:34.320> to

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
confidence that they could just going to

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.720 
confidence that they could just going to
work<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.860> you're<00:02:35.190> not<00:02:35.340> going<00:02:35.460> to<00:02:35.520> get<00:02:35.610> any

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
work and you're not going to get any

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.570 
work and you're not going to get any
palm<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.090> them<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.100> they've<00:02:38.250> made<00:02:38.370> by
