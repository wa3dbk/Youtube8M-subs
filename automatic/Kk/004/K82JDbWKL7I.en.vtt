definitely have learned my lesson
because<00:03:55.420> I<00:03:56.820> you<00:03:57.820> you<00:03:58.360> mean<00:03:58.600> sleep<00:03:58.959> you<00:03:59.560> have<00:03:59.590> to

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
because I you you mean sleep you have to

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.930 
because I you you mean sleep you have to
have<00:04:00.130> sleep<00:04:00.519> it's<00:04:00.760> very<00:04:01.000> important<00:04:01.510> so<00:04:02.940> I'm

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
have sleep it's very important so I'm

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.660 
have sleep it's very important so I'm
not<00:04:04.090> gonna<00:04:04.239> do<00:04:04.420> that<00:04:04.600> again<00:04:05.310> one<00:04:06.310> thing<00:04:06.489> that's

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
not gonna do that again one thing that's

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.949 
not gonna do that again one thing that's
really<00:04:06.850> weird<00:04:07.180> that<00:04:07.329> I've<00:04:07.480> noticed<00:04:07.660> is<00:04:07.930> that

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
really weird that I've noticed is that

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.170 
really weird that I've noticed is that
I've<00:04:08.620> had<00:04:08.860> a<00:04:08.920> lot<00:04:09.010> more<00:04:09.280> free<00:04:09.519> time<00:04:09.730> this

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
I've had a lot more free time this

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.530 
I've had a lot more free time this
quarter<00:04:10.600> and<00:04:10.980> when<00:04:11.980> I<00:04:12.010> have<00:04:12.310> more<00:04:12.610> free<00:04:12.850> time<00:04:12.880> I

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
quarter and when I have more free time I

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.740 
quarter and when I have more free time I
as<00:04:14.440> I<00:04:14.680> would<00:04:15.160> think<00:04:15.489> that<00:04:15.880> I<00:04:16.539> would<00:04:16.599> actually

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
as I would think that I would actually

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.740 
as I would think that I would actually
get<00:04:17.140> more<00:04:17.260> sleep

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
get more sleep

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.300 
get more sleep
actually<00:04:18.049> get<00:04:18.170> less<00:04:18.350> sleep<00:04:18.410> because<00:04:19.070> I<00:04:19.100> have

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
actually get less sleep because I have

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.319 
actually get less sleep because I have
nothing<00:04:19.579> to<00:04:19.609> do<00:04:19.820> I'm<00:04:19.940> not<00:04:20.060> worried<00:04:20.269> about

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
nothing to do I'm not worried about

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.270 
nothing to do I'm not worried about
anything<00:04:20.630> I<00:04:20.959> just<00:04:21.170> tend<00:04:21.410> to<00:04:21.470> stay<00:04:21.709> up<00:04:21.890> and

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
anything I just tend to stay up and

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.460 
anything I just tend to stay up and
that's<00:04:23.120> really<00:04:23.420> not<00:04:23.630> good<00:04:23.870> for<00:04:23.900> me<00:04:24.200> and<00:04:24.410> I've

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
that's really not good for me and I've

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.730 
that's really not good for me and I've
been<00:04:24.620> staying<00:04:24.860> up<00:04:25.130> even<00:04:26.120> later<00:04:26.390> in<00:04:26.510> later<00:04:26.840> than
