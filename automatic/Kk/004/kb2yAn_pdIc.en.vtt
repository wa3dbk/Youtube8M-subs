00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.480
 we are now seeing a big deal on the final day after a week 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.950
 Final day arrived 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.120
 Of course, there are now five engines in five groups 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.779
 to lead 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:13.779
 and although the lead plays stoked 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:16.659
 the route through the balance sheets 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:19.739
 the Honda CB and she would be 600 f 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.159
 in here we have the 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:24.970
 here the countries are growing 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.679
 I'm the BMW k 1300 gt e 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.679
 and the KTM are sooner 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.250
 RSS it works like this we drive a big test round 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.110
 belongs to several passes and next to it fits all and Vauxhall scheduled and 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.110
 This is the first stop on the Stelvio Pass 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.230
 is 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.140
 for the works council 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.040
 which consists of two colleagues from the motorcycle 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.230
 In addition, from any colleague from Sweden a measure quarters from one 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.480
 Spain and one from Italy 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.100
 and how it is now the result at the Stelvio Gerd Velte photo has 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.220
 eliminated 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.910
 because in this case a bit sad because 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.910
 yes, once elected vocal multiculturalism 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.020
 sometimes it surprises how good the engine's worth is of course fun without it 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.610
 engine 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.420
 that will not do cheap percent more turns very well 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.400
 but now I am power and 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.460
 The concert of the engine may not be ideal for these routes 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.100
 All right then we are waiting eagerly for the next result
