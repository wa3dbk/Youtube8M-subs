00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.350 
that people who do may not know all
their<00:00:29.890> genes<00:00:30.130> are<00:00:30.369> named<00:00:30.550> after<00:00:30.760> rock<00:00:31.090> stars

so that's rock revival here I got the 7
line<00:00:36.640> genes<00:00:37.109> so<00:00:38.550> these<00:00:39.550> are<00:00:39.699> both<00:00:39.819> dirty<00:00:40.089> SAS

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
line genes so these are both dirty SAS

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.939 
line genes so these are both dirty SAS
36<00:00:41.699> and<00:00:42.699> certain<00:00:43.059> micro<00:00:43.329> levels<00:00:43.690> or<00:00:43.839> 32<00:00:44.379> and<00:00:44.800> so

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
36 and certain micro levels or 32 and so

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.700 
36 and certain micro levels or 32 and so
on<00:00:44.979> the<00:00:45.579> truth<00:00:45.789> lizards<00:00:46.149> are<00:00:46.269> 34<00:00:46.719> but<00:00:47.499> if<00:00:47.620> you

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
on the truth lizards are 34 but if you

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.770 
on the truth lizards are 34 but if you
don't<00:00:47.920> know<00:00:48.100> ultra<00:00:48.999> Melissa's<00:00:49.329> genes<00:00:49.539> are

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
don't know ultra Melissa's genes are

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.840 
don't know ultra Melissa's genes are
inserted<00:00:50.170> 34<00:00:50.589> so<00:00:51.190> that's<00:00:51.429> just<00:00:51.549> the<00:00:51.699> way<00:00:51.789> they

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
inserted 34 so that's just the way they

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.439 
inserted 34 so that's just the way they
make<00:00:52.059> them<00:00:52.210> so<00:00:52.389> I'll<00:00:53.170> go<00:00:53.289> through<00:00:53.319> genes<00:00:54.449> these

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
make them so I'll go through genes these

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.849 
make them so I'll go through genes these
are<00:00:55.600> true<00:00:55.749> ilysm<00:00:56.139> these<00:00:56.319> are<00:00:56.499> the<00:00:58.859> destroyed
