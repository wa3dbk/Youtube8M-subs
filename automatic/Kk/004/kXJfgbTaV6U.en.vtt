tank reservoir which is temporary we're

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.890 
tank reservoir which is temporary we're
going<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:18.050> basically<00:00:19.050> put<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:20.510> on<00:00:21.510> rainwater

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
going to basically put this on rainwater

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.920 
going to basically put this on rainwater
that's<00:00:22.380> been<00:00:22.560> sitting<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.539> then<00:00:24.539> we<00:00:24.750> will

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
that's been sitting and then we will

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.870 
that's been sitting and then we will
have<00:00:25.109> taps<00:00:25.500> coming<00:00:25.890> out<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.250> at<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.699> bottom

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
have taps coming out of it at the bottom

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.700 
have taps coming out of it at the bottom
I<00:00:27.269> have<00:00:27.480> another<00:00:27.779> tank<00:00:28.080> I'm<00:00:28.260> working<00:00:28.560> on<00:00:28.650> now

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
I have another tank I'm working on now

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.370 
I have another tank I'm working on now
and<00:00:29.250> then<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.119> two<00:00:30.330> taps<00:00:30.630> at<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> bottom<00:00:31.260> will

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
and then the two taps at the bottom will

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.959 
and then the two taps at the bottom will
take<00:00:31.560> out<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.859> waste<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> fish<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.709 
take out the waste of the fish and the
crayfish<00:00:34.130> which<00:00:35.130> will<00:00:35.340> be<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.550> there<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.910> then

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
crayfish which will be in there and then

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.030 
crayfish which will be in there and then
feed<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.649> plants<00:00:38.040> over<00:00:38.969> here<00:00:39.739> so<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.890> we'll

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
feed the plants over here so that we'll

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.590 
feed the plants over here so that we'll
have<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.340> running<00:00:41.520> through<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.030> fish<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
have it running through the fish and the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.260 
have it running through the fish and the
crayfish<00:00:43.590> before<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.399> gets<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> garden

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
crayfish before it gets to the garden

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.170 
crayfish before it gets to the garden
now<00:00:46.200> we<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.530> some<00:00:46.800> sprouts<00:00:47.640> already<00:00:47.969> coming

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
now we have some sprouts already coming

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.260 
now we have some sprouts already coming
up<00:00:48.360> here<00:00:49.280> nothing<00:00:50.280> coming<00:00:50.489> up<00:00:50.640> here<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.000> corn

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
up here nothing coming up here the corn

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.250 
up here nothing coming up here the corn
still<00:00:51.629> germinating<00:00:52.969> we<00:00:53.969> have<00:00:54.180> tomato<00:00:54.989> plant

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
still germinating we have tomato plant

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.439 
still germinating we have tomato plant
under<00:00:55.469> here<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.550> I'll<00:00:56.610> show<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.120> rack

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
under here and I'll show you this rack

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.160 
under here and I'll show you this rack
because<00:00:57.989> last<00:00:58.440> year<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.800> used<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.190> rack<00:00:59.430> and<00:01:00.170> then

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
because last year I used a rack and then

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.590 
because last year I used a rack and then
when<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> cucumbers<00:01:02.160> grew<00:01:02.430> up<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.850> put<00:01:03.480> them

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
when the cucumbers grew up I put them

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.509 
when the cucumbers grew up I put them
through<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.019> rack<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.589> cucumbers<00:01:05.339> grew

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
through the rack and the cucumbers grew

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.820 
through the rack and the cucumbers grew
on<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.850> rack<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.689> you're<00:01:07.320> protected

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
on the rack so that you're protected

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.030 
on the rack so that you're protected
from<00:01:07.979> bugs<00:01:08.360> so<00:01:09.360> that's<00:01:09.689> my<00:01:09.900> tip<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.590> most<00:01:10.799> and

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
from bugs so that's my tip to most and

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.670 
from bugs so that's my tip to most and
then<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.150> also<00:01:12.540> did<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.960> with<00:01:13.080> tomato<00:01:13.409> plant

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
then I also did that with tomato plant

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.530 
then I also did that with tomato plant
so<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.040> tomatoes<00:01:14.400> will<00:01:14.729> sit<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.150> rack

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
so that tomatoes will sit on the rack

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.560 
so that tomatoes will sit on the rack
and<00:01:15.810> those<00:01:16.560> will<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.799> gone<00:01:17.040> by<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.310> time

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
and those will be gone by that time

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.499 
and those will be gone by that time
here's<00:01:18.570> our<00:01:18.810> blueberry<00:01:19.500> plant<00:01:20.390> we're<00:01:21.390> going

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
here's our blueberry plant we're going

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.740 
here's our blueberry plant we're going
to<00:01:22.549> transfer<00:01:23.549> our<00:01:23.729> seedlings<00:01:24.060> into<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
to transfer our seedlings into the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.230 
to transfer our seedlings into the
ground<00:01:24.990> where<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.500> empty<00:01:25.770> space<00:01:26.119> we<00:01:27.119> have

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
ground where we have empty space we have

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.140 
ground where we have empty space we have
onions<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.810> stuff<00:01:27.960> over<00:01:28.200> there<00:01:28.970> we<00:01:29.970> haven't

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
onions and stuff over there we haven't

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.850 
onions and stuff over there we haven't
had<00:01:30.270> any<00:01:30.299> real<00:01:30.720> full<00:01:31.020> day<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.200> Sun<00:01:31.500> yet<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:31.829> I

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
had any real full day of Sun yet so I

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.170 
had any real full day of Sun yet so I
haven't<00:01:32.070> been<00:01:32.189> able<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.490> see<00:01:32.939> what<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
haven't been able to see what the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.749 
haven't been able to see what the
temperature<00:01:33.659> will<00:01:33.840> get<00:01:34.079> up<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.729> right<00:01:35.729> now

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
temperature will get up to right now

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.050 
temperature will get up to right now
we're<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.180> about<00:01:36.420> 60<00:01:37.290> or<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.650> 58<00:01:38.280> degrees

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
we're in about 60 or so 58 degrees

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.139 
we're in about 60 or so 58 degrees
inside<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.860> 45<00:01:40.860> 50<00:01:41.790> maybe<00:01:41.939> outside<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:44.149> there

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
inside and 45 50 maybe outside so there

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.929 
inside and 45 50 maybe outside so there
you<00:01:45.180> go<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.600> micro<00:01:45.930> garden<00:01:46.320> farm<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.939> coming

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
you go the micro garden farm is coming

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.819 
you go the micro garden farm is coming
along<00:01:48.090> well<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.450> we<00:01:48.689> also<00:01:48.869> put<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.470> roof

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
along well and we also put the roof

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.830 
along well and we also put the roof
peaked<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.850> center<00:01:51.180> now<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.659> rain

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
peaked in the center now so the rain

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.310 
peaked in the center now so the rain
water

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
water

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
water
drip<00:01:52.560> off<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.950> sides<00:01:53.240> into<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.450> corners<00:01:55.340> and

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
drip off the sides into the corners and

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.370 
drip off the sides into the corners and
I<00:01:57.030> might<00:01:57.240> actually<00:01:57.450> be<00:01:57.690> able<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.020> feed<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
I might actually be able to feed the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.030 
I might actually be able to feed the
farm<00:01:58.650> by<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.930> but<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.960> also<00:02:01.170> might<00:02:01.470> use<00:02:01.680> test

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
farm by that but I also might use test

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.410 
farm by that but I also might use test
water<00:02:02.880> from<00:02:03.260> the<00:02:04.260> tap<00:02:04.770> which<00:02:05.580> will<00:02:05.790> be<00:02:05.910> diluted

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
water from the tap which will be diluted

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.700 
water from the tap which will be diluted
more<00:02:06.810> than<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.050> rain<00:02:07.260> if<00:02:07.470> it<00:02:07.590> is

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
more than the rain if it is

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.370 
more than the rain if it is
contaminating<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.520> range<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.320> we'll<00:02:10.320> be

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
contaminating the range and we'll be

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.470 
contaminating the range and we'll be
able<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.619> do<00:02:10.800> test<00:02:11.670> with<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.150> Geiger<00:02:12.450> counter

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
able to do test with the Geiger counter

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.900 
able to do test with the Geiger counter
on<00:02:13.050> all<00:02:13.410> these<00:02:13.620> planets<00:02:14.100> versus<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.610> outdoor

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
on all these planets versus the outdoor

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.630 
on all these planets versus the outdoor
plants<00:02:15.330> as<00:02:15.480> well<00:02:16.200> as<00:02:16.530> spinach<00:02:16.950> spinach<00:02:17.160> and

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
plants as well as spinach spinach and

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.470 
plants as well as spinach spinach and
other<00:02:18.420> things<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:20.000> limit<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.120> exposure<00:02:22.010> and

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
other things and limit the exposure and

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.320 
other things and limit the exposure and
that<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.690> what<00:02:24.900> we<00:02:25.020> have<00:02:25.050> set<00:02:25.410> up<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:27.030> another

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
that is what we have set up so another

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.580 
that is what we have set up so another
week<00:02:27.570> or<00:02:27.720> two<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:27.989> we'll<00:02:28.080> start<00:02:28.290> doing

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
week or two and we'll start doing

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.550 
week or two and we'll start doing
readings<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:30.600> when<00:02:30.870> we<00:02:30.959> get<00:02:31.110> our<00:02:31.260> Geiger

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
readings and when we get our Geiger

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.770 
readings and when we get our Geiger
counters<00:02:31.920> we're<00:02:32.070> getting<00:02:32.250> two<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.459> them<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:32.880> we

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
counters we're getting two of them so we

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.960 
counters we're getting two of them so we
will<00:02:33.959> have<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.200> double<00:02:34.620> check<00:02:34.860> on<00:02:35.340> all<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.850> the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
will have a double check on all of the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.890 
will have a double check on all of the
readings<00:02:37.310> there<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.430> go<00:02:38.550> small<00:02:38.910> greenhouse

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
readings there you go small greenhouse

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.729 
readings there you go small greenhouse
garden<00:02:40.530> in<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.130> city<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.810> tomatoes<00:02:43.440> beans

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
garden in the city and tomatoes beans

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.110 
garden in the city and tomatoes beans
peas<00:02:44.190> corn<00:02:44.959> spinach<00:02:45.959> asparagus<00:02:47.120> raspberries

blueberries cherry tomatoes carrots and

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.410 
blueberries cherry tomatoes carrots and
onions<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:55.980> quite<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.850> bit<00:02:56.970> of<00:02:57.060> food<00:02:57.209> hopefully

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
onions so quite a bit of food hopefully

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.900 
onions so quite a bit of food hopefully
and<00:02:57.959> we'll<00:02:58.410> use<00:02:58.650> this<00:02:59.040> rack<00:02:59.310> for<00:02:59.549> germination

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
and we'll use this rack for germination

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.400 
and we'll use this rack for germination
and<00:03:00.120> then<00:03:00.269> we'll<00:03:00.390> put<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.660> over<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.900> cucumbers

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
and then we'll put it over the cucumbers

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.840 
and then we'll put it over the cucumbers
as<00:03:01.560> well<00:03:01.739> as<00:03:01.890> some<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.310> tomatoes<00:03:02.430> maybe

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
as well as some of the tomatoes maybe

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.050 
as well as some of the tomatoes maybe
and<00:03:03.260> grow<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.380> cucumbers<00:03:04.860> on<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.070> racks<00:03:05.430> well

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
and grow the cucumbers on the racks well

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.170 
and grow the cucumbers on the racks well
the<00:03:06.269> plant<00:03:06.510> grows<00:03:06.630> up<00:03:06.870> through<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.230> rack<00:03:08.180> so

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
the plant grows up through the rack so

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.830 
the plant grows up through the rack so
there<00:03:09.390> is<00:03:09.570> my<00:03:10.070> urban<00:03:11.070> cyber<00:03:11.489> garden<00:03:12.180> for<00:03:12.720> all

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
there is my urban cyber garden for all

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.020 
there is my urban cyber garden for all
you<00:03:13.079> people<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.560> check<00:03:14.310> out<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:14.790> hopefully

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030
