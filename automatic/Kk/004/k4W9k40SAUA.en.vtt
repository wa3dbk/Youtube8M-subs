00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
steel is h1 which I'll get back to

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.529 
steel is h1 which I'll get back to
there's<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.810> lot<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.050> talk<00:00:19.170> about<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:20.180> it<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.510> a

I've got the yellow of our own handles
which<00:00:30.359> are<00:00:30.510> not<00:00:30.779> steel<00:00:31.170> lined<00:00:31.470> which<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.160> good

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
which are not steel lined which is good

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.400 
which are not steel lined which is good
which<00:00:32.460> makes<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.759> very<00:00:32.910> light<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:34.020> has<00:00:34.200> a

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
quite fond of this pocket clip i have a

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.190 
quite fond of this pocket clip i have a
big<00:00:43.590> fan<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.800> spider<00:00:44.040> coat<00:00:44.219> pocket<00:00:44.520> clips<00:00:45.200> ok

big fan of spider coat pocket clips ok
let's<00:00:46.500> start<00:00:46.620> off<00:00:46.829> with<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.219> h1<00:00:47.760> steel<00:00:48.559> I<00:00:49.559> have

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
let's start off with the h1 steel I have

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.160 
let's start off with the h1 steel I have
noticed<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.000> fingerprints<00:00:51.510> really<00:00:51.719> badly<00:00:51.899> but

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
noticed it fingerprints really badly but

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.160 
noticed it fingerprints really badly but
that's<00:00:52.320> not<00:00:52.500> really<00:00:52.800> an<00:00:52.980> issue<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.760> um<00:00:54.170> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
that's not really an issue but um the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.439 
that's not really an issue but um the
thing<00:00:55.410> with<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.620> steel<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.969> steel<00:00:57.239> does

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
thing with the steel is this steel does

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.650 
thing with the steel is this steel does
not<00:00:57.600> rust<00:00:57.809> period<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.129> doesn't<00:00:59.660> when

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
not rust period it just doesn't when

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.330 
not rust period it just doesn't when
they<00:01:00.750> make<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.109> steel<00:01:01.410> instead<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.190> using

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
they make the steel instead of using

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.189 
they make the steel instead of using
carbon<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.300> steel<00:01:03.480> they<00:01:03.719> actually<00:01:03.989> use<00:01:04.110> in

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
carbon in the steel they actually use in

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.560 
carbon in the steel they actually use in
nitrogen<00:01:04.500> atom<00:01:04.890> which<00:01:05.489> i<00:01:05.760> find<00:01:06.060> interesting<00:01:06.210> I

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
nitrogen atom which i find interesting I

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.390 
nitrogen atom which i find interesting I
want<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.780> learn<00:01:06.840> how<00:01:06.900> they<00:01:07.170> do<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.470> but<00:01:08.159> um

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
want to learn how they do that but um

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.030 
want to learn how they do that but um
what<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.240> does<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.380> doesn't<00:01:10.770> rust

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
what it does is it just it doesn't rust

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.760 
what it does is it just it doesn't rust
so<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.820> actually<00:01:12.450> bought<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.020> as<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.320> fishing

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
so I actually bought this as a fishing

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.490 
so I actually bought this as a fishing
knife<00:01:13.950> i'm<00:01:14.159> an<00:01:14.400> avid<00:01:14.549> fisherman<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:16.320> is

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
knife i'm an avid fisherman and this is

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.050 
knife i'm an avid fisherman and this is
like<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.950> greatest<00:01:17.130> life<00:01:17.460> I've<00:01:17.700> ever<00:01:17.850> used

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
like the greatest life I've ever used

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.399 
like the greatest life I've ever used
for<00:01:18.299> fishing<00:01:18.450> ever<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:21.479> hot<00:01:21.869> grill<00:01:22.049> design<00:01:22.200> is

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
for fishing ever the hot grill design is

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.690 
for fishing ever the hot grill design is
great<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.100> get<00:01:23.220> some<00:01:23.400> fishing<00:01:23.580> line

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
great so if you get some fishing line

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.789 
great so if you get some fishing line
imagine<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.750> have<00:01:24.780> fishing<00:01:25.049> line<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.710> get

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
imagine I have fishing line you can get

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.050 
imagine I have fishing line you can get
it<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:25.979> loop<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:26.729> go<00:01:26.820> you

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
it you can loop it and you can go you

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.390 
it you can loop it and you can go you
can<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.330> pull<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.080> cuts<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.920> great

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
can just pull it and it cuts just great

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.280 
can just pull it and it cuts just great
it's<00:01:29.880> also<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.180> great<00:01:30.329> self-defense<00:01:31.049> knife

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
it's also a great self-defense knife

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.440 
it's also a great self-defense knife
because<00:01:31.619> then<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.220> Hawk<00:01:32.759> bill<00:01:33.000> design<00:01:33.329> is

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
because then that Hawk bill design is

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.520 
because then that Hawk bill design is
just<00:01:33.630> face<00:01:34.409> slashing<00:01:35.570> but<00:01:36.570> um<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:37.229> opens

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
just face slashing but um it opens

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.280 
just face slashing but um it opens
relatively<00:01:38.340> fast<00:01:38.579> as<00:01:38.850> most<00:01:39.630> spider<00:01:39.869> ko's<00:01:40.079> do

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
relatively fast as most spider ko's do

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.010 
relatively fast as most spider ko's do
it<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> lock<00:01:41.670> back<00:01:41.880> which<00:01:42.210> I'm<00:01:42.450> not<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.689> normal

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
it is a lock back which I'm not a normal

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.380 
it is a lock back which I'm not a normal
big<00:01:43.799> fan<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.070> their<00:01:44.579> kind<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.880> an<00:01:44.970> issue<00:01:45.090> but

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
big fan of their kind of an issue but

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.310 
big fan of their kind of an issue but
because<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:47.000> that's<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.210> called<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.720> can't

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
because the that's it called I can't

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.260 
because the that's it called I can't
remember<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:49.799> called<00:01:49.829> but<00:01:50.040> on<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
remember what it's called but on the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.690 
remember what it's called but on the
space<00:01:51.570> between<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.380> pivot<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.009> blade<00:01:53.310> is

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
space between the pivot and the blade is

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.120

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
stuff I think this is one of the

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.920 
stuff I think this is one of the
greatest<00:03:12.579> blade<00:03:12.910> shapes<00:03:13.150> ever<00:03:13.359> because<00:03:13.630> you

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
greatest blade shapes ever because you

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.199 
greatest blade shapes ever because you
can<00:03:14.079> just<00:03:14.109> you<00:03:15.010> can<00:03:15.040> do<00:03:15.220> basically<00:03:15.670> anything<00:03:15.880> I

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
can just you can do basically anything I

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.580 
can just you can do basically anything I
mean<00:03:16.329> it's<00:03:16.480> not<00:03:16.630> good<00:03:16.900> for<00:03:16.930> thrust<00:03:17.350> cuts

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
mean it's not good for thrust cuts

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.460 
mean it's not good for thrust cuts
because<00:03:18.040> of<00:03:18.220> that<00:03:18.370> but<00:03:18.880> for<00:03:19.269> slashing<00:03:19.720> both

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470
