00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
different question 20 years ago I

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.279 
different question 20 years ago I
thought<00:04:20.889> it<00:04:21.370> was<00:04:21.729> important<00:04:22.360> to<00:04:22.479> try<00:04:22.930> to<00:04:22.990> do

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
thought it was important to try to do

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.320 
thought it was important to try to do
something<00:04:23.620> about<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:24.550> educational

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
something about the educational

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.290 
something about the educational
disparities<00:04:25.840> in<00:04:26.139> our<00:04:26.410> nation<00:04:26.910> but<00:04:27.910> it<00:04:28.030> didn't

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
disparities in our nation but it didn't

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.750

occur<00:04:28.630> to<00:04:28.660> me<00:04:28.810> then<00:04:29.259> that<00:04:29.530> we<00:04:30.160> could<00:04:30.400> literally

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
occur to me then that we could literally

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.540 
occur to me then that we could literally
realize<00:04:31.860> educational<00:04:32.860> excellence<00:04:33.190> and

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550

teaching core and an alumni force

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.370 
teaching core and an alumni force
ultimately<00:05:21.130> tens<00:05:21.610> of<00:05:21.789> thousands<00:05:22.389> strong<00:05:22.690> that

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
ultimately tens of thousands strong that

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.870 
ultimately tens of thousands strong that
is<00:05:23.530> a<00:05:23.560> formidable<00:05:24.099> force<00:05:24.669> for<00:05:25.090> change<00:05:25.120> i<00:05:26.490> am<00:05:27.490> so

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
is a formidable force for change i am so

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.629 
is a formidable force for change i am so
glad<00:05:27.909> i<00:05:28.599> started<00:05:29.320> in<00:05:29.470> when<00:05:29.710> I<00:05:29.740> did<00:05:30.099> because

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
glad i started in when I did because

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.870 
glad i started in when I did because
there<00:05:31.389> is<00:05:31.570> simply<00:05:31.900> so<00:05:32.470> much<00:05:32.860> to<00:05:33.130> be<00:05:33.250> done<00:05:33.490> and

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
there is simply so much to be done and

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.080 
there is simply so much to be done and
not<00:05:34.810> only<00:05:34.990> here<00:05:35.200> in<00:05:35.740> this<00:05:36.190> country<00:05:36.460> but<00:05:36.909> also

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
not only here in this country but also
