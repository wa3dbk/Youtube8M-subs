00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.530 
be completely honest I don't think I
have<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.259> great<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.829> an<00:01:50.399> upload<00:01:50.700> schedule<00:01:50.939> I

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
have that great of an upload schedule I

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.120 
have that great of an upload schedule I
used<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.899> do<00:01:52.079> every<00:01:52.439> like<00:01:52.590> monday<00:01:52.979> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
used to do every like monday and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.740 
used to do every like monday and
thursday<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.880> that's<00:01:54.149> just<00:01:54.299> kind<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.600> gone

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
thursday but that's just kind of gone

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.510 
thursday but that's just kind of gone
off<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.320> definitely<00:01:55.649> try<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.009> upload<00:01:56.310> at<00:01:56.490> least

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
off I definitely try to upload at least

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.450 
off I definitely try to upload at least
every<00:01:57.060> week<00:01:57.390> if<00:01:58.290> it's<00:01:58.649> any<00:01:58.950> less<00:01:59.189> than<00:01:59.250> that

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
every week if it's any less than that

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.530 
every week if it's any less than that
and<00:01:59.759> I'll<00:01:59.820> think<00:02:00.000> people<00:02:00.240> are<00:02:00.329> going<00:02:00.450> to

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
and I'll think people are going to

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.010 
and I'll think people are going to
really

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
really

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.630 
really
continuously<00:02:01.649> watch<00:02:01.859> your<00:02:02.039> videos<00:02:02.310> because

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
continuously watch your videos because

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.160 
continuously watch your videos because
they're<00:02:02.759> gonna<00:02:02.850> be<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.090> where<00:02:03.329> are<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.899> ads

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
they're gonna be like where are you ads

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.230 
they're gonna be like where are you ads
for<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.829> editing<00:02:05.130> question<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.700> think<00:02:05.729> it's

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
for the editing question I think it's

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.270 
for the editing question I think it's
important<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.899> kind<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.649> break<00:02:07.859> up<00:02:08.099> your

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
important to kind of break up your

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.800 
important to kind of break up your
editing<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.849> just<00:02:09.030> sit<00:02:09.149> down<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.390> edit<00:02:09.690> a

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
editing you just sit down and edit a

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.360 
editing you just sit down and edit a
video<00:02:09.929> for<00:02:10.289> like<00:02:10.410> five<00:02:10.590> hours<00:02:10.619> it's<00:02:11.099> not<00:02:11.250> going

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
video for like five hours it's not going

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.680 
video for like five hours it's not going
to<00:02:11.459> be<00:02:11.519> that<00:02:11.550> great<00:02:11.849> you're<00:02:12.209> gonna<00:02:12.360> be<00:02:12.450> tired

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
to be that great you're gonna be tired

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.180 
to be that great you're gonna be tired
you're<00:02:13.500> gonna<00:02:13.590> lose<00:02:13.769> a<00:02:13.830> lot<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.069> your

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
you're gonna lose a lot of your

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.800 
you're gonna lose a lot of your
creativity<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:15.000> definitely<00:02:15.300> just<00:02:15.480> break<00:02:15.660> it

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
creativity so definitely just break it

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.839 
creativity so definitely just break it
up<00:02:15.930> into<00:02:16.140> maybe<00:02:16.440> like<00:02:16.709> two<00:02:16.980> hour<00:02:17.129> sessions<00:02:17.700> or

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
up into maybe like two hour sessions or

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.699 
up into maybe like two hour sessions or
something<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.900> think<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.230> just<00:02:19.260> works<00:02:19.590> a

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
something and I think that just works a

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.289 
something and I think that just works a
lot<00:02:19.830> better<00:02:19.890> for<00:02:20.280> me<00:02:20.430> personally<00:02:20.670> Chloe

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
lot better for me personally Chloe

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.640 
lot better for me personally Chloe

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
thinking of something in fashion

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.409

merchandising because I love fashion and

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.659 
merchandising because I love fashion and
i<00:04:59.350> really<00:04:59.590> like<00:04:59.770> kind<00:05:00.070> of<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.310> whole<00:05:00.490> like

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
i really like kind of the whole like

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.000

such so i think that would maybe be a
good<00:05:05.020> place<00:05:05.289> but<00:05:05.680> for<00:05:05.950> now<00:05:06.100> I<00:05:06.539> have<00:05:07.539> no<00:05:07.870> idea
