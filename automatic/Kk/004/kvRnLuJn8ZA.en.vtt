00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 it's my seventh season of the trophy 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.009
 andros with my olive son who is him 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.200
 the real pilot and for once this is the 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.059
 father who follows the following his son and 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.059
 I try to follow as I can 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.710
 progress of race in race of season 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.650
 in season 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.939
 two sleeves we eat because good I 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.199
 be part of the amateurs who come 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.109
 have fun at the trophy andros 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.550
 so I 'm not doing any training I see 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.109
 I'm going to race every time 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.580
 and every season it's a 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.090
 rediscovered this year we changed 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.669
 stable 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.579
 we changed car so it took 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.800
 some adaptation sleeves and the 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.899
 isola I think we have a track that me 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.340
 i love that olivier likes he did 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.559
 a podium last year so I hope 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.379
 that his second caliph will be good 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.920
 so we hope to have fun and figure well 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.590
 in the ranking 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.430
 change of car has changed stable 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.500
 the chassis instinct a little bit 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.820
 difference it's a little motricity 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.739
 little different it's a weight of the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.980
 different car are settings 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.600
 to adapt to pilots and that the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.340
 pilot adapts to the car so it's 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.979
 a learning that lasts a few 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.720
 weeks and who gets in the race if we 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.220
 had been able to do some testing before of course 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.439
 we could have done all these adjustments 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.780
 before then there the car will settle the 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.180
 pilot are gradually adjusting themselves 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.860
 early weekend in isola was nice 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.970
 for me, I had a lot of fun 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.040
 While the leads Pilotage 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.960
 ice cream it's something like 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.369
 that we do not imagine doing a day on 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.020
 road that's why we come back from 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.280
 season because we have 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.680
 sensations on the ice that are 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.390
 absolutely unique with its 350 horses 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.310
 behind with 4-wheel drive and 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.930
 guidelines with circuits that are 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.560
 beautiful sometimes at a stop sometimes 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.579
 very quickly 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.710
 so we try to slip in fact if 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.930
 we are constantly sliding without stopping 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.909
 we try to find motor skills 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.979
 of the car during after the presle and 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.360
 after the slips after the pins 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.950
 after the turns where the parabolic 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.610
 so we try to find motor skills 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.619
 we try to play well reports and 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.060
 more brakes finally have access it's 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.070
 a whole technique then we brake 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.350
 glide one straightens one accelerates thoroughly 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.170
 it's true that on the road we can not 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.540
 at all the same 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.159
 and fortunately on the other hand the fact of 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.500
 flying on ice has helped me 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.009
 times on the road to get out of situations 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.130
 delicate 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.780
 if only to understand that when 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.650
 we slide 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.660
 if we do it if we let go 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.000
 the accelerator the car goes sledging 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.800
 it slips even more so when we go 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 slipping on a road you never 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.950
 let go of the accelerator always makes 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.630
 keep a little bit of gas never 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.950
 braked hold a little bit of gas 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.959
 for the wheel the wheel continues to 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.470
 turn and looks for motor skills for 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.910
 to hang up 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.650
 I fight for motorsport 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.840
 because for a lot of reasons 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.310
 motorsport is a laboratory 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.290
 for automotive brands 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.400
 the fact that there is only 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.230
 formula 1 in France 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.310
 do not be surprised if behind 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.500
 major French car brands 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.790
 are in trouble you need a big price 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.170
 of formula 1 in France 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.060
 it is necessary that the big brands 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.220
 come back that I come back to the 24 hours 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.830
 mans peugeot missing the 24 hours of 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.850
 this year audi has benefited from it 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.160
 included in its sales 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.290
 behind it is a laboratory 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.700
 technological motor racing on 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.830
 ice cream in the summer especially for 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.269
 races on electric or now the 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.680
 run electric cars on ice 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.079
 as fast as cars 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.430
 thermal and then it's there is also a 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.049
 concept of pleasure with the electric 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.920
 that we do not find in small 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.359
 cars that we are shown they 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.489
 roll at 10 per hour when you buy 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.810
 a car we try to have fun 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.190
 to fly it 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.900
 we can have fun flying a 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.250
 day of electric cars is in 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.720
 this the andros trophy is a 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.120
 laboratory he remains passionate about 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.950
 sport in the trophy andros and among 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.209
 they are great champions ago 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.519
 jacques villeneuve ya jean philippe 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.150
 peyraud olive panis so there is very 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.859
 great pilots 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.019
 there is no official stable there is 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.340
 passionate stables bosses them 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.260
 same speak by car racing 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.489
 it's a pity they do not have a stable 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.739
 official it's a pity that brands 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.269
 do not come to participate in the first 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.500
 european ice consciousness race 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.760
 but we have fun and it's 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.230
 the essential is there 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.160
 amateur pilots like me from 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.930
 known or unknown 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.610
 people who come from the big 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.360
 athletes like alain bernard this weekend 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.540
 in electric 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.410
 it gives us here it makes you want to 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.990
 have fun i hope alain bernard 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.370
 will come back because it's an atmosphere 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.820
 great there is always a lot of 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.680
 public 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.210
 and there we still have three appointments 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.610
 after Romanian isola three appointments to 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.440
 lans in vercors with super besse and saint 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.910
 diÃ© des vosges where there are dozens of 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.380
 thousands of spectators because the sport 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.580
 self is first and foremost a 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.580
 popular sport
