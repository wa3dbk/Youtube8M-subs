Apartments<00:00:33.649> I<00:00:34.649> think<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.910> has<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> two

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
Apartments I think this has a two

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.450 
Apartments I think this has a two
apartments<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:36.930> see<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.620> some<00:00:37.890> one

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
apartments in see here it is some one

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.569 
apartments in see here it is some one
that<00:00:38.610> one<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.390> recommend<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
that one that I recommend is the

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.299 
that one that I recommend is the
$319,000<00:00:41.579> one<00:00:41.850> opposed<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.129> $304,000<00:00:44.129> one

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
$319,000 one opposed to the $304,000 one

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.500 
$319,000 one opposed to the $304,000 one
because<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.670> has<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> better<00:00:45.000> view<00:00:45.149> and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
because it has a better view and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.200 
because it has a better view and
everything<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.250> it's<00:00:47.250> much<00:00:47.640> cheaper<00:00:47.670> than

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
everything and it's much cheaper than

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.549 
everything and it's much cheaper than
the<00:00:48.559> $500,000<00:00:49.559> apartment<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:52.350> much

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
the $500,000 apartment and it is so much

of<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.759> one<00:01:20.939> right<00:01:21.090> here<00:01:21.360> has<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.689> palm<00:01:22.080> tree

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
of this one right here has a palm tree

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.749 
of this one right here has a palm tree
and<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.450> really<00:01:24.930> cool<00:01:25.490> driveway<00:01:26.490> and

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
and this is a really cool driveway and

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.440 
and this is a really cool driveway and
then<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.479> garage<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.770> basic<00:01:29.270> it's<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
then the garage is just basic it's the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.810 
then the garage is just basic it's the
same<00:01:30.780> 10<00:01:31.079> car<00:01:31.290> garage<00:01:31.560> as<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.070> other

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
same 10 car garage as the other

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.810 
same 10 car garage as the other
apartments<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.689> do<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> ten-car<00:01:34.619> garage

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
apartments that do have a ten-car garage

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.580 
apartments that do have a ten-car garage
but<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.030> really<00:01:36.780> think<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.049> rock<00:01:37.350> stars

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
but I really think that rock stars

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.190 
but I really think that rock stars
should<00:01:37.799> add<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> DLC<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:39.450> which<00:01:39.600> they<00:01:39.780> update

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
should add a DLC in which they update

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.289 
should add a DLC in which they update
the<00:01:40.380> interiors<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.159> garages<00:01:41.430> because<00:01:41.970> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
the interiors of the garages because the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.420 
the interiors of the garages because the
the<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.439> plain<00:01:43.649> white<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.159> sort<00:01:44.310> of

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
the just the plain white one is sort of

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.920 
the just the plain white one is sort of
getting<00:01:44.610> old<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.149> know<00:01:45.210> they<00:01:45.420> updated<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
interiors of the apartments and then the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.530 
interiors of the apartments and then the
interior<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.520> same<00:01:50.909> as<00:01:51.090> any<00:01:51.450> other
