00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 cadena3 the most open television that 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.610
 You never have to listen look for two 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.040
 versions but what is a fact is that 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.740
 because we always have to be 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.109
 struggling with those issues that do not 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.439
 they had to see in Toronto that they had to 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.170
 He has negotiated observed since 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.180
 many months or at least a couple of 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.970
 weeks before traveling to the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.980
 Pan American 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.259
 Fernanda says that they had it 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.960
 sitting that did not let her compete that 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.360
 they threatened her that her 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.940
 accreditation and return it to mexico 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.440
 the matter really of a sport of 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.720
 Robert's third world will absolve him and 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.280
 very painful so is embarrassing Pablo for 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.290
 the issue also that is the strong card 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.440
 of Mexican swimming that by the way 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.629
 is totally in a lethargy of great 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.430
 athletes and because they are also working 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.440
 by the federation which is a 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.449
 reality is that obviously this 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.129
 puts in that the Mexican sport has 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.960
 this kind of situations because I do not know 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.760
 works well when normally the 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.769
 affected is the athlete who during a 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.330
 process led sacrifice delivery and 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.890
 obviously because of this situation, a 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.630
 report that which seems to be the 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.360
 cantaleta every two years every four 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.640
 years affects its work is that it 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.250
 I understand why you can not foresee this 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.830
 negotiate talking with each of the 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.170
 respective federations in checking 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.630
 that the uniforms are perfect for 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.369
 each one of the athletes and well no 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.560
 it is every four years they spend 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.350
 Central Americans make Pan-Americans 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.090
 will happen again the Olympians and then 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.310
 these are the topics 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.500
 they have the Mexican sport braked 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.359
 these absurd things but it is 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.759
 unheard of that two hours before a 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:45.090
 competition have a girl sitting 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.619
 in an office threatening her and telling her 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.530
 that they are going to send it back to our 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.880
 country look up to the moment things do not 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.289
 they have been all good finds 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.600
 medal harvest beyond the 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.119
 Pan-American a barbarian contrast with 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.729
 what happened in guadalajara I see 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.979
 difficult to reach the parameter of what 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.979
 what happened in Brazil to his strangers 18 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.130
 gold medals but with things like 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.340
 we understand this because we are like 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.340
