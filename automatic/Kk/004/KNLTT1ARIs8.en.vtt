00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
the problem that'll sort of solve it

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.340 
the problem that'll sort of solve it
that<00:05:28.190> wasn't<00:05:28.460> going<00:05:28.550> to<00:05:28.610> work<00:05:28.900> you<00:05:29.900> know<00:05:30.020> what

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
that wasn't going to work you know what

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.450 
that wasn't going to work you know what
I'm<00:05:30.410> going<00:05:30.530> to<00:05:30.590> work<00:05:30.710> with<00:05:30.890> in<00:05:31.010> the<00:05:31.130> universe

I'm going to work with in the universe

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.100 
I'm going to work with in the universe
and<00:05:31.580> it<00:05:31.700> wasn't<00:05:31.910> going<00:05:32.000> to<00:05:32.060> work<00:05:32.120> outside<00:05:32.480> it

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
and it wasn't going to work outside it

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.260 
and it wasn't going to work outside it
instead<00:05:33.860> it's<00:05:34.070> become<00:05:34.340> much<00:05:34.520> more<00:05:34.790> what<00:05:35.180> are

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
instead it's become much more what are

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.610 
instead it's become much more what are
the<00:05:35.330> good<00:05:35.480> ideas<00:05:35.870> what<00:05:36.110> are<00:05:36.230> the<00:05:36.290> things<00:05:36.470> we

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
the good ideas what are the things we

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.810 
the good ideas what are the things we
should<00:05:36.920> be<00:05:36.950> doing<00:05:37.100> what<00:05:37.460> are<00:05:37.550> all<00:05:37.670> the

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
should be doing what are all the

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.100 
should be doing what are all the
resources<00:05:38.210> we<00:05:38.510> can<00:05:38.660> capture<00:05:40.150> to<00:05:41.150> move<00:05:41.600> forward

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
resources we can capture to move forward

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.320 
resources we can capture to move forward
and<00:05:42.320> then<00:05:42.590> take<00:05:42.890> it<00:05:43.010> from<00:05:43.040> there<00:05:43.220> I<00:05:43.580> think

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
and then take it from there I think

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.630 
and then take it from there I think
housing<00:05:45.200> development<00:05:45.680> on<00:05:45.770> a<00:05:45.800> known<00:05:46.070> on<00:05:46.370> its

own is a fine thing it changes the

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.130 
own is a fine thing it changes the
statics<00:05:49.610> of<00:05:49.790> a<00:05:49.850> neighborhood<00:05:50.120> especially<00:05:50.690> in

statics of a neighborhood especially in
Phil<00:05:51.410> I<00:05:51.680> can<00:05:52.220> really<00:05:52.490> make<00:05:53.030> a<00:05:53.060> person<00:05:53.510> think

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
Phil I can really make a person think

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.660 
Phil I can really make a person think
that<00:05:53.900> the<00:05:53.990> neighborhood<00:05:54.140> is<00:05:54.650> doing<00:05:55.250> well<00:05:55.400> it

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
that the neighborhood is doing well it

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.860 
that the neighborhood is doing well it
looks<00:05:55.880> well<00:05:56.090> and<00:05:56.390> it's<00:05:57.070> stabilized<00:05:58.070> and<00:05:58.340> safe

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
looks well and it's stabilized and safe

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.930 
looks well and it's stabilized and safe
but<00:05:59.870> unless<00:06:00.290> we<00:06:00.530> really<00:06:01.040> think<00:06:01.370> about<00:06:01.490> what's

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
but unless we really think about what's

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.060 
but unless we really think about what's
behind<00:06:02.360> those<00:06:02.780> doors<00:06:03.050> we<00:06:03.560> haven't<00:06:03.920> really

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
behind those doors we haven't really

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.300 
behind those doors we haven't really
done<00:06:04.340> much<00:06:05.140> so<00:06:06.140> it's<00:06:06.320> really<00:06:06.470> key<00:06:06.830> to<00:06:07.130> being

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
done much so it's really key to being

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.030 
done much so it's really key to being
able<00:06:07.490> to<00:06:07.640> be<00:06:07.940> a<00:06:07.970> good<00:06:08.300> community<00:06:09.260> developer<00:06:09.860> is

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040 
able to be a good community developer is

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.650 
able to be a good community developer is
to<00:06:10.310> know<00:06:10.490> that<00:06:10.730> you've<00:06:10.910> got<00:06:11.120> a<00:06:11.150> neighborhood
