00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
our smart air TC collection now the TC

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.890 
our smart air TC collection now the TC
stands<00:00:14.099> for<00:00:14.400> technical<00:00:14.940> cotton<00:00:15.389> that's

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
stands for technical cotton that's

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.780 
stands for technical cotton that's
because<00:00:16.200> we're<00:00:16.410> using<00:00:16.529> our<00:00:16.800> o<00:00:17.009> tex<00:00:17.279> air<00:00:17.520> tech

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:17.790 
because we're using our o tex air tech

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.999 
because we're using our o tex air tech
fly<00:00:18.090> sheet<00:00:18.360> on<00:00:18.480> here<00:00:18.779> which<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.290> indeed<00:00:19.770> a

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:20.009 
fly sheet on here which is indeed a

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:21.889 
fly sheet on here which is indeed a
technical<00:00:20.460> cotton<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.270> what<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.419> means<00:00:21.750> is

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:21.899 
technical cotton so what that means is

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:24.139 
technical cotton so what that means is
we<00:00:22.140> have<00:00:22.259> a<00:00:22.290> sixty-five<00:00:23.070> percent<00:00:23.279> cotton<00:00:23.790> and

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:24.149 
we have a sixty-five percent cotton and

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.479 
we have a sixty-five percent cotton and
thirty<00:00:24.840> five<00:00:25.140> percent<00:00:25.169> polyester<00:00:25.919> material

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:26.489 
thirty five percent polyester material

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.170 
thirty five percent polyester material
on<00:00:27.000> here<00:00:27.590> one<00:00:28.590> great<00:00:29.340> advantage<00:00:29.489> of<00:00:30.029> this

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
on here one great advantage of this

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.060 
on here one great advantage of this
material<00:00:30.360> just<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.200> the<00:00:31.349> tent<00:00:31.559> as<00:00:31.890> it's

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
material just like the tent as it's

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.070 
material just like the tent as it's
going<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.279> last<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.669> very<00:00:32.700> long<00:00:33.030> time<00:00:33.450> it's<00:00:33.780> much

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.080 
going to last a very long time it's much

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.720 
going to last a very long time it's much
much<00:00:34.350> more<00:00:34.620> durable<00:00:34.920> when<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.340> comes<00:00:35.550> to

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
much more durable when it comes to

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.540 
much more durable when it comes to
degradation<00:00:36.140> under<00:00:37.140> UV<00:00:37.380> light<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.130> basically

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
degradation under UV light so basically

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.860 
degradation under UV light so basically
sunlight<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.210> not<00:00:39.360> going<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.600> degrade

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
sunlight it's not going to degrade

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.750 
sunlight it's not going to degrade
anywhere<00:00:40.320> near<00:00:40.470> as<00:00:40.590> quickly<00:00:40.830> as<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.340> lakes<00:00:41.520> of

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
anywhere near as quickly as the lakes of

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.480 
anywhere near as quickly as the lakes of
polyester<00:00:42.660> materials<00:00:43.190> it's<00:00:44.190> also<00:00:44.370> a

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.490 
polyester materials it's also a

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.550 
polyester materials it's also a
breathable<00:00:44.910> material<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.720> a<00:00:45.750> hot<00:00:46.020> day<00:00:46.260> you

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
breathable material so on a hot day you

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.750 
breathable material so on a hot day you
should<00:00:46.740> be<00:00:46.829> kept<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.190> little<00:00:47.370> bit<00:00:47.579> more

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
should be kept a little bit more

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.700 
should be kept a little bit more
comfortable<00:00:48.270> inside<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.020> vice<00:00:49.200> versa<00:00:49.590> if

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
comfortable inside and vice versa if

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.770 
comfortable inside and vice versa if
it's<00:00:49.860> quite<00:00:50.040> cold<00:00:50.280> then<00:00:50.970> actually<00:00:51.450> you'll<00:00:51.690> be

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
it's quite cold then actually you'll be

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.510 
it's quite cold then actually you'll be
kept<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.290> little<00:00:52.590> bit<00:00:52.710> warmer<00:00:53.040> inside<00:00:53.190> as

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
kept that little bit warmer inside as

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.569 
kept that little bit warmer inside as
well<00:00:53.870> we<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:55.410> large<00:00:55.680> tinted<00:00:56.070> windows<00:00:56.370> all

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
well we have large tinted windows all

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.240 
well we have large tinted windows all
the<00:00:56.610> way<00:00:56.850> around<00:00:57.060> the<00:00:57.630> the<00:00:58.350> extension<00:00:58.950> as<00:00:59.070> well

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the way around the the extension as well

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.250 
the way around the the extension as well
again<00:00:59.550> just<00:00:59.790> like<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> tent<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.690> these<00:01:00.989> serve

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
again just like the tent so these serve

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.680 
again just like the tent so these serve
two<00:01:01.470> key<00:01:01.710> functions<00:01:02.220> one<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.700> to<00:01:03.420> reflect

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
two key functions one is to reflect

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.899 
two key functions one is to reflect
sunlight<00:01:04.439> away<00:01:04.860> from<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> inside<00:01:05.579> of<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
sunlight away from the inside of the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.190 
sunlight away from the inside of the
tent<00:01:06.360> keeping<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.780> little<00:01:06.990> bit<00:01:07.110> more

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
tent keeping a little bit more

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.200 
tent keeping a little bit more
comfortable<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.830> secondly<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.729> obviously<00:01:09.030> to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
comfortable and secondly is obviously to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.280 
comfortable and secondly is obviously to
give<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.479> little<00:01:09.510> bit<00:01:09.780> more<00:01:09.930> privacy

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
give you a little bit more privacy

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.820 
give you a little bit more privacy
inside<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.490> extension<00:01:12.030> as<00:01:12.150> well<00:01:12.830> more

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
inside the extension as well more

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.320 
inside the extension as well more
importantly<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.490> me<00:01:14.640> though<00:01:14.820> what<00:01:15.150> we're

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
importantly for me though what we're

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.480 
importantly for me though what we're
using<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.960> here<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> exact<00:01:16.830> same<00:01:17.040> frame<00:01:17.340> is

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
using on here is the exact same frame is

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.520 
using on here is the exact same frame is
what<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.760> use<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.299> tent<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.260> is<00:01:19.290> our

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
what we use on the tent so this is our

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.860 
what we use on the tent so this is our
one<00:01:19.740> go<00:01:20.010> inflation<00:01:20.640> technology<00:01:21.299> where<00:01:21.600> in

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
one go inflation technology where in

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.230 
one go inflation technology where in
place<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.860> traditional<00:01:23.100> steel<00:01:23.820> or

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
place of the traditional steel or

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.140 
place of the traditional steel or
fiberglass<00:01:24.840> poles<00:01:25.830> or<00:01:26.070> friend<00:01:26.370> we're<00:01:26.909> using

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
fiberglass poles or friend we're using

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.930 
fiberglass poles or friend we're using
inflatable<00:01:28.049> beams<00:01:28.409> now<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.400> one<00:01:29.670> going

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
inflatable beams now the one going

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.580 
inflatable beams now the one going
fellation<00:01:30.299> technology<00:01:30.780> allows<00:01:31.049> us<00:01:31.080> to<00:01:31.260> pump

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
fellation technology allows us to pump

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.620 
fellation technology allows us to pump
this<00:01:31.710> up<00:01:31.770> from<00:01:32.100> one<00:01:32.130> single<00:01:32.490> point<00:01:32.909> we'll<00:01:33.450> just

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
this up from one single point we'll just

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.090 
this up from one single point we'll just
show<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.810> now<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.290> other<00:01:34.409> side<00:01:34.680> how<00:01:34.920> that

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
show you now on the other side how that

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.969 
show you now on the other side how that
works<00:01:35.510> so<00:01:36.510> as<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.750> mentioned<00:01:36.780> there<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.500> one<00:01:37.770> go

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
works so as I mentioned there the one go

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.800 
works so as I mentioned there the one go
of<00:01:38.100> inflation<00:01:38.400> technology<00:01:39.119> allows<00:01:39.450> us<00:01:39.479> to

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
of inflation technology allows us to

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.710 
of inflation technology allows us to
inflate<00:01:40.260> the<00:01:40.740> entire<00:01:41.360> extension<00:01:42.360> just<00:01:42.570> from

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
inflate the entire extension just from

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.510 
inflate the entire extension just from
one<00:01:42.900> single<00:01:43.260> plug-in<00:01:43.770> point<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.250> it's<00:01:44.369> very

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
one single plug-in point so it's very

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.760 
one single plug-in point so it's very
similar<00:01:44.760> to<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.090> tent<00:01:45.420> where<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
similar to the tent where we have the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.789 
similar to the tent where we have the
air<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.670> valve<00:01:48.000> just<00:01:48.479> here<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.470> underneath

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
air in valve just here so underneath

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.800 
air in valve just here so underneath
this<00:01:50.490> piece<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.850> materials<00:01:51.299> where<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.600> valve

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
this piece of materials where the valve

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.899 
this piece of materials where the valve
is<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.590> take<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:52.890> off<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.700> would<00:01:53.880> be

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
is just take this off this would be

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.600 
is just take this off this would be
where<00:01:54.150> we<00:01:54.270> put<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.630> pump<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.250> single

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
where we put the pump in and in a single

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.340 
where we put the pump in and in a single
point<00:01:56.760> here<00:01:57.090> when<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.299> start<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.659> inflate<00:01:57.900> the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
point here when we start to inflate the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.499 
point here when we start to inflate the
whole<00:01:58.560> extension<00:01:59.130> will<00:01:59.670> go<00:01:59.939> up<00:02:00.090> quite<00:02:00.479> quickly

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
whole extension will go up quite quickly

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.450 
whole extension will go up quite quickly
it<00:02:01.170> quite<00:02:01.380> easily<00:02:01.590> within<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.100> matter<00:02:02.310> of

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
it quite easily within a matter of

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.330 
it quite easily within a matter of
minutes<00:02:03.200> just<00:02:04.200> here<00:02:04.409> you'll<00:02:04.619> see<00:02:04.650> that<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
minutes just here you'll see that the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.340 
minutes just here you'll see that the
main<00:02:05.850> beams<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.390> extension<00:02:06.869> also<00:02:07.170> have

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
main beams of the extension also have

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.399 
main beams of the extension also have
the<00:02:07.560> air<00:02:07.860> out<00:02:08.220> valves<00:02:09.179> as<00:02:09.299> well<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:10.079> on

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:10.409 
the air out valves as well so just on

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:12.800 
the air out valves as well so just on
here<00:02:10.679> for<00:02:11.310> ticking<00:02:11.819> need<00:02:12.029> extension<00:02:12.599> don't

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
here for ticking need extension don't

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.760 
here for ticking need extension don't
simply<00:02:13.409> just<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.680> case<00:02:13.859> of<00:02:13.889> open

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
simply just a case of open

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.950 
simply just a case of open
up<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.340> over<00:02:15.430> here<00:02:15.730> will<00:02:15.910> come<00:02:16.210> out<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.840> this

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
up and over here will come out and this

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.380 
up and over here will come out and this
will<00:02:17.140> drop<00:02:17.350> really<00:02:17.650> quickly<00:02:18.100> as<00:02:18.220> well<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:19.180> just

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
will drop really quickly as well so just

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.780 
will drop really quickly as well so just
as<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.570> remained<00:02:20.020> up<00:02:20.200> we<00:02:20.590> do<00:02:20.770> supply<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.460> pump

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
as I remained up we do supply the pump

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.690 
as I remained up we do supply the pump
with<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.420> tent<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:23.950> would<00:02:24.100> just<00:02:24.130> use<00:02:24.490> this

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
with the tent so you would just use this

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.490 
with the tent so you would just use this
on<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.210> extension<00:02:25.540> as<00:02:25.810> well<00:02:25.990> it's<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.200> double

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
on the extension as well it's a double

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.870 
on the extension as well it's a double
action<00:02:26.650> hand<00:02:26.980> pumps<00:02:27.280> or<00:02:27.370> when<00:02:27.490> you<00:02:27.580> pull<00:02:27.760> the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
action hand pumps or when you pull the

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.480 
action hand pumps or when you pull the
pump<00:02:28.030> up<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:28.630> push<00:02:29.350> down<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.950> are<00:02:30.130> putting

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
pump up and push down you are putting

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.610 
pump up and push down you are putting
air<00:02:30.850> into<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.360> beams<00:02:31.570> you<00:02:32.230> see<00:02:32.380> that<00:02:32.530> we<00:02:32.590> have

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
air into the beams you see that we have

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.470 
air into the beams you see that we have
a<00:02:32.740> pressure<00:02:33.040> gauge<00:02:33.340> on<00:02:33.550> top<00:02:33.790> here<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:34.210> you<00:02:34.270> can

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
a pressure gauge on top here so you can

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.300 
a pressure gauge on top here so you can
keep<00:02:34.600> an<00:02:34.780> eye<00:02:34.900> on<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.320> pressure<00:02:35.560> of<00:02:36.250> the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
keep an eye on the pressure of the

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.810 
keep an eye on the pressure of the
extension<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.210> we<00:02:37.690> would<00:02:37.840> recommend<00:02:38.820> between

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
extension and we would recommend between

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.400 
extension and we would recommend between
eight<00:02:40.000> point<00:02:40.300> seven<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:40.810> eleven<00:02:41.110> point<00:02:41.320> six

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
eight point seven and eleven point six

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.220 
eight point seven and eleven point six
psi<00:02:42.300> which<00:02:43.300> is<00:02:43.480> between<00:02:43.870> 0<00:02:44.110> point<00:02:44.340> 6.8<00:02:45.340> are<00:02:46.230> so

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
psi which is between 0 point 6.8 are so

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.410 
psi which is between 0 point 6.8 are so
again<00:02:47.470> similarly<00:02:48.100> to<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.340> temp<00:02:48.790> we<00:02:49.120> supply

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
again similarly to the temp we supply

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.120 
again similarly to the temp we supply
you<00:02:49.510> with<00:02:49.660> our<00:02:49.930> easy<00:02:50.110> pegging<00:02:50.560> system<00:02:50.920> here

you with our easy pegging system here

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.650 
you with our easy pegging system here
which<00:02:51.400> is<00:02:51.610> where<00:02:51.790> we<00:02:51.940> have<00:02:52.120> three<00:02:52.420> different

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
which is where we have three different

planks on the tent which are color-coded
gray<00:03:01.090> we<00:03:01.810> then<00:03:02.020> have<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.650> black<00:03:02.950> plastic<00:03:03.250> pegs

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
gray we then have the black plastic pegs

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.310 
gray we then have the black plastic pegs
for<00:03:03.880> all<00:03:04.090> of<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:04.300> black<00:03:04.480> bag<00:03:04.690> in<00:03:04.840> pipes<00:03:05.080> around

have the luminous peg for the bottom

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.590 
have the luminous peg for the bottom
half<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:10.060> our<00:03:10.510> 14<00:03:11.080> gallons<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.180> highlight

half of our 14 gallons so to highlight
another<00:03:14.110> few<00:03:14.530> features<00:03:14.710> on<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.460> extension

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
another few features on the extension

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.970 
another few features on the extension
we're<00:03:16.180> using<00:03:16.360> our<00:03:16.660> floating<00:03:17.020> islands<00:03:17.590> on<00:03:17.770> here

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
we're using our floating islands on here

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.400 
we're using our floating islands on here
as<00:03:18.100> well<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:18.850> again<00:03:19.240> these<00:03:19.540> much<00:03:19.930> with<00:03:20.260> the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
as well so again these much with the

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.590 
as well so again these much with the
tent<00:03:20.650> exactly<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:21.520> you've<00:03:21.670> got<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:22.060> top<00:03:22.360> half

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
tent exactly so you've got the top half

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.930 
tent exactly so you've got the top half
of<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.870> of<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.800> floating<00:03:24.160> islands<00:03:24.550> which<00:03:24.790> are

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
of the of the floating islands which are

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.910 
of the of the floating islands which are
color<00:03:25.180> coordinated<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.140> fly<00:03:26.470> sheet<00:03:26.740> and

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
color coordinated to the fly sheet and

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.640 
color coordinated to the fly sheet and
then<00:03:27.430> at<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.730> bottom<00:03:27.940> half<00:03:28.600> of<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:29.080> guylines

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
then at the bottom half of the guylines

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.070 
then at the bottom half of the guylines
we<00:03:29.860> have<00:03:30.040> or<00:03:30.250> luminous<00:03:30.790> part<00:03:31.060> hopefully<00:03:31.750> just

windows or owners as we mentioned so
just<00:04:22.240> above<00:04:22.480> me<00:04:22.660> we<00:04:22.900> have<00:04:23.229> the<00:04:23.620> shot<00:04:24.220> off<00:04:24.370> files

just above me we have the shot off files

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.430 
just above me we have the shot off files
again<00:04:25.090> similar<00:04:25.540> to<00:04:25.720> what<00:04:25.900> we<00:04:26.020> have<00:04:26.169> in<00:04:26.350> the

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440

again similar to what we have in the
tent<00:04:26.710> so<00:04:27.220> when<00:04:27.550> you

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
tent so when you

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.659 
tent so when you
the<00:04:28.660> extension<00:04:29.620> you'll<00:04:29.800> think<00:04:30.009> that<00:04:30.430> the

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
the extension you'll think that the

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.550 
the extension you'll think that the

vowels are in the open position like

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.249 
vowels are in the open position like
this<00:04:32.590> one<00:04:32.889> here<00:04:33.150> once<00:04:34.150> it's<00:04:34.360> inflated<00:04:34.569> we<00:04:35.050> just

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
this one here once it's inflated we just

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:36.960 
this one here once it's inflated we just
need<00:04:35.380> to<00:04:35.500> simply<00:04:35.830> spin<00:04:36.190> these<00:04:36.400> round<00:04:36.669> to<00:04:36.880> the

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
need to simply spin these round to the

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.490 
need to simply spin these round to the
off<00:04:37.120> position<00:04:37.150> and<00:04:37.870> what<00:04:38.020> that<00:04:38.169> does<00:04:38.319> have

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
off position and what that does have

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.040 
off position and what that does have
separates<00:04:39.039> each<00:04:39.280> of<00:04:39.639> the<00:04:39.789> beams<00:04:40.000> so<00:04:40.750> that<00:04:40.900> an

separates each of the beams so that an

separates each of the beams so that an
the<00:04:41.080> unlikely<00:04:41.800> event<00:04:41.830> of<00:04:42.220> something<00:04:42.699> going

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:42.819 
the unlikely event of something going

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:44.999 
the unlikely event of something going
wrong<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.479> entire<00:04:43.750> extension<00:04:44.319> won't<00:04:44.620> deflate

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
wrong the entire extension won't deflate

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.070 
wrong the entire extension won't deflate
it<00:04:45.130> would<00:04:45.400> just<00:04:45.610> affect<00:04:46.090> one<00:04:46.419> single<00:04:46.930> beam

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
it would just affect one single beam

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.730 
it would just affect one single beam
tank<00:04:48.150> also<00:04:49.150> at<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.419> top<00:04:49.599> here<00:04:49.780> we<00:04:50.020> do<00:04:50.169> have<00:04:50.470> a

located in a good central location so if

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.360 
located in a good central location so if
you<00:04:56.080> are<00:04:56.199> sitting<00:04:56.440> out<00:04:56.650> here<00:04:56.680> in<00:04:57.069> the<00:04:57.190> evenings

you do have a point to be able to hang a

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.909 
you do have a point to be able to hang a
lantern<00:05:00.630> so<00:05:01.630> there<00:05:01.780> you<00:05:01.840> go<00:05:01.900> that<00:05:02.169> is<00:05:02.349> all<00:05:02.770> the
