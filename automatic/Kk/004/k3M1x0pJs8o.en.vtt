one of the most respected players uh I

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.730 
one of the most respected players uh I
just<00:01:13.210> think<00:01:13.390> that<00:01:13.450> Emily's<00:01:13.990> going<00:01:14.649> to

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
just think that Emily's going to

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.099 
just think that Emily's going to
continue<00:01:15.039> on<00:01:15.369> her<00:01:15.609> improvement<00:01:16.450> you<00:01:16.990> know

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:17.109 
continue on her improvement you know

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:18.810 
continue on her improvement you know
she's<00:01:17.320> a<00:01:17.380> relatively<00:01:17.890> new<00:01:18.159> outside<00:01:18.369> hitter

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
she's a relatively new outside hitter

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.349 
she's a relatively new outside hitter
and<00:01:19.060> last<00:01:19.869> year<00:01:20.079> was<00:01:20.229> her<00:01:20.350> first<00:01:20.649> year<00:01:20.920> I<00:01:21.359> think

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:22.359 
and last year was her first year I think

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:24.510 
and last year was her first year I think
she'll<00:01:22.570> be<00:01:22.659> better<00:01:22.869> this<00:01:23.049> year<00:01:23.399> she's<00:01:24.399> gonna

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
she'll be better this year she's gonna

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.370 
she'll be better this year she's gonna
swing<00:01:24.789> it<00:01:24.880> a<00:01:24.939> lot<00:01:25.119> of<00:01:25.210> balls<00:01:25.390> out<00:01:25.659> for<00:01:25.869> sure<00:01:26.109> and

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
swing it a lot of balls out for sure and

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.919 
swing it a lot of balls out for sure and
I<00:01:26.799> think<00:01:27.640> she'll<00:01:27.789> be<00:01:27.909> up<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.179> it<00:01:28.299> she<00:01:28.539> has<00:01:28.659> more

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
I think she'll be up to it she has more

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.419 
I think she'll be up to it she has more
range<00:01:29.259> it<00:01:29.740> more<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:31.060> think<00:01:31.689> shots<00:01:32.170> that<00:01:33.070> she<00:01:33.249> can

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
range it more I think shots that she can

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:36.719 
range it more I think shots that she can
go<00:01:33.460> to<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:35.560> you<00:01:35.799> know<00:01:35.829> she's<00:01:36.130> already<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:36.520> great

problems i think they return a lot of
people<00:04:08.840> Davis<00:04:09.590> is<00:04:09.739> good<00:04:09.980> so<00:04:10.340> it's<00:04:10.940> a<00:04:11.090> better

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
people Davis is good so it's a better

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.680 
people Davis is good so it's a better
conference<00:04:11.900> Cal<00:04:12.380> Poly<00:04:12.620> won't<00:04:12.920> be<00:04:13.540> like<00:04:14.540> they

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
conference Cal Poly won't be like they

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.390 
conference Cal Poly won't be like they
were<00:04:14.840> last<00:04:15.080> year<00:04:15.410> there<00:04:15.860> were<00:04:16.010> a<00:04:16.040> few<00:04:16.250> more

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
were last year there were a few more

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.990 
were last year there were a few more
matches<00:04:16.820> and<00:04:17.030> so<00:04:18.040> just<00:04:19.040> overall<00:04:19.430> I<00:04:19.459> think<00:04:19.730> the

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
matches and so just overall I think the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.759 
matches and so just overall I think the
conference<00:04:20.690> is<00:04:20.840> stronger

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
conference is stronger

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.030 
conference is stronger
