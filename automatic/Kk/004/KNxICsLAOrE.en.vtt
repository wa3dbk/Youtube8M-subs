background to the colors that you use on
the<00:00:51.170> inside<00:00:51.440> so<00:00:52.220> they<00:00:52.340> don't<00:00:52.370> have<00:00:52.670> to<00:00:52.790> be<00:00:52.940> as

the inside so they don't have to be as

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.940 
the inside so they don't have to be as
distinct<00:00:53.690> as<00:00:53.780> what<00:00:53.930> you<00:00:54.050> see<00:00:54.260> here<00:00:54.530> with<00:00:54.770> the

there is a caddywhompus X on them now
when<00:01:02.600> we<00:01:02.690> used<00:01:02.900> to<00:01:03.110> do<00:01:03.410> this<00:01:03.649> back<00:01:03.980> in<00:01:04.009> the<00:01:04.309> day

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
when we used to do this back in the day

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.609 
when we used to do this back in the day
we<00:01:04.729> had<00:01:04.879> square-dance<00:01:05.630> if<00:01:05.869> you<00:01:05.990> remember<00:01:06.409> that

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
we had square-dance if you remember that

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.340 
we had square-dance if you remember that
but<00:01:07.130> all<00:01:07.250> we<00:01:07.399> had<00:01:07.640> was<00:01:07.880> template<00:01:08.600> you<00:01:09.020> cut<00:01:09.229> out

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
but all we had was template you cut out

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.469 
but all we had was template you cut out
your<00:01:09.530> template<00:01:09.890> you<00:01:10.250> placed<00:01:10.550> it<00:01:10.760> on<00:01:10.850> here<00:01:11.120> but

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
your template you placed it on here but

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.090 
your template you placed it on here but
there's<00:01:11.659> a<00:01:11.750> steam<00:01:11.990> right<00:01:12.260> here<00:01:12.560> so<00:01:12.800> it<00:01:12.920> makes

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
there's a steam right here so it makes

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.250 
there's a steam right here so it makes
it<00:01:13.340> it<00:01:13.490> was<00:01:13.610> kind<00:01:13.820> of<00:01:13.850> hard<00:01:14.150> to<00:01:14.210> balance<00:01:15.080> and

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
it it was kind of hard to balance and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.320 
it it was kind of hard to balance and
you<00:01:15.350> definitely<00:01:15.800> didn't<00:01:16.010> want<00:01:16.040> to<00:01:16.280> work<00:01:17.120> with

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
you definitely didn't want to work with

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.390 
you definitely didn't want to work with
a<00:01:17.360> rotary<00:01:17.810> cutter<00:01:18.170> it<00:01:18.470> would<00:01:18.620> sometimes<00:01:18.950> go<00:01:19.370> a

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
a rotary cutter it would sometimes go a

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.490 
a rotary cutter it would sometimes go a
little<00:01:19.790> up<00:01:20.030> sideways<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:21.140> didn't<00:01:21.350> want<00:01:21.470> to

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
little up sideways you didn't want to

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.240 
little up sideways you didn't want to
cut<00:01:21.710> yourself

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
cut yourself

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.219 
cut yourself
the<00:01:22.549> twister<00:01:23.030> rulers<00:01:23.390> have<00:01:23.659> these<00:01:23.930> little

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
the twister rulers have these little

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.350 
the twister rulers have these little
legs<00:01:24.500> on<00:01:24.830> them<00:01:25.070> so<00:01:25.490> it<00:01:25.610> makes<00:01:25.850> it<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:26.180> as<00:01:26.330> we

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
legs on them so it makes it so as we

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.960 
legs on them so it makes it so as we
position<00:01:26.990> these<00:01:27.170> over<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:28.040> intersections<00:01:28.790> of

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
position these over the intersections of

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.600 
position these over the intersections of
our<00:01:29.180> square<00:01:29.540> as<00:01:29.720> we're<00:01:29.930> going<00:01:30.080> to<00:01:30.140> do<00:01:30.380> then<00:01:31.100> the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
our square as we're going to do then the

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.450 
our square as we're going to do then the
seam<00:01:32.120> allowance<00:01:32.600> is<00:01:32.780> held<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.620> ruler<00:01:34.220> doesn't

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
seam allowance is held the ruler doesn't

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.219 
seam allowance is held the ruler doesn't
move<00:01:34.909> and<00:01:35.240> you<00:01:35.330> can<00:01:35.479> use<00:01:35.659> your<00:01:35.810> rotary<00:01:36.049> cutter

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
move and you can use your rotary cutter

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.350 
move and you can use your rotary cutter
with<00:01:37.040> ease<00:01:37.400> for<00:01:37.670> ease

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
with ease for ease

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.910 
with ease for ease
now<00:01:38.479> before<00:01:38.840> we<00:01:38.960> start<00:01:39.020> cutting<00:01:39.560> I<00:01:39.650> want<00:01:39.830> to

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
now before we start cutting I want to

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.160 
now before we start cutting I want to
show<00:01:40.100> you<00:01:40.159> that<00:01:40.790> when<00:01:41.090> we<00:01:41.119> cut<00:01:41.600> this<00:01:41.810> all<00:01:42.049> the

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
show you that when we cut this all the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.289 
show you that when we cut this all the
way<00:01:42.260> down<00:01:42.470> to<00:01:42.860> all<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.280> twister<00:01:43.670> blocks<00:01:43.970> and

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
way down to all the twister blocks and

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.750 
way down to all the twister blocks and
so<00:01:44.510> on<00:01:44.659> back<00:01:44.840> together<00:01:45.200> it's<00:01:45.560> going<00:01:46.159> to<00:01:46.340> reduce

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
so on back together it's going to reduce

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.060 
so on back together it's going to reduce
in<00:01:47.000> size<00:01:47.060> so<00:01:47.840> you<00:01:47.900> can<00:01:47.960> see<00:01:48.229> we're<00:01:48.439> about<00:01:48.530> 25

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
in size so you can see we're about 25

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.429 
in size so you can see we're about 25
percent<00:01:49.820> smaller<00:01:50.600> than<00:01:50.900> what<00:01:51.229> we<00:01:51.380> started

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
percent smaller than what we started

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.980 
percent smaller than what we started
with<00:01:52.010> so<00:01:52.070> you<00:01:52.310> need<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.610> plan<00:01:52.880> ahead<00:01:53.090> for<00:01:53.540> your

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
with so you need to plan ahead for your

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.960 
with so you need to plan ahead for your
finish<00:01:54.380> 2<00:01:54.590> projects<00:01:55.070> now<00:01:55.250> of<00:01:55.430> course<00:01:55.610> all<00:01:55.790> the

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
finish 2 projects now of course all the

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.149 
finish 2 projects now of course all the
books<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.810> patterns<00:01:57.229> for<00:01:57.560> this<00:01:57.740> ruler<00:01:58.130> is

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
books and the patterns for this ruler is

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.219 
books and the patterns for this ruler is
going<00:01:58.430> to<00:01:58.490> have<00:01:58.640> that<00:01:58.790> predetermined<00:01:59.720> for<00:02:00.020> you

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
going to have that predetermined for you

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.080 
going to have that predetermined for you
but<00:02:00.740> if<00:02:00.860> you're<00:02:00.979> doing<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.310> on<00:02:01.460> your<00:02:01.610> own<00:02:01.670> you

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
but if you're doing it on your own you

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.179 
but if you're doing it on your own you
got<00:02:02.240> to<00:02:02.360> allow<00:02:02.450> for<00:02:02.600> that<00:02:02.930> extra<00:02:03.439> shrinkage

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
got to allow for that extra shrinkage

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.020 
got to allow for that extra shrinkage
ok<00:02:04.820> so<00:02:04.880> I<00:02:05.060> have<00:02:05.330> one<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.110> these<00:02:06.290> started<00:02:07.250> in<00:02:07.490> the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
ok so I have one of these started in the

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.270 
ok so I have one of these started in the
cutting<00:02:08.479> because<00:02:08.659> once<00:02:09.019> we<00:02:09.259> cut<00:02:09.560> it's<00:02:10.009> kind<00:02:10.250> of

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
cutting because once we cut it's kind of

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.220 
cutting because once we cut it's kind of
neat<00:02:10.489> to<00:02:10.640> see<00:02:10.670> how<00:02:10.849> this<00:02:11.150> actually<00:02:11.360> all<00:02:11.840> comes

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
neat to see how this actually all comes

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.989 
neat to see how this actually all comes
together<00:02:12.560> so<00:02:13.099> we're<00:02:13.489> going<00:02:13.579> to<00:02:13.639> take<00:02:13.819> our

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:13.999 
together so we're going to take our

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.989 
together so we're going to take our
twister<00:02:14.419> and<00:02:14.629> back<00:02:15.169> to<00:02:15.349> where<00:02:15.529> that<00:02:15.739> X<00:02:16.159> is<00:02:16.730> on

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:16.999 
twister and back to where that X is on

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:19.260 
twister and back to where that X is on
the<00:02:17.029> ruler<00:02:17.569> we'll<00:02:18.109> be<00:02:18.230> placing<00:02:18.499> that<00:02:18.829> it

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
the ruler we'll be placing that it

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.970 
the ruler we'll be placing that it
any<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.630> intersections<00:02:20.380> actually<00:02:20.770> all

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
any of the intersections actually all

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.340 
any of the intersections actually all
intersections<00:02:21.880> it<00:02:22.240> will<00:02:22.630> be<00:02:22.870> cutting<00:02:23.230> a

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
intersections it will be cutting a

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.780 
intersections it will be cutting a
square<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.830> there's<00:02:23.980> going<00:02:24.070> to<00:02:24.130> be<00:02:24.190> a<00:02:24.280> slight

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
square and there's going to be a slight

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.200 
square and there's going to be a slight
about<00:02:25.570> 1/4<00:02:26.200> inch<00:02:26.400> distance<00:02:27.400> between<00:02:27.940> all

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
about 1/4 inch distance between all

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.690 
about 1/4 inch distance between all
these<00:02:28.480> when<00:02:29.290> we're<00:02:29.470> actually<00:02:29.650> done<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.340> a

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
these when we're actually done and a

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.130 
these when we're actually done and a
little<00:02:30.970> waste<00:02:31.210> that's<00:02:31.510> going<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.780> come<00:02:31.990> out

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
little waste that's going to come out

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.490 
little waste that's going to come out
between<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:33.070> blocks<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:34.030> you<00:02:34.390> also<00:02:34.600> cut<00:02:35.110> the

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
between the blocks and you also cut the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.140 
between the blocks and you also cut the
borders<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.370> that's<00:02:36.490> why<00:02:36.640> it's<00:02:36.760> important<00:02:37.120> to

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
borders and that's why it's important to

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.990 
borders and that's why it's important to
have<00:02:37.240> your<00:02:37.510> borders<00:02:37.870> all<00:02:38.050> sewn<00:02:38.710> on<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.880> is

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
have your borders all sewn on that is

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.980 
have your borders all sewn on that is
going<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.270> actually<00:02:40.390> be<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.780> background

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
going to actually be the background

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.900 
going to actually be the background
colors<00:02:41.620> when<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:41.890> see<00:02:42.160> this<00:02:42.310> all<00:02:42.520> dead

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
colors when you see this all dead

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.060 
colors when you see this all dead
so<00:02:43.180> we're<00:02:43.300> going<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.450> go<00:02:43.600> ahead<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:44.050> just<00:02:44.470> cut

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
so we're going to go ahead and just cut

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.040 
so we're going to go ahead and just cut
around<00:02:45.280> what's<00:02:46.030> nice<00:02:46.270> is<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.480> could<00:02:46.720> extend

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
around what's nice is you could extend

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.410 
around what's nice is you could extend
your<00:02:47.200> rotary<00:02:47.650> cutter<00:02:47.680> past<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.670> ruler<00:02:49.000> and

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
your rotary cutter past the ruler and

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.700 
your rotary cutter past the ruler and
we'll<00:02:49.510> kind<00:02:49.720> of<00:02:49.750> go<00:02:49.870> into<00:02:50.170> that<00:02:50.290> part<00:02:50.560> that's

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
we'll kind of go into that part that's

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.820 
we'll kind of go into that part that's
going<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:50.950> get<00:02:51.190> actually<00:02:52.170> removed<00:02:53.170> so<00:02:53.770> it

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
going to get actually removed so it

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.290 
going to get actually removed so it
won't<00:02:54.010> actually<00:02:54.130> make<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.580> big<00:02:54.820> difference

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
won't actually make a big difference

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.710 
won't actually make a big difference
there<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:58.020> okay<00:02:59.020> now<00:02:59.560> for<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:00.580> twisting<00:03:01.330> to

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
there and okay now for the twisting to

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.060 
there and okay now for the twisting to
begin<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:05.080> probably<00:03:05.290> want<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.620> have<00:03:05.770> some

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
begin and you probably want to have some

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.090 
begin and you probably want to have some
sort<00:03:06.370> of<00:03:06.610> design<00:03:07.120> wall<00:03:07.420> or<00:03:07.750> even<00:03:08.470> an<00:03:08.590> area<00:03:08.800> that

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
sort of design wall or even an area that

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.760 
sort of design wall or even an area that
you'll<00:03:09.280> be<00:03:09.400> working<00:03:09.820> with<00:03:09.850> so<00:03:10.660> these<00:03:11.290> do<00:03:11.590> not

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
you'll be working with so these do not

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.020 
you'll be working with so these do not
get<00:03:12.190> mixed<00:03:13.150> up<00:03:13.300> into<00:03:13.750> any<00:03:13.990> unnecessary<00:03:15.030> order

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
get mixed up into any unnecessary order

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.270 
get mixed up into any unnecessary order
here<00:03:16.270> so<00:03:16.300> watch<00:03:16.690> as<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.080> comes<00:03:17.260> together<00:03:17.470> these

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
here so watch as it comes together these

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.430 
here so watch as it comes together these
blocks<00:03:18.700> are<00:03:18.910> just<00:03:19.090> going<00:03:19.300> to<00:03:19.420> slight<00:03:19.960> you<00:03:19.990> just

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
blocks are just going to slight you just

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.430 
blocks are just going to slight you just
twist<00:03:20.740> them<00:03:20.920> into<00:03:21.070> place<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:22.110> you'll<00:03:23.110> see

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
twist them into place and you'll see

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.090 
twist them into place and you'll see
those<00:03:23.709> pinwheels<00:03:24.600> starting<00:03:25.600> to<00:03:25.930> take<00:03:26.860> shape

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
those pinwheels starting to take shape

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.730 
those pinwheels starting to take shape
here's<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.150> borders<00:03:30.930> now<00:03:31.930> one<00:03:32.140> thing<00:03:32.350> I<00:03:32.470> love

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
here's the borders now one thing I love

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.010 
here's the borders now one thing I love
about<00:03:32.770> this<00:03:33.280> block<00:03:33.520> it<00:03:33.700> is<00:03:33.850> so<00:03:34.120> forgiving<00:03:34.780> at

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
about this block it is so forgiving at

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.260 
about this block it is so forgiving at
once<00:03:35.260> again<00:03:35.590> all<00:03:35.800> you're<00:03:36.250> going<00:03:36.370> to<00:03:36.430> do<00:03:36.580> is<00:03:36.760> sew

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
once again all you're going to do is sew

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.230 
once again all you're going to do is sew
these<00:03:37.660> blocks<00:03:38.050> together<00:03:38.350> so<00:03:38.860> no<00:03:39.310> triangles<00:03:39.970> no

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
these blocks together so no triangles no

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.540 
these blocks together so no triangles no
no<00:03:40.840> nothing<00:03:41.200> special<00:03:41.530> here<00:03:41.920> is<00:03:42.070> these

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
no nothing special here is these

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.370 
no nothing special here is these
intersections<00:03:43.390> at<00:03:43.570> this<00:03:43.750> point<00:03:44.050> they're<00:03:44.260> all

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
intersections at this point they're all

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.960 
intersections at this point they're all
the<00:03:44.560> same<00:03:44.590> color<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:45.280> if<00:03:45.370> they're<00:03:45.520> not<00:03:45.640> just

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
the same color so if they're not just

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.730 
the same color so if they're not just
perfect<00:03:46.450> your<00:03:46.900> eye<00:03:46.930> is<00:03:47.140> not<00:03:47.410> going<00:03:47.590> to<00:03:47.650> be

perfect your eye is not going to be
drawn<00:03:47.980> to<00:03:48.010> that<00:03:48.220> so<00:03:48.520> it's<00:03:48.670> a<00:03:48.730> great<00:03:49.090> project

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
drawn to that so it's a great project

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.650 
drawn to that so it's a great project
for<00:03:50.110> any<00:03:50.350> beginner
