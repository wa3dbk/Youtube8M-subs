because<00:01:53.509> this<00:01:53.720> screen<00:01:54.080> sucked<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:57.310> now<00:01:58.310> this

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
because this screen sucked it now this

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.450 
because this screen sucked it now this
one's<00:01:58.670> still<00:01:59.440> black<00:02:00.440> and<00:02:00.649> white<00:02:00.830> but<00:02:01.310> it's

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
true black and white as opposed to a

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.830 
true black and white as opposed to a

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
green monochrome like the original

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.259 
green monochrome like the original
Gameboy<00:02:06.729> so<00:02:07.729> it<00:02:07.880> doesn't<00:02:08.209> look<00:02:08.360> all<00:02:08.950> like<00:02:09.950> it's

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
Gameboy so it doesn't look all like it's

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.990 
Gameboy so it doesn't look all like it's
everything's<00:02:11.269> washed<00:02:11.540> over<00:02:12.080> in<00:02:12.260> pea<00:02:12.500> soup

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.290 
everything's washed over in pea soup
it's<00:02:14.000> actually<00:02:14.150> black<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:14.810> white<00:02:16.060> let's<00:02:17.060> pop

it's actually black and white let's pop

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.729 
it's actually black and white let's pop
in<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.600> little<00:02:18.160> hunt<00:02:19.160> for<00:02:19.340> red<00:02:19.430> october<00:02:20.739> give

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
in a little hunt for red october give

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.510 
in a little hunt for red october give
you<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.860> little<00:02:21.980> demonstration

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.550 

I<00:02:27.610> don't<00:02:28.180> know<00:02:28.270> if<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.510> can<00:02:28.600> see<00:02:29.350> that<00:02:29.530> that

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
I don't know if you can see that that

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.950 
I don't know if you can see that that
well<00:02:29.920> just<00:02:30.610> wait<00:02:30.760> in<00:02:30.880> turn<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.090> contrast<00:02:31.660> up<00:02:31.840> a

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
well just wait in turn the contrast up a

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:43.350 
well just wait in turn the contrast up a
little<00:02:32.170> bit<00:02:33.060> other<00:02:34.060> way

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.790 

it's<00:02:44.360> a<00:02:44.450> little<00:02:44.690> hard<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:44.960> film<00:02:45.230> but<00:02:45.470> this<00:02:45.650> is

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
it's a little hard to film but this is

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.920 
it's a little hard to film but this is
actually<00:02:45.980> black<00:02:46.460> and<00:02:46.700> white<00:02:46.910> as<00:02:47.420> opposed<00:02:47.780> to

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
actually black and white as opposed to

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:58.290 
actually black and white as opposed to
monochrome<00:02:48.320> green<00:02:52.330> alright<00:02:53.330> enough<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:54.020> that

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.090 

so<00:02:59.300> if<00:02:59.540> you're<00:02:59.720> in<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.020> market<00:03:00.170> for<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:00.560> gameboy

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
so if you're in the market for a gameboy

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.550 
so if you're in the market for a gameboy
and<00:03:01.450> don't<00:03:02.450> want<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.690> spend<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.020> money<00:03:03.200> for<00:03:03.530> a

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
and don't want to spend the money for a

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.170 
and don't want to spend the money for a
gameboy<00:03:04.400> advance<00:03:06.670> but<00:03:07.670> you<00:03:07.760> don't<00:03:07.940> want<00:03:08.090> to

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
gameboy advance but you don't want to

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.690 
gameboy advance but you don't want to
carry<00:03:08.420> around<00:03:08.630> this<00:03:08.900> big<00:03:09.140> brick<00:03:09.490> it's<00:03:10.490> not<00:03:10.640> a

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
carry around this big brick it's not a

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.940 
carry around this big brick it's not a
bad<00:03:10.880> option<00:03:11.170> these<00:03:12.170> things<00:03:12.350> are<00:03:12.530> relatively

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
bad option these things are relatively

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.920 
bad option these things are relatively
inexpensive<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:13.910> they<00:03:14.480> tend<00:03:14.660> to<00:03:14.690> be<00:03:14.840> in

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
inexpensive and they tend to be in

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.950 
inexpensive and they tend to be in
better<00:03:15.110> shape<00:03:15.230> than<00:03:15.710> the<00:03:15.830> original<00:03:16.250> game<00:03:16.280> boys

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
better shape than the original game boys

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.200 
better shape than the original game boys
mostly<00:03:17.960> because<00:03:18.830> of<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.250> build<00:03:19.760> quality<00:03:19.910> of

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
mostly because of the build quality of

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.500 
mostly because of the build quality of
the<00:03:20.300> screen<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:22.070> original<00:03:22.460> Gameboy<00:03:22.820> the

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
the screen the original Gameboy the

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.270 
the screen the original Gameboy the
screen<00:03:23.810> build<00:03:24.290> quality<00:03:24.440> was<00:03:24.860> so<00:03:24.980> poor<00:03:25.250> that

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
screen build quality was so poor that

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.460 
screen build quality was so poor that
most<00:03:25.670> of<00:03:25.760> them<00:03:25.910> deteriorate<00:03:26.780> over<00:03:26.810> time<00:03:27.050> it's

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
most of them deteriorate over time it's

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.500 
most of them deteriorate over time it's
really<00:03:27.800> hard<00:03:28.010> to<00:03:28.100> get<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.250> good<00:03:28.310> one<00:03:29.210> that<00:03:29.360> has<00:03:29.480> a
