00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.700
 Dear friend we have today April 13 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.200
 2014 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:14.309
 and I want you in this video 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:19.490
 tell when to open the grapes I 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:24.750
 yesterday there was one grape already opened 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:27.590
 although we still have nights 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.590
 frost I arrived yesterday and I have 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:37.200
 the bathroom where I make the elixir was well 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:40.620
 ice was not a thick crust was all 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.530
 equal at this point you need to open 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.510
 grapes well, not exactly at this moment 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:52.770
 it is now not wait Well 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:57.449
 recommend warming and only then 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:02.219
 discovering grapes the thing is my 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.989
 good my dear reader my 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.780
 mailing 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:11.909
 do not get fooled by this nonsense 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:16.200
 know why because if the rose will 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:24.330
 under cover kai and air temperature 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:25.979
 yes yes yes plus 15 to plus 18 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.439
 vines wake up 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:36.750
 even they will be covered anyway 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:41.159
 wake up and there will be young shoots 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:46.290
 but under the arms of the fish in the dark they will 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:50.729
 white and then there will be a problem like them 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.840
 adapt to the direct rays of the sun this 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:02:00.329
 very great problem because you have to 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:04.740
 first open but not really need gun 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:07.290
 to finish some kind of tents there so that 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.979
 not gone around these 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:15.209
 leaded white shoots are not necessary here 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:18.180
 as soon as you put the snow you can walk on 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:23.300
 cottage squares by mail or along the aisles 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:26.670
 spend as we go open 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.920
 do you really think that the plant is 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:35.780
 stupid that she will start 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:39.629
 meditation at a time when these young 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:44.209
 sprouts can die not plants 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:48.959
 smarter than us much smarter than us so 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:53.510
 opens not as soon as it is available 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:58.129
 what hands of a grape bush open 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:02.849
 now you see now 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:05.790
 they take their how to say their 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:09.930
 posture they also come true for me with these 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:14.310
 spire other they all very well read 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:18.750
 lay on the ground I pulled these 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:23.900
 hairpins and you see for jokes count 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.900
 because as the vines have risen 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:32.260
 you look already the vines have risen see and 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.960
 on the opening day do not tie 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.010
 them on the first wire give them 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:43.960
 opportunity to return to that position in 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:47.260
 which they grew up last year if u 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.150
 you will not be able to give them 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.410
 temporarily 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:57.070
 straightening for adaptation then not 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:03.190
 take your time and practice 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:04.690
 vines like this do them 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.330
 and only then 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:15.130
 and only then take and tie up 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:19.830
 otherwise when you release from u cap from 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:25.390
 studs and immediately begin to twist them 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:28.360
 break as if to rather bring them in 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.610
 that someone sees in which, not once in 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.150
 Last year 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:38.560
 the vines will burst visually not visible a 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:44.350
 then there will be a very big trouble so 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:49.540
 keep in mind open vines 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:55.200
 as soon as you can go to the cottage but we 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:58.360
 this is well somewhere here is the first of April 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:03.930
 early April but see 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:08.190
 year on year is not our case and 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:11.919
 Twenty March 25 it was already warm 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:15.820
 Well, in those years, I opened a little bit 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:21.160
 early and this spring we are real as 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:22.090
 and there must be another cold in April 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.590
 freezers 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:30.310
 so here at this time I usually 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:33.379
 open the grapes that week bring it back 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:40.169
 tel that weekend we will come 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:45.180
 These knit this one today will 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:48.349
 engage pruning apple prone 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.349
 on the next
