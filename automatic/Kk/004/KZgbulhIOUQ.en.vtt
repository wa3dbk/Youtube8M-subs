00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.440
 no doubt mention granger nicia is 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.380
 mention one of the biggest 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.910
 creators of games of the world panorama 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.920
 this blue man legends that we have in the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.930
 hand is nothing more than a fusion pack of a 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.480
 game created by starts ago quite 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.190
 time for nor for the 2004 that has had 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.810
 different expansions and that now 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.210
 we have all together in the hand of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.210
 exeter time in this blue man game 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.220
 legends is a game that originally 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.320
 played two players or faced each other 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.150
 two players as a series of decks 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.430
 predesigned or you could go 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.769
 building and all these expansions 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.180
 that have been appearing were much 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.190
 more color to the game then here we have 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.290
 both the base game and all the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.880
 expansions together in an almost edition 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.820
 of luxury let's open the box 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.320
 we open the box of blue man legends and 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.180
 inside we find ourselves in addition to the 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.550
 classic catalog of a regulation 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.650
 divided into two books by quite 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.140
 typical lately and that you have many 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.210
 thank you I like a regulation where 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.430
 teaches us the content first 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.090
 and then how to play the game all to 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.370
 color very well laid out and then a 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.750
 reference book or concepts 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.470
 advanced but here already tells us that 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.900
 better to use it later to consult 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.850
 let's say more precise rules or doubts that 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.220
 we can have it like that should all come 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.260
 the manuals we have a very 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.850
 long that reminds me of games like 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.090
 the call of CÃ¡ceres of the game of 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.680
 letters or one of the rings of the game of 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.900
 letters because in the end this is from the 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.460
 same line on this board that board 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.140
 will serve as a border between the two 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.180
 players or will be on either side of 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.610
 another with combat zone in low 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.500
 game pile of discards even zone of 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.280
 leaders and in addition to a very illustration 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.990
 pretty 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.570
 we have the turn the turn sequence 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.790
 in both directions so that we are in 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.390
 the side that we are able to read that 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.630
 shift and we have the main component 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.630
 that there are many letters 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.880
 that come very very laid out very well 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.160
 maquetadas with some illustrations very 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.950
 very nice striking and that we 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.630
 They will create our arms around 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.700
 already predesigned arms if we do not want 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.650
 break our head a lot especially at 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.599
 beginning but a lot of letters 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.319
 because as I say this is the game more 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:25.330
 the expansions are all the same as 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.989
 they will give us a lot of hours of 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.450
 fun with this blues legends but 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.550
 in addition and this is a detail in addition the 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.390
 letters okay here we have another deck is 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.120
 same 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.890
 we have plastics and in a game of this 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.430
 style we have plastic we have three 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:47.590
 dragons are colors that are very very 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.590
 pretty in some green 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.800
 blue 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.810
 and red that also as you are seeing are 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.480
 of different model is not even the 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.520
 same dragon model are different and 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.060
 finally some magical stones that 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.240
 they are also the most interesting are not 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.180
 the typical cardboard tokens and cubes 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.550
 wood are some plastic stones that 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.760
 they attract a lot of attention and since 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.769
 then enter by sight 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.390
 some impressive letters a board 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.519
 very beautiful and a game of the most 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.500
 entertaining for two players that we 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.409
 will make us enter this fantasy world 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.569
 of blue moon if you like alicia if you 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:30.250
 like this style of games of two 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.629
 players where we have to create 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.849
 our army and show that we are 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:38.010
 better than the rival, do not miss this one 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.010
 blue moon le jets all in one crack
