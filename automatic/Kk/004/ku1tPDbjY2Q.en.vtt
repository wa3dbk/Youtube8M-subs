hey<00:00:02.340> everyone<00:00:02.879> our<00:00:03.120> sky<00:00:03.600> here<00:00:03.990> and<00:00:04.170> if<00:00:04.230> you

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
hey everyone our sky here and if you

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.430 
hey everyone our sky here and if you
know<00:00:04.470> I<00:00:04.500> do<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.830> lot<00:00:05.100> of<00:00:05.339> product<00:00:06.060> reviews<00:00:06.540> and<00:00:06.569> I

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
know I do a lot of product reviews and I

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.589 
know I do a lot of product reviews and I
think<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.309> product<00:00:08.580> review<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.120> important

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
think the product review is important

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.410 
think the product review is important
but<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:09.809> think<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:10.110> follow<00:00:10.380> up<00:00:10.650> review<00:00:10.889> is<00:00:11.420> if

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
but I think the follow up review is if

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.600 
but I think the follow up review is if
not<00:00:12.750> more<00:00:13.049> important<00:00:13.590> than<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.830> original<00:00:14.400> and

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
pieces but as you can see this one and

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.340 
pieces but as you can see this one and
this<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.030> great<00:01:00.210> example<00:01:00.359> because<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:03.350> even

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
this is a great example because I even

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.899 
this is a great example because I even
took<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> camera<00:01:04.979> underwater<00:01:05.430> with<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.820> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
took the camera underwater with it and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.240 
took the camera underwater with it and
I'll<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.150> again<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.860> thing<00:01:08.070> is

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
I'll do that again but this thing is

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.899 
I'll do that again but this thing is
never<00:01:08.520> leaked<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.950> it's<00:01:10.950> rock-solid<00:01:11.280> I

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
never leaked it's it's rock-solid I

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.499

so<00:02:15.500> if<00:02:15.560> you're<00:02:15.710> looking<00:02:15.860> for<00:02:16.160> something<00:02:16.400> that

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
so if you're looking for something that

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:24.100 
so if you're looking for something that
is<00:02:19.070> a<00:02:19.520> good<00:02:20.500> good<00:02:21.500> quality<00:02:22.570> timepiece<00:02:23.570> from<00:02:23.930> a

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
is a good good quality timepiece from a

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.050 
is a good good quality timepiece from a
durability<00:02:24.500> perspective<00:02:25.280> but<00:02:25.370> also<00:02:25.520> water

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
durability perspective but also water

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.510 
durability perspective but also water
resistance<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:26.990> I<00:02:27.770> would<00:02:27.920> go<00:02:28.040> as<00:02:28.160> far<00:02:28.220> as<00:02:28.490> to

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
resistance and I would go as far as to

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.950 
resistance and I would go as far as to
say<00:02:28.820> I<00:02:28.850> wouldn't<00:02:29.150> say<00:02:29.360> this<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.660> water

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
say I wouldn't say this is water

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.480 
say I wouldn't say this is water
resistant<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.620> would<00:02:30.800> say<00:02:30.950> it's<00:02:31.130> pretty<00:02:31.250> much

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
resistant I would say it's pretty much

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
resistant I would say it's pretty much
waterproof<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:33.380> as<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.800> says<00:02:34.010> on<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.310> front

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
waterproof and as it says on the front

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.090 
waterproof and as it says on the front
three<00:02:35.510> hundred<00:02:35.810> meters<00:02:36.140> of<00:02:36.350> thousand<00:02:36.860> feet

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
three hundred meters of thousand feet

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.070 
three hundred meters of thousand feet
and<00:02:37.430> then<00:02:38.000> this<00:02:38.150> over<00:02:38.330> here<00:02:38.450> is<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.690> hill<00:02:38.930> in

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
and then this over here is a hill in

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.520 
and then this over here is a hill in
helium<00:02:39.850> release<00:02:40.850> valve<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:41.510> feel<00:02:42.290> fairly

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
helium release valve I feel fairly

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.470 
helium release valve I feel fairly
confident<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.370> if<00:02:43.580> someone<00:02:43.940> wanted<00:02:44.210> to<00:02:44.300> put

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
confident that if someone wanted to put

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.230 
confident that if someone wanted to put
this<00:02:44.630> thing<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.080> an<00:02:45.230> extreme<00:02:45.650> test<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:47.120> it

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
this thing to an extreme test that it

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.160 
this thing to an extreme test that it
would<00:02:47.330> probably<00:02:47.720> hold<00:02:47.900> up<00:02:49.540> but<00:02:50.540> other<00:02:50.720> some<00:02:51.140> of

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
would probably hold up but other some of

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.090 
would probably hold up but other some of
the<00:02:51.290> other<00:02:51.350> popular<00:02:53.050> dive<00:02:54.050> watches<00:02:54.500> as<00:02:54.950> they

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
the other popular dive watches as they

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.180 
the other popular dive watches as they
call<00:02:55.340> them<00:02:55.520> I<00:02:55.760> don't<00:02:56.360> think<00:02:56.600> they<00:02:56.780> could<00:02:57.190> could

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
call them I don't think they could could

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.770 
call them I don't think they could could
come<00:02:58.400> close<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:58.850> this<00:02:59.000> but<00:02:59.240> yeah<00:02:59.450> mega

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
come close to this but yeah mega

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.450 
come close to this but yeah mega
