00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.280
 hello i am today with yoko du 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.650
 fashion blog neil is ambassador of the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.269
 nice trendy brand then yuko va 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.070
 answer the question how to make a 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.599
 fast and easy mail art 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.820
 so I will show you how 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.859
 make a fast and easy art with 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.390
 double decors so you have two 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.100
 models that exist you have the model 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.150
 on the entire surface of the nail as I 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.970
 will introduce you today on 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.750
 diane and you also have the motive in 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.609
 french manicure 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.710
 as you see on my nails then 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.300
 the first step is going to be to prepare the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.710
 surface of the nail so in a first 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.739
 time I'm going to disinfect my hands 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.660
 as well as my model and then I'm going 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.790
 do a fairly traditional preparation 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.590
 of the nail so for a start i'm going 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.420
 push back the cuticle and then I'm going 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.430
 describe the surface of the nail using 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.789
 of a block in order to open the scales of 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.879
 the nail so that the last adhesive on 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.440
 the nail I will finish with a cleaner or 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:04.260
 alcohol to degrease 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.790
 totally the surface of leuven then 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.280
 normally go to the break of the decor 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.960
 so as you see you have some 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.400
 forms that are so very long 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.659
 if you have the icy waters, do you 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.700
 can put them all the way 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.409
 but it's not necessary so as 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.189
 you see there are several widths 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.810
 of form 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.210
 so we will use the most form 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.189
 suited to the nail so here it is enough 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.890
 end i will take slightly more more 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.960
 the money once one has chosen his 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.939
 pattern we will cut the shape in half 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.200
 which here we have two cases either we are at 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.000
 the house and we want to do it on his 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.090
 own hands in which case we will cut 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.840
 the form really to the form of his 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.369
 nail 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.380
 if you do it on someone in an institute 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.540
 it's better to do as I do you 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.920
 showed now I'm going to look at the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.659
 shape of its angle so I see that 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.649
 it's slightly rounded so I'm going 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.740
 try to content in a first 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.930
 time to cut only the waters of the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.060
 decor then so I'll see if that 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.159
 just fits there he 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.500
 is still on his support so here we 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.509
 see that there is a facade and ziv we are going 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.110
 reactivate this glue to the heat had 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.870
 the fronts 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.220
 traditional hair and we will come the 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.370
 put under his hair for 10 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.370
 seconds 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.850
 so you see that the pattern is ready to 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.560
 employment because it is really 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.370
 flexible and it will really adapt to 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.620
 the form of languages 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.150
 I will now come and ask the form 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.800
 on the nail 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.170
 so I'm really going to really go 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.910
 by the middle of the nail and then I 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.600
 go back on both sides by pressing 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.730
 quite strongly 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.400
 we then check that there is no 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.820
 air bubble between the decor and the surface 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.940
 of the nail 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.410
 we will now cut out the shape of 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.840
 two sides of the nail in order to put it 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.290
 in form for that we will simply 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.900
 peeled off the nails decor on the side 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.700
 we will cut the shape on the side of 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.680
 two sides of the nail in fact so 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.660
 that they perfectly match 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.340
 the nail so we will go to the last 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.020
 step that is going to be putting in place 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.209
 shape on the end of the nail have 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.550
 for that I will use a file 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:01.770
 with a grain hard enough for him but 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:04.200
 the pattern over so then i'm going 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.230
 to refine the work by folding and 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.810
 malignant way below the nail of 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.070
 this way the simple reason 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.070
 perfectly matches 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.840
 why finish the work we will come 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.530
 with a grain a little finer for good 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.000
 throw the edge the break is now 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.650
 finished you now know how 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.650
 have pretty decorated nails
