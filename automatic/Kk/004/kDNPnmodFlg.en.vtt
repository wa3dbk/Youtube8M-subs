 Hello 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.680

 the old bridge inserted between santa maria novella of the domo palazzo della signoria 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:47.890
 in what is obviously not the reconstruction true to the millimeter from the 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.280
 Tuscan city but which undoubtedly constitutes the most lamentations 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.280
 suggestive never seen from behind 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.680
 but 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.400
 much changed compared to the first episode to diversify the mechanics 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.210
 of play 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.440
 certainly the inclusion in an economic component stands out 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.909
 every being accomplished will serve to slip money to spend 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.640
 otherwise, passers-by will be able to pick through passers-by through the groups of 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.710
 people with strange rope 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.000
 money was put on ointments healing potions and belen offensives 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.540
 but also to buy numerous weapons to add to professional 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.510

 drugs the fights have undergone several changes even if not 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.960
 radicals 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.590
 but it is possible however collects weapons disarming soldiers 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.860
 I have promptly found randomici hiring mercenary send to the state 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.179
 of the guards I have simply in starting order citizens who have been 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.729
 conquered at our bone age due to the popularity gained with 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.530
 the exploits of ezio 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.259
 it has also been rethought of salerno milan

 the one that dense you possible different targets 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.420
 it is not only activable with subjective laughter but also when you move 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.030
 the mind in the third person becoming a real way to play 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.659
 having in mind what are the objectives to be pursued 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.780
 many have seen in the repetitiveness of the action 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.379
 the main criticality is the first chapter 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.069
 to overcome this ubisoft has inserted the series to the secret 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.879
 these hidden areas will be mer it's just concentrated of nothing leigh in 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.489
 whose players will be forced to resort to all those skill moves 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.750

 which to recover a precious everyone 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.680
 it seems like ubisoft has done that they are lessons learned from 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.739
 first episode 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.499
