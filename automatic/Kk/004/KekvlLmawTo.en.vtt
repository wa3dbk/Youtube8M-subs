 hi girls in this video i do 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.050
 see with the creation of the lunettes for 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.700
 france with some simple 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.650
 of paper a little fire paper the 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.400
 mediation is like the ones they sell 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.400
 classical 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:27.460
 obviously also the removal like 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.250
 you know I never used the lunettes 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.280
 but for the nail art I have to do today 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.740
 these served me by force and since 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.110
 I had never used them and didn't have them 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.320
 home and I decided to make it myself 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.900
 if you are interested in how to make them at home 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.820
 follow the tutorial of this thanks 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.230
 Hello 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.130
 then we need a bit of 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.530
 baking paper 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.710
 because the baking paper is very much 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.640
 smooth almost hateful not to let him attack 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:04.769
 Scotch tape and of course Scotch and 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.769
 run apply a strip 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:14.520
 ah of course I forgot about the 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:22.000
 scissors but I am little more pro sla 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:25.590
 and cut another strip with one 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.390
 pencil we have to trace ours 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.100
 important and thickness between a bezel and 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.500
 the other ill- informed and do them all 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.720
 of the same angle to the oar sky 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.850
 with a certain smile the other must be 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.850
 with an equally smile 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.880
 every two lunettes leaves a space e 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:02.100
 I make the angle this is used for 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.100
 avoid going to tighten the bow 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.250
 let's move on to the cutout just follow 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:21.470
 the line we have drawn with the 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:23.720
 pencil of course you can decide if 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.700
 make them more smiling or less smiling 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.700
 all thanks hi girls
