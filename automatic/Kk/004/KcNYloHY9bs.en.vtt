00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.470
 And I think that 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.800
 It must be said working to surprise 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.250
 what is done 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.230
 in the course of next week 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.110
 they have difficult matches and you have to 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.490
 be ready 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.980
 as you saw the group very well I think that 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.600
 to the day of the preseason the group 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.600
 he did very well and that is very important 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.950
 and there they are joining the same group 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.240
 what a newcomer but they know 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.400
 what this little bit 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.150
 some insane fight but in the front 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.329
 with castillejo if always always has 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.510
 that to be one 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.940
 conte competitive for the other you 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.550
 They know that this is a healthy competition 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.320
 where we all want to be and it seems that 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.760
 work hard and we keep adding 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.129
 football minutes 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.739
 I believe that playing grabbing rhythm 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.909
 let's get good first time by 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.109
 there we find the second round 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.699
 a little better like that 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.829
 releasing one of them a little bit like having 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.059
 in account that receives the game we end 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.049
 the hard work of preseason and 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.710
 good to little it's very loosing and 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.710
 finding the equipment 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.070
 yes sure no doubt because I finish then 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.420
 he does a long preseason but if not 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.649
 sum minute of football with the team not 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.759
 I found I think adding minutes 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.500
 as I was saying, we are not going to go 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.920
 finding and we will be demonstrating 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.920
 best game 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.020
 very well and adapting to the team 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.110
 they are preparatory parties for what 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.100
 comes from the year there are many matches in the 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.409
 calendar so good here 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.290
 accommodating ourselves by getting ready to 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.940
 rhythm with the guys so nothing 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.940
 little by little we find the rhythm 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.310
 [Music] 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.440
 just like that, always not giving away anything 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.550
 fighting all the way and the good 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.530
 opportunities that you have to try 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.450
 seize them 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.340
 [Music] 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.579
 yes, I think that we are already 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.140
 we are going to know a little more today 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.789
 I have not had many opportunities but 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.440
 well I think with the running of the 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.489
 parties will be appearing the 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.420
 jokes so good to try 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.420
 take advantage of them when they have them 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.200
 and well this handles it has liked 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.880
 they have different players 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:27.130
 characteristics and what good the option the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:30.110
 from end to tomorrow 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.460
 and tomorrow morning he showed on Monday 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.460
 we do the quiet interview 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.620
 It's very cute but I'll make up 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.620
 tomorrow to sign
