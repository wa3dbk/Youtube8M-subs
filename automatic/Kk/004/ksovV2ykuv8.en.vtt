00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
prohibition era which is the 20s and 30s

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.389 
prohibition era which is the 20s and 30s
the<00:01:42.930> 1900s<00:01:43.530> at<00:01:43.619> least<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.310> actually

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
the 1900s at least so this is actually

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.789 
the 1900s at least so this is actually
going<00:01:44.670> back<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.030> time<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.840> before<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
going back in time this is before the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.499 
going back in time this is before the
nazi<00:01:47.130> regime<00:01:47.250> everything<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.390> i'm<00:01:48.479> thinking

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
nazi regime everything so i'm thinking

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.300 
nazi regime everything so i'm thinking
that<00:01:48.930> someone<00:01:49.290> else<00:01:49.439> will<00:01:49.649> be<00:01:49.770> controlling<00:01:50.189> it

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
that someone else will be controlling it

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.740 
that someone else will be controlling it
and<00:01:50.399> not<00:01:50.579> Richthofen<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.600> could

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
and not Richthofen and this could

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.910 
and not Richthofen and this could
possibly<00:01:51.990> tighten<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.530> storyline<00:01:52.890> that

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
possibly tighten the storyline that

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.740 
possibly tighten the storyline that
those<00:01:53.189> four<00:01:53.430> characters<00:01:53.790> will<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.360> back<00:01:54.540> and

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
those four characters will be back and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.230 
those four characters will be back and
then<00:01:54.990> they<00:01:55.140> will<00:01:55.290> be<00:01:55.979> teaming<00:01:56.250> up<00:01:56.490> now<00:01:56.969> if<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
then they will be teaming up now if the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.580 
then they will be teaming up now if the
new<00:01:57.360> characters<00:01:57.719> aren't<00:01:57.840> even<00:01:57.990> born<00:01:58.170> yet<00:01:58.229> but

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
new characters aren't even born yet but

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.980 
new characters aren't even born yet but
the<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.280> old<00:01:59.460> ones<00:01:59.700> were<00:01:59.909> at<00:02:00.509> least<00:02:00.659> probably

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the the old ones were at least probably

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.469 
the the old ones were at least probably
30<00:02:01.200> or<00:02:01.290> 40<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:02.189> black<00:02:02.460> ops<00:02:02.610> 2<00:02:02.729> i'm<00:02:03.030> black<00:02:03.299> ops

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
30 or 40 in black ops 2 i'm black ops

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.690 
30 or 40 in black ops 2 i'm black ops
and<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:04.020> was<00:02:04.140> like<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.740> mid<00:02:04.950> like<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.549> late

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
and that was like the mid like the late

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.969 
and that was like the mid like the late
50s<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.329> early<00:02:06.509> 60s<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.140> i<00:02:07.320> think<00:02:07.619> they<00:02:07.860> will

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
50s and early 60s so i think they will

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.999 
50s and early 60s so i think they will
be<00:02:08.099> back<00:02:08.250> if<00:02:08.789> not<00:02:09.060> then<00:02:10.050> they'll<00:02:10.229> travel<00:02:10.800> back

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
be back if not then they'll travel back

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.530 
be back if not then they'll travel back
in<00:02:11.039> time<00:02:11.160> or<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.730> new<00:02:11.819> people<00:02:12.090> travel<00:02:12.390> back<00:02:12.510> in

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
in time or the new people travel back in

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.190 
in time or the new people travel back in
time

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
time

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.140 
time
but<00:02:13.319> I<00:02:13.349> think<00:02:13.500> it's<00:02:13.620> be<00:02:13.739> very<00:02:14.459> very<00:02:14.670> scary<00:02:14.970> with

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
but I think it's be very very scary with

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.030 
but I think it's be very very scary with
the<00:02:15.270> gangsters<00:02:15.720> like<00:02:16.200> Al<00:02:16.349> Capone<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.830> people

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
the gangsters like Al Capone and people

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.199 
the gangsters like Al Capone and people
like<00:02:17.129> that<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.519> I<00:02:17.610> just<00:02:17.700> think<00:02:17.940> it's<00:02:18.030> gonna<00:02:18.120> be

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
like that and I just think it's gonna be

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.330 
like that and I just think it's gonna be
very<00:02:18.269> very<00:02:18.569> cool<00:02:18.810> guys<00:02:19.019> I'm<00:02:19.709> sorry<00:02:20.040> once<00:02:20.220> again
