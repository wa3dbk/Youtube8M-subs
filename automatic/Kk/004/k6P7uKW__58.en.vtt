00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
so I'm gonna show how to first change

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.639 
so I'm gonna show how to first change
the<00:00:04.890> combination<00:00:05.279> on<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.879> v7<00:00:06.420> combo<00:00:07.080> lock<00:00:07.319> and

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
the combination on the v7 combo lock and

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.370 
the combination on the v7 combo lock and
then<00:00:08.099> show<00:00:08.309> how<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.880> put<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.599> mount<00:00:10.019> it<00:00:10.200> on

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
then show how to put it and mount it on

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.560 
then show how to put it and mount it on
the<00:00:10.530> Kensington<00:00:11.070> lock<00:00:11.280> spot<00:00:11.700> over<00:00:12.179> here<00:00:12.210> if

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
the Kensington lock spot over here if

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.790 
the Kensington lock spot over here if
you<00:00:12.599> can<00:00:12.809> just<00:00:13.700> alright<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:15.330> first<00:00:15.630> make<00:00:16.560> sure

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
you can just alright so first make sure

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.099 
you can just alright so first make sure
the<00:00:16.980> lock<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.400> unlocked<00:00:17.570> the<00:00:18.570> default

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
the lock is unlocked the default

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.070 
the lock is unlocked the default
combination<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.830> zero<00:00:20.100> zero<00:00:20.340> zero<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.670> zero

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
combination is zero zero zero is zero

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.650 
combination is zero zero zero is zero
when<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.230> unlocked<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:23.340> will<00:00:23.580> move<00:00:23.820> in

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
when it's unlocked this will move in

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.630 
when it's unlocked this will move in
order<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.199> change<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> lock<00:00:25.830> combination

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
order to change the lock combination

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.839 
order to change the lock combination
what<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.630> need<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.900> do<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.380> take<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.340> coin<00:00:29.609> of

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
what you need to do is take a coin of

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.319 
what you need to do is take a coin of
anything<00:00:30.269> any<00:00:30.810> type<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.019> coin<00:00:31.439> use<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.579> to

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
anything any type of coin use this to

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.680 
anything any type of coin use this to
move<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:35.660> this<00:00:37.070> clockwise<00:00:38.239> you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.390> see<00:00:39.540> that

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
move the this clockwise you can see that

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.410 
move the this clockwise you can see that
this<00:00:39.809> red<00:00:40.110> dot<00:00:40.379> then<00:00:41.010> aligns<00:00:41.370> with<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.790> black

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
this red dot then aligns with the black

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.069 
this red dot then aligns with the black
bar<00:00:42.719> right<00:00:42.960> here<00:00:43.730> once<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:44.910> aligned<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.930> can

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
bar right here once it's aligned you can

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.380 
bar right here once it's aligned you can
now<00:00:46.200> change<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.710> combination<00:00:47.430> for<00:00:47.850> example

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
now change the combination for example

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.000 
now change the combination for example
we'll<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.629> change<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.200> zero<00:00:49.710> zero<00:00:49.950> zero

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
we'll just change it to zero zero zero

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.380 
we'll just change it to zero zero zero
nine<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:51.090> then<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:52.949> see<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.370> if<00:00:54.180> it's

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
nine and then you can see that if it's

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.990 
nine and then you can see that if it's
still<00:00:54.629> unlocked<00:00:55.260> once<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.340> done<00:00:56.640> you

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
still unlocked once this is done you

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.590 
still unlocked once this is done you
move<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.570> one<00:00:58.199> back<00:00:58.850> now<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> new

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
move this one back now this is a new

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.819 
move this one back now this is a new
combination<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.260> can<00:01:01.379> see<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.649> still

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
combination you can see it's still

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.950 
combination you can see it's still
unlocked<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.730> if<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.969> do<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.390> zero<00:01:03.690> zero<00:01:03.750> zero

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
unlocked so if I do a zero zero zero

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.520 
unlocked so if I do a zero zero zero
zero<00:01:04.339> again<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:06.090> will<00:01:06.299> not<00:01:06.479> move<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.380> new

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
zero again this will not move the new

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.460 
zero again this will not move the new
combination<00:01:08.280> as<00:01:08.520> triple<00:01:09.000> zero<00:01:09.240> 9<00:01:09.960> for<00:01:10.320> this

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
combination as triple zero 9 for this

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.200 
combination as triple zero 9 for this
lock<00:01:11.119> now<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.900> me<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:14.210> have

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
lock now that you have me you have

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.820 
lock now that you have me you have
changed<00:01:15.659> your<00:01:15.750> combination<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.350> next<00:01:16.650> step

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
changed your combination the next step

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.969 
changed your combination the next step
is<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.340> actually<00:01:17.909> mount<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
is to actually mount it on the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.490 
is to actually mount it on the
Kensington<00:01:20.610> lock<00:01:20.790> spot<00:01:21.240> what<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.080> would<00:01:22.259> be

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
Kensington lock spot what you would be

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.640 
Kensington lock spot what you would be
doing<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:23.360> once<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> secure<00:01:25.530> location

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
doing is once you have a secure location

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.280 
doing is once you have a secure location
of<00:01:26.040> where<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.369> can<00:01:26.549> wrap<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.810> cord<00:01:28.170> around

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
of where you can wrap the cord around

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.719 
of where you can wrap the cord around
using<00:01:30.079> this<00:01:31.079> well<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.829> not<00:01:31.950> open<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:32.579> if

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
using this well this is not open but if

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.880 
using this well this is not open but if
you<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.420> was<00:01:33.630> open<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:33.990> would<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.320> put

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
you this was open you would just put

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.590 
you this was open you would just put
this<00:01:35.040> theory<00:01:35.340> share<00:01:36.110> like<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.600> there'll

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
this theory share like this and there'll

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.330 
this theory share like this and there'll
be<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.810> pole<00:01:40.110> here<00:01:40.470> I'm<00:01:40.680> not<00:01:40.860> going<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.100> show<00:01:41.310> up

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
be a pole here I'm not going to show up

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.480 
be a pole here I'm not going to show up
very<00:01:42.060> nicely<00:01:42.299> right<00:01:42.750> now<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.170> won't<00:01:43.590> but

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
very nicely right now so I won't but

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.280 
very nicely right now so I won't but
what<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.880> need<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.570> make<00:01:45.720> sure<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.110> when

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
what you need to do to make sure is when

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.969 
what you need to do to make sure is when
it's<00:01:46.470> unlocked<00:01:47.210> you<00:01:48.210> see<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.659> two<00:01:48.899> teeth<00:01:49.290> that

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
it's unlocked you see the two teeth that

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.980 
it's unlocked you see the two teeth that
come<00:01:50.220> out<00:01:50.369> here<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:51.360> needs<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.720> be<00:01:51.810> mounted

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
come out here this needs to be mounted

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.980 
come out here this needs to be mounted
inside<00:01:52.500> here<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.610> order<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.240> secure<00:01:54.840> it

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
inside here in order for it to secure it

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.420 
inside here in order for it to secure it
so<00:01:55.140> we'll<00:01:55.740> do<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:57.860> first<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.070> put<00:01:59.280> this

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
so we'll do that first you put this

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.880 
so we'll do that first you put this
thing<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.820> this<00:01:59.939> will<00:02:00.119> go<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.420> like<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:01.020> if

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
thing and this will go in like this if

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.149 
thing and this will go in like this if
you<00:02:02.009> can<00:02:02.189> see<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:02.899> eternity<00:02:03.899> then<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.829> turn

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
you can see this eternity then you turn

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.280 
you can see this eternity then you turn
it<00:02:05.310> around

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
it around

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.950 
it around
so<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.310> teeth<00:02:08.690> would<00:02:09.690> prompt<00:02:11.960> probably

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
so that the teeth would prompt probably

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:26.720 
so that the teeth would prompt probably
going<00:02:20.810> make<00:02:21.810> sure<00:02:21.840> it's<00:02:22.170> unlocked<00:02:25.160> go<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.460> all
