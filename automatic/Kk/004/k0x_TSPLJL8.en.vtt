00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
a Gaza but you know we learn from the

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
making a run and making a comeback they

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.490 
making a run and making a comeback they
could<00:01:11.210> have<00:01:11.300> just<00:01:11.330> laid<00:01:11.630> down<00:01:11.660> but<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:12.380> know

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
could have just laid down but you know

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.430 
could have just laid down but you know
that's<00:01:13.040> a<00:01:13.160> tough<00:01:13.400> I<00:01:13.550> in<00:01:13.610> team<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.260> we'd<00:01:15.260> learn

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
that's a tough I in team so we'd learn

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.990 
that's a tough I in team so we'd learn
from<00:01:15.650> and<00:01:15.860> get<00:01:15.979> better<00:01:16.160> how<00:01:16.670> much<00:01:16.850> of<00:01:16.880> that

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
from and get better how much of that

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.910 
from and get better how much of that
momentum<00:01:17.270> you<00:01:17.810> think<00:01:17.990> that<00:01:18.110> they<00:01:18.200> got<00:01:18.229> fourth

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
momentum you think that they got fourth

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.960 
momentum you think that they got fourth
quarters<00:01:19.310> 144<00:01:19.940> points<00:01:20.119> can<00:01:20.600> be<00:01:20.630> careful<00:01:21.080> I

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
quarters 144 points can be careful I

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.460 
quarters 144 points can be careful I
don't<00:01:22.970> know<00:01:23.060> I'm<00:01:23.360> a<00:01:23.479> that's<00:01:23.720> not<00:01:23.930> from<00:01:24.110> that's

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
don't know I'm a that's not from that's

don't know I'm a that's not from that's
13<00:01:24.890> but<00:01:25.100> we've<00:01:25.340> got<00:01:25.550> to<00:01:25.640> go<00:01:25.729> out<00:01:25.790> there<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:26.000> do

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
13 but we've got to go out there and do

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.050

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.680 
know how we know how to fight you let
you<00:01:30.920> lost<00:01:31.130> any<00:01:31.310> momentum<00:01:31.790> going<00:01:31.940> again<00:01:32.540> how

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
you lost any momentum going again how

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.210

the<00:01:32.750> game<00:01:32.990> ended<00:01:33.259> my<00:01:33.560> I<00:01:33.590> don't<00:01:33.800> think<00:01:34.040> we<00:01:34.100> lost

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
the game ended my I don't think we lost

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.830 
the game ended my I don't think we lost
I<00:01:34.369> mean<00:01:34.550> we<00:01:34.640> still<00:01:34.850> won<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.210> game<00:01:35.360> at<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.750> end

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
I mean we still won the game at the end

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.310 
I mean we still won the game at the end
a<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.380> W<00:01:37.340> counts<00:01:37.729> and<00:01:38.000> you<00:01:38.720> know<00:01:38.810> we<00:01:38.930> take<00:01:39.170> that

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
a the W counts and you know we take that

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.040 
a the W counts and you know we take that
as<00:01:39.500> a<00:01:39.530> positive<00:01:39.619> we<00:01:40.040> won<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.340> game<00:01:40.369> so<00:01:41.050> we

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
as a positive we won the game so we

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.330 
as a positive we won the game so we
can't<00:01:42.259> let<00:01:42.470> you<00:01:42.619> know<00:01:42.680> we<00:01:42.800> look<00:01:42.920> at<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.160> things

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
can't let you know we look at the things

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.859 
can't let you know we look at the things
that<00:01:43.520> we<00:01:43.580> did<00:01:43.759> bad<00:01:43.970> and<00:01:44.240> we<00:01:44.300> learn<00:01:44.479> from<00:01:44.690> them

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
that we did bad and we learn from them

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.109 
that we did bad and we learn from them
but<00:01:45.140> we<00:01:45.380> still<00:01:45.619> were<00:01:46.250> when<00:01:46.610> it<00:01:46.759> is<00:01:46.850> serious

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
but we still were when it is serious

we're<00:01:54.990> lost<00:01:55.620> Kari<00:01:55.800> is<00:01:56.159> over<00:01:56.520> yeah<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.540> think<00:01:57.720> so

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
we're lost Kari is over yeah I think so

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.690 
we're lost Kari is over yeah I think so
because<00:01:58.320> every<00:01:58.620> game<00:01:58.770> different<00:01:59.250> every

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
because every game different every

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.330 
because every game different every
single<00:01:59.729> game<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.300> different<00:02:00.630> game<00:02:01.340> again

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
single game is a different game again

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.399 
single game is a different game again
what<00:02:02.550> was<00:02:02.670> different<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.000> game<00:02:03.150> to<00:02:03.390> game<00:02:04.140> two

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
what was different the game to game two

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.290 
what was different the game to game two
was<00:02:04.740> different<00:02:05.220> in<00:02:05.280> Game<00:02:05.430> five<00:02:05.640> every<00:02:06.150> game

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
was different in Game five every game

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.330 
was different in Game five every game
different<00:02:06.720> so<00:02:06.900> I<00:02:07.110> think<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.979> lot<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
different so I think a lot of the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.100 
different so I think a lot of the
momentum<00:02:09.060> stuff<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.420> think<00:02:09.630> it's<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.959> know

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
momentum stuff I think it's you know

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.440 
momentum stuff I think it's you know
it's<00:02:10.140> overhyped<00:02:10.950> because<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.790> tenday<00:02:12.180> still

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
it's overhyped because a tenday still

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.390 
it's overhyped because a tenday still
going<00:02:12.600> to<00:02:12.660> start<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.900> game<00:02:12.930> over<00:02:13.320> you<00:02:14.160> can't

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
going to start the game over you can't

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.860 
going to start the game over you can't
lead<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.700> long<00:02:14.850> time<00:02:15.090> are<00:02:15.300> these<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.570> biggest
