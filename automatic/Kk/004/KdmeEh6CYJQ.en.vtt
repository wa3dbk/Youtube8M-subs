00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.730
 between 1997 and 2006 only five panda cubs were born in the 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.099
 United States the low number considering that four years of cost 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.990
 so it seems plant-eaters the heat of giant pandas females 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.960
 for 12 to 25 days each spring 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.640
 within this period they are receptive to mating for 2 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.500
 hours 7 days are happy for maximum 36 hours 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.710
 these limitations made it very difficult to reproduce plants 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.050
 wild life in packs compete for floods during the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.180
 mating is the dominant male home several times with the leg in the period 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.550
 which increases the chances of procreation and at the same time serve as a 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.810
 example to the younger bands when they are raised in captivity between detainees 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.950
 the packs do not need to compete for the series and ended up losing interest 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.450
 to each side or even do not know how to do it the zoos the puppies 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.140
 of panda are separated from their mothers at six months of age the hope that 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.070
 females re-breed faster 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.620
 already in the wild the puppies stay on the maternal care until 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.880
 complete a year and a half to save plans for extinction scientists 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.760
 are developing various techniques to help them procreate 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.300
 in captivity as tests to determine whether females are or not the flywheel 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.920
 in-depth studies on the behavior of bands and procedures 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.369
 defined artificial termination even with all these advances is still 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.930
 It is difficult to say when a feminist effectively 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.490
 they suffer from psychological pregnancy 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.610
 Another factor that hinders the identification of gestation is the fact 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.780
 of the band offer to be very small this without speaking in the maternal womb 45 days 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.730
 before birth 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.930
 how everything works explains how it works to quote 7 birth of pandas
