00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.610
 this note 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.030
 ah I show myself of the accident of a 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.030
 depression 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.570
 ahead 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.170
 now with what you have are doing 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.079
 I feel happier here 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.140
 because I see that it shows what they think 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.620
 do 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.590
 understands the colors 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.670
 It makes me feel one 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.670
 food 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:56.610
 plus 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.900
 the nature of man 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.120
 to express yourself 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.400
 even though the system oppresses you 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:09.680
 that one is subjected to 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.930
 to labor regimes to studies 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.170
 that in a certain way to prosecute life 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.369
 one will always find a way 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.070
 to vent it as the most ludic side 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.330
 be it the lady in her house weaving that 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.360
 many times he does not even sell his 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.640
 product but it simply does 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.710
 because he has a creative need that 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.580
 must express the somehow either 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.369
 in the shape and colors of your past or 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.189
 in a crochet cloth that equal 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.250
 certain form are crafts and expression 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.250
 artistic 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:51.660
 graffiti is transforming into a 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.660
 Super sensitive and super texture 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.200
 Respectful of its roots , graffiti 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.020
 Latin American the Chilean are 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.299
 Following 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.219
 in history before the graffiti 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.619
 your own countries have an example 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.830
 Brazil is another example in Peru too 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.890
 there is an ethnic heritage load 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.930
 cultural very very very powerful that is 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.879
 that if you can see it in the streets in 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.879
 what is done as graffiti 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.170
 how it gives life to the world 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.190
 because if I had black and white that 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:31.150
 would be 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.579
 clear as he understands but he puts fruit 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.120
 I imagine the iron is a house that 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.120
 Do you get me 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.760
 ah 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.290
 no no 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.620
 night
