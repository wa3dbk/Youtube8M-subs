00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.529
 the next point after the cup 

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:11.129
 It is the third height 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:13.469
 to which they must be I saw them 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.929
 you will say 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.849
 because I have a red wine 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:19.619
 creating they are already in age 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.710
 The reality is that red wines are also afraid to cool down if the 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.300
 room temperature 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.119
 no proportional 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.880
 adequate temperature 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.910
 I learned 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.440
 What does it mean 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.620
 on a sunny day 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.430
 where the interior of the restaurant where we are 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.320
 it should be around about 25 degrees 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.210
 if I take out this red wine 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.469
 at room temperature we would be living the 25 degrees 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.010
 which is not correct 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.880
 red wines depending on age 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.910
 they must be giving at least 18 degrees and they are younger 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.840
 they can even and series and 6 and up to 14 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.740
 how can we know the exact temperature in which the hiv is good 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.080
 the reality is that good 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.760
 those of us who dedicate ourselves to this maybe we have a little bit of experience and 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.990
 we can only with the pact know 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.950
 sylvinho and even at the temperature 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.160
 but on the other hand, maybe this is the case 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.630
 a person who is a beginner there are 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.740
 thermometers that can be purchased in hearth where 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.210
 to put the thermometer and know exactly the faith 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.210
 temperature in the third 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.210
 As I said, be aware of the wine that we are 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.810
 speaking in question will be the specific temperature at which we should 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.920
 us here 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.330
 here I want to say with this 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.630
 explanation the moments at which temperatures 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.100
 average should be handled 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.880
 white villages also have a specific temperature and also going to 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.140
 depend if they are 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.770
 sweet white 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.060
 They are dry white 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.600
 positions 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.880
 formally sweet dishes will tend to look a little colder than 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.759
 The Czechs 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.039
 the teams are only around around 11 degrees 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:18.039
 I recommend the echoes on the seven degrees and the sparkling ones 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.759
 it is very important to take into account one thing 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:26.069
 normally we should always lower the temperature a couple of degrees more 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.919
 d what we have 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.919
 I have hoped for 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:35.579
 because when we took it out of the fridge 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.579
 at that time you will start to acquire temperature 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:41.829
 and it is proven what is 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.829
 very normal it can go up a couple of degrees 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.560
 of temperature at the moment that we are not following
