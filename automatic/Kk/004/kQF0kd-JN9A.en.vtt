00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.200
 act 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.770
 the electrical system is the energy that drives the operation of all 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.409
 business systems 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:16.500
 this in turn must be referred to a grounding system as the brand 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:20.699
 the mentioned electric co uk neck 250 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.210
 and other international institutions 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.279
 to meet two fundamental objectives 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.849
 human security 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.589
 and guarantee of operation of electrical and electronic equipment 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.590
 conventional grounding systems are subject to variables that 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.600
 radically reduce their performance and reliability over time 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.460
 for example the manufacturing materials that are made of steel and a 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.460
 copper coating you generate to go to the bank 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.180
 additionally in the process of installing the systems 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.639
 conventional 

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:57.399
 chemical compounds are used that in combination with the acidity of the soil 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.980
 accelerate their deterioration by increasing oxidation 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.410
 the ambient temperature and the terrain conditions as the factor 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.320
 moisture 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.610
 they also affect the resistance of the system in addition to requiring a 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.750
 frequent maintenance that is expensive over time 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.430
 being the pdi directionality of these systems its main limitation for 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.510
 ensure efficient operation of the equipment licadho and sensitive 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.800
 as it is in microelectronics and power electronics 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.470
 Due to the above, it is vitally important that they adequately protect 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.270
 its operational infrastructure using cutting-edge technology totally 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.540
 superior to conventional systems to achieve a good connection to the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.049
 land 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.990
 that is safe effective and reliable oriented to avoid delays or stoppages 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.179
 of production as well as damage to personnel and equipment 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.640
 With professionalism and with the acquired experience we have evaluated the systems of 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.410
 current grounding and the electrical and electronic environment and 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.649
 as a response to the needs and demands of the market we design and 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.810
 we produce an optimal system that allows us to offer our customers 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.280
 total security the result is 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.609
 more to ground 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.549
 the application of universal laws of physics to the development of more to 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:23.120
 land 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.500
 allowed them to find the following properties and advantages 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:31.859
 high performance of the structural electrode by its contact area 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.299
 thus achieving greater dissipation in the field 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:42.370
 a capacitive effect due to the plague on both ends which is accentuated 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.260
 thanks to its closed body having a negative preponderance to the subsoil 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:52.469
 use of the property of the tips to download to greater 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:53.220
 depth 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.030
 this thanks to the tip termination of the lower part of the electrode 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.660
 thus minimizing the risk of voltage tito vÃ¡zquez step by its technology 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.700
 integrated eliminates the return of the subsoil to applications due to its 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.890
 active magnet filter which converts more to ground into a unique system and 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.940
 made high avoiding electromagnetic impulses from the subsoil to 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.940
 sensitive and sensitive equipment 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:23.310
 Besides, our system is free of maintenance 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.050
 and offers a lifespan of up to 15 years 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:28.869
 more to ground 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:31.899
 because everything must be referred to earth
