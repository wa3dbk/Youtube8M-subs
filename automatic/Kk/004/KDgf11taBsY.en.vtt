you're going to get more current flow

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.220 
you're going to get more current flow
and<00:00:38.350> you<00:00:38.470> can<00:00:38.500> get<00:00:38.890> this<00:00:39.100> from

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
and you can get this from

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.360 
and you can get this from
your<00:00:40.530> local<00:00:41.010> car<00:00:41.340> stereo<00:00:42.329> audio<00:00:42.690> shops<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.920> lot

of<00:00:44.489> times<00:00:44.760> we're<00:00:45.180> doing<00:00:45.510> battery<00:00:46.200> cables<00:00:46.559> you

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
of times we're doing battery cables you

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.049 
of times we're doing battery cables you
can<00:00:46.770> actually<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.160> pick<00:00:47.340> up<00:00:47.489> some<00:00:47.670> scraps

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
can actually just pick up some scraps

some<00:00:48.900> stuff<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.230> they<00:00:49.320> would<00:00:49.470> normally

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
some stuff that they would normally

throw<00:00:49.949> away<00:00:50.040> because<00:00:51.260> your<00:00:52.260> battery<00:00:52.410> cables

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
throw away because your battery cables

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.970 
throw away because your battery cables
are<00:00:53.100> never<00:00:53.250> really<00:00:53.520> too<00:00:53.699> long<00:00:54.379> as<00:00:55.379> far<00:00:55.590> as<00:00:55.770> that

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
are never really too long as far as that

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
some resin core solder actually

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.550 
some resin core solder actually
some<00:01:12.990> additional<00:01:13.640> rosin<00:01:15.079> this<00:01:16.079> makes<00:01:16.350> the

some additional rosin this makes the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:29.730 
some additional rosin this makes the
solder<00:01:17.069> blow<00:01:17.579> better

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.219 

you<00:01:29.890> want<00:01:30.040> to<00:01:30.130> heat<00:01:30.310> this

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
you want to heat this

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.749 
you want to heat this
and<00:01:32.439> you<00:01:32.530> want<00:01:32.680> to<00:01:32.770> keep<00:01:32.979> heat<00:01:33.310> on<00:01:33.520> it

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
and you want to keep heat on it

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.590 
and you want to keep heat on it
constantly

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.420 

if<00:01:38.870> you<00:01:38.960> take<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.350> heat<00:01:39.530> off<00:01:39.560> of<00:01:39.920> a<00:01:40.010> facade<00:01:40.370> er

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
if you take the heat off of a facade er

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.609 
if you take the heat off of a facade er
well

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.660 

basically

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
basically

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.330 
basically
go<00:01:46.210> back<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.600> its<00:01:46.750> original<00:01:46.840> state

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
go back to its original state

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:57.690 
go back to its original state
the

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.330 

what<00:01:58.270> I<00:01:58.299> normally<00:01:58.450> do<00:01:59.110> is<00:01:59.320> I<00:01:59.469> try<00:01:59.799> to<00:01:59.829> fill<00:02:00.219> it

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
what I normally do is I try to fill it

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.490 
what I normally do is I try to fill it
up<00:02:00.430> about<00:02:00.579> halfway<00:02:01.149> I<00:02:01.509> know<00:02:01.840> he's<00:02:01.990> gonna<00:02:02.259> see

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
up about halfway I know he's gonna see

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.830 
up about halfway I know he's gonna see
that<00:02:02.820> thought<00:02:03.820> up<00:02:03.969> about<00:02:04.210> halfway<00:02:04.479> with

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
that thought up about halfway with

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.990 
that thought up about halfway with
solder

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.449 

dump<00:02:10.660> it<00:02:10.780> in<00:02:10.869> there

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
dump it in there

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.280 
dump it in there
be<00:02:12.760> careful<00:02:13.329> though<00:02:13.450> because<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.989> solder

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
be careful though because the solder

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.710 
be careful though because the solder
will<00:02:14.590> splattered<00:02:15.159> and<00:02:15.310> can<00:02:15.579> burn

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.140 

that<00:02:20.960> they're<00:02:21.170> from<00:02:21.440> what

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
that they're from what

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.050 
that they're from what
down

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
down

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.180 
down
a<00:02:24.090> little<00:02:24.630> bit<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:25.319> can<00:02:25.440> see<00:02:25.739> it's<00:02:25.860> very

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
a little bit you can see it's very

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.190 
a little bit you can see it's very
strong

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
you want to look to for your little wire

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.050 
you want to look to for your little wire
hangers<00:02:36.890> hanging<00:02:37.220> off<00:02:37.310> here<00:02:37.520> too<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:37.790> want<00:02:38.000> to

hangers hanging off here too you want to

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.040 
hangers hanging off here too you want to
trim<00:02:38.240> those<00:02:38.420> off

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
trim those off
