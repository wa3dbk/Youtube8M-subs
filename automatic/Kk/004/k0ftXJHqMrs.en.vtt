ride a Cannock Chase where conditions
are<00:00:21.399> very<00:00:21.579> sandy<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:23.140> since<00:00:23.380> it<00:00:23.500> are<00:00:23.590> the

00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:23.649 
are very sandy so since it are the

winter<00:00:25.390> I<00:00:25.739> tend<00:00:26.739> to<00:00:26.770> use<00:00:26.919> organic<00:00:27.070> pads<00:00:27.520> in<00:00:27.730> the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
winter I tend to use organic pads in the

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.280 
winter I tend to use organic pads in the
summer<00:00:28.029> if<00:00:28.239> and<00:00:28.570> when<00:00:28.660> everything<00:00:28.989> is<00:00:29.079> dry<00:00:29.230> and

dusty the only tool you will need for
this<00:00:32.110> is<00:00:32.169> the<00:00:32.380> TNR<00:00:32.649> millimeter<00:00:33.160> allen<00:00:33.370> key<00:00:33.609> as

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
this is the TNR millimeter allen key as

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.189 
this is the TNR millimeter allen key as
well<00:00:34.090> as<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:34.300> disc<00:00:34.480> rotor<00:00:34.750> wipes<00:00:34.899> supplied

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
with the fibrex pads the first step is

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.990 
with the fibrex pads the first step is
to<00:00:38.320> remove<00:00:38.410> the<00:00:38.500> c-clip<00:00:38.769> these<00:00:39.670> are<00:00:39.850> quite

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
to remove the c-clip these are quite

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.189 
to remove the c-clip these are quite
fragile<00:00:40.239> but<00:00:40.600> should<00:00:40.719> come<00:00:40.839> off<00:00:40.960> quite<00:00:41.140> easily

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
unscrew all the way out so once the

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.029 
unscrew all the way out so once the
thread<00:00:56.019> has<00:00:56.350> reached<00:00:56.559> his<00:00:56.679> end

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
thread has reached his end

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.680 
thread has reached his end
just<00:00:57.249> pull<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:57.399> bolts<00:00:57.699> out<00:00:59.879> key<00:01:00.879> pop<00:01:01.059> now<00:01:01.629> we

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
just pull the bolts out key pop now we

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.910 
just pull the bolts out key pop now we
need<00:01:01.870> to<00:01:01.960> remove<00:01:02.140> the<00:01:02.289> old<00:01:02.409> part<00:01:02.649> and<00:01:02.769> clip

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
need to remove the old part and clip

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.499 
need to remove the old part and clip
simply<00:01:03.579> pull<00:01:03.819> them<00:01:03.969> straight<00:01:04.059> up<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:07.299> next

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
simply pull them straight up the next

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:08.670 
simply pull them straight up the next
step<00:01:07.630> is<00:01:07.750> to<00:01:07.810> check<00:01:07.930> and<00:01:08.110> prepare<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.470> disc

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
step is to check and prepare the disc

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.649 
step is to check and prepare the disc
before<00:01:08.890> inserting<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.460> new<00:01:09.610> pads<00:01:09.820> inspect

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
before inserting the new pads inspect

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:11.969 
before inserting the new pads inspect
the<00:01:10.720> writer<00:01:10.899> for<00:01:11.049> any<00:01:11.229> signs<00:01:11.470> of<00:01:11.560> damage<00:01:11.619> or

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
the writer for any signs of damage or

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.499 
the writer for any signs of damage or
warping<00:01:12.369> as<00:01:12.549> this<00:01:12.850> sort<00:01:13.030> of<00:01:13.060> problem<00:01:13.329> could

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
warping as this sort of problem could

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:14.639 
warping as this sort of problem could
wear<00:01:13.659> down<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:13.899> new<00:01:14.020> parts<00:01:14.259> quicker<00:01:14.470> than

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
wear down the new parts quicker than

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.639 
wear down the new parts quicker than
normal<00:01:15.479> once<00:01:16.479> happy<00:01:16.780> with<00:01:16.810> the<00:01:16.930> disc<00:01:17.200> take<00:01:17.560> the

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
normal once happy with the disc take the

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.709 
normal once happy with the disc take the
disparate<00:01:17.979> to<00:01:18.100> wipe<00:01:18.250> from<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.520> packet<00:01:18.880> the

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719 
disparate to wipe from the packet the

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.240 
disparate to wipe from the packet the
easiest<00:01:19.960> way<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.170> do<00:01:20.409> this<00:01:20.560> is<00:01:20.770> fold<00:01:21.040> the<00:01:21.130> wipe

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
easiest way to do this is fold the wipe

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.870 
easiest way to do this is fold the wipe
in<00:01:21.399> half<00:01:22.770> then<00:01:23.770> wipe<00:01:23.979> both<00:01:24.159> sides<00:01:24.460> of<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:24.700> disc

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
in half then wipe both sides of the disc

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.370 
in half then wipe both sides of the disc
at<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.180> same<00:01:25.329> time<00:01:25.600> while<00:01:25.930> spinning<00:01:26.200> the

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
at the same time while spinning the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.969 
at the same time while spinning the
wheel<00:01:27.570> disc<00:01:28.570> roaches<00:01:28.899> can<00:01:29.110> be<00:01:29.259> very<00:01:29.469> sharp<00:01:29.710> so

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
wheel disc roaches can be very sharp so

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.300 
wheel disc roaches can be very sharp so
please<00:01:30.130> be<00:01:30.280> careful<00:01:30.430> while<00:01:30.729> doing<00:01:30.880> this<00:01:32.310> at

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
please be careful while doing this at

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.649 
please be careful while doing this at
this<00:01:33.460> time<00:01:33.670> it<00:01:33.789> is<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:33.909> good<00:01:34.060> idea<00:01:34.180> to<00:01:34.450> check<00:01:34.600> the

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
this time it is a good idea to check the

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:35.760 
this time it is a good idea to check the
