do not use the homing rockets because

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.520 
do not use the homing rockets because
the<00:00:38.550> problem<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.149> they<00:00:39.359> take<00:00:39.600> too<00:00:39.840> long<00:00:40.079> and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
helicopter then you'll see just random

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.329 
helicopter then you'll see just random
helicopters<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.739> are<00:01:01.890> flying<00:01:02.129> around

of<00:01:07.980> you<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.280> then<00:01:08.940> be<00:01:09.750> sure<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.050> don't<00:01:10.200> get<00:01:10.350> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
of you and then be sure you don't get a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.440 
of you and then be sure you don't get a
strike<00:01:10.500> team<00:01:10.800> and<00:01:10.980> just<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
strike team and just do that the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.000 
strike team and just do that the
helicopters<00:01:12.990> will<00:01:13.110> keep<00:01:13.290> spawning<00:01:13.590> it'll

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
helicopters will keep spawning it'll

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.470 
helicopters will keep spawning it'll
take<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> while<00:01:14.580> but<00:01:15.510> you<00:01:16.320> won't<00:01:16.620> die<00:01:17.480> because

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 
take a while but you won't die because

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.020 
take a while but you won't die because
this<00:01:18.900> can<00:01:19.650> be<00:01:19.830> extremely<00:01:20.280> hard<00:01:20.610> like<00:01:20.850> you'll

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
this can be extremely hard like you'll

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.420 
this can be extremely hard like you'll
see<00:01:21.210> here<00:01:21.510> there<00:01:22.320> four<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.770> them<00:01:23.070> I'm<00:01:23.250> gonna

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
see here there four of them I'm gonna

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.370 
see here there four of them I'm gonna
try<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.820> kill<00:01:23.970> them<00:01:24.120> all<00:01:24.240> before<00:01:24.690> strike<00:01:25.140> team

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
try and kill them all before strike team

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.290 
try and kill them all before strike team
comes<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:26.010> because<00:01:26.280> they're<00:01:26.490> all<00:01:26.640> four<00:01:26.970> so

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
comes but because they're all four so

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.590 
comes but because they're all four so
close<00:01:27.660> I<00:01:27.990> don't<00:01:28.620> think<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.180> was<00:01:30.180> able<00:01:30.390> to

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
close I don't think that I was able to

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.900 
close I don't think that I was able to
pull<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.870> off<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.440> you<00:01:32.010> want<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> always<00:01:32.580> use

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
pull it off but you want to always use

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.140 
pull it off but you want to always use
the<00:01:32.940> machine<00:01:33.330> gun<00:01:33.510> ammo<00:01:33.690> because<00:01:34.140> as<00:01:34.380> long<00:01:34.680> as

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
the machine gun ammo because as long as

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.340 
the machine gun ammo because as long as
you're<00:01:36.150> always<00:01:36.510> going<00:01:36.690> to<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:36.780> close<00:01:37.170> enough

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
you're always going to be close enough

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.460 
you're always going to be close enough
where<00:01:37.860> it'll<00:01:38.220> attack<00:01:38.820> well<00:01:39.480> do<00:01:39.840> damage<00:01:40.230> if

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
where it'll attack well do damage if

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.530 
where it'll attack well do damage if
anything<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.040> going<00:01:41.160> to<00:01:41.250> do<00:01:41.610> damage<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:44.540> it's

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
anything is going to do damage and it's

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.630 
anything is going to do damage and it's
usually<00:01:46.050> just<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.680> best<00:01:46.980> because<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.460> kills

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
usually just the best because it kills

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.480 
usually just the best because it kills
the<00:01:47.910> fastest<00:01:48.480> out<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.750> all<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.050> them<00:01:49.170> um<00:01:49.620> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
the fastest out of all of them um the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.090 
the fastest out of all of them um the
homing<00:01:50.700> rocket<00:01:51.180> does<00:01:51.390> kill<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:51.870> one<00:01:52.020> hit<00:01:52.350> but

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
homing rocket does kill in one hit but

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.950 
homing rocket does kill in one hit but
it<00:01:53.370> takes<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:54.030> while<00:01:54.150> to<00:01:54.390> get<00:01:54.480> to<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.750> target

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
it takes a while to get to the target

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.050 
it takes a while to get to the target
and<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.860> get<00:01:56.070> shot<00:01:56.340> down<00:01:56.390> so<00:01:57.620> yeah<00:01:59.060> and

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
and you can get shot down so yeah and

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.940 
and you can get shot down so yeah and
that's<00:02:00.420> how<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.630> do<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.870> there's<00:02:01.380> strike<00:02:01.710> team

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
that's how you do it there's strike team

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.940 
that's how you do it there's strike team
that's<00:02:02.160> coming<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:03.350> strike<00:02:04.350> teams<00:02:04.590> when

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
that's coming and strike teams when

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.110 
that's coming and strike teams when
you're<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.220> a<00:02:05.310> helicopter<00:02:05.520> will<00:02:06.000> usually
