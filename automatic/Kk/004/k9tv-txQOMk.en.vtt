just create go on like talk about the
new<00:02:40.209> matchmaking<00:02:40.719> system<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:42.340> basically<00:02:42.730> what

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
new matchmaking system so basically what

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.550 
new matchmaking system so basically what
happens<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.299> think<00:02:43.689> this<00:02:43.959> is<00:02:44.139> a<00:02:44.169> really<00:02:44.379> bad

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
happens is I think this is a really bad

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.569 
happens is I think this is a really bad
idea<00:02:44.919> in<00:02:45.280> my<00:02:45.370> opinion<00:02:46.290> basically<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:48.400> could

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
idea in my opinion basically you could

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.250 
idea in my opinion basically you could
you<00:02:48.849> get<00:02:49.000> put<00:02:49.180> into<00:02:49.299> matches<00:02:49.719> where<00:02:49.900> everyone

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
you get put into matches where everyone

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.750 
you get put into matches where everyone
is<00:02:50.290> pretty<00:02:50.500> much<00:02:50.650> roughly<00:02:51.129> the<00:02:51.250> same<00:02:51.400> rank<00:02:51.669> as

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
is pretty much roughly the same rank as

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.670 
is pretty much roughly the same rank as
you<00:02:51.939> it's<00:02:52.239> like<00:02:52.359> a<00:02:52.389> rank<00:02:52.780> or<00:02:53.049> score<00:02:53.319> per<00:02:53.439> minute

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
you it's like a rank or score per minute

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.009 
you it's like a rank or score per minute
I'm<00:02:53.769> not<00:02:53.919> really<00:02:54.010> sure<00:02:54.569> but<00:02:55.569> essentially<00:02:55.810> if

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
I'm not really sure but essentially if

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.659 
I'm not really sure but essentially if
you're<00:02:56.139> really<00:02:56.379> good<00:02:56.650> at<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.829> game<00:02:56.859> or<00:02:57.250> decent
