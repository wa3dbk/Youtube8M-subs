00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.439
 I would like to introduce my own laser pointer from now on 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:16.469
 The appearance was made by remodeling Kurushima 100 average like this 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.469
 Shitenchi is 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.910
 It has become 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.910
 Loop contains three 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.340
 The front looks like this 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.340
 Different space is open for heat dissipation 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.920
 As we form a uniform constant current circuit 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.320
 Quite 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.320
 I have a stable pacio 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.420
 Then I think that I would like to introduce my own laser from now 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.940
 Unusual 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.940
 This is the side that is hit 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.120
 This time production is like this 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.710
 With laser pointer 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.710
 Like this at night 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.040
 I can see the line of light 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.030
 Then 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.030
 But was I think that I want to ignite the black match 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.390
 It can be easily ignited if the center is a black city like 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.840
 Match on 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.840
 I want to ignite the lens 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.880
 Oh 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.420
 This is so thin it cuts off unexpectedly 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.290
 Then we think that we want to go for short distance more 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.420
 It was followed 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.950
 I think that I want to use the balloon from now 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.970
 First of all ordinary balloons 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.110
 Since its magic as it can not be divided 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.980
 Put a black dot like this 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.980
 Make it easy to finish 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.819
 I think I want to end with a 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.060
 A N 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.850
 It breaks quite easily 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.670
 Then 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.670
 I think that I would like to work on a continual basis 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.310
 Follow 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.209
 Finally a little to understand the stomach just below 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.209
