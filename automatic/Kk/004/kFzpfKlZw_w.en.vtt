00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.830 
and so that's all we have here for you
today<00:07:28.070> just<00:07:28.760> a<00:07:28.850> brief<00:07:29.030> demonstration<00:07:29.240> of

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 
today just a brief demonstration of

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.390 
today just a brief demonstration of
various<00:07:30.260> codecs<00:07:30.650> playing<00:07:30.980> back<00:07:31.160> on<00:07:31.310> the

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 
various codecs playing back on the

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.450 
various codecs playing back on the
galaxy<00:07:31.790> s3<00:07:32.390> and<00:07:32.600> though<00:07:33.320> the<00:07:33.470> video<00:07:33.590> shows

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:34.460 
galaxy s3 and though the video shows

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.670 
galaxy s3 and though the video shows
several<00:07:34.790> failures<00:07:35.270> overall<00:07:36.170> it's<00:07:36.470> fair<00:07:36.650> to

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:36.680 
several failures overall it's fair to

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.740 
several failures overall it's fair to
say<00:07:36.800> that<00:07:36.950> the<00:07:37.190> galaxy<00:07:37.700> s3<00:07:37.970> results<00:07:38.540> are

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:38.750 
say that the galaxy s3 results are

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.050 
say that the galaxy s3 results are
excellent<00:07:39.020> and<00:07:39.620> unmatched<00:07:40.370> apart<00:07:40.940> from

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:41.060 
excellent and unmatched apart from

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.700 
excellent and unmatched apart from
perhaps<00:07:41.210> as<00:07:41.600> mentioned<00:07:42.050> previously<00:07:42.080> the

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:42.710 
perhaps as mentioned previously the

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.880 
perhaps as mentioned previously the
archos<00:07:43.130> genome<00:07:43.580> tap<00:07:43.850> and<00:07:44.410> if<00:07:45.410> you<00:07:45.500> keep<00:07:45.650> an<00:07:45.800> eye

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:45.890 
archos genome tap and if you keep an eye

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.980 
archos genome tap and if you keep an eye
peeled<00:07:45.950> at<00:07:46.310> the<00:07:46.400> blog<00:07:46.640> you'll<00:07:47.360> see<00:07:47.630> that<00:07:47.810> the

peeled at the blog you'll see that the

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.480 
peeled at the blog you'll see that the
second<00:07:48.290> part<00:07:48.470> of<00:07:48.560> our<00:07:48.680> galaxy<00:07:49.130> is<00:07:49.160> three

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:49.490 
second part of our galaxy is three

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.150 
second part of our galaxy is three
review<00:07:49.910> is<00:07:50.210> going<00:07:50.330> to<00:07:50.480> go<00:07:50.600> live<00:07:50.890> anytime<00:07:51.890> now
