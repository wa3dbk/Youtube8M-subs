kick okay i technique and basically as

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.690 
kick okay i technique and basically as

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
it's not really important that you

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.650 
it's not really important that you
actually<00:02:37.050> make<00:02:38.040> impact<00:02:38.610> with<00:02:39.180> your<00:02:39.390> attacker
