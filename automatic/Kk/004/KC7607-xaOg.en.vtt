now he'd do even better against
Mayweather<00:01:59.060> than<00:01:59.240> before<00:01:59.539> that's<00:01:59.689> my<00:01:59.899> own

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
Mayweather than before that's my own

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.440

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
opinion but what what is what does he do

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.380 
opinion but what what is what does he do
now<00:02:02.890> that<00:02:03.890> maybe<00:02:04.100> fans<00:02:04.490> don't<00:02:04.909> see<00:02:05.210> because
