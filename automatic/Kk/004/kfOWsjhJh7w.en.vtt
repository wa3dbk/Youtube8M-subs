ever been on the tennis court well I

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.640 
ever been on the tennis court well I
think<00:02:35.579> it's<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.480> key<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:37.170> feel<00:02:37.440> healthy

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
think it's the key that you feel healthy

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.610 
think it's the key that you feel healthy
you're<00:02:38.250> you're<00:02:39.030> solid<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:40.049> then<00:02:40.260> definitely

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
you're you're solid and then definitely

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.370 
you're you're solid and then definitely
to<00:02:41.100> me<00:02:41.280> it's<00:02:41.519> also<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:42.329> lot<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.870> times<00:02:43.139> is

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
to me it's also a lot of the times is

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.340 
to me it's also a lot of the times is
the<00:02:43.530> technique<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.459> to<00:02:45.329> the<00:02:45.480> playing<00:02:45.780> spend<00:02:46.319> a

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
the technique and to the playing spend a

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.039 
the technique and to the playing spend a
lot<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.530> hours<00:02:46.859> on<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.100> court<00:02:47.840> because<00:02:48.840> that's

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
lot of hours on the court because that's

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.990 
lot of hours on the court because that's
I<00:02:49.200> think<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.739> can<00:02:50.040> always<00:02:50.340> overcome<00:02:50.639> the
