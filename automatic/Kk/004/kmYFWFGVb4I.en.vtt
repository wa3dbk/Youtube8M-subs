on the same level as I am so sometimes
the<00:02:14.600> games<00:02:14.810> could<00:02:15.020> get<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.200> little<00:02:15.320> lopsided<00:02:15.530> or

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
the games could get a little lopsided or

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.580

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
you know if he's taking ridiculous shots

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.980

or<00:02:18.860> sometimes<00:02:19.520> if<00:02:20.300> I'm<00:02:20.510> playing<00:02:20.630> it's<00:02:20.870> like

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
or sometimes if I'm playing it's like

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.300 
or sometimes if I'm playing it's like
another<00:02:21.170> person<00:02:21.380> may<00:02:21.650> understand<00:02:22.070> it<00:02:22.190> they

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
another person may understand it they

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.120 
another person may understand it they
may<00:02:22.550> start<00:02:22.820> coming<00:02:23.090> up<00:02:23.120> with<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.300> strategy<00:02:24.130> so

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
may start coming up with a strategy so

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.740 
may start coming up with a strategy so
that's<00:02:25.370> when<00:02:25.610> sometimes<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.270> game<00:02:26.450> can<00:02:26.630> end

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
that's when sometimes the game can end

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.330 
that's when sometimes the game can end
up<00:02:26.810> being<00:02:27.020> close<00:02:27.230> but<00:02:27.380> it's<00:02:27.620> not<00:02:27.770> bad<00:02:28.040> then

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
up being close but it's not bad then

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.480 
up being close but it's not bad then
this<00:02:28.460> doesn't<00:02:28.850> really<00:02:28.970> exist<00:02:29.150> normal<00:02:30.490> the

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
this doesn't really exist normal the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.220 
this doesn't really exist normal the
offensive<00:02:32.090> rebound<00:02:32.150> sometimes<00:02:32.960> you'll

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
offensive rebound sometimes you'll

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.690 
offensive rebound sometimes you'll
notice<00:02:33.560> that<00:02:33.590> they<00:02:33.890> start<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.220> come<00:02:34.400> very

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
notice that they start to come very

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.070 
notice that they start to come very
often<00:02:35.060> inside<00:02:35.360> of<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.600> quarter<00:02:35.840> like<00:02:35.960> you'll

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
often inside of a quarter like you'll

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.720

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
one passed away not the guy in the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.250 
one passed away not the guy in the
middle<00:03:07.310> instead<00:03:07.730> of<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:07.970> zone<00:03:08.180> but<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.959> guy<00:03:09.200> who

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
is all the way across so then they make

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.990 
is all the way across so then they make
a<00:03:11.420> full<00:03:11.660> quarter<00:03:12.560> carmela<00:03:13.220> they<00:03:13.760> make<00:03:13.970> a

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
diagonal pass across the court and they

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.060 
diagonal pass across the court and they
get<00:03:17.239> an<00:03:17.330> easy<00:03:17.450> score<00:03:17.810> it's<00:03:18.530> ridiculous<00:03:19.010> and

player could not catch the ball and then
they<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:28.130> cute<00:03:28.670> passes<00:03:29.209> made<00:03:29.480> me<00:03:29.630> go<00:03:29.780> internal

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
they the cute passes made me go internal

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
they the cute passes made me go internal
would<00:03:30.530> but<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.739> know<00:03:30.769> that's<00:03:31.040> they<00:03:31.220> happen

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
and not a costly down by two he's

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.310 
and not a costly down by two he's
shooting<00:03:36.110> six<00:03:36.440> out<00:03:36.530> of<00:03:36.560> seven<00:03:36.800> know<00:03:37.250> what<00:03:37.400> else

another thing you'll notice is like I
just<00:03:40.550> had<00:03:40.700> this<00:03:40.940> is<00:03:41.060> it<00:03:41.150> like<00:03:41.269> what<00:03:41.420> just

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
just had this is it like what just

just had this is it like what just
happened<00:03:41.840> me<00:03:41.930> is<00:03:42.049> that<00:03:42.170> you'll<00:03:42.440> see<00:03:42.590> a<00:03:42.620> high

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
happened me is that you'll see a high

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.130 
happened me is that you'll see a high
turnover<00:03:42.970> ratio<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.299> a<00:03:44.390> weird<00:03:44.690> type<00:03:44.959> of

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
turnover ratio and a weird type of

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.100 
turnover ratio and a weird type of
turnover<00:03:45.880> or<00:03:46.880> a<00:03:46.940> bunch<00:03:47.330> of<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:47.570> turnover<00:03:47.989> is

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
turnover or a bunch of a turnover is

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.660 
turnover or a bunch of a turnover is
inside<00:03:48.350> a<00:03:48.380> short<00:03:48.680> period<00:03:48.860> of<00:03:48.980> time<00:03:49.040> like

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
inside a short period of time like

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.370 
inside a short period of time like
you'll<00:03:49.850> see<00:03:50.000> pass<00:03:50.239> is<00:03:50.450> flying<00:03:50.780> out<00:03:50.900> of<00:03:50.930> bounds

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
you'll see pass is flying out of bounds

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.229 
you'll see pass is flying out of bounds
like<00:03:51.709> I<00:03:51.920> could<00:03:52.190> be<00:03:52.400> using<00:03:52.549> Darren<00:03:52.970> winds<00:03:53.150> at

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
like I could be using Darren winds at

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.729 
like I could be using Darren winds at
the<00:03:53.330> three-point<00:03:53.690> line<00:03:53.810> go<00:03:54.200> into<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.530> guy<00:03:54.680> the

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
the three-point line go into the guy the

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.320 
the three-point line go into the guy the
top<00:03:55.040> of<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.250> key<00:03:55.400> and<00:03:55.459> he'll<00:03:55.640> miss<00:03:55.940> it<00:03:55.970> somehow

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
top of the key and he'll miss it somehow

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.390 
top of the key and he'll miss it somehow
or<00:03:56.720> those<00:03:57.230> who<00:03:57.350> got<00:03:57.530> three<00:03:57.830> point<00:03:58.070> line<00:03:58.190> by

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
or those who got three point line by

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.890 
or those who got three point line by
himself<00:03:58.790> and<00:03:58.970> it<00:03:59.060> will<00:03:59.150> just<00:03:59.269> fly<00:03:59.630> out<00:03:59.660> of

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
himself and it will just fly out of

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.270 
himself and it will just fly out of
bounds<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.320> then<00:04:00.440> Deron<00:04:00.799> Williams<00:04:00.920> does<00:04:01.160> have

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
bounds and then Deron Williams does have

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.660 
bounds and then Deron Williams does have
a<00:04:01.340> 95<00:04:01.880> pass<00:04:02.120> rating<00:04:03.040> sometimes<00:04:04.040> you'll<00:04:04.459> see

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
a 95 pass rating sometimes you'll see

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.340 
a 95 pass rating sometimes you'll see
players<00:04:05.000> they'll<00:04:05.450> quickly<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:06.049> don't<00:04:06.260> know

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
players they'll quickly I don't know

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.900 
players they'll quickly I don't know
where<00:04:06.530> they'll<00:04:06.650> just<00:04:06.799> cut<00:04:07.100> on<00:04:07.250> their<00:04:07.430> own<00:04:07.640> like

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
where they'll just cut on their own like

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.520 
where they'll just cut on their own like
you<00:04:08.000> did<00:04:08.120> a<00:04:08.150> lead<00:04:08.390> pass<00:04:08.630> and<00:04:08.989> they'll<00:04:09.500> just

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
you did a lead pass and they'll just

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.440 
you did a lead pass and they'll just
jump<00:04:10.070> behind<00:04:10.220> another<00:04:10.670> player<00:04:11.000> and<00:04:11.239> you'll

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
jump behind another player and you'll

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.090 
jump behind another player and you'll
get<00:04:11.570> an<00:04:11.690> instant<00:04:11.930> turn<00:04:12.080> over<00:04:12.410> that<00:04:12.920> you
