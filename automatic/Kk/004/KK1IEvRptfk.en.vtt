but at the brand new feature that
everybody's<00:00:29.580> talking<00:00:29.880> about<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.240> a

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
everybody's talking about is a

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.389 
everybody's talking about is a
thunderbolt<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.470> it's<00:00:31.650> actually<00:00:31.800> like<00:00:32.130> peak

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
thunderbolt so it's actually like peak

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.040 
thunderbolt so it's actually like peak
technology<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:33.270> Apple<00:00:33.719> called<00:00:33.960> it

technology but Apple called it

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.139 
technology but Apple called it
thunderbolt<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:35.579> can<00:00:35.730> kind<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:35.940> compare

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
thunderbolt and you can kind of compare

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.000 
thunderbolt and you can kind of compare
to<00:00:36.420> USB<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.410> pretty<00:00:37.559> much<00:00:37.649> connect

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
to USB you can pretty much connect

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.979 
to USB you can pretty much connect
devices<00:00:38.309> or<00:00:38.760> hard<00:00:39.030> drives<00:00:39.300> external<00:00:39.600> hard

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
devices or hard drives external hard

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.510 
devices or hard drives external hard
drives<00:00:40.170> whatever<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.829> want<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.070> can<00:00:41.219> connect

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
drives whatever you want you can connect

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.280 
drives whatever you want you can connect
it<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.090> as<00:00:42.180> really<00:00:42.690> really<00:00:42.989> fast

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
it to that and as really really fast

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.770 
it to that and as really really fast
transfer<00:00:44.070> speed<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.760> go<00:00:44.910> up<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.210> 10

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
transfer speed so you can go up to 10

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.450 
transfer speed so you can go up to 10
gigabit<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> second<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.980> already<00:00:47.219> has

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
gigabit a second so that I already has

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.610 
gigabit a second so that I already has
been<00:00:47.640> proven<00:00:48.000> be<00:00:48.690> sure<00:00:48.840> not<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.110> confuse<00:00:49.410> 10

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
been proven be sure not to confuse 10

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.740 
been proven be sure not to confuse 10
gigabit<00:00:50.010> with<00:00:50.160> 10<00:00:50.370> gigabytes<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.390> not<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
gigabit with 10 gigabytes it's not the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.020 
gigabit with 10 gigabytes it's not the
same<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.170> 10<00:00:52.710> gigabit<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.160> not<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.489> fast<00:00:53.730> as

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
same a 10 gigabit is not as fast as

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.450 
same a 10 gigabit is not as fast as
bites<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.410> know<00:00:55.530> some<00:00:56.039> people<00:00:56.340> get

your computer for example through
thunderbolt<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:12.210> going<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.510> be<00:01:12.600> way<00:01:13.290> way

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
thunderbolt is going to be way way

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.210 
thunderbolt is going to be way way
faster<00:01:13.860> than<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.610> simple<00:01:15.979> hard<00:01:16.979> drive<00:01:17.189> a

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
faster than just a simple hard drive a

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.960 
faster than just a simple hard drive a
few<00:01:17.820> via<00:01:18.810> USB<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.710> that's<00:01:20.159> great<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.820> that's

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
few via USB so that's great so that's

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.070 
few via USB so that's great so that's

course a big upgrade in the processor
the<00:01:26.130> 15<00:01:26.490> inch<00:01:26.700> imac<00:01:27.210> now<00:01:27.509> has<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:28.080> quad<00:01:28.619> core

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the 15 inch imac now has a quad core

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.969 
the 15 inch imac now has a quad core
asset<00:01:29.430> re<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.939> 15<00:01:30.360> inch<00:01:30.509> ND<00:01:30.840> 17-inch<00:01:31.530> has<00:01:31.710> its

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.350 
so a macbook pro is coming to quad core
that's<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.189> that's<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.700> pretty<00:01:39.000> big<00:01:39.150> upgrade

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
that's a that's a pretty big upgrade

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.530 
that's a that's a pretty big upgrade
right<00:01:39.689> there<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.500> 13-inch<00:01:40.920> although<00:01:41.540> stays

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
right there the 13-inch although stays

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.510 
right there the 13-inch although stays
with<00:01:42.930> well<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.470> doesn't<00:01:43.740> stay<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.159> gets

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
with well it doesn't stay it gets

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.780 
with well it doesn't stay it gets
upgraded<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.240> dual<00:01:45.840> core<00:01:46.170> intel<00:01:46.380> core<00:01:47.100> i7<00:01:47.250> as

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
upgraded to dual core intel core i7 as

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.109 
upgraded to dual core intel core i7 as
well<00:01:48.380> so<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.590> pretty<00:01:49.740> big<00:01:50.119> processor

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
well so it's a pretty big processor

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.840 
well so it's a pretty big processor
upgrade<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.780> definitely<00:01:52.409> notice<00:01:52.619> some<00:01:53.340> big

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
upgrade you definitely notice some big

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.840 
upgrade you definitely notice some big
improvements<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.930> speed<00:01:55.579> now<00:01:56.579> for<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
improvements in the speed now for the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.889 
improvements in the speed now for the
graphics<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.390> think<00:01:57.689> it's<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.140> ati<00:01:58.890> or<00:01:58.979> AMD<00:01:59.490> a

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
graphics I think it's the ati or AMD a

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.420 
graphics I think it's the ati or AMD a
while<00:02:00.899> adi<00:02:01.259> radian<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:03.290> 3,000<00:02:04.290> or<00:02:04.500> at<00:02:05.040> least<00:02:05.280> i

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
while adi radian as 3,000 or at least i

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.609 
while adi radian as 3,000 or at least i
ah<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.670> think<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.329> but<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.869> built-in

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
ah I think that is but it's a built-in

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.219 
ah I think that is but it's a built-in
graphics<00:02:08.520> card<00:02:09.149> chip<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.569> it's<00:02:09.780> built<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
graphics card chip so it's built in the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.410 
graphics card chip so it's built in the
CPU<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:10.979> won't<00:02:11.160> be<00:02:11.310> amazing<00:02:11.970> graphics

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
CPU so it won't be amazing graphics

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.910 
CPU so it won't be amazing graphics
they'll<00:02:13.110> be<00:02:13.290> good<00:02:13.500> they'll<00:02:13.709> be

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
they'll be good they'll be

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.620 
they'll be good they'll be
better<00:02:14.099> than<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.400> current<00:02:14.610> ones<00:02:14.849> but<00:02:15.420> it's

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
better than the current ones but it's

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.180 
better than the current ones but it's
not<00:02:15.810> going<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:15.990> be<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.110> huge<00:02:16.349> upgrade<00:02:16.620> it's<00:02:17.010> just

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
not going to be a huge upgrade it's just

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.580 
not going to be a huge upgrade it's just
a<00:02:17.280> built-in<00:02:17.640> chip<00:02:17.910> that's<00:02:18.690> built<00:02:18.959> in<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.200> CPU

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
a built-in chip that's built in the CPU

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.070 
a built-in chip that's built in the CPU
and<00:02:19.910> of<00:02:20.910> course<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.239> CPU<00:02:21.569> is<00:02:21.720> more<00:02:21.900> powerful

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
and of course the CPU is more powerful

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.170 
and of course the CPU is more powerful
so<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.650> will<00:02:22.890> get<00:02:23.069> pretty<00:02:23.340> good<00:02:23.489> graphics<00:02:23.970> but

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
so you will get pretty good graphics but

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.930 
so you will get pretty good graphics but
it's<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.290> really<00:02:25.590> good<00:02:25.830> for<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.069> notebook<00:02:26.459> or<00:02:26.819> at

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
it's a really good for a notebook or at

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.330 
it's a really good for a notebook or at
least<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.270> laptop<00:02:28.080> computer<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.709> really<00:02:29.220> good

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
least a laptop computer a really good

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.340 
least a laptop computer a really good
graphics<00:02:29.700> for<00:02:29.819> that<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.600> last<00:02:30.780> feature<00:02:31.050> they

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
graphics for that the last feature they

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.449 
graphics for that the last feature they
talked<00:02:31.590> about<00:02:31.800> on<00:02:31.920> their<00:02:32.010> website<00:02:32.340> is

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
talked about on their website is

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.790 
talked about on their website is
FaceTime<00:02:32.910> goes<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.360> HD<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.230> of<00:02:34.380> course<00:02:34.530> that

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
FaceTime goes to HD so of course that

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.470 
FaceTime goes to HD so of course that
means<00:02:34.920> not<00:02:35.160> only<00:02:35.220> FaceTime<00:02:35.819> goes<00:02:36.000> entry<00:02:36.300> but

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
means not only FaceTime goes entry but

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.080 
means not only FaceTime goes entry but
the<00:02:36.870> eyesight<00:02:37.319> in<00:02:37.500> general<00:02:37.950> will<00:02:38.130> be<00:02:38.310> in<00:02:38.819> high

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
the eyesight in general will be in high

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.199 
the eyesight in general will be in high
definition<00:02:39.330> 720p<00:02:40.290> quality<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.850> course<00:02:42.090> it

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
definition 720p quality of course it

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.720 
definition 720p quality of course it
will<00:02:42.269> be<00:02:42.420> wide<00:02:42.780> screen<00:02:43.190> and<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:44.370> that's<00:02:44.550> great

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
will be wide screen and so that's great

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.199 
will be wide screen and so that's great
a<00:02:45.030> wide<00:02:45.510> screen<00:02:45.750> camera<00:02:46.140> HD<00:02:46.800> camera<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.940> lot

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
a wide screen camera HD camera and a lot

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.699 
a wide screen camera HD camera and a lot
of<00:02:48.239> people<00:02:48.330> already<00:02:48.750> have<00:02:48.930> requested<00:02:49.500> that

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
of people already have requested that

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.979 
of people already have requested that
feature<00:02:49.739> a<00:02:50.160> long<00:02:50.850> time<00:02:51.120> ago<00:02:51.269> already<00:02:51.480> so

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
feature a long time ago already so

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.559 
feature a long time ago already so
that's<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.260> good<00:02:52.410> thing<00:02:52.590> I'll<00:02:53.340> be<00:02:53.790> getting<00:02:53.970> well

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
that's a good thing I'll be getting well

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.059 
that's a good thing I'll be getting well
I<00:02:54.600> won't<00:02:54.900> be<00:02:55.049> getting<00:02:55.200> myself<00:02:55.470> from<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.920> new

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
I won't be getting myself from the new

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.220 
I won't be getting myself from the new
macbook<00:02:56.280> pros<00:02:56.670> but<00:02:56.880> I<00:02:57.150> beginning<00:02:57.750> an<00:02:57.870> imac

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
macbook pros but I beginning an imac

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.289 
macbook pros but I beginning an imac
soon<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.709> hopefully<00:02:59.160> that<00:02:59.580> will<00:02:59.730> also<00:03:00.090> have

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
soon and hopefully that will also have

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.300 
soon and hopefully that will also have
the<00:03:00.540> new<00:03:00.870> FaceTime<00:03:01.530> worm<00:03:01.739> at<00:03:01.950> least<00:03:02.160> I'm

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
the new FaceTime worm at least I'm

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.759 
the new FaceTime worm at least I'm
pretty<00:03:02.580> sure<00:03:02.730> about<00:03:02.850> it<00:03:03.110> other<00:03:04.110> than<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
pretty sure about it other than that the

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.440 
pretty sure about it other than that the
design<00:03:05.100> didn't<00:03:05.400> change<00:03:05.640> or<00:03:05.790> anything<00:03:06.090> the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
design didn't change or anything the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.670 
design didn't change or anything the
only<00:03:06.630> thing<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.900> changed<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.319> actual

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
only thing that changed the actual

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.440 
only thing that changed the actual
design<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:07.980> course<00:03:08.340> is<00:03:08.519> they've<00:03:08.970> added<00:03:09.360> the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
design of course is they've added the

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.270 
design of course is they've added the
port<00:03:09.720> for<00:03:09.959> Thunderbolts<00:03:10.500> fortunately<00:03:11.250> only

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
port for Thunderbolts fortunately only

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.220 
port for Thunderbolts fortunately only
get<00:03:11.610> one<00:03:11.790> port<00:03:12.090> but<00:03:12.299> you<00:03:12.480> won't<00:03:12.660> need<00:03:12.780> dozens

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
get one port but you won't need dozens

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.520 
get one port but you won't need dozens
of<00:03:13.500> Thunderbolt<00:03:14.310> port<00:03:14.640> ports<00:03:15.380> for<00:03:16.380> now

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
of Thunderbolt port ports for now

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.140 
of Thunderbolt port ports for now
because<00:03:16.799> there's<00:03:17.160> not<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.340> much<00:03:17.640> devices

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
because there's not that much devices

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.180 
because there's not that much devices
that<00:03:18.299> that<00:03:19.109> are<00:03:19.260> compatible<00:03:19.560> with<00:03:19.829> it<00:03:20.010> yet

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
that that are compatible with it yet

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.860 
that that are compatible with it yet
although<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.820> will<00:03:20.910> definitely<00:03:21.480> come<00:03:21.690> now

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
although that will definitely come now
