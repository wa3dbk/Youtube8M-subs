be pal and then the alert sound I turned

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.490 
be pal and then the alert sound I turned
it<00:02:46.150> off<00:02:48.569> because<00:02:49.569> it's<00:02:49.870> just<00:02:49.989> really<00:02:50.260> annoying

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
it off because it's just really annoying

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.720 
it off because it's just really annoying
so<00:02:51.370> turn<00:02:51.849> that<00:02:51.970> off<00:02:52.980> web<00:02:53.980> camera<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.430> can<00:02:54.579> turn

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
so turn that off web camera you can turn

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.050 
so turn that off web camera you can turn
on<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:54.970> use<00:02:55.209> as<00:02:55.329> a<00:02:55.360> Skype<00:02:55.739> which<00:02:56.739> is<00:02:56.860> cool<00:02:57.099> and

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
on to use as a Skype which is cool and

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.180 
on to use as a Skype which is cool and
then<00:02:58.720> language<00:02:59.170> just<00:02:59.470> supports<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.859> standard

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
then language just supports the standard

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.300 
then language just supports the standard
three<00:03:00.400> languages<00:03:00.850> so<00:03:01.209> that's<00:03:01.389> nice

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
three languages so that's nice

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.150 
three languages so that's nice
so<00:03:03.310> that's<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.549> camera<00:03:03.819> at<00:03:03.940> a<00:03:03.970> glance<00:03:05.160> it

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
so that's the camera at a glance it

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.319 
so that's the camera at a glance it
comes<00:03:06.370> in<00:03:08.069> several<00:03:09.069> colors<00:03:09.250> I<00:03:09.549> of<00:03:09.970> course<00:03:10.150> like
