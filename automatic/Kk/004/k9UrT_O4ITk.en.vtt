00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:08.220
 Hello everyone today, I'll show you how you can 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:11.099
 make a long story a ball of paper it can 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.799
 be a decoration on the Christmas tree and 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.539
 type less diameter do or just 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:22.320
 decorate house house class at school for example 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:28.970
 where is this ball I made of leaves 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:32.669
 from different magazines I will show the white ball 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.739
 from the usual copier on and paper what for 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.390
 it is necessary 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:41.300
 we will need to do 10 of these 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.450
 circles with needles 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:50.449
 I have already prepared in advance and now I will show 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:55.829
 how to make them take paper sheet 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:59.390
 we turn off the corner of a triangle 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:11.490
 in order to get a square then 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:18.229
 we cut off the excess part 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:21.920
 such a square and so we fold once 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.920
 triangle second time 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:33.810
 and the third time now we make cuts with 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:49.570
 each side to the center 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:59.560
 Not a little bit do not cut to the center with this 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:02:02.760
 the sides are like this 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.980
 turned out our square and such 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:09.280
 triangles on it cuts 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:16.740
 we will continue to fold each one 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.740
 triangle of kulechek in this way 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:25.290
 we pull up a little bit 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.440
 Spicy tip our needles and be 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.330
 wrap this up with torus 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:36.070
 we fix as if there is no need for glue 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:40.380
 we keep everything next to her seeds 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:44.760
 in the same way we turn hens 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:49.750
 We pull up to needle vostrikova 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:52.530
 here is the second tick it happened every 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.530
 triangle 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.390
 welding 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:30.060
 for your tip to turn out or 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:30.060
 wrapping you take off your granddaughters 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.640
 after 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:58.650
 we turn here 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:04:01.560
 circle with needles I already said 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.650
 make 10 pieces of these I have already prepared 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:09.060
 in advance 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:13.220
 then take a needle with a string of ordinary 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.220
 ordinary school eraser cut off 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:21.470
 a piece you need two such pieces 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:33.150
 we pierce a needle with a thread on a string 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:37.970
 we have a bundle done that is not going anywhere 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:42.449
 run away our piece of plastic and string 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:47.430
 our circles will be strung vodka 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:55.940
 needles here this side of 5 pieces so 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:05:00.979
 one needles try to get 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.979
 between those needles of the previous circle 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:32.490
 from one side beyond the next 5 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.850
 the downside is inside 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.850
 Now 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:17.630
 take again a piece of mastic which we 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:29.490
 cut off with a hand. 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:34.560
 we touch the ball right here 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:37.940
 it turns out this way without glue 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:40.940
 just wetting the desired race label 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:47.160
 scissors and paper 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:50.880
 just do everything too, I'll be happy 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:54.080
 the idea was liked by someone everybody thanks for 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.080
 attention yet
