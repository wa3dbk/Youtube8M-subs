occur and this yellow line right here is

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.840 
occur and this yellow line right here is
where<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:10.439> think<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> freezing<00:01:11.250> line<00:01:11.430> will

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
where we think the freezing line will

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.539 
where we think the freezing line will
occur<00:01:12.180> with<00:01:12.600> time<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.860> freezing<00:01:14.280> link<00:01:14.430> will

occur with time this freezing link will

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.969 
occur with time this freezing link will
be<00:01:14.670> very<00:01:15.150> very<00:01:15.380> important<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.500> evening<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
be very very important this evening and

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.859 
be very very important this evening and
overnight<00:01:17.220> which<00:01:18.030> will<00:01:18.210> dictate<00:01:18.450> where

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
overnight which will dictate where

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.050 
overnight which will dictate where
freezing<00:01:19.439> rain<00:01:19.740> occurs<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.490> where<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
freezing rain occurs and where the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.170 
freezing rain occurs and where the
liquid<00:01:21.299> rain<00:01:21.630> occurs<00:01:21.930> west<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:22.979> line

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
liquid rain occurs west of this line

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.570 
liquid rain occurs west of this line
rain<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.420> expected<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> east<00:01:25.979> we

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
rain is expected but to the east we

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.890 
rain is expected but to the east we
think<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.909> freezing<00:01:27.299> rain<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> ice

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
think the freezing rain and the ice

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.429 
think the freezing rain and the ice
accumulations<00:01:28.740> will<00:01:28.979> occur<00:01:29.549> okay<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.509> by<00:01:30.869> 7

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
accumulations will occur okay so by 7

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
p.m. this evening we will start to see

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.569 
p.m. this evening we will start to see
precipitation<00:01:34.079> increase<00:01:34.979> from<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.340> south

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
precipitation increase from the south

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.310 
precipitation increase from the south
meanwhile<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.210> freezing<00:01:36.689> line<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.930> expected

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
meanwhile the freezing line is expected

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.069 
meanwhile the freezing line is expected
to<00:01:37.470> line<00:01:37.710> up<00:01:37.890> roughly<00:01:38.250> along<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:39.479> Stockton

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
to line up roughly along the Stockton

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.289 
to line up roughly along the Stockton
Lake<00:01:40.290> area<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.040> down<00:01:41.369> towards<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.880> western

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
Lake area and down towards the western

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.990 
Lake area and down towards the western

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
part of Table Rock Lake as we progress

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.730 
part of Table Rock Lake as we progress
through<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.659> evening<00:01:45.840> hours<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.320> think<00:01:46.649> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
through the evening hours we think the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.100 
through the evening hours we think the
snowpack<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.430> Springfield<00:01:48.000> will<00:01:48.659> help<00:01:48.899> keep

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
snowpack in Springfield will help keep

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.649 
snowpack in Springfield will help keep
temperatures<00:01:49.439> below<00:01:49.829> freezing<00:01:50.280> therefore<00:01:51.030> we

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
temperatures below freezing therefore we

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.230 
temperatures below freezing therefore we
