00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
just select the eye cover the i.v is

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.420 
just select the eye cover the i.v is
retina<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.540> don't<00:01:18.780> know<00:01:18.840> or<00:01:19.159> that's<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> right

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
retina I don't know or that's the right

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.890 
retina I don't know or that's the right
word<00:01:20.640> yeah<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.299> right<00:01:21.479> now<00:01:21.689> right<00:01:21.869> here

and<00:01:22.380> now<00:01:22.520> once<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.610> thing<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.030> selected<00:01:24.450> I

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
and now once that thing is selected I

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.950 
and now once that thing is selected I
will<00:01:25.409> uncheck<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.890> one<00:01:26.130> now<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.880> eye<00:01:27.060> that

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
will uncheck this one now the eye that

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.520 
will uncheck this one now the eye that
not<00:01:28.229> selected<00:01:28.710> now<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.159> will<00:01:29.820> go<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.530> Select

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
not selected now I will go to the Select

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.280 
not selected now I will go to the Select
menu<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.979> inverse<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.610> selection<00:01:32.990> or<00:01:33.990> gather

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
menu and inverse the selection or gather

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.830 
menu and inverse the selection or gather
wise<00:01:34.530> what<00:01:35.369> I'm<00:01:35.670> going<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.939> do<00:01:36.180> now<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.390> we

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
wise what I'm going to do now is we

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.870 
wise what I'm going to do now is we
don't<00:01:36.960> want<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.259> change<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> color<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.820> is

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
don't want to change the color that is

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.510 
don't want to change the color that is
outside<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.990> selection<00:01:40.740> we<00:01:40.890> only<00:01:41.130> want<00:01:41.400> to

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
outside the selection we only want to

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.850 
outside the selection we only want to
select<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.150> area<00:01:42.780> which<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.200> inside<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
select the area which is inside the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.670 
select the area which is inside the
fraction<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.430> that's<00:01:44.640> why<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.210> chose<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
fraction so that's why I chose the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.910 
fraction so that's why I chose the
correct<00:01:47.310> inverse<00:01:48.290> ok<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.619> will<00:01:49.710> come<00:01:49.860> to

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
correct inverse ok and you will come to

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.620 
correct inverse ok and you will come to
know<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.250> moment<00:01:50.369> why<00:01:50.670> exactly<00:01:51.000> i<00:01:51.210> did<00:01:51.450> that

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
know in a moment why exactly i did that

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.899 
know in a moment why exactly i did that
so<00:01:52.229> once<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.530> thing<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.950> done<00:01:53.130> i<00:01:53.310> would<00:01:53.729> go<00:01:53.850> to

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
so once that thing is done i would go to

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.730 
so once that thing is done i would go to
the<00:01:54.119> image<00:01:56.329> adjustment<00:01:57.329> I've<00:01:57.869> got<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.500> color

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
the image adjustment I've got the color

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.270 
the image adjustment I've got the color
balance<00:01:59.219> ok<00:02:00.210> now<00:02:01.200> i<00:02:01.229> will<00:02:01.649> just<00:02:01.860> play<00:02:02.189> around

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
balance ok now i will just play around

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.999 
balance ok now i will just play around
with<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.640> as<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.210> can<00:02:03.450> see<00:02:03.659> i<00:02:03.869> am<00:02:04.049> moving<00:02:04.590> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
with it as you can see i am moving the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:12.199 
with it as you can see i am moving the
bar<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.420> eye<00:02:06.450> color<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:06.990> changing<00:02:08.149> ok<00:02:09.470> so<00:02:11.209> we

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
bar the eye color is changing ok so we

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.400 
bar the eye color is changing ok so we
can<00:02:12.390> i<00:02:12.420> think<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.110> is
