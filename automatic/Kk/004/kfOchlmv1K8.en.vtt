welcome to the fifth and final part of

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.320 
welcome to the fifth and final part of
my<00:00:06.870> lefty<00:00:07.440> guitar<00:00:07.830> conversion<00:00:08.429> it's<00:00:09.030> now<00:00:09.240> time

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
my lefty guitar conversion it's now time

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.509 
my lefty guitar conversion it's now time
to<00:00:09.510> get<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.900> things<00:00:10.110> set<00:00:10.410> up<00:00:10.440> so<00:00:11.040> we<00:00:11.160> can<00:00:11.309> play

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
to get the things set up so we can play

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.120 
to get the things set up so we can play
it<00:00:11.700> first<00:00:12.599> thing<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.780> need<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:12.960> do<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.440> roughly

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
it first thing I need to do is roughly

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.670 
it first thing I need to do is roughly
set<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.610> intonation<00:00:15.059> I've<00:00:15.960> got<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.350> strings

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
set the intonation I've got the strings

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.070 
set the intonation I've got the strings
on<00:00:16.920> here<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.369> they're<00:00:18.060> really<00:00:18.359> really<00:00:18.750> loose

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
on here and they're really really loose

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.380 
on here and they're really really loose
right<00:00:19.320> now<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:20.430> can<00:00:20.550> see<00:00:20.730> how<00:00:20.880> they're<00:00:21.090> at<00:00:21.270> an

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
right now you can see how they're at an

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.720 
right now you can see how they're at an
angle<00:00:21.920> which<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:22.949> correct<00:00:23.460> for<00:00:23.670> a

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
angle which is correct for a

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.820 
angle which is correct for a
right-handed<00:00:24.330> guitar<00:00:24.689> but<00:00:25.289> for<00:00:25.439> left-handed

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
right-handed guitar but for left-handed

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.759 
right-handed guitar but for left-handed
guitar<00:00:26.099> need<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.400> reverse<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.439> need<00:00:28.560> to

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
guitar need to reverse this so I need to

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.560 
guitar need to reverse this so I need to
bring<00:00:28.980> they<00:00:29.550> should<00:00:29.730> be<00:00:29.820> going<00:00:30.000> at<00:00:30.210> an<00:00:30.480> angle

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
bring they should be going at an angle

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.770 
bring they should be going at an angle
like<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:34.250> I'm<00:00:35.250> just<00:00:35.489> gonna<00:00:35.610> roughly<00:00:36.239> adjust

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
like this I'm just gonna roughly adjust

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.889 
like this I'm just gonna roughly adjust
these<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.380> where<00:00:38.100> they're<00:00:38.660> going<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.750> right

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
these to where they're going the right

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.880 
these to where they're going the right
direction<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:41.780> have<00:00:42.780> no<00:00:43.020> idea<00:00:43.260> how<00:00:43.410> close<00:00:43.710> this

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
direction I have no idea how close this

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.910 
direction I have no idea how close this
is<00:00:44.040> gonna<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:45.170> it's<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.410> gonna<00:00:46.530> give<00:00:46.770> me<00:00:46.890> a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
is gonna be it's just gonna give me a

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.430 
is gonna be it's just gonna give me a
starting<00:00:47.370> point<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.300> know<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.750> somewhere

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
starting point that I know is somewhere

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.069 
starting point that I know is somewhere
in<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.430> neighborhood<00:00:51.530> something<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.680> that

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
in the neighborhood something like that

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:03.250 
in the neighborhood something like that
now<00:00:55.079> tune<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.500> up<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.620> pitch

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.219 

so<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.040> next<00:01:04.280> step<00:01:04.580> of<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:04.879> setup<00:01:05.269> is<00:01:06.020> going

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
so the next step of the setup is going

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.700 
so the next step of the setup is going
to<00:01:06.320> be<00:01:06.440> to<00:01:06.590> adjust<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:07.100> truss<00:01:07.340> rod<00:01:08.530> I'm<00:01:09.530> going

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
to be to adjust the truss rod I'm going

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.649 
to be to adjust the truss rod I'm going
to<00:01:09.770> put<00:01:09.920> a<00:01:09.950> capo<00:01:10.400> at<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.670> first<00:01:10.970> fret<00:01:13.000> and<00:01:14.000> then

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
to put a capo at the first fret and then

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.680 
to put a capo at the first fret and then
I'm<00:01:14.750> going<00:01:14.900> to<00:01:15.369> press<00:01:16.369> down<00:01:16.400> at<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:16.940> 13th<00:01:17.420> fret

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
I'm going to press down at the 13th fret

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.650 
I'm going to press down at the 13th fret
and<00:01:18.200> we're<00:01:18.560> gonna<00:01:18.680> measure<00:01:19.010> the<00:01:19.910> spacing<00:01:20.509> at

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
and we're gonna measure the spacing at

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.109 
and we're gonna measure the spacing at
the<00:01:21.050> eighth<00:01:21.229> fret

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.069 

and<00:01:27.509> already<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.289> don't<00:01:29.039> have<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.250> measure<00:01:29.460> it

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
and already I don't have to measure it

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.169 
and already I don't have to measure it
the<00:01:31.079> strings<00:01:31.409> are<00:01:31.590> touching<00:01:31.859> the<00:01:32.159> frets<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.030> we

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
the strings are touching the frets so we

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.050 
the strings are touching the frets so we
need<00:01:33.359> to<00:01:33.570> adjust<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.289> a<00:01:34.409> little<00:01:34.649> bit<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.100> I'm

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
need to adjust that a little bit so I'm

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.389 
need to adjust that a little bit so I'm
loosening<00:01:36.539> the<00:01:36.780> truss<00:01:37.020> rod<00:01:37.140> which<00:01:37.829> will<00:01:38.039> make

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
loosening the truss rod which will make

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:49.849 
loosening the truss rod which will make
the<00:01:38.609> neck<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.179> little<00:01:39.780> bit<00:01:40.020> more<00:01:40.259> concave<00:01:48.859> you

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
the neck a little bit more concave you

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:54.069 
the neck a little bit more concave you
want<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.069> just<00:01:50.159> go<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> little<00:01:50.549> bit<00:01:50.759> at<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.939> time<00:01:50.969> I

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.209 

always<00:01:55.079> try<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.229> check<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> playing

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
always try to check it in the playing

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.429 
always try to check it in the playing
position<00:01:56.520> rather<00:01:57.420> than<00:01:57.630> laying<00:01:57.780> flat<00:01:58.109> on<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
position rather than laying flat on the

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.870 
position rather than laying flat on the
bench<00:01:58.619> I<00:02:01.939> wanted<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.000> go<00:02:03.060> with<00:02:03.209> that<00:02:03.329> for<00:02:03.509> now

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
bench I wanted to go with that for now

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.250 
bench I wanted to go with that for now
well<00:02:05.880> retune<00:02:06.239> it

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.400 

the<00:02:11.890> next<00:02:12.129> thing<00:02:12.310> I<00:02:12.370> want<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.640> set<00:02:12.910> is<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
the next thing I want to set is the

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.960 
the next thing I want to set is the
action<00:02:14.950> which<00:02:15.129> is<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.310> height<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.849> the

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
action which is the height of the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.759 
action which is the height of the
strings<00:02:16.269> at<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.540> bridge<00:02:17.160> at<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.310> 17th<00:02:18.910> fret

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
strings at the bridge at the 17th fret

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.910 
strings at the bridge at the 17th fret
you<00:02:20.769> want<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:21.040> have<00:02:21.690> 460<00:02:22.690> fourths<00:02:23.110> I<00:02:23.260> don't

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
you want to have 460 fourths I don't

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.650 
you want to have 460 fourths I don't
know<00:02:24.010> why<00:02:24.129> they<00:02:24.280> call<00:02:24.459> it<00:02:24.489> four<00:02:24.819> sixty<00:02:25.269> fourths

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
know why they call it four sixty fourths

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.440 
know why they call it four sixty fourths
and<00:02:25.950> weird

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.220 

bring<00:02:30.290> in<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.500> height<00:02:30.680> of<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:30.920> strings<00:02:31.220> down

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
bring in the height of the strings down

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.229 
bring in the height of the strings down
with<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.349> allen<00:02:33.530> screws<00:02:34.040> on<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.940> string

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
with the allen screws on the string

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:42.490 
with the allen screws on the string
saddles<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:40.730> this<00:02:40.910> is<00:02:41.090> also<00:02:41.270> just<00:02:41.599> a<00:02:41.840> rough

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
saddles and this is also just a rough

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.600 
saddles and this is also just a rough
adjustment<00:02:42.650> I'll<00:02:43.130> probably<00:02:43.340> have<00:02:43.580> to

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
adjustment I'll probably have to

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.570 
adjustment I'll probably have to
readjust<00:02:44.060> this<00:02:44.480> once<00:02:44.780> I<00:02:44.930> start<00:02:45.260> playing<00:02:45.500> it

playing<00:02:56.420> style<00:02:57.040> now<00:02:58.040> I'm<00:02:58.100> noticing<00:02:58.280> as<00:02:58.640> I'm

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
playing style now I'm noticing as I'm

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.979 
playing style now I'm noticing as I'm
adjusting<00:02:59.030> this<00:02:59.300> that<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.599> bridge<00:02:59.840> is

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
adjusting this that the bridge is

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.290 
adjusting this that the bridge is
lifting<00:03:00.410> I<00:03:00.590> don't<00:03:01.489> want<00:03:01.670> that<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.940> happen<00:03:01.970> so

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
lifting I don't want that to happen so

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.870 
lifting I don't want that to happen so
I'm<00:03:05.300> gonna<00:03:05.420> flip<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.780> guitar<00:03:06.080> over<00:03:06.110> and<00:03:06.880> bring

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
I'm gonna flip the guitar over and bring

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.970 
I'm gonna flip the guitar over and bring
these<00:03:08.090> screws<00:03:08.450> in<00:03:08.630> so<00:03:11.380> I'll<00:03:12.380> probably<00:03:12.590> end<00:03:12.860> up

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
these screws in so I'll probably end up

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.460 
these screws in so I'll probably end up
adding<00:03:13.340> more<00:03:13.519> Springs<00:03:13.940> because<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:15.049> don't<00:03:15.260> want

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
adding more Springs because I don't want

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.809 
adding more Springs because I don't want
this<00:03:15.650> bridge<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:16.160> float<00:03:16.900> then<00:03:17.900> we'll<00:03:18.049> retune

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
this bridge to float then we'll retune

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.309 
this bridge to float then we'll retune
always<00:03:19.819> retune<00:03:20.269> every<00:03:20.870> time<00:03:21.019> you<00:03:21.110> make<00:03:21.290> a

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
always retune every time you make a

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.220 
always retune every time you make a
little<00:03:21.590> adjustment<00:03:21.950> you<00:03:22.130> got<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.370> retune<00:03:22.670> the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
little adjustment you got to retune the

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.539 
little adjustment you got to retune the
last<00:03:24.230> step<00:03:24.470> is<00:03:24.620> going<00:03:24.709> to<00:03:24.799> be<00:03:24.890> to<00:03:24.980> fine-tune

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
last step is going to be to fine-tune

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.570 
last step is going to be to fine-tune
the<00:03:25.730> intonation<00:03:26.830> and<00:03:27.830> we'll<00:03:28.010> do<00:03:28.130> that<00:03:28.280> by

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
the intonation and we'll do that by

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.130 
the intonation and we'll do that by
tuning<00:03:28.940> it<00:03:29.030> up<00:03:29.090> to<00:03:29.269> pitch<00:03:29.480> perfect

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.400 

don't<00:03:34.140> skimp<00:03:34.560> on<00:03:34.740> your<00:03:34.800> tuning

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.530 

and<00:03:39.410> then<00:03:39.650> play<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.010> twelfth<00:03:40.340> fret<00:03:40.460> and<00:03:41.000> you

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
and then play the twelfth fret and you

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:54.229 
and then play the twelfth fret and you
should<00:03:41.750> be<00:03:41.900> exactly<00:03:42.530> at<00:03:42.800> the<00:03:42.920> same<00:03:43.130> tune

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.559 

just<00:03:55.239> a<00:03:55.330> little<00:03:55.510> bit<00:03:55.720> sharp<00:03:57.299> so<00:03:58.299> you<00:03:58.390> need<00:03:58.510> to

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
just a little bit sharp so you need to

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:08.180 
just a little bit sharp so you need to
lengthen

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.320 

in<00:04:09.190> retune<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:12.160> whole<00:04:12.310> setup<00:04:12.700> process<00:04:12.940> is<00:04:13.150> a

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
in retune the whole setup process is a

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.090 
in retune the whole setup process is a

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.710 

now<00:04:30.110> I'll<00:04:30.230> just<00:04:30.440> adjust<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.980> pickup<00:04:31.370> height

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
now I'll just adjust the pickup height

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.920 
now I'll just adjust the pickup height
this<00:04:32.720> is<00:04:32.900> another<00:04:33.139> adjustment<00:04:33.830> that<00:04:33.950> I'll

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
this is another adjustment that I'll

this is another adjustment that I'll
adjust<00:04:35.930> a<00:04:36.230> little<00:04:36.470> bit<00:04:36.620> once<00:04:36.889> I<00:04:37.040> start<00:04:37.310> playing

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
adjust a little bit once I start playing
