00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.300
 and greet everyone knows this is 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.149
 like the death we find ourselves 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.769
 today for a video on minecraft 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:32.009
 today a little tutorial on how 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.009
 make 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.420
 a flaming arrows launcher 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.890
 automatic 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.589
 so let's start all of 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.269
 first you will do this 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.899
 trick there 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:49.440
 so these compounds of 2 3 4 5 2 lengths 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.839
 so two like that there of two there in 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.729
 width of 3 you also do three 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.100
 lobes I did that but it was for 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:59.430
 personal use 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.469
 there you do in the middle so something 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.600
 which goes up by 2 after that makes the whole 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.370
 length and that goes down from 2 and there 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.110
 you do 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.770
 in the middle a hole of 3 like that so I 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.650
 explains you 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.800
 so we're going to put the pitchers 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.800
 arrows and there we will put some lava 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.800
 for 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:30.100
 here 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:35.400
 when you go see why so we 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:39.050
 will already do that you put the lava them 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.050
 you redo between protection 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.009
 hop 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.670
 there we will put repeaters 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.740
 here like that must be the same 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:56.140
 so there at the same normal thing after you 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.850

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.240
 a bit nawak 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:26.860
 in the first one up we believe it all 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:29.410
