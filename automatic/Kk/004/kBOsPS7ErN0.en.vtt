 hello how about youtube friends today 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.040
 I will teach how to install the rom more 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.930
 stable that found for this 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.990
 device that is the samsung galaxy fit 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.510
 for me it is one of the most stable as 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.450
 wrinkle that comes within the 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.810
 that comes in this device is 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.090
 too stable I love it good 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.940
 we proceed to the installation below in the 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.140
 description of the video I will leave the link 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.510
 from the rom 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.070
 well let's get into record mode and pressing 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.070
 the middle button and on 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.369
 let's hope 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.630
 and ready once there we will go to güipe 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.630
 cache recipe 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.909
 now a partition cache 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:33.130
 and now install from without that of 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.130
 we go right there to the first option 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.770
 we will point out the rumba 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:44.759
 It fits to say that this rom very good 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.759
 very stable 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.810
 does not have any problem is very very 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.790
 cool wait for the installation of the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.060
 branch 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:02.220
 this is not the requirements are to have the 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:07.140
 clockwork mode 5.0 within a time 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:11.040
 I will have the clockwork mod 6.0 for the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.940
 installation of the kid cat 4.2 points 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.240
 4.4 points 2 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.730
 and ready 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.870
 we are going 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.680
 this country 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.680
 to reset 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.310
 güipe cache partition 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.200
 rebot systems 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.610
 and let's hope that 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.680
 start the rice calm 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.870
 in this screen of android stays 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.200
 about 5 seconds 10 8 out there 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:52.280
 it is not a sign of alarm 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.000
 and soon the rom will start 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.000
 has a 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.790
 a very good ability this rom that 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:06.270
 everything works all all video camera 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.210
 applications of everything 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:13.230
 well I invite you while they ripped 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.750
 I invite you to like the video 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.610
 comment any doubt and subscribe 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.970
 to the good channel, look, it's already starting 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.970
 the rom 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.140
 Let's wait a little 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:33.819
 but that it is starting the rumba is 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.819
 that lowers the brightness and vibrates the cell phone 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.060
 so you know 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.629
 well let's wait 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.210
 this is a simple installation and very 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.210
 fast 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.610
 we will see a little 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.030
 at once in the video I will show you that 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.030
 it's a good one 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.910
 I'll take a small sample of how 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.920
 works 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.770
 so you can see and see 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.920
 as they say 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:37.690
 and here already vibrated look how it goes 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.690
 putting is a little bit slower 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.940
 that sign that a ready start is already 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:47.479
 time here on this screen the most 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:51.220
 It is advisable to leave here this option 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.220
 that says language 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.310
 and we will select our language 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.930
 here 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.279
 I will give in jumping 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:15.059
 for not here, deactivate that 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:17.300
 because that will activate the gps and ready 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:17.300
 look 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:25.590
 look here is the camera 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.590
 I will show that it is not a lie 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.380
 the video 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.540
 ready look that's no lie me 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.940
 good 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.099
 the version 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:00.670
 I will show it 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.670
 of 3.7 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.900

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.210

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.000
