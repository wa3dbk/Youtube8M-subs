00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
the air strike will not actually happen

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.360 
the air strike will not actually happen
you'll<00:02:15.110> see<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.379> plane<00:02:15.590> but<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:16.040> will<00:02:16.190> not

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
you'll see the plane but it will not

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.190 
you'll see the plane but it will not
actually<00:02:16.550> learn<00:02:17.360> for<00:02:17.659> that<00:02:17.780> because<00:02:17.930> there's

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
actually learn for that because there's

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.350 
actually learn for that because there's
nothing<00:02:18.349> to<00:02:18.640> block<00:02:19.640> because<00:02:19.879> you<00:02:20.030> haven't

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
nothing to block because you haven't

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.479 
nothing to block because you haven't
made<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:20.780> target<00:02:21.319> and<00:02:21.440> at<00:02:21.799> nighttime<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.250> can

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
made a target and at nighttime you can

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.039 
made a target and at nighttime you can
actually<00:02:22.610> like<00:02:22.940> things<00:02:23.239> up<00:02:23.450> like<00:02:23.480> this<00:02:23.810> you

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
actually like things up like this you

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.960 
actually like things up like this you
see<00:02:24.080> on<00:02:24.290> this<00:02:24.409> wall<00:02:24.620> here<00:02:24.860> it's<00:02:25.310> not<00:02:25.519> amazing

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
see on this wall here it's not amazing

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.369 
see on this wall here it's not amazing
but<00:02:26.209> it's<00:02:26.480> a<00:02:26.510> cool<00:02:26.690> little<00:02:26.810> feature<00:02:26.930> if<00:02:27.290> you

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
but it's a cool little feature if you

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.809 
but it's a cool little feature if you
wanted<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.709> do<00:02:27.799> like<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.040> little<00:02:28.310> skit<00:02:28.610> or<00:02:28.760> a

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
wanted to do like a little skit or a

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.080 
wanted to do like a little skit or a
machinima<00:02:29.269> where<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.890> world's<00:02:31.370> like<00:02:31.549> overrun

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
machinima where the world's like overrun

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.759 
machinima where the world's like overrun
by<00:02:32.120> something<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:32.930> go<00:02:33.080> into<00:02:33.290> like<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.470> dark

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
by something you go into like a dark

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.559 
by something you go into like a dark
tunnel<00:02:33.980> like<00:02:34.310> this<00:02:34.519> I<00:02:34.700> know<00:02:35.030> there's<00:02:35.239> darker

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
tunnel like this I know there's darker

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.479 
tunnel like this I know there's darker
places<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:36.440> will<00:02:36.620> work<00:02:36.830> better<00:02:37.069> in<00:02:37.280> dark

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
places and it will work better in dark

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.220 
places and it will work better in dark
places<00:02:37.610> but<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.180> can<00:02:38.330> see<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.629> effect<00:02:38.930> it<00:02:39.079> has

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
places but you can see the effect it has

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.530 
places but you can see the effect it has
and<00:02:39.440> when<00:02:39.950> you<00:02:40.099> actually<00:02:40.310> aim<00:02:40.700> down<00:02:40.940> sight<00:02:41.269> if

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
and when you actually aim down sight if

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.509 
and when you actually aim down sight if
you're<00:02:42.049> getting<00:02:42.349> someone<00:02:42.769> to<00:02:42.799> record<00:02:43.220> you<00:02:43.370> by

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
you're getting someone to record you by

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.220 
you're getting someone to record you by
the<00:02:43.579> like<00:02:44.030> something<00:02:44.569> like<00:02:44.659> a<00:02:44.690> first-person

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
the like something like a first-person

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.380 
the like something like a first-person
view<00:02:45.500> or<00:02:45.709> whatnot<00:02:46.010> of<00:02:46.370> them<00:02:46.849> looking<00:02:47.180> at<00:02:47.299> you

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
view or whatnot of them looking at you
