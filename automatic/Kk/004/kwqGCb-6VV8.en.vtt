where<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.210> broke<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:28.619> bone<00:01:28.890> split<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:29.970> half<00:01:30.240> so

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
where it broke the bone split in half so

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.740 
where it broke the bone split in half so
it<00:01:31.560> lost<00:01:31.860> all<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.399> blood<00:01:32.610> supply<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.539> when<00:01:33.659> it

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
right track and took about a year

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.940 
right track and took about a year
involved<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.150> am<00:02:18.750> NOT<00:02:18.989> allowed<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.290> bend<00:02:19.829> my

involved I am NOT allowed to bend my
wrist<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:20.660> so<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:22.109> rule<00:02:22.320> is<00:02:22.530> if<00:02:22.799> you<00:02:22.920> don't

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
wrist and so the rule is if you don't

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.520 
wrist and so the rule is if you don't
use<00:02:23.340> two<00:02:23.820> hands<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.180> all<00:02:24.420> it's<00:02:24.720> voided<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.410> get

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
use two hands of all it's voided you get

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.250 
use two hands of all it's voided you get
a<00:02:25.560> zero<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.670> need<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.239> put<00:02:27.450> two<00:02:27.810> hands<00:02:28.079> on<00:02:28.200> the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
a zero so I need to put two hands on the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.380 
a zero so I need to put two hands on the
vault<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.709> use<00:02:29.010> my<00:02:29.220> knuckles<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:29.970> put<00:02:30.269> my

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390
