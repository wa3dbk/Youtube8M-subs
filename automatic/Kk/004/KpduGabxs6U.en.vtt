here you need to remove that rubber

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.300 
here you need to remove that rubber
isolator<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:28.690> plate<00:02:29.020> goes<00:02:29.230> in<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.470> back<00:02:29.680> and

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
isolator that plate goes in the back and

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.790 
isolator that plate goes in the back and
your<00:02:30.970> newly<00:02:31.270> relocated<00:02:31.600> turn<00:02:32.020> signal<00:02:32.380> Bolton

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
your newly relocated turn signal Bolton

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.770 
your newly relocated turn signal Bolton
like<00:02:32.950> that<00:02:33.190> same<00:02:33.910> adjust<00:02:34.180> things<00:02:34.270> up<00:02:34.480> really

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
like that same adjust things up really

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
number upper one back here where my turn

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.580 
number upper one back here where my turn
signal<00:02:57.860> was<00:02:58.220> maybe<00:02:59.000> one<00:02:59.120> in<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.330> back<00:02:59.590> I'm

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
signal was maybe one in the back I'm

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
signal was maybe one in the back I'm
just<00:03:00.739> going<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:00.950> test<00:03:01.370> fit<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.670> SUP<00:03:02.200> loosely

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
just going to test fit the SUP loosely

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.720 
just going to test fit the SUP loosely
looks<00:03:04.610> like<00:03:04.760> we're<00:03:04.970> close<00:03:05.510> to<00:03:05.900> lining<00:03:06.319> up<00:03:06.730> so

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
looks like we're close to lining up so

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.160 
looks like we're close to lining up so
I'm<00:03:08.090> going<00:03:08.269> to<00:03:08.299> go<00:03:08.390> ahead<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:08.720> put<00:03:08.810> my<00:03:08.840> quick

they're very easy to install have a nice
clip<00:03:22.549> on<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.819> back<00:03:23.000> side<00:03:23.829> they're

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
clip on the back side they're

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.150 
clip on the back side they're
spring-loaded<00:03:26.470> they're<00:03:27.470> spring-loaded<00:03:27.769> this

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
spring-loaded they're spring-loaded this

is<00:03:28.280> what<00:03:28.430> allows<00:03:28.670> us<00:03:28.700> to<00:03:29.019> easily<00:03:30.019> remove<00:03:30.500> the

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
is what allows us to easily remove the

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.349 
is what allows us to easily remove the
racks<00:03:30.859> from<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.160> bike<00:03:31.340> there's<00:03:32.000> got<00:03:32.209> four

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
racks from the bike there's got four

00:03:32.359 --> 00:04:02.880 
racks from the bike there's got four
four<00:03:32.569> on<00:03:32.720> each<00:03:32.810> side<00:03:32.870> let's<00:03:33.409> get<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:33.709> it

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.410 

so<00:04:03.890> we're<00:04:04.370> going<00:04:04.490> to<00:04:04.550> test<00:04:04.730> fit<00:04:04.910> this<00:04:05.060> up<00:04:05.210> the

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
so we're going to test fit this up the

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.680 
so we're going to test fit this up the
three<00:04:05.660> mounting<00:04:06.050> locations<00:04:06.560> we<00:04:06.709> have<00:04:07.690> this

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
three mounting locations we have this

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.449 
three mounting locations we have this
particular<00:04:08.930> bikes<00:04:09.530> have<00:04:09.770> the<00:04:09.950> tail<00:04:10.190> section

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
particular bikes have the tail section

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.000 
particular bikes have the tail section
modified<00:04:11.230> normally<00:04:12.230> remove<00:04:12.410> it<00:04:12.530> attach<00:04:12.800> that

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
modified normally remove it attach that

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.760 
modified normally remove it attach that

here since the license plate bracket has

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.289 
here since the license plate bracket has
been<00:04:17.930> cut<00:04:18.140> off<00:04:18.489> we're<00:04:19.489> going<00:04:19.790> to<00:04:19.880> disconnect

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
been cut off we're going to disconnect

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.030 
been cut off we're going to disconnect
it<00:04:20.450> at<00:04:20.570> these<00:04:20.660> three<00:04:21.049> mounting<00:04:21.440> locations<00:04:21.919> I

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
it at these three mounting locations I

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.780 
it at these three mounting locations I
have<00:04:22.130> left<00:04:22.340> loose<00:04:24.100> so<00:04:25.100> I've<00:04:25.250> left<00:04:25.400> all<00:04:25.580> these

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
have left loose so I've left all these

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.730 
have left loose so I've left all these
locations<00:04:26.300> loose<00:04:26.540> now<00:04:27.380> that<00:04:27.500> we<00:04:27.590> have<00:04:27.710> our

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
locations loose now that we have our

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.490 
locations loose now that we have our
racks<00:04:28.070> on<00:04:28.930> we<00:04:29.930> can<00:04:30.020> go<00:04:30.110> around

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
racks on we can go around

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:38.140 
racks on we can go around
tighten<00:04:30.830> these<00:04:30.919> up<00:04:31.130> nice<00:04:31.340> and<00:04:31.370> snug<00:04:37.150> because

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
tighten these up nice and snug because

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.320 
tighten these up nice and snug because
we<00:04:38.330> know<00:04:38.450> they're<00:04:38.600> all<00:04:38.720> aligned<00:04:39.020> properly<00:04:39.290> now

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
we know they're all aligned properly now

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.390 
we know they're all aligned properly now
we're<00:04:41.330> going<00:04:41.419> to<00:04:41.480> go<00:04:41.600> put<00:04:41.780> on<00:04:41.900> our<00:04:42.080> other<00:04:43.040> side

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
we're going to go put on our other side

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.590 
we're going to go put on our other side
rack<00:04:43.669> and<00:04:44.030> we're<00:04:44.180> going<00:04:44.330> to<00:04:44.390> put<00:04:44.510> the

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
rack and we're going to put the

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.210 
rack and we're going to put the
connector<00:04:44.870> in<00:04:45.080> between<00:04:45.410> the<00:04:45.500> two<00:04:45.680> let's<00:04:46.070> get

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
connector in between the two let's get

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.180 
connector in between the two let's get
the<00:04:46.310> other<00:04:46.430> side<00:04:46.610> done<00:04:47.860> so<00:04:48.860> this<00:04:49.010> side

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
the other side done so this side

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.460 
the other side done so this side
virtually<00:04:49.640> the<00:04:49.760> same<00:04:49.930> I've<00:04:50.930> already<00:04:51.320> extended

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
virtually the same I've already extended

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.570 
virtually the same I've already extended
my<00:04:51.860> wiring<00:04:52.400> for<00:04:52.940> my<00:04:53.230> turn<00:04:54.230> signal<00:04:54.500> so<00:04:55.310> I<00:04:55.340> kind

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
my wiring for my turn signal so I kind

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.980 
my wiring for my turn signal so I kind
of<00:04:55.669> jumped<00:04:55.910> ahead<00:04:56.000> a<00:04:56.150> little<00:04:56.300> bit<00:04:56.570> already<00:04:56.810> got

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
of jumped ahead a little bit already got

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.750 
of jumped ahead a little bit already got
this<00:04:57.140> mounted<00:04:57.560> well<00:04:58.040> as<00:04:58.160> during<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:58.430> wiring

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
this mounted well as during the wiring

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.610 
this mounted well as during the wiring
on<00:04:58.820> the<00:04:58.910> other<00:04:59.030> side<00:04:59.270> I<00:04:59.300> did<00:04:59.600> it<00:04:59.960> on<00:05:00.110> both<00:05:00.320> sides

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
on the other side I did it on both sides

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.800 
on the other side I did it on both sides
simultaneously<00:05:01.150> I'm<00:05:02.150> gonna<00:05:02.300> get<00:05:02.419> these<00:05:02.540> spots

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
simultaneously I'm gonna get these spots

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:39.580 
simultaneously I'm gonna get these spots
mounted<00:05:03.230> up<00:05:03.350> let's<00:05:03.620> get<00:05:03.770> to<00:05:03.919> it
