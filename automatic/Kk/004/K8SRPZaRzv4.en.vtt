00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
personally offensive I don't really

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.310 
personally offensive I don't really
think<00:04:25.539> that<00:04:25.660> this<00:04:25.840> cost

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
think that this cost

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.020 
think that this cost
is<00:04:26.470> a<00:04:26.530> big<00:04:26.710> deal<00:04:26.950> just<00:04:27.010> like<00:04:27.460> I<00:04:27.580> don't<00:04:27.760> think

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
is a big deal just like I don't think

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.530
