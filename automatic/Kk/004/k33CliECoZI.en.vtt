00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.170
 Good day, wanderers with you 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.600
 Styx 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.600
 Today we are going to talk about the pain 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.900
 as you probably already understood it will be about 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.030
 dark souls 2 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.550
 I read this game excessive 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.890
 you have to die hard 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.170
 and often and about this to you from the very beginning 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.090
 openly declare right in the game itself not 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.100
 going deep into the plot you are sent 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.719
 through a whirl shower somewhere down where you 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.450
 actually start your journey in this 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.340
 sick mad world having passed a checkpoint out 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.079
 grandmothers group at the entrance that is, 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.120
 fireplace and plenty having heard and 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.370
 you are given furry to your choice 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.920
 class a couple more useful stray on your 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.690
 discretion and eat everything st I do not know there 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.690
 where do you do not know what 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.119
 further training though generally and so all 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.150
 clear hit monsters don't let yourself be killed 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.650
 and all chocolate in my opinion training 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.500
 here it is necessary rather to give 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.180
 understand it will not be easy especially with 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.890
 control may be this joke 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.689
 developers but management tips 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.939
 they decided to leave in the form of buttons 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.340
 xbox gamepad 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.530
 There are x keys on the keyboard and so on. 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.110
 actually soared well and the left trigger 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.820
 there too, and apparently after a short 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.799
 possibly already deadly for you 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.520
 learning you find yourself in town 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.220
 majulu 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.320
 which will be your new home here 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.479
 start all your way further 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.280
 development in the city you can 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.729
 buy character level join your 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.159
 first covenant purchase gear and 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:50.399
 talk to a cat or cat 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.680
 never mind leaving the very first locations 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.930
 you are already in full taste the beauty of dark 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.939
 Souls Private Index Knife 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.920
 It is quite a serious enemy and 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.390
 if he is not alone then you will have to 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.820
 have a good run 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.770
 especially at first for each killed 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.110
 monster you are given local currency 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.940
 souls for which you will raise yourself 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.160
 level buy armor and upgrades for 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.160
 equipment as well as all sorts of useful 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.280
 poultices 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.200
 However, do not flatter yourself when you first 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.270
 same death, we carry her soul 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.830
 get lost and you only have one 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.140
 attempt to get them back 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.200
 you need not dying to get to the place 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.660
 death and pick up the loot well that is 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.360
 won in a fair fight that 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.100
 Of course, this does not always work out. 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.420
 of course, and there is a charm 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.150
 willy-nilly you start thinking 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.430
 each step and the higher the number 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.040
 the shower in amber the more you wait for some 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.770
 dirty trick from the game that by all laws 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.390
 It does not make long to wait then 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.790
 of course you can tell a story 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.100
 campfire like you lost 20 thousand souls but 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.310
 my advice to you boldly waste your accumulated 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.360
 second chance may not be 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.280
 I would like to tell a little more detail 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.010
 about game mechanics that is about that 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.630
 makes the game so complicated and compels 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.360
 burn various parts of your body you 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.490
 playing beyond control 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.320
 players are faced with the fact that each 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.420
 action takes quite a while 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.040
 whether it is a simple attack or God forbid 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.530
 healing bottle when health is on 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.390
 the outcome of which, of course, cannot be said about attacks 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.430
 some monsters that fall by 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.560
 sometimes even when you are confident 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.090
 hide behind your seemingly reliable 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.650
 by shield 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.000
 these problems are solved partly by experience 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.760
 in part to how you are your character 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.440
 develop but trust you more than once 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.800
 will have to die trying to finish your 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.140
 medicinal swill however observe 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.420
 calm this still with bosses not 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.070
 met sometimes from one size 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.720
 ill becomes seen this terrible 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.190
 Hepe strip on the whole screen in general 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.680
 I want to shoot 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.320
 not all of course so uniquely early or 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.880
 late all bosses will be defeated but then 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.090
 what happens between your first 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.370
 meeting last priceless tens 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.800
 attempts with ridiculous deaths thoughts about 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.430
 universal injustice and maybe 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:04.510
 even a broken mouse or gamepad 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.459
 calm only calm in general 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.950
 your monitor will hear a lot of new 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.690
 interesting words of epithets deep 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.030
 immersion in the wilds of the Russian language 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.700
 in places it is possible that Yesenin would 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.980
 envied remember for example punish 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.019
 the holy captain of the captain has fallen out of love 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:24.800
 he is our mother's sinner 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.379
 next was the entrance to the world of pain and 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.020
 misery dark souls about 700 rubles 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:32.030
 In the incentive of the location of bosses in the game more than 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.919
 abound and some monsters and 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.780
 will you do in nightmares in dreams 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.300
 overall impression for the price through 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.849
 edge game from i recommend to those who want 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.039
 test your skills 2 and nerves 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:45.229
 at the same time as well as those to whom the current game 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.810
 seem too simple and casual 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.669
 my particularly impressive is worth three times 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.000
 to think if the smart purchase 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.979
 spent nerves and no one will return but 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.449
 I will say for sure nothing of the kind 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.729
 modern industry is simply not 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.190
 there is well besides the first part 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.590
 summing up the assessment of the game I will say that 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.419
 its money, it is definitely worth it and not 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.580
 worth despair if at first you donâ€™t 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.919
 will something turn out everything comes with 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.289
 experience well, more about this game about 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.389
 what to do and what not to go 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:16.940
 and many other things I will tell in my 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.159
 next video like thoughts on 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.940
 game write in the comments well and with you 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:23.860
 was stix 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.860
 all the best for now
