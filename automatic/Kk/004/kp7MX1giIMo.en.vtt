 tangerine the truth is that I had those 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.000
 two fruits did not reach the oranges 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.760

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.320
 how many grams are each one are 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.300
 I will put in the description box a 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.700
 little bit of vanilla here is the 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.090
 vanilla flour here I have three bags 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.340
 of wheat flour and a cup of flour 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.910
 of hot cakes I have two tablespoons and 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.910
 measures of 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.010
 baking powder here I have a cup 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.220
 of sugar and I have a little bit of oil 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:49.280
 to complete in case I do not have enough 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:54.680
 butter this bread that I have at home 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:57.869
 it is not necessary to go to the store 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.960
 and they can pour oil on it if they do not have 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.390
 the orange juice can pour milk or 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.760
 you can get water, here I have a 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.420
 little bit of condensed milk with this what 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.739
 I'm going to complete for the sugar this 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.660
 remember that this is optional and I 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.630
 I try to make something easier that is 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.080
 may well let's start here in this 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.630
 fret in statin I have this 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.510
 making the whites about to nougat 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.330
 we're going to make them beat up 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.459
 Let the good nougat point remain 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.190
 friends here since the yolks have been 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.910
 the clear forgiveness about nougat like 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.760
 can see do not fall good the next 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.939
 step is that with the clear 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:46.709
 let's beat them and let's go 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:49.049
 adding sugar little by little and not 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:53.430
 sorry but first we are going to beat it with 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.989
 the butter the yolks and we're going to 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.049
 beat with butter as they are a 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:01.280
 little bit white we're going to start 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:06.180
 to beat with the sugar and until it 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:09.209
 put whiter and we are also going to 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.140
 adding the milk was good and after 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:16.349
 this we are going to add the juice of 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.030
 good orange I've heard them tell me 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:22.109
 I have preheated this I'm heating up 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.629
 my oven at 200 degrees so they said in the 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.909
 list of hot cakes these recipes the 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:30.540
 I took out a cupcake flour but the 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:33.569
 truth is that I made her walk to my 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.770
 then good chances we will 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.200

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.770
 the yolks forgive this with the sugar 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.560
 it was white as I could was a little bit 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.530
 white now I'm going to add the 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.740
 Butter 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.740

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.210

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.230
 I will add the same diet you know this 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:13.530

 as it's called with butter and milk 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:24.660
 with half a cup of oil now I'm going to 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.130
 help little by little our juice and good 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.180

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.180
 one with only one hand 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.500
 well here I have my mix now I'm going to 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.170
 go adding the flour little by little 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.140

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.940
 with the yolks the milkmaid if that 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.460
