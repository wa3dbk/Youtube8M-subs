here's<00:00:03.510> how<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.750> change<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.650> bearings<00:00:05.130> in<00:00:05.310> a

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
here's how to change the bearings in a

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.430 
here's how to change the bearings in a
skateboard<00:00:05.970> now<00:00:06.359> I<00:00:06.390> have<00:00:06.870> an<00:00:06.990> old<00:00:07.170> skateboard

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
skateboard now I have an old skateboard

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.100 
skateboard now I have an old skateboard
from<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.770> 1970s<00:00:08.460> here<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.730> you<00:00:08.790> can<00:00:08.910> see<00:00:09.120> that

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
from the 1970s here and you can see that

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.660 
from the 1970s here and you can see that
wheel<00:00:10.260> doesn't<00:00:10.590> want<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.830> turn<00:00:10.980> anymore<00:00:11.460> and

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
wheel doesn't want to turn anymore and

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.089 
wheel doesn't want to turn anymore and
the<00:00:12.210> other<00:00:12.360> wheels<00:00:12.509> say<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:13.500> making<00:00:13.830> noise

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
the other wheels say you making noise

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.440 
the other wheels say you making noise
sound<00:00:14.370> like<00:00:14.460> they<00:00:14.549> have<00:00:14.580> gravel<00:00:15.030> in<00:00:15.150> them<00:00:15.269> so

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
sound like they have gravel in them so

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.450 
sound like they have gravel in them so
these<00:00:15.599> bearings<00:00:16.020> are<00:00:16.109> 30<00:00:16.379> or<00:00:16.710> 40<00:00:17.039> years<00:00:17.220> old

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
these bearings are 30 or 40 years old

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.760 
these bearings are 30 or 40 years old
the<00:00:17.940> good<00:00:18.119> news<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.529> an<00:00:19.680> old

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
the good news is this this is an old

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.470 
the good news is this this is an old
1970s<00:00:20.460> skateboard<00:00:20.820> with<00:00:20.970> sealed<00:00:21.180> bearings

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
1970s skateboard with sealed bearings

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.670 
1970s skateboard with sealed bearings
they've<00:00:21.660> already<00:00:21.779> changed<00:00:22.080> one<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.380> them<00:00:22.560> you

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
they've already changed one of them you

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.769 
they've already changed one of them you
can<00:00:22.800> see<00:00:22.949> how<00:00:23.580> smooth<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.090> quiet<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.510> wheel

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
can see how smooth and quiet that wheel

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.450 
can see how smooth and quiet that wheel
is<00:00:24.990> now<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.260> I've<00:00:25.380> changed<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.800> but<00:00:26.220> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
is now that I've changed it but the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.460 
is now that I've changed it but the
bearings<00:00:27.060> are<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.269> same<00:00:27.449> size<00:00:27.779> as<00:00:28.230> they<00:00:28.410> were

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
bearings are the same size as they were

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.960 
bearings are the same size as they were
in<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.800> seventies<00:00:29.250> even<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> spacer<00:00:29.939> in

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
in the seventies even the spacer in

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.400 
in the seventies even the spacer in
between<00:00:30.090> them<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.689> same<00:00:30.840> size<00:00:31.080> for<00:00:31.289> these

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
between them is the same size for these

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.410 
between them is the same size for these
wheels<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.309> what<00:00:32.579> I've<00:00:32.669> done<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:32.969> just<00:00:33.180> gone

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
wheels so what I've done is just gone

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.170 
wheels so what I've done is just gone
and<00:00:33.750> bought<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.960> set<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.950> Beck<00:00:35.850> five

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
and bought a set of a Beck five

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.970 
and bought a set of a Beck five
independent<00:00:36.809> bearings<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.770> I'm<00:00:37.829> going<00:00:37.950> to

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
independent bearings and I'm going to

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.220 
independent bearings and I'm going to
put<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.250> there<00:00:38.780> now<00:00:39.780> when<00:00:39.960> you're<00:00:40.079> buying

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
put in there now when you're buying

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.720 
put in there now when you're buying
bearings<00:00:40.680> there's<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.070> thing<00:00:41.430> called<00:00:41.460> an

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
bearings there's this thing called an

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.990 
bearings there's this thing called an
ABEC<00:00:42.000> rating<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.989> there's<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.680> big<00:00:43.890> threes<00:00:44.520> a

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
ABEC rating and there's a big threes a

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.180 
ABEC rating and there's a big threes a
big<00:00:45.570> five<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.140> big<00:00:46.320> sevens<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.010> beck

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
big five is a big sevens and a beck

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.560 
big five is a big sevens and a beck
nines<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.760> higher<00:00:47.910> number<00:00:48.360> means

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
nines and the higher number means

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.150 
nines and the higher number means
they're<00:00:48.870> better<00:00:49.110> quality<00:00:49.620> bearings<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.100> I

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
they're better quality bearings so I

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.830 
they're better quality bearings so I
just<00:00:50.340> went<00:00:50.460> with<00:00:50.520> these<00:00:50.700> fives<00:00:51.149> which<00:00:51.420> are<00:00:51.629> a

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
just went with these fives which are a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.569 
just went with these fives which are a
little<00:00:52.379> better<00:00:52.620> than<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.829> threes<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.370> not<00:00:53.489> as

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
little better than the threes but not as

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.069 
little better than the threes but not as
good<00:00:53.699> as<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.910> sevens<00:00:54.270> or<00:00:54.420> nines<00:00:54.600> but<00:00:54.840> probably

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
good as the sevens or nines but probably

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.439 
good as the sevens or nines but probably
good<00:00:55.230> enough<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.530> get<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.770> down<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> street

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
good enough to get you down the street

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.319 
good enough to get you down the street
so<00:00:57.449> let's<00:00:57.870> see<00:00:58.079> how<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.469> take<00:00:59.039> the<00:01:00.030> bearings

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
so let's see how to take the bearings

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.479 
so let's see how to take the bearings
out<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:01.379> don't<00:01:01.500> really<00:01:01.590> need<00:01:01.829> any<00:01:02.039> special

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
out you don't really need any special

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.850 
out you don't really need any special
tools<00:01:02.699> other<00:01:02.879> than<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.320> socket<00:01:04.320> wrench<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.619> do

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
tools other than a socket wrench to do

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.070 
tools other than a socket wrench to do
that<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.820> take<00:01:06.000> them<00:01:06.150> out<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:06.900> want<00:01:07.049> to

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
that to take them out you just want to

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.289 
that to take them out you just want to
take<00:01:07.229> take<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.220> nut<00:01:08.430> off<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.850> wheel<00:01:09.030> and

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
take take the nut off of the wheel and

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.380 
take take the nut off of the wheel and
there's<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.869> lock<00:01:10.170> nut<00:01:13.189> firm<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.670> take

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
there's a lock nut firm so you just take

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.080 
there's a lock nut firm so you just take
the<00:01:15.540> nut<00:01:15.720> off<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:20.100> then<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:20.640> want<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.880> clean

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
the nut off and then we want to clean

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.620 
the nut off and then we want to clean
everything<00:01:21.570> if<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:21.869> filthy<00:01:22.320> which<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.710> is

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
everything if it's filthy which it is

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.870 
everything if it's filthy which it is
enough<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.780> get<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.409> actual<00:01:26.340> bearing<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.759> can

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
enough to get the actual bearing you can

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.390 
enough to get the actual bearing you can
see<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.119> bearing<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:28.189> just<00:01:29.189> kind<00:01:29.369> of

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
see the bearing this is just kind of

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.429 
see the bearing this is just kind of
press<00:01:29.670> your<00:01:29.850> fit<00:01:30.030> into<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.420> rubber<00:01:30.630> wheel<00:01:30.930> so

alright here we go so so you just sort
of<00:01:48.329> put<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:51.509> edge<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.049> bearing<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.500> there

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
of put the edge of the bearing in there

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.819 
of put the edge of the bearing in there
so<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.860> get<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.420> nut<00:01:54.810> or<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.560> bolt

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
so you get the the this nut or this bolt

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.179 
so you get the the this nut or this bolt
in<00:01:56.070> there<00:01:56.479> just<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.899> edge<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.890> bearing

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
in there just to the edge of the bearing

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.370 
in there just to the edge of the bearing
and<00:01:59.460> then<00:01:59.610> kind<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.820> lean<00:02:00.420> down<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.110> pry<00:02:01.320> it

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
and then kind of lean down and pry it

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.530 
and then kind of lean down and pry it
out<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:01.890> I'm<00:02:01.979> going<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.189> demonstrate<00:02:03.060> that

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
out so I'm going to demonstrate that

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.929 
out so I'm going to demonstrate that
here<00:02:03.899> just<00:02:04.049> kind<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.530> leaning<00:02:05.369> down<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.610> little

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
here just kind of leaning down a little

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.910 
here just kind of leaning down a little
bit<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.210> pry<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:07.049> price<00:02:07.320> oh<00:02:07.560> now<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.710> I've

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
bit to pry it to price oh now that I've

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.369 
bit to pry it to price oh now that I've
pried<00:02:08.599> you<00:02:09.599> can<00:02:09.720> see<00:02:09.869> it's<00:02:09.989> sticking<00:02:10.140> out<00:02:10.349> a

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
pried you can see it's sticking out a

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.470 
pried you can see it's sticking out a
little<00:02:10.410> bit<00:02:10.679> on<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.860> bottom<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:12.060> then<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.270> flip

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
little bit on the bottom so then I flip

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.040 
little bit on the bottom so then I flip
it<00:02:12.569> over

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
it over

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.100 
it over
pry<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.350> this<00:02:13.590> way<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:15.090> get<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.420> other<00:02:15.810> side

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
pry it this way to get the other side

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.830 
pry it this way to get the other side
out<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.670> just<00:02:17.910> kind<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.090> rock<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.360> back<00:02:18.630> and

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
out and just kind of rock it back and

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.390 
out and just kind of rock it back and
forth<00:02:19.050> like<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:20.390> until<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.890> bearing<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.460> out

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
forth like that until the bearing is out

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.860 
forth like that until the bearing is out
and<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:26.730> pretty<00:02:27.000> disgusting<00:02:29.870> then

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
and that is pretty disgusting then

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.390 
and that is pretty disgusting then
there's<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.140> spacer<00:02:31.590> inside<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.130> there<00:02:32.280> it

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
there's a spacer inside of there it

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.460 
there's a spacer inside of there it
looks<00:02:32.550> like<00:02:32.700> this<00:02:33.030> now<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.840> want<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.140> check<00:02:34.320> it

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
looks like this now you want to check it

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.870 
looks like this now you want to check it
against<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.770> new<00:02:34.980> spacer<00:02:35.400> if<00:02:35.490> you<00:02:35.580> get<00:02:35.700> new

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
against the new spacer if you get new

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.360 
against the new spacer if you get new
spacers<00:02:36.330> with<00:02:36.510> your<00:02:36.750> with<00:02:37.650> your<00:02:37.680> bearings<00:02:38.160> I

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
spacers with your with your bearings I

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.430 
spacers with your with your bearings I
I've<00:02:38.790> checked<00:02:39.330> them<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.690> new<00:02:39.840> spacers<00:02:40.290> are

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
I've checked them the new spacers are

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.330 
I've checked them the new spacers are
actually<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.010> same<00:02:41.040> size<00:02:41.520> as<00:02:41.940> my<00:02:42.540> old<00:02:42.750> ones

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
actually the same size as my old ones

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.800 
actually the same size as my old ones
so<00:02:44.340> here's<00:02:45.230> new<00:02:46.230> versus<00:02:46.680> old<00:02:46.800> spacer<00:02:47.630> you<00:02:48.630> just

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
so here's new versus old spacer you just

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.210 
so here's new versus old spacer you just
want<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:48.990> make<00:02:49.110> sure<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.470> it's<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.040> same

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
want to make sure that it's the same

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.800 
want to make sure that it's the same
size<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.730> if<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.880> is<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.090> same<00:02:51.240> size<00:02:51.450> then<00:02:51.690> you

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
size and if it is the same size then you

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.810 
size and if it is the same size then you
can<00:02:52.290> use<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.560> new<00:02:52.680> one<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:54.720> then<00:02:55.610> we've<00:02:56.610> taken

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
can use the new one and then we've taken

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.160 
can use the new one and then we've taken
one<00:02:57.060> bearing<00:02:57.390> out<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.720> then<00:02:57.810> there's<00:02:57.960> another

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
one bearing out and then there's another

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.620 
one bearing out and then there's another
bearing<00:02:58.470> on<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.740> outside<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.850> the<00:02:59.910> wheel<00:03:00.060> same

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
bearing on the outside of the wheel same

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.290 
bearing on the outside of the wheel same
procedure<00:03:01.050> there<00:03:01.350> we<00:03:01.500> just<00:03:01.680> put<00:03:01.860> this<00:03:02.010> on<00:03:02.300> here

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
procedure there we just put this on here

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.280 
procedure there we just put this on here
and<00:03:03.450> gently<00:03:04.260> pry<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.710> out<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:06.150> roll<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:06.900> and

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
and gently pry it out and roll it and

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.310 
and gently pry it out and roll it and
crying<00:03:07.800> so<00:03:08.300> I<00:03:09.300> pry<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.540> from<00:03:09.660> one<00:03:09.870> side<00:03:10.080> and

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
crying so I pry it from one side and

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.570 
crying so I pry it from one side and
then<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.500> other<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.920> then<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.190> comes<00:03:11.340> out

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
then the other and then that comes out

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.840 
then the other and then that comes out
like<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:12.710> then<00:03:13.710> I'm<00:03:13.950> going<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.220> wash<00:03:14.460> the

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
like that then I'm going to wash the

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.280 
like that then I'm going to wash the
hell<00:03:15.000> out<00:03:15.150> of<00:03:15.180> this<00:03:15.330> wheel<00:03:15.570> because<00:03:15.870> it's<00:03:16.050> got

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
hell out of this wheel because it's got

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.590 
hell out of this wheel because it's got
you<00:03:16.740> can<00:03:16.860> see<00:03:16.890> crud<00:03:17.520> and<00:03:17.760> grime<00:03:18.090> in<00:03:18.270> there<00:03:18.420> all

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
you can see crud and grime in there all

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.970 
you can see crud and grime in there all
that<00:03:18.750> stuff<00:03:19.880> that<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:21.450> just<00:03:22.320> want<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.590> want<00:03:22.920> to

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
that stuff that I just want to want to

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
that stuff that I just want to want to
get<00:03:23.070> it<00:03:23.190> clean<00:03:23.400> as<00:03:23.610> clean<00:03:23.850> as<00:03:23.970> possible

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
get it clean as clean as possible

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.390 
get it clean as clean as possible
cleaning<00:03:24.750> this<00:03:24.870> up<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:25.290> then<00:03:25.890> we'll<00:03:26.040> put<00:03:26.190> the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
cleaning this up and then we'll put the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.570 
cleaning this up and then we'll put the
new<00:03:26.880> bearings<00:03:27.720> in<00:03:27.810> once<00:03:28.020> it's<00:03:28.170> clean<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.650> once

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
new bearings in once it's clean and once

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.530 
new bearings in once it's clean and once
I'm<00:03:29.730> done<00:03:29.850> cleaning<00:03:30.030> it<00:03:30.270> I'm<00:03:30.330> going<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.480> make

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
I'm done cleaning it I'm going to make

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.729 
I'm done cleaning it I'm going to make
sure<00:03:30.720> there's<00:03:30.900> no<00:03:30.989> water<00:03:31.170> in<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.470> because<00:03:31.680> we

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
sure there's no water in it because we

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:32.630 
sure there's no water in it because we
don't<00:03:31.800> want<00:03:31.890> water<00:03:32.160> getting<00:03:32.400> in<00:03:32.550> their

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
don't want water getting in their

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.370 
don't want water getting in their
bearings<00:03:32.970> all<00:03:33.540> right<00:03:33.690> now<00:03:33.810> let's<00:03:34.020> take<00:03:34.110> a<00:03:34.170> look

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
bearings all right now let's take a look

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.080 
bearings all right now let's take a look
at<00:03:34.440> what<00:03:34.560> we<00:03:34.680> get<00:03:34.860> in<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.190> box<00:03:35.430> with<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.790> new

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
at what we get in the box with the new

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.890 
at what we get in the box with the new
kit<00:03:36.709> so<00:03:37.850> spacer<00:03:38.850> goes<00:03:39.060> between<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.480> bearings

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
kit so spacer goes between the bearings

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.020 
kit so spacer goes between the bearings
I'm<00:03:40.470> going<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.680> put<00:03:40.770> a<00:03:40.800> washer<00:03:41.280> on<00:03:41.310> either<00:03:41.670> side

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
I'm going to put a washer on either side

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.410 
I'm going to put a washer on either side
of<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.270> bearing<00:03:42.540> one<00:03:43.400> one<00:03:44.400> on<00:03:44.520> the<00:03:44.640> outside<00:03:45.180> of

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
of the bearing one one on the outside of

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.630 
of the bearing one one on the outside of
the<00:03:45.480> wheel<00:03:45.630> under<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.650> nut<00:03:46.890> and<00:03:47.100> one<00:03:47.310> then<00:03:47.459> one

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
the wheel under the nut and one then one

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.400 
the wheel under the nut and one then one
on<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.790> inside<00:03:48.180> of<00:03:48.300> the<00:03:48.360> wheel<00:03:48.540> up<00:03:49.050> against

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
on the inside of the wheel up against

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.050 
on the inside of the wheel up against
the<00:03:49.530> truck<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.160> if<00:03:50.550> you<00:03:50.670> look<00:03:50.820> at<00:03:50.970> the

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
the truck and if you look at the

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.150 
the truck and if you look at the
bearings<00:03:51.480> themselves<00:03:51.680> you<00:03:52.680> can<00:03:52.770> see<00:03:52.980> in<00:03:53.070> the

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
bearings themselves you can see in the

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.190 
bearings themselves you can see in the
back<00:03:53.400> of<00:03:53.580> this<00:03:53.730> bearing<00:03:54.120> it's<00:03:54.570> open<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.140> you

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
back of this bearing it's open and you

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.620 
back of this bearing it's open and you
can<00:03:55.350> see<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.739> actual<00:03:56.100> little<00:03:56.880> balls<00:03:57.209> in<00:03:57.450> there

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
can see the actual little balls in there

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.690 
can see the actual little balls in there
so<00:03:58.140> that<00:03:58.290> means<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:58.620> could<00:03:58.800> actually<00:03:59.400> oil

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
so that means you could actually oil

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.400 
so that means you could actually oil
this<00:04:00.180> take<00:04:00.360> it<00:04:00.480> off<00:04:00.570> an<00:04:00.720> oil<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:01.080> periodically

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
this take it off an oil it periodically

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.620 
this take it off an oil it periodically
to<00:04:01.739> keep<00:04:01.890> it<00:04:02.010> running<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.400> then<00:04:02.910> put<00:04:03.330> this

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
to keep it running and then put this

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.470 
to keep it running and then put this
side<00:04:04.380> of<00:04:04.590> it<00:04:04.709> facing<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.160> outside<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.820> that

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
side of it facing the outside and that

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.650 
side of it facing the outside and that
way<00:04:06.600> this<00:04:06.750> will<00:04:06.900> keep<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.230> dirt<00:04:07.410> out<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:08.660> then

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
way this will keep the dirt out and then

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.740 
way this will keep the dirt out and then
just<00:04:10.280> remove<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:11.400> too<00:04:11.640> to<00:04:12.000> spray<00:04:12.239> oil<00:04:12.450> in<00:04:12.600> there

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
just remove it too to spray oil in there

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.030 
just remove it too to spray oil in there
periodically<00:04:13.260> so<00:04:13.440> when<00:04:13.560> you<00:04:13.650> mount<00:04:13.800> it<00:04:13.950> you

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
periodically so when you mount it you

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.860 
periodically so when you mount it you
want<00:04:14.250> this<00:04:14.850> side<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.239> be<00:04:15.269> facing<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.840> outside

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
want this side to be facing the outside

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.020 
want this side to be facing the outside
of<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.470> wheel<00:04:16.590> on<00:04:16.830> both<00:04:16.980> sides<00:04:17.220> we<00:04:17.700> take<00:04:17.850> our

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
of the wheel on both sides we take our

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:25.270 
of the wheel on both sides we take our
wheel<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.930> just<00:04:22.169> sort<00:04:22.380> of<00:04:22.410> press<00:04:22.710> it<00:04:22.890> in<00:04:23.100> there

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
wheel and just sort of press it in there

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.610 
wheel and just sort of press it in there
get<00:04:26.280> it<00:04:26.400> started<00:04:26.730> with<00:04:27.630> my<00:04:27.810> hands<00:04:28.290> and<00:04:28.440> there's

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
get it started with my hands and there's

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.170 
get it started with my hands and there's
a<00:04:28.710> little<00:04:28.830> Ridge<00:04:29.190> on<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.610> inside<00:04:29.940> of<00:04:29.970> the

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
a little Ridge on the inside of the

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.900 
a little Ridge on the inside of the
wheel<00:04:30.360> where<00:04:31.050> that<00:04:31.200> it<00:04:31.320> sits<00:04:31.560> on<00:04:31.770> and<00:04:32.010> then<00:04:32.760> I'm

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
wheel where that it sits on and then I'm

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.820 
wheel where that it sits on and then I'm
going<00:04:33.180> to<00:04:33.270> get<00:04:33.389> a<00:04:33.419> socket<00:04:33.810> that's<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.620> same

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
going to get a socket that's the same

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.580 
going to get a socket that's the same
size<00:04:35.100> as<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.460> bearing<00:04:35.820> and<00:04:36.480> they<00:04:37.230> just<00:04:37.410> use<00:04:37.560> it

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
size as the bearing and they just use it

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:44.270 
size as the bearing and they just use it
to<00:04:37.800> gently<00:04:38.190> push<00:04:38.430> it<00:04:38.460> in<00:04:38.700> here<00:04:42.980> and<00:04:43.980> get<00:04:44.190> it

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
to gently push it in here and get it

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.920 
to gently push it in here and get it
down<00:04:44.430> against<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:44.970> rubber<00:04:45.210> lip<00:04:45.450> in<00:04:45.600> there<00:04:45.780> so

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
down against the rubber lip in there so

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.580 
down against the rubber lip in there so
now<00:04:46.080> it's<00:04:46.230> it's<00:04:46.889> properly<00:04:47.960> securely<00:04:48.960> placed

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
now it's it's properly securely placed

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.060 
now it's it's properly securely placed
in<00:04:49.860> there<00:04:50.040> then<00:04:50.910> we<00:04:51.000> flip<00:04:51.240> it<00:04:51.830> I'm<00:04:52.830> going<00:04:53.040> to

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
in there then we flip it I'm going to

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.810 
in there then we flip it I'm going to
want<00:04:53.220> to<00:04:53.280> put<00:04:53.430> in<00:04:53.550> our<00:04:53.700> star<00:04:54.030> new<00:04:54.210> spacer<00:04:55.820> kind

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
want to put in our star new spacer kind

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.640 
want to put in our star new spacer kind
of<00:04:56.970> try<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:57.240> keep<00:04:57.600> it<00:04:57.810> centered<00:04:58.110> you<00:04:58.500> can

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
of try to keep it centered you can

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.320 
of try to keep it centered you can
adjust<00:04:58.979> it<00:04:59.130> some<00:04:59.370> after<00:04:59.639> you<00:04:59.700> put<00:04:59.880> the<00:05:00.000> second

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
adjust it some after you put the second

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.750 
adjust it some after you put the second
bearing<00:05:00.630> it<00:05:00.780> I<00:05:01.040> guess<00:05:02.040> I<00:05:02.160> go<00:05:02.400> in<00:05:02.520> there<00:05:02.610> with<00:05:02.729> a

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
bearing it I guess I go in there with a

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.909 
bearing it I guess I go in there with a
pen<00:05:03.060> and<00:05:03.090> just<00:05:03.330> kind<00:05:03.540> of<00:05:03.570> wiggle<00:05:03.810> it<00:05:04.020> around<00:05:04.080> to

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
pen and just kind of wiggle it around to

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.129 
pen and just kind of wiggle it around to
get<00:05:05.040> it<00:05:05.220> on<00:05:05.760> target<00:05:06.240> so<00:05:06.540> again<00:05:06.720> we<00:05:06.810> put<00:05:06.960> the

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
get it on target so again we put the

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.440 
get it on target so again we put the
still<00:05:07.950> not<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:08.280> black<00:05:08.520> side<00:05:08.820> but<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.120> silver

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
still not the black side but the silver

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.810 
still not the black side but the silver
side<00:05:09.600> facing<00:05:10.020> out<00:05:11.780> and<00:05:12.780> press<00:05:13.050> that<00:05:13.380> in<00:05:13.820> that

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
side facing out and press that in that

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.400 
side facing out and press that in that
one<00:05:15.060> I<00:05:15.090> didn't<00:05:15.389> need<00:05:15.479> to<00:05:15.540> use<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:15.900> socket<00:05:16.080> for

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
one I didn't need to use the socket for

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.040 
one I didn't need to use the socket for
because<00:05:16.680> it<00:05:16.800> went<00:05:16.950> in<00:05:17.010> pretty<00:05:17.130> easy<00:05:17.930> and<00:05:18.930> then

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
because it went in pretty easy and then

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.990 
because it went in pretty easy and then
align<00:05:19.710> it<00:05:19.919> so<00:05:20.100> that<00:05:20.220> I<00:05:20.280> can<00:05:20.430> see<00:05:20.700> daylight

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
align it so that I can see daylight

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.390 
align it so that I can see daylight
through<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.479> hole<00:05:22.220> then<00:05:23.220> continue<00:05:23.760> over<00:05:24.030> here

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
through the hole then continue over here

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:32.540 
through the hole then continue over here
put<00:05:26.400> one<00:05:27.350> washer<00:05:28.350> on<00:05:28.590> here<00:05:30.500> to<00:05:31.500> that<00:05:32.160> presses

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
put one washer on here to that presses

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.040 
put one washer on here to that presses
up<00:05:32.669> against<00:05:32.940> the<00:05:33.030> inside<00:05:33.450> of<00:05:33.660> the<00:05:33.720> bearing

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.290 
up against the inside of the bearing
here<00:05:34.289> the<00:05:34.740> part<00:05:34.950> that<00:05:35.100> spins<00:05:35.220> and<00:05:35.669> make<00:05:36.150> sure

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
here the part that spins and make sure

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.029 
here the part that spins and make sure
that<00:05:36.479> it<00:05:36.690> doesn't<00:05:36.900> drag<00:05:37.260> on<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:37.620> side<00:05:37.830> of<00:05:37.950> the

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
that it doesn't drag on the side of the

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.409 
that it doesn't drag on the side of the
truck<00:05:38.280> especially<00:05:38.700> with<00:05:38.789> a<00:05:38.850> big<00:05:39.000> fat<00:05:39.180> truck

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
truck especially with a big fat truck

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:45.140 
truck especially with a big fat truck
like<00:05:39.570> this<00:05:39.750> one<00:05:39.930> and<00:05:40.650> then<00:05:43.430> like<00:05:44.430> my<00:05:44.970> inner

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
like this one and then like my inner

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.520 
like this one and then like my inner
hole<00:05:45.390> has<00:05:45.630> gotten<00:05:45.840> out<00:05:45.900> of<00:05:45.960> alignment<00:05:46.229> again

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
hole has gotten out of alignment again

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:53.610 
hole has gotten out of alignment again
so<00:05:46.950> we<00:05:47.070> just<00:05:47.280> line<00:05:48.060> it<00:05:48.090> up

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.260 

put<00:05:54.190> it<00:05:54.280> on<00:05:54.400> and<00:05:55.120> then<00:05:55.690> on<00:05:55.810> the<00:05:55.930> outside<00:05:57.270> I'm

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
put it on and then on the outside I'm

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.400 
put it on and then on the outside I'm
going<00:05:58.419> to<00:05:58.480> want<00:05:58.630> to<00:05:58.690> put<00:05:58.810> one<00:05:58.960> of<00:05:59.080> these<00:05:59.139> little

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
going to want to put one of these little

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:04.050 
going to want to put one of these little
baby<00:05:59.710> washers<00:06:00.160> in<00:06:00.310> there<00:06:00.780> and<00:06:02.610> then<00:06:03.610> put<00:06:03.940> our

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
baby washers in there and then put our

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:11.310 
baby washers in there and then put our
locking<00:06:04.419> nut<00:06:04.570> back<00:06:04.750> on<00:06:09.900> torque<00:06:10.900> it<00:06:11.050> down<00:06:11.290> I

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
locking nut back on torque it down I

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.720 
locking nut back on torque it down I
looked<00:06:11.710> around<00:06:11.830> on<00:06:12.100> the<00:06:12.190> Internet

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:12.730 
looked around on the Internet

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.150 
looked around on the Internet
these<00:06:13.389> nuts<00:06:13.690> are<00:06:13.990> built<00:06:14.350> so<00:06:14.620> that<00:06:14.650> they<00:06:14.950> don't

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
these nuts are built so that they don't

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.980 
these nuts are built so that they don't
spin<00:06:15.610> off<00:06:15.760> they<00:06:15.940> have<00:06:16.060> a<00:06:16.090> locking<00:06:16.330> feature<00:06:16.720> to

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
spin off they have a locking feature to

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.680 
spin off they have a locking feature to
them<00:06:17.110> so<00:06:17.770> they<00:06:17.889> go<00:06:18.040> on<00:06:18.150> kind<00:06:19.150> of<00:06:19.210> hard<00:06:19.389> even

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
them so they go on kind of hard even

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.320 
them so they go on kind of hard even
even<00:06:20.050> when<00:06:20.980> they're<00:06:21.130> loose<00:06:21.340> so<00:06:21.880> you<00:06:21.970> just<00:06:22.120> want

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
even when they're loose so you just want

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.550 
even when they're loose so you just want
to<00:06:22.389> torque<00:06:22.600> it<00:06:22.690> down<00:06:22.750> so<00:06:23.200> that<00:06:23.350> the<00:06:23.440> wheel

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
to torque it down so that the wheel

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.470 
to torque it down so that the wheel
doesn't<00:06:23.800> wiggle<00:06:24.100> from<00:06:24.220> side<00:06:24.280> to<00:06:24.460> side<00:06:24.639> but<00:06:25.389> you

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480 
doesn't wiggle from side to side but you

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:36.750 
doesn't wiggle from side to side but you
don't<00:06:25.630> really<00:06:25.780> need<00:06:25.990> to<00:06:26.139> hell<00:06:26.620> up<00:06:35.580> it<00:06:36.580> feels

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 
don't really need to hell up it feels

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:43.650 
don't really need to hell up it feels
pretty<00:06:37.000> tight<00:06:38.040> yeah<00:06:42.150> there<00:06:43.150> we<00:06:43.240> go<00:06:43.300> that's

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660 
pretty tight yeah there we go that's

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.050 
pretty tight yeah there we go that's
pretty<00:06:43.780> good<00:06:43.960> spin<00:06:44.550> that's<00:06:45.550> all<00:06:45.729> there<00:06:45.850> is<00:06:45.910> to

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
pretty good spin that's all there is to

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.140 
pretty good spin that's all there is to
it<00:06:46.180> just<00:06:46.660> do<00:06:46.750> that<00:06:46.930> four<00:06:47.229> times<00:06:47.260> and<00:06:48.120> you<00:06:49.120> are

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
it just do that four times and you are

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.870 
it just do that four times and you are
set<00:06:49.510> and<00:06:49.960> that<00:06:50.110> is<00:06:50.290> a<00:06:50.320> whole<00:06:51.310> lot<00:06:51.370> better<00:06:51.729> than

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
set and that is a whole lot better than

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:57.150 
set and that is a whole lot better than
this<00:06:52.180> a<00:06:54.120> whole<00:06:55.120> lot<00:06:55.360> better<00:06:55.570> so<00:06:55.840> maybe<00:06:56.830> now<00:06:57.100> the

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 
this a whole lot better so maybe now the

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.920 
this a whole lot better so maybe now the
kids<00:06:57.669> will<00:06:57.910> want<00:06:58.150> to<00:06:58.240> ride<00:06:58.390> the<00:06:58.600> old<00:06:58.630> man's

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
kids will want to ride the old man's

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.930 
kids will want to ride the old man's
skateboard<00:06:59.410> again<00:06:59.580> when<00:07:00.580> they<00:07:00.700> see<00:07:00.760> it

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:00.940 
skateboard again when they see it

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.539 
skateboard again when they see it
sitting<00:07:01.120> in<00:07:01.210> the<00:07:01.330> garage
