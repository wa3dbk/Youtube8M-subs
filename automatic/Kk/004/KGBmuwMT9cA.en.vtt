00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
called spring round one word and you can

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.189 
called spring round one word and you can
find<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.369> for<00:00:17.400> 99<00:00:18.000> cents<00:00:18.390> under<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.840> bigboss

repo now this one is actually really

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.630 
repo now this one is actually really
cool<00:00:21.420> what<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.020> does<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.289> allows<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.340> set

cool what it does is allows you to set

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.849 
cool what it does is allows you to set
an<00:00:23.789> activator<00:00:24.269> option<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.869> create<00:00:25.050> an<00:00:25.320> overlay

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
an activator option to create an overlay

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.859 
an activator option to create an overlay
of<00:00:25.890> your<00:00:26.250> springboard<00:00:26.699> from<00:00:26.939> within<00:00:27.330> any

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
of your springboard from within any

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.169 
of your springboard from within any
application<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:29.189> let's<00:00:29.340> go<00:00:29.460> ahead<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.730> go

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
application so let's go ahead and go

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.820 
application so let's go ahead and go
into<00:00:30.300> an<00:00:30.480> application<00:00:31.019> like<00:00:31.050> settings<00:00:31.590> here

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
into an application like settings here

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.740 
into an application like settings here
and<00:00:32.040> we're<00:00:32.610> already<00:00:32.759> within<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.329> settings<00:00:33.540> of

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
and we're already within the settings of

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.479 
and we're already within the settings of
spring<00:00:34.050> round<00:00:34.260> but<00:00:34.649> let's<00:00:34.829> go<00:00:34.950> ahead<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.250> see

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
spring round but let's go ahead and see

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.340 
spring round but let's go ahead and see
what<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:36.149> can<00:00:36.329> do<00:00:36.480> when<00:00:36.630> we<00:00:36.809> double<00:00:37.140> tap<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
what we can do when we double tap the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.049 
what we can do when we double tap the
status<00:00:37.860> bar<00:00:37.890> which<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.550> activation

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
status bar which is the activation

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.389 
status bar which is the activation
method<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.930> set<00:00:40.260> for<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.190> let's<00:00:41.340> go

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
method that I set for this so let's go

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.889 
method that I set for this so let's go
ahead<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.579> double<00:00:41.850> tap<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.030> status<00:00:42.540> bar<00:00:42.570> and

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
ahead and double tap the status bar and

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.020 
ahead and double tap the status bar and
as<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.379> can<00:00:43.500> see<00:00:43.530> my<00:00:43.829> springboard<00:00:44.219> pops<00:00:44.670> up<00:00:44.879> I

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
as you can see my springboard pops up I

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.220 
as you can see my springboard pops up I
can<00:00:45.210> go<00:00:45.300> ahead<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.510> open<00:00:45.960> up<00:00:46.050> other

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
can go ahead and open up other

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.049 
can go ahead and open up other
applications<00:00:46.980> if<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.219> really<00:00:47.489> wanted<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.910> like

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
applications if I really wanted to like

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.760 
applications if I really wanted to like
the<00:00:48.239> camera<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.899> switches<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.350> that

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
the camera and it switches to that

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.130 
the camera and it switches to that
application<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:51.059> whichever<00:00:51.449> application

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
application for whichever application

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.840 
application for whichever application
you<00:00:52.230> really<00:00:52.500> want<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.800> do<00:00:52.949> just<00:00:53.579> wanted<00:00:53.789> to

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
you really want to do just wanted to

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.279 
you really want to do just wanted to
test<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.149> out<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.480> springboard<00:00:54.870> there<00:00:55.110> but

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
test it out on the springboard there but

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.330 
test it out on the springboard there but
let's<00:00:55.440> go<00:00:55.559> ahead<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.829> go<00:00:55.890> back<00:00:55.920> into<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
let's go ahead and go back into the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.580 
let's go ahead and go back into the
settings<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.210> can<00:00:57.239> go<00:00:57.480> ahead<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.719> choose<00:00:58.289> app

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
settings you can go ahead and choose app

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.680 
settings you can go ahead and choose app
interaction<00:00:59.520> so<00:00:59.820> when<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.239> go<00:01:00.390> ahead<00:01:00.510> and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
interaction so when you go ahead and

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.959 
interaction so when you go ahead and
turn<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.829> still<00:01:02.160> interact<00:01:02.550> with

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
turn that on you can still interact with

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.390 
turn that on you can still interact with
the<00:01:03.090> application<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> back<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.650> let's<00:01:05.189> go

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
the application in the back so let's go

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.100 
the application in the back so let's go
into<00:01:05.580> my<00:01:05.790> spotlight<00:01:06.299> here<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.869> go<00:01:07.020> ahead

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
into my spotlight here I can go ahead

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.170 
into my spotlight here I can go ahead
and<00:01:07.439> open<00:01:07.710> up<00:01:07.950> activation<00:01:08.640> method<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
and open up activation method in the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.880 
and open up activation method in the

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
you really wanted to from within any

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.370 
you really wanted to from within any
application<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.689> actually<00:01:37.350> really

interaction<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.530> suggest<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.130> guys<00:01:56.369> do<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
interaction I suggest you guys do the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.850 
interaction I suggest you guys do the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
same thing because it really gets in the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.440

way and you accidentally tap things in

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.940 
way and you accidentally tap things in
the<00:02:00.509> back<00:02:00.630> when<00:02:00.869> you're<00:02:00.990> trying<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.320> tap<00:02:01.530> one
