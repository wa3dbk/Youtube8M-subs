period<00:00:09.019> on<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.230> planet<00:00:10.740> was<00:00:11.490> designed<00:00:12.349> to

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
period on the planet was designed to

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.379 
period on the planet was designed to
keep<00:00:13.769> humanity<00:00:14.340> in<00:00:14.849> terms<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.269> the

keep humanity in terms of the
consciousness<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:16.289> humanity<00:00:16.760> aligned<00:00:17.760> with

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
consciousness of humanity aligned with

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.650 
consciousness of humanity aligned with
their<00:00:18.900> for<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.380> dimensional<00:00:20.480> action<00:00:21.480> comes

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
their for the dimensional action comes

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.050 
their for the dimensional action comes
and<00:00:23.420> it<00:00:24.420> did<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.529> way<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.670> calendar

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
and it did so in a way that the calendar

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.750 
and it did so in a way that the calendar
was<00:00:27.449> pretty<00:00:27.840> much<00:00:28.080> basically<00:00:28.619> designed<00:00:29.429> about

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
was pretty much basically designed about

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.820 
was pretty much basically designed about
a<00:00:29.789> feminine<00:00:30.420> principle<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:31.199> connected<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
a feminine principle that connected the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.479 
a feminine principle that connected the
consciousness<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.700> humanity<00:00:33.290> with<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.649> 22<00:00:35.040> of

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
consciousness of humanity with the 22 of

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.410 
consciousness of humanity with the 22 of
telepathic<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.420> psychic<00:00:36.899> cycles<00:00:37.860> and

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
telepathic and psychic cycles and

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.330 
telepathic and psychic cycles and
characteristics<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> world<00:00:40.160> so<00:00:41.160> it

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
characteristics of the world so it

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.910 
characteristics of the world so it
wasn't<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.790> lot<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.270> we<00:00:42.420> had<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.050> done<00:00:43.320> just

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
wasn't a lot that we had and done just

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.060 
wasn't a lot that we had and done just
by<00:00:44.100> following<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.910> certain<00:00:46.070> Newman

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.640 
know about 44 45 bc became the Julian
calendar<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:01.760> that<00:01:02.760> took<00:01:03.120> us<00:01:03.329> from<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
calendar and that took us from the

calendar and that took us from the
motorcycle<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.909> know<00:01:06.090> which<00:01:06.270> was<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> more

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
motorcycle you know which was a more

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.649 
motorcycle you know which was a more
sick<00:01:07.110> spiracle<00:01:07.950> cycle<00:01:08.400> into<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> very<00:01:09.030> very

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
sick spiracle cycle into a very very

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.929 
sick spiracle cycle into a very very
projection<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.640> reality<00:01:12.409> and<00:01:13.409> which<00:01:13.939> change

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
projection of reality and which change

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.840 
projection of reality and which change
the<00:01:15.210> whole<00:01:15.420> nature<00:01:15.830> our<00:01:17.240> earthly<00:01:18.240> environment
