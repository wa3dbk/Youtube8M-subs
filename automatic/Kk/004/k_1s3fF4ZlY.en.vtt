00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
know with friends recording gameplays

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.960 
know with friends recording gameplays
perspectives<00:01:54.259> editing<00:01:55.040> together<00:01:55.399> some

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
perspectives editing together some

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.700 
perspectives editing together some
little<00:01:56.210> overlay<00:01:56.689> which<00:01:56.899> one<00:01:57.320> of<00:01:57.350> my<00:01:57.409> friends

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
little overlay which one of my friends

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.710 
little overlay which one of my friends
made<00:01:57.890> for<00:01:58.100> me<00:01:58.250> and<00:01:58.430> just<00:01:59.090> all<00:01:59.270> that<00:01:59.420> kind<00:01:59.659> of

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
made for me and just all that kind of

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.810 
made for me and just all that kind of
stuff<00:01:59.780> putting<00:02:00.380> it<00:02:00.500> all<00:02:00.619> together<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:01.280> this

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
stuff putting it all together and this

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.800 
stuff putting it all together and this
is<00:02:01.880> something<00:02:02.060> I'm<00:02:02.299> definitely<00:02:02.450> gonna<00:02:02.720> be

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
is something I'm definitely gonna be

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.289 
is something I'm definitely gonna be
doing<00:02:03.200> more<00:02:03.530> often<00:02:03.979> of<00:02:04.729> course<00:02:04.939> if<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:05.149> guys

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
doing more often of course if you guys

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.569 
doing more often of course if you guys
enjoy<00:02:05.719> kind<00:02:06.380> of<00:02:06.530> switching<00:02:07.009> from<00:02:07.159> person<00:02:07.520> to

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
enjoy kind of switching from person to

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.639 
enjoy kind of switching from person to
person<00:02:07.610> when<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.780> action<00:02:09.110> is<00:02:09.200> going<00:02:09.440> on<00:02:09.470> but

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
person when the action is going on but

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.410 
person when the action is going on but
this<00:02:09.769> was<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:09.979> particularly<00:02:10.399> slow<00:02:10.940> gameplay

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
this was a particularly slow gameplay

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.900 
this was a particularly slow gameplay
from<00:02:11.480> each<00:02:11.780> player's<00:02:12.110> perspective<00:02:12.519> so<00:02:13.519> I<00:02:13.549> kind

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
from each player's perspective so I kind

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.150 
from each player's perspective so I kind
of<00:02:13.940> increased<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.510> pace<00:02:14.690> by<00:02:14.989> just<00:02:15.290> jumping

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
of increased the pace by just jumping

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160 
of increased the pace by just jumping
around<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.760> it's<00:02:17.180> all<00:02:17.330> real<00:02:17.569> time<00:02:17.840> as<00:02:17.989> well

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
around and it's all real time as well

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.540 
around and it's all real time as well
which<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.560> think<00:02:18.739> it's<00:02:18.830> kind<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.040> cool<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:19.280> see

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
which I think it's kind of cool you see

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.260 
which I think it's kind of cool you see
someone<00:02:19.760> running<00:02:19.849> into<00:02:20.239> a<00:02:20.300> building<00:02:20.660> then<00:02:21.050> it

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
someone running into a building then it

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.820 
someone running into a building then it
to<00:02:21.540> another<00:02:21.750> player<00:02:21.990> here<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.410> can<00:02:22.560> see<00:02:22.710> on

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
to another player here you can see on

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.990 
to another player here you can see on
the<00:02:22.890> mini-map<00:02:23.100> is<00:02:23.340> already<00:02:23.610> in<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.760> building

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
the mini-map is already in the building

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.820 
the mini-map is already in the building
so<00:02:24.660> this<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:24.960> something<00:02:25.110> quite<00:02:25.320> cool<00:02:25.620> i'm

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
so this is something quite cool i'm

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.130 
so this is something quite cool i'm
going<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.130> be<00:02:26.250> employing<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.480> future<00:02:27.930> in

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
going to be employing in the future in

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.830 
going to be employing in the future in
team<00:02:28.380> random<00:02:28.740> weapon<00:02:29.040> gameplays<00:02:29.460> so<00:02:30.450> yeah<00:02:30.690> we

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
team random weapon gameplays so yeah we

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.990 
team random weapon gameplays so yeah we
finally<00:02:31.320> got<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:32.130> team<00:02:32.400> combat<00:02:32.760> gameplay

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
finally got this team combat gameplay

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.240 
finally got this team combat gameplay
which<00:02:33.270> I'm<00:02:33.390> really<00:02:33.750> happy<00:02:33.930> about<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:35.070> don't

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
which I'm really happy about and I don't

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.800 
which I'm really happy about and I don't
think<00:02:35.550> we're<00:02:35.850> going<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.060> be<00:02:36.150> stepping<00:02:36.540> up<00:02:36.660> to

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
think we're going to be stepping up to

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.950 
think we're going to be stepping up to
7,000<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.950> would<00:02:38.100> require<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.640> 15<00:02:39.420> kill<00:02:39.810> death

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
7,000 that would require a 15 kill death

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.680 
7,000 that would require a 15 kill death
ratio<00:02:40.050> from<00:02:41.010> each<00:02:41.340> player<00:02:41.940> let<00:02:42.300> me<00:02:42.450> just

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
ratio from each player let me just

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.590 
ratio from each player let me just
quickly<00:02:42.810> do<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.170> math<00:02:43.500> in<00:02:43.680> my<00:02:43.710> head<00:02:44.120> yup<00:02:45.120> 15

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
quickly do the math in my head yup 15

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.020 
quickly do the math in my head yup 15
kill<00:02:45.780> death<00:02:45.930> ratio<00:02:46.020> so<00:02:46.710> player<00:02:47.160> 2<00:02:47.280> player<00:02:47.610> 15

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
kill death ratio so player 2 player 15

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.460 
kill death ratio so player 2 player 15
kill<00:02:48.210> death<00:02:48.360> ratio<00:02:48.480> aren't<00:02:48.990> easy<00:02:49.140> things<00:02:49.410> to

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
kill death ratio aren't easy things to

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.260 
kill death ratio aren't easy things to
pull<00:02:49.680> off<00:02:49.770> let<00:02:49.980> alone<00:02:50.130> as<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.340> whole<00:02:50.550> team<00:02:50.760> you

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
pull off let alone as a whole team you

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.880 
pull off let alone as a whole team you
never<00:02:51.480> know<00:02:51.570> I<00:02:51.720> might<00:02:51.840> pick<00:02:52.290> up<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.500> full-on

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
never know I might pick up a full-on

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.310 
never know I might pick up a full-on
beast<00:02:53.400> team<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.150> give<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.690> attempt<00:02:55.050> at<00:02:55.140> some

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
beast team and give that attempt at some

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.930 
beast team and give that attempt at some
point<00:02:55.560> in<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.740> future<00:02:55.770> but<00:02:56.250> not<00:02:56.490> anytime<00:02:56.730> soon

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
point in the future but not anytime soon

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.670 
point in the future but not anytime soon
I<00:02:57.440> think<00:02:58.440> this<00:02:59.090> gameplay<00:03:00.090> has<00:03:00.570> killed<00:03:01.050> off<00:03:01.320> my

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
I think this gameplay has killed off my

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.180 
I think this gameplay has killed off my
love<00:03:02.070> for<00:03:02.310> mw3<00:03:02.760> as<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.180> game<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.890> you<00:03:04.890> know<00:03:05.010> it's
