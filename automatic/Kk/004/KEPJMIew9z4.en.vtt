00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:15.420
 and hello to all that's all back then 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.100
 we find ourselves today for the big 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.189
 xy contest 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.660
 kim in shock want I have a little doubt about 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.550
 the fact is what I have the right to 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.160
 to make this backlash paper youtube I 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.439
 contacted my caregiver by 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.990
 my networker what is taking care of my 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.180
 chain and the person she told me 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.160
 it is asma sadoun those who know 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.039
 maybe you even go to me 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.780
 replied that, in principle, nothing prevents 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:42.629
 to make a contest it's just that he does 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.210
 must not claim the flute 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.620
 comments things like that when 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.090
 priori there would not be anything that 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.090
 would prevent after was not sure 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.059
 from her to 1000% since my last 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.559
 contest people in art donates a 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.210
 little doubt turn into doubt 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.699
 listen to me I take the risk if my 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.170
 chain takes a beating strike that's 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.839
 anyway we bring them second 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.129
 logically we'll see if the 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.380
 string is removed and cause that and 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.670
 I'm sorry, I'm taking a 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.660
 risk because I want to want to 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.880
 do what I want on my channel that 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.470
 I've been doing a web for several years 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.160
 several months yeah I think that 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.230
 I'm doing these competitions 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.700
 I like it a lot because I do 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.840
 competitions different from others it's 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.550
 to say that I leave you commented 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.930
 as many times as you want and that 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.830
 do I read very things 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.970
 interesting I'm learning a lot of 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.280
 things thanks to bout when sometimes not 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.110
 really and when we really lose a 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.190
 little weird sometimes but you talk 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.690
 between you and everything is so 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.890
 I learn things about pokemon on 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.080
 about everyday life at all and 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.420
 I like it I like it it's a pleasure 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.980
 and suddenly I decided to try it 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.180
 contest it goes so much better 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.680
 three months we will be traffic so I 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.610
 will show you the lots and then 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.760
 you will explain the terms then 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.140
 lots are a little bit more 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.490
 that in 1st time not very cool here I try 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.180
 to make lots a little more acceptable 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.100
 for my purse we will say then we will 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.510
 start so there will be three winners 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.590
 now it will always be like that 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.430
 so the third will win a booster 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.290
 so of his choice 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.840
 so here I show you the four have 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.520
 not the 4 to a booster of his choice so 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.190
 I show you one for example take 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.100
 third winner get boost what I 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.300
 put it together with a holographic of 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.830
 his choice and I'm going to enjoy it for 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.760
 show you all donations 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.290
 that they had 18 well 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.930
 because it's good holographic 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.130
 so I'm going to you during this contest I 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.980
 shows you the other graphs ya 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.020
 like that we have to release all here I 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.900
 passes quickly and logically in the 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.459
 comments do not hesitate to tell me 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.370
 will there be the holography you have 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.690
 favorite you want to spend quickly 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.709
 it's not the purpose of the video but I 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.300
 wanted to show the one 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:46.360
 this is a magnificent building kept for the 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.360
 end 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.080
 she is beautiful of the less beautiful and 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.510
 me this one is my favorite I know 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.769
 not why it's flattering 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.150
 I already said but I also love 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.200
 resume facing the very pretty by 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.330
 example but the snake that I love 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.250
 beautiful here is the third is 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.049
 there a booster is an ode to choose from 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.340
 the 18 here I was at least one 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.709
 duplicate times so talk about 18 he 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.989
 will choose lolo graph of the contribution in 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.760
 end of his dreams or whatever 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:19.790
 second will also win a booster 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.750
 so here are the first the second and 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.519
 third win every two years 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.400
 booster but will win this time two 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.150
 cars so for example the 3rd will win 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.150
 this water 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.700
 if he chooses this one and the game puts you 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.900
 both since that people prefer 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.450
 often saw the harbor or that people 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.030
 like too 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.940
 for example the 3rd the second thanks to a 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.880
 booster and zola is the big winner 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.030
 him first here is the first one the 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.170
 best more lucky keira two 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.760
 boosters so the same has always 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.590
 illustration to choose here I bought 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.549
 4 booster in store to be able to 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.770
 to redo what I did not have 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.209
 in principle I want to receive a small 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.150
 little still maybe a display that I 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.489
 ask the unit 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.530
 finally normally jean marc and other to 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.500
 to eat in others we will see two 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.129
 boosters to choose so for example from there 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:12.310
 as well as the rare lute of his choice 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:17.350
 between these two there between primo cup 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:19.389
 ex I'm going to put there and took my good tone 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.100
 ex or doubt it was this one 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.930
 why this one as usual I 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.930
 always offers you the series card 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.100
 the flagship card of the series there in 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.960
 the occurrence that flagship map of the 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.510
 series there are two is the idea so 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.479
 here is the winner will choose two boosters 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.639
 who preferred boost to prefer so 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.710
 that one of the two primo I did say one 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.940
 of both the one he prefers to handle two 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.360
 in double face to the young and even three 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.000
 times I believe 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.520
 and here is the one they prefer 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.520
 I personally prefer the club 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.860
 so here are the ways to participate 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.940
 are in the description so thanks for 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.430
 read the description 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.449
 after I wanted to say orally so in 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.740
 principle is not right of you 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.090
 ask to like any comment in 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.320
 what after that is your ethics 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.120
 you who see if you like to work 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.900
 or not that it does not matter all that I 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.380
 ask you is to put a 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.510
 comment 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.800
 and so that I can choose what 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.750
 you put no comments I want 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.520
 not pick a winner so you put 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.979
 as many comments as you 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.210
 like as usual just when 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.740
 you put a comment you expect 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.050
 that someone comments after you for 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.550
 power rpt commented otherwise it makes the 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.110
 spam 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.580

 contest the contest dates are in 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.599

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.860
