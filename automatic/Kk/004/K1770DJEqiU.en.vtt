00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.039
 well the year 1851 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:12.919
 it was not held 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:14.169
 in darlington 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:19.119
 a so to speak the first international chess tournament in history 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:20.449
 obviously 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.450
 in order to economize the means the tournament did not develop per day but 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.230
 by a system of eliminatory 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.550
 however here follows the best players 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.499
 of that time 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.660
 interview of the German actor adolfo andersen 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.120
 in the first round he had 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.150
 the east we will face chf my 15 years notebook 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.540
 I sell games and tied one a winner of the match 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.719
 6 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.870
 I hope in the following days both will play a series of matches 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.430
 friendly 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.190
 in which xx imposed by the new nation's 5 advantage of this defeats 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.550
 i a two draws 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.450
 however in these friendly matches one always came out 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.200
 triumphant the president if they wish 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.060
 if it is chosen for example it does the one that was commissioned to transmit by 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.060
 scheduled telegraphs call it regantes 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.750
 and in that case this was included 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.930
 started one of the masterpieces 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.360
 from andersen 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.360
 he knew as the immortal 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.940
 white gone 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.940
 when sacrificing two towers 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.070
 good 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.070
 let's start the game started with 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.060
 the scope of the region 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.430
 a torture 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.430
 very popular at that time 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.520
 like black 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.430
 obviously sacrifice and material in the first phase of the concert and if it was a 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.260
 symptom 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.220
 tasteful to use it 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.010
 a sign to the contrary 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.850
 mkhize 4 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.899
 he knew it as the variant of the film and 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.300
 and the neo responds with 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.919
 ladies c 4 hunt 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.069

 clubs like the horse does not go petrescu rolón vara in 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.769
 the areas king normalized and of saleh 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.909
 deserves to grow and sing is that most of 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.779
 the idea of ​​playing the fise four feet 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:32.159
 winner of the piero 4 regret Cuba plan 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.319

 an easel three points and andorra 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.960
 but cuba to lose 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.279
 Dew 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:46.719
 in ladies and 4 jacksons could be an option 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:49.579
 of five plays the black 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.669
 a play 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:55.669
 a the pivot deflect the sil 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.919
 I dedicated that it is pointing to the box f7 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.239
 but it's really about a 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.260
 what's wrong with the environment is not implemented 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.179
 cross 1 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:11.179
 about Peronism 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:16.230
 the black plays an easel 6 the white 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.179
 your time wins the purchase and between 3 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:21.159
 in January he plays

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.439
 ladies of five 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:25.799
 touching him 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.159
 1 bishop of 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:29.449

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.299
 must 5 no it would not be very good 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.839
 Lamco simply 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:37.169
 continues with its development not 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:38.630
 the leak of five is 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.349
 pretty strong 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.040
 picasso for example the sectors of three 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.470
 ramón pérez expressed changes in the laws 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.399

 it will touch torrevejense 8 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.809
 the defense target something that has been most active is to play dig and disaster 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:59.609
 for example 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.739

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:06.590
 give me two 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.049
 for example 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.349
 Kiev 4 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.009

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:16.430
 club 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.309

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.740
 the white k is can defend your tower a position sun 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.580

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.999
 tower for h4 pesos 

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:40.159
 spot 6 threatening a draw was left alone 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.009
 he defends 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:44.789
 take the plan pawn 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.009
 all with tower 1 this occurred in 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.479
 in a game, the theme for trades 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.279
 is 5 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:56.909
 a federal horse 408 che 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:02.099
 he went white to stop us he does not agree 1 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.159
 with this area a procedure 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:07.029
 damage 3 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:09.729
 if it fits for the 4 and public 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.059
 Ghana 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:14.059
 the deposed plays 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.689
 It was done and 5 a 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:18.509
 a happening 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:20.330
 a dark game 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.119
 in the tour the monarch that your life at the moment threatens immediate 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:27.999
 cavallo g 3 jun 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.150
 but you could rich or continue fisher 5 1 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.569
 I would follow four 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:39.169
 sector profile expressed well of seven 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:40.779
 profile of three 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.710
 it is uncomfortable h4 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.169
 VECTOR G8 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:46.559
 an old man is 

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:49.709
 quite with its five and complicated not 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:55.000
 I think it's going to say 4 the plan corresponds 1 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.569
 with the same 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:00.589
 idealism times in that move tadeo g3 defends here 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:03.550
 it is no longer possible 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.830
 nevertheless sme was preferable 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.520
 since each fact four play 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.300
 Towers secured 1 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.300
 Viktor that this move threatens 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:19.219
 4 

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:22.860
 I saw after discussing example 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.150
 a stretch of 6 1 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.830
 playing in the film 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.159
 siyaka disasters simply 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:32.159

 white however clear 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:41.270

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.629
 the tournament 

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:45.869
 I wanted niki 

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:47.789
 Then he said that 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:50.789

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.039
 c 6 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:02.580
 and the 15 4 not suddenly 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.430
 regal j 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.080
 every axis 2 oct 26 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.770
 bush one more than three but the mco 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.289
 it's very good 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:16.319
 a workshop of five plays a loan December can get five 

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:18.639
 apart to continue with 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.680
 cavalli five points 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.399
 since the anuies imposed 

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:25.710

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:34.939
 an agreement 

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:36.599
 the horizontal 

00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:39.069
 a small time that defends itself
