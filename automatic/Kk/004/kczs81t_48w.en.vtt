00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.250
 the controversial episode of the final series 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.230
 fantasy xiii was mostly criticized by 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.670
 its lack of ancillary activities and its 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.250
 famous hallway that have reduced the appearance 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.230
 exploration a set of problems that 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.930
 his final direct sequel fantasy xiii-2 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.040
 tries to solve two years later for 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.900
 this the game starts with changing 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.359
 totally his casting by putting us 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.710
 at christmas's controls and squeezed the 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.809
 first is a hunter come from the future 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.820
 go through the valhalla where he met 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.040
 the famous lightning today worn 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.360
 missing the second character and the 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.830
 sister of that same lightning who 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.659
 try to find it, no matter what 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.860
 a duo that works well and who 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:47.229
 will remain in this form 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.760
 until the end of the game indeed no 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:50.379
 other character will come to join 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.909
 you except during a few fights 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.860
 major in the form of wink 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.299
 however you can now 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.739
 enlist monsters in your team 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:58.570
 for him you seconds in the 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.010
 fighting these can more or 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.260
 less evolved according to objects 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.729
 chosen and has capabilities that he 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.710
 is possible to exchange during mergers 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.479
 so it's easy by sacrificing everything from 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.880
 even one of the two creatures of 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.140
 create quite versatile monsters a 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.880
 addition that bring a little more 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.810
 customization and that allows to manage at 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.969
 better his team 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.770
 each animal has a role 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:19.780
 important and it is imperative to good 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.420
 think of his strategy by integrating his 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.799
 group 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.210
 the combat system is similar time 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.740
 to that of final fantasy xiii 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.570
 so you have to juggle 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.270
 jobs to take advantage of weaknesses 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.890
 of the opponent 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.450
 still very effective this system is 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.479
 now faster with the lack of 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.289
 transition between role changes 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.640
 unfortunately this new intensity 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.560
 closes the clashes in 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.700
 less than a minute and even fighting 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.979
 against bosses are often too much 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.509
 expeditious fault also besides 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.429
 to an evolution curve really 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.319
 weird the main characters 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.270
 actually reach the maximum 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.979
 of their abilities and once the level 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.719
 five years exceed these 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.100
 do not learn much anymore 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:57.780
 pleasant feeling of progression 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.189
 so stop very quickly even if 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.700
 some additional fights brought from the 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.219
 challenge 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.539
 a real frustration appears in 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.069
 revenge square enix did indeed 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.479
 respected its specifications at 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.590
 level of side quests and 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.660
 much larger maps 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.280
 many pnj gives you indeed 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.049
 missions to be made to win 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.799
 useful fragments to discover from 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.750
 new era 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.160
 a good opportunity to recover from 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.349
 new objects and discover others 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.700
 in the scenario the exploration is therefore 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.470
 at the appointment with areas that 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.670
 has more branches and 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.050
 especially interactions with 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.940
 the environment 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.010
 final fantasy xiii 2 is so a copy 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.690
 reviewed and corrected both at the level of 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.250
 gameplay as staging and 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.030
 writing characters a lot 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.030
 better built 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.320
 the note that welcomed 16 out of 20
