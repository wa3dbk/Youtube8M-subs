00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
did actually upload it but I guess I had

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.880 
did actually upload it but I guess I had
some<00:00:21.480> rendering<00:00:21.960> problems<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.650> video

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
some rendering problems and the video

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.590 
some rendering problems and the video
quality<00:00:23.220> wasn't<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.850> great<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.300> went<00:00:24.510> back

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
quality wasn't that great so I went back

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.500

I<00:00:24.900> fixed<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.730> problems<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.939> video<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.480> I

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
it up a little bit and try the m16 and

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.620 
it up a little bit and try the m16 and
see<00:02:21.600> how<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.750> works<00:02:21.990> for<00:02:22.230> me<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.880> I<00:02:24.330> have<00:02:24.510> to

see how that works for me and I have to

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.230 
see how that works for me and I have to
say<00:02:24.660> first<00:02:25.650> impressions<00:02:26.220> on<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.340> m16<00:02:26.970> I

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
say first impressions on the m16 I

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.940 
say first impressions on the m16 I
actually<00:02:27.900> haven't<00:02:28.230> used<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.740> much

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
actually haven't used it that much

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.610 
actually haven't used it that much
because<00:02:29.130> I<00:02:29.400> honestly<00:02:29.520> I<00:02:30.140> don't<00:02:31.140> know<00:02:31.320> it's

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
because I honestly I don't know it's

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.260 
because I honestly I don't know it's
definitely<00:02:32.100> an<00:02:32.160> effective<00:02:32.580> gun<00:02:32.850> but<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.060> just

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
definitely an effective gun but I just

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.180 
definitely an effective gun but I just
don't<00:02:33.420> think<00:02:33.540> it's<00:02:33.780> as<00:02:33.990> effective<00:02:34.620> as<00:02:34.860> like

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
don't think it's as effective as like

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.970 
don't think it's as effective as like
the<00:02:35.490> previous<00:02:35.760> Call<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.210> Duty's<00:02:36.540> like<00:02:36.720> in<00:02:36.980> cod4

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
the previous Call of Duty's like in cod4

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.640 
the previous Call of Duty's like in cod4
or<00:02:38.640> mono<00:02:39.180> warfare<00:02:39.540> two<00:02:39.750> was<00:02:40.080> definitely<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.530> lot

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
or mono warfare two was definitely a lot

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.260 
or mono warfare two was definitely a lot
more<00:02:40.710> effective<00:02:41.280> because<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.580> had<00:02:41.730> stopping

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
more effective because you had stopping

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.260 
more effective because you had stopping
power<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.920> could<00:02:44.100> get<00:02:44.250> like<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.550> way<00:02:45.120> no<00:02:45.180> one

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
power so you could get like a way no one

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.380 
power so you could get like a way no one
burst<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.620> guy<00:02:46.740> will<00:02:46.800> go<00:02:46.980> down<00:02:47.220> but<00:02:48.210> send

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
burst and the guy will go down but send

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.700 
burst and the guy will go down but send
some<00:02:48.510> black<00:02:48.720> ops<00:02:48.960> it<00:02:49.140> takes<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:49.410> many<00:02:49.500> more

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
some black ops it takes so many more

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.970 
some black ops it takes so many more
bullets<00:02:50.300> usually<00:02:51.300> you<00:02:52.140> can<00:02:52.350> still<00:02:52.650> get<00:02:52.770> those

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
bullets usually you can still get those

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.880 
bullets usually you can still get those
one<00:02:53.250> shot<00:02:53.550> burst<00:02:53.970> or<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.420> one<00:02:54.810> kill<00:02:55.620> burst

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
one shot burst or a one kill burst

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.910 
one shot burst or a one kill burst
however<00:02:56.460> you<00:02:56.580> want<00:02:56.640> word<00:02:56.910> that<00:02:57.150> but<00:02:58.020> you<00:02:58.800> know

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
however you want word that but you know

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.440 
however you want word that but you know
it<00:02:59.070> sometimes<00:02:59.460> it<00:02:59.580> takes<00:02:59.700> two<00:02:59.970> depending<00:03:00.360> on

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
it sometimes it takes two depending on

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
it sometimes it takes two depending on
where<00:03:00.570> you<00:03:00.660> hit<00:03:00.780> them<00:03:00.900> on<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:00.990> body<00:03:01.260> if<00:03:01.440> you

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
where you hit them on the body if you

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.690 
where you hit them on the body if you
hit<00:03:01.590> them<00:03:01.650> like<00:03:01.740> in<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:01.980> upper<00:03:02.190> chest<00:03:02.490> or<00:03:02.640> the

the<00:03:57.780> connection<00:03:58.590> in<00:03:58.680> this<00:03:58.830> game<00:03:59.040> is<00:03:59.600> just

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
the connection in this game is just

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.160 
the connection in this game is just
ridiculous<00:04:01.290> like<00:04:01.470> it's<00:04:01.650> either<00:04:02.060> it<00:04:03.060> I<00:04:03.510> want<00:04:04.050> to

save this game right now it's definitely
very<00:04:08.580> connection<00:04:09.240> base<00:04:09.480> like<00:04:09.750> if<00:04:09.870> you<00:04:09.990> don't

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
very connection base like if you don't

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.290 
very connection base like if you don't
have<00:04:10.470> a<00:04:10.500> good<00:04:10.740> connection<00:04:10.920> you're<00:04:11.910> probably

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
have a good connection you're probably

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.650 
have a good connection you're probably
not<00:04:12.570> gonna<00:04:12.690> do<00:04:12.930> well<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:13.530> that's<00:04:14.010> you<00:04:14.520> know

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
not gonna do well and that's you know

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.320 
not gonna do well and that's you know
neither<00:04:15.660> your<00:04:16.020> fault<00:04:16.320> or<00:04:16.620> does<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:18.060> enemy

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
neither your fault or does the enemy

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.210 
neither your fault or does the enemy
teams<00:04:18.600> fault<00:04:18.930> like<00:04:19.230> whoever<00:04:19.859> just<00:04:20.070> has<00:04:20.190> a

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
teams fault like whoever just has a

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.250 
teams fault like whoever just has a
better<00:04:20.489> connection<00:04:20.820> is<00:04:21.209> a<00:04:21.239> most<00:04:21.870> likely<00:04:22.140> gonna

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
better connection is a most likely gonna

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.950 
better connection is a most likely gonna
do<00:04:22.470> better<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:23.400> it<00:04:24.270> says<00:04:24.420> to<00:04:24.510> take<00:04:24.660> so<00:04:24.870> many

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
do better and it says to take so many

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.630 
do better and it says to take so many
more<00:04:25.170> bullets<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.590> kill<00:04:25.620> somebody<00:04:26.070> you<00:04:26.460> know

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
more bullets to kill somebody you know

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.730 
more bullets to kill somebody you know
you<00:04:26.700> really<00:04:26.940> rely<00:04:27.330> on<00:04:27.510> having<00:04:27.630> a<00:04:28.020> host<00:04:28.500> in<00:04:28.710> the

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:18.069 
pack up with like a 7 sensitivity and I

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:20.849 
pack up with like a 7 sensitivity and I
could<00:05:18.339> not<00:05:18.489> you<00:05:19.419> know<00:05:19.539> aim<00:05:19.839> for<00:05:19.869> shit<00:05:20.439> I<00:05:20.619> would

a<00:05:20.889> my<00:05:21.819> bullet<00:05:22.179> for<00:05:22.329> this<00:05:22.419> going<00:05:22.719> everywhere

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
a my bullet for this going everywhere

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:24.809 
a my bullet for this going everywhere
and<00:05:23.379> I<00:05:23.439> started<00:05:23.919> off<00:05:24.039> really<00:05:24.219> bad<00:05:24.339> until<00:05:24.759> I

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
and I started off really bad until I

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:27.359 
and I started off really bad until I
realized<00:05:25.329> I<00:05:25.689> had<00:05:26.169> to<00:05:26.229> bring<00:05:26.349> my<00:05:26.439> sensitivity

00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:27.369 
realized I had to bring my sensitivity

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:28.829 
realized I had to bring my sensitivity
down<00:05:27.669> a<00:05:27.699> little<00:05:27.849> bit<00:05:28.029> and<00:05:28.149> I'm<00:05:28.239> right<00:05:28.449> now<00:05:28.599> I'm

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:33.489 
on the default which i believe is like a

00:05:33.489 --> 00:05:35.909 
on the default which i believe is like a
three<00:05:34.049> or<00:05:35.049> maybe<00:05:35.169> a<00:05:35.319> 2<00:05:35.529> i'm<00:05:35.679> not<00:05:35.799> really

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
three or maybe a 2 i'm not really

far oh it's very accurate and if I can

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:44.279 
far oh it's very accurate and if I can
compare<00:06:42.819> it<00:06:42.849> to<00:06:43.119> any<00:06:43.269> gun<00:06:43.569> from<00:06:43.749> a<00:06:43.869> previous

call duty this gun is the ACR of black
ops<00:06:49.329> like<00:06:49.779> the<00:06:50.739> accuracies<00:06:51.369> there<00:06:51.639> but<00:06:52.389> the

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 
ops like the accuracies there but the

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:55.559 
ops like the accuracies there but the
damage<00:06:52.899> is<00:06:53.139> pretty<00:06:53.739> fairly<00:06:54.279> low<00:06:54.639> so<00:06:54.999> go<00:06:55.299> away

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:55.569 
damage is pretty fairly low so go away

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:57.419 
damage is pretty fairly low so go away
it<00:06:56.079> does<00:06:56.289> take<00:06:56.469> a<00:06:56.499> lot<00:06:56.649> more<00:06:56.709> bullets<00:06:57.129> in<00:06:57.219> a<00:06:57.279> guy

00:06:57.419 --> 00:06:57.429 
it does take a lot more bullets in a guy

00:06:57.429 --> 00:06:59.129 
it does take a lot more bullets in a guy
but<00:06:57.639> the<00:06:57.699> accuracy<00:06:58.209> is<00:06:58.239> just<00:06:58.539> so<00:06:58.719> steady

00:06:59.129 --> 00:06:59.139 
but the accuracy is just so steady

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:00.959 
but the accuracy is just so steady
Charlie<00:06:59.859> that<00:07:00.129> you<00:07:00.249> don't<00:07:00.429> you<00:07:00.639> know<00:07:00.759> miss

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:00.969 
Charlie that you don't you know miss

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:02.310 
Charlie that you don't you know miss
bullets<00:07:01.539> and

bullets and

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.960 
bullets and

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
I get them right in them so it takes a

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.470

there's<00:07:24.040> a<00:07:24.160> for<00:07:24.430> some<00:07:24.580> weird<00:07:24.790> reason<00:07:24.910> they

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:25.300 
there's a for some weird reason they

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.790 
there's a for some weird reason they
don't<00:07:25.420> show<00:07:25.720> the<00:07:25.840> killcams<00:07:26.260> I<00:07:26.410> hope<00:07:26.560> that<00:07:26.680> they

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 
don't show the killcams I hope that they

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.080 
don't show the killcams I hope that they
go<00:07:26.920> back<00:07:27.070> and<00:07:27.280> fix<00:07:27.430> that<00:07:27.610> because<00:07:27.820> I<00:07:27.910> think

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.090 
go back and fix that because I think

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.050
