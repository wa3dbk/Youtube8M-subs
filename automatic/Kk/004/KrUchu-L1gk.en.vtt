we<00:00:00.089> have<00:00:00.179> a<00:00:00.240> total<00:00:00.539> of<00:00:00.599> five<00:00:00.840> options<00:00:01.140> we're

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
we have a total of five options we're

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.110 
we have a total of five options we're
here<00:00:01.770> on<00:00:01.890> one<00:00:02.220> this<00:00:02.429> if<00:00:02.580> you<00:00:02.669> do<00:00:02.790> but<00:00:02.939> at<00:00:03.000> the

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
here on one this if you do but at the

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.769 
here on one this if you do but at the
same<00:00:03.240> time<00:00:03.480> here's<00:00:03.810> two<00:00:04.170> and<00:00:05.060> then<00:00:06.060> I<00:00:06.569> roll

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
same time here's two and then I roll

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:14.320 
same time here's two and then I roll
over<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.170> three<00:00:09.620> one<00:00:10.620> more<00:00:10.769> over<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.160> four<00:00:11.960> and

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
over to three one more over the four and

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.390 
over to three one more over the four and
and<00:00:15.330> finds<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.379> big<00:00:16.529> jump<00:00:16.830> between<00:00:16.949> four<00:00:17.369> and

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
and finds a big jump between four and

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.310 
and finds a big jump between four and
five<00:00:17.550> once<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.090> get<00:00:18.210> tile<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.840> really<00:00:19.050> starts

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
five once you get tile it really starts

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.750 
five once you get tile it really starts
to<00:00:19.910> we<00:00:20.910> have<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.240> garden<00:00:22.020> page<00:00:22.320> right<00:00:22.650> here

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
to we have this garden page right here

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.670 
to we have this garden page right here
my<00:00:23.760> thought<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.300> it's<00:00:24.510> causing<00:00:25.109> less<00:00:25.350> than

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
my thought is it's causing less than

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.950 
my thought is it's causing less than
Eddie<00:00:25.949> or<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.580> Whirlpool<00:00:27.090> current<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.720> here

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
Eddie or the Whirlpool current in here

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.230 
Eddie or the Whirlpool current in here
now<00:00:28.619> slows<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.160> down<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.340> little<00:00:29.550> bit<00:00:29.760> just

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
now slows it down a little bit just

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.659 
now slows it down a little bit just
putting<00:00:31.140> these<00:00:31.260> two<00:00:31.500> pieces<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.160> plywood<00:00:32.460> up

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
putting these two pieces of plywood up

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.490 
putting these two pieces of plywood up
here<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.059> kind<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.329> slosh<00:00:33.660> guard<00:00:34.110> I

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
here is this kind of a slosh guard I

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.700 
here is this kind of a slosh guard I
could<00:00:35.160> always<00:00:35.309> fill<00:00:36.059> more<00:00:36.989> water<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.530> here

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
could always fill more water in here

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.049 
could always fill more water in here
because<00:00:37.950> we're<00:00:38.100> losing<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.460> little<00:00:38.579> bit<00:00:38.700> kind

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
because we're losing a little bit kind

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.380 
because we're losing a little bit kind

it's<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.899> classic<00:00:43.469> 28<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.309> fact<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.730> think<00:00:44.789> 28

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
it's a classic 28 in fact I think 28

it's a classic 28 in fact I think 28
indicates<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.289> amount<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.969> pounds<00:00:47.969> I

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
indicates the amount of pounds I

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.959 
indicates the amount of pounds I
measured<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.809> pounds<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.350> thrust<00:00:49.969> reverse

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
measured in pounds of thrust reverse

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.600 
measured in pounds of thrust reverse
forward<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:52.410> does<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.800> gauge<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.399> here

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
forward it does have a gauge on here

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.189 
forward it does have a gauge on here
just<00:00:53.820> interesting<00:00:54.270> here<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.600> indicates<00:00:55.079> that

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
just interesting here it indicates that

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.319 
just interesting here it indicates that
on<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.500> power<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:56.100> five<00:00:56.370> actual<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.090> right

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
on this power of five actual on right

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.439 
on this power of five actual on right
now<00:00:57.649> they'll<00:00:58.649> go<00:00:58.800> 2.5<00:00:59.670> hours

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
now they'll go 2.5 hours

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.000 
now they'll go 2.5 hours
what's<00:01:01.050> deceiving<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.710> doesn't<00:01:01.829> indicate

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
what's deceiving is it doesn't indicate

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.729 
what's deceiving is it doesn't indicate
the<00:01:02.489> size<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.180> battery<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:04.170> happens<00:01:04.589> to

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
the size of the battery this happens to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.120 
the size of the battery this happens to
be<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:05.129> they<00:01:06.119> call<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> deep<00:01:06.630> cycle<00:01:07.170> battery

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
be a they call a deep cycle battery

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.370 
be a they call a deep cycle battery
which<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.119> what<00:01:09.360> they<00:01:09.450> use<00:01:09.600> more<00:01:09.840> commonly<00:01:10.170> and

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
which is what they use more commonly and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.050 
which is what they use more commonly and
like<00:01:10.500> golf<00:01:10.740> carts<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.159> stuff<00:01:11.369> like<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.729> I

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
like golf carts and stuff like that I

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.000 
like golf carts and stuff like that I
don't<00:01:12.840> know<00:01:12.930> if<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.170> based<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.770> one<00:01:13.979> of

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
don't know if this is based on one of

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.440 
don't know if this is based on one of
those<00:01:14.250> sorts<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.700> batteries<00:01:15.119> which<00:01:15.299> i<00:01:15.390> think

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
those sorts of batteries which i think

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.660 
those sorts of batteries which i think
is<00:01:15.689> encouraged<00:01:16.170> with<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.439> sort<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.710> motor<00:01:16.979> or

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
is encouraged with this sort of motor or

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.380 
is encouraged with this sort of motor or
if<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:19.100> car<00:01:20.100> battery<00:01:20.549> which<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.000> cold

if it's a a car battery which is cold
cranking<00:01:21.659> amps<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.740> my<00:01:22.950> understanding<00:01:23.430> this

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
cranking amps is my understanding this

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.679 
cranking amps is my understanding this
doesn't<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:24.200> too<00:01:25.200> many<00:01:25.320> cold<00:01:25.619> cranking<00:01:25.830> amps

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
doesn't have too many cold cranking amps

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.300 
doesn't have too many cold cranking amps
because<00:01:27.689> it's<00:01:27.869> not<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.619> not<00:01:28.799> required<00:01:29.070> that

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
because it's not it's not required that

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.280 
because it's not it's not required that

I<00:02:01.460> believe<00:02:02.300> we<00:02:02.420> started<00:02:02.840> about<00:02:03.130> 315<00:02:04.130> so<00:02:04.400> here

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
I believe we started about 315 so here

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.430 
I believe we started about 315 so here
now<00:02:04.760> about<00:02:04.940> a<00:02:05.270> little<00:02:05.690> over<00:02:05.870> a<00:02:05.900> half<00:02:06.110> an<00:02:06.290> hour

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
now about a little over a half an hour

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.210 
now about a little over a half an hour
3:45<00:02:07.810> into<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:08.929> it<00:02:09.020> sounds<00:02:09.290> about<00:02:09.560> exactly<00:02:09.920> the

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
3:45 into it it sounds about exactly the

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.980 
3:45 into it it sounds about exactly the
same<00:02:10.490> our<00:02:10.759> water<00:02:11.000> levels<00:02:11.360> fluctuated<00:02:11.960> a

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
same our water levels fluctuated a

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.110 
same our water levels fluctuated a
little<00:02:12.230> bit<00:02:12.380> I<00:02:12.620> haven't<00:02:13.430> added<00:02:13.580> any<00:02:13.940> more

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
little bit I haven't added any more

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.610 
little bit I haven't added any more
water<00:02:14.300> but<00:02:14.660> looks<00:02:14.810> like<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.080> same<00:02:15.260> amount<00:02:15.380> of

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
water but looks like the same amount of

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.830 
water but looks like the same amount of
thrust<00:02:16.150> will<00:02:17.150> go<00:02:17.210> down<00:02:17.360> here<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:17.570> look<00:02:17.690> at

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
thrust will go down here and look at

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.760 
thrust will go down here and look at
this<00:02:17.990> I<00:02:18.850> have<00:02:19.850> noticed<00:02:20.240> this<00:02:20.720> sounds<00:02:21.500> louder

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
this I have noticed this sounds louder

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.010 
this I have noticed this sounds louder
almost<00:02:22.430> like<00:02:22.670> there's<00:02:22.850> more<00:02:23.030> thrust<00:02:23.330> that

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
almost like there's more thrust that

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.290 
almost like there's more thrust that
sounds<00:02:24.440> about<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.709> same<00:02:25.030> I'll<00:02:26.030> have<00:02:26.180> to

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
sounds about the same I'll have to

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.300 
sounds about the same I'll have to
compare<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:27.100> 45<00:02:28.100> minutes<00:02:29.770> coming<00:02:30.770> up<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.070> core

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
compare it 45 minutes coming up the core

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.980 
compare it 45 minutes coming up the core
block<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.640> only<00:02:31.850> variable<00:02:32.360> here<00:02:32.630> is<00:02:32.660> that<00:02:32.870> the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
block the only variable here is that the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.020 
block the only variable here is that the
water<00:02:33.170> level<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.590> little<00:02:33.680> less<00:02:33.980> no<00:02:34.820> we<00:02:35.000> just

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
water level is a little less no we just

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.520 
water level is a little less no we just
started<00:02:35.300> filling<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.780> water<00:02:36.020> but<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.350> want

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
started filling the water but you want

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.199 
started filling the water but you want
to<00:02:36.560> check<00:02:36.770> with<00:02:36.950> water<00:02:37.190> line<00:02:37.459> right<00:02:37.490> there<00:02:37.910> by

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
to check with water line right there by

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.780 
to check with water line right there by
on<00:02:38.420> day<00:02:38.720> 2<00:02:38.780> of<00:02:39.320> testing<00:02:39.709> out<00:02:39.890> this<00:02:40.070> MinnKota

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
on day 2 of testing out this MinnKota

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.440 
on day 2 of testing out this MinnKota
it's<00:02:41.690> still<00:02:42.050> you<00:02:42.620> know<00:02:42.709> what<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:44.060> doesn't<00:02:44.330> have

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
it's still you know what it doesn't have

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.170 
it's still you know what it doesn't have
the<00:02:44.570> same<00:02:44.780> sound<00:02:45.050> I've<00:02:45.740> elevated<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.880> water

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
the same sound I've elevated the water

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.640 
the same sound I've elevated the water
level<00:02:47.570> here<00:02:47.720> for<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:47.930> little<00:02:48.110> bit<00:02:48.260> so<00:02:48.380> it's<00:02:48.500> less

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
level here for a little bit so it's less

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.070 
level here for a little bit so it's less
of<00:02:48.770> that<00:02:48.920> kind<00:02:49.610> like<00:02:49.730> a<00:02:49.790> slurping<00:02:50.300> sound<00:02:50.360> with

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
of that kind like a slurping sound with

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.010 
of that kind like a slurping sound with
the<00:02:51.260> Eddy<00:02:51.530> little<00:02:51.980> whirlpool<00:02:52.220> here<00:02:52.790> but<00:02:53.720> this

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
the Eddy little whirlpool here but this

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.880 
the Eddy little whirlpool here but this
is<00:02:54.200> day<00:02:54.440> 2<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:55.250> still<00:02:55.580> seems<00:02:55.850> to<00:02:55.940> be<00:02:56.000> going<00:02:56.390> I

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
is day 2 it still seems to be going I

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.320 
is day 2 it still seems to be going I
consider<00:02:57.890> strong<00:02:58.340> ok<00:02:58.790> maybe<00:02:58.940> not<00:02:59.030> as<00:02:59.209> much

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
consider strong ok maybe not as much

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.750 
consider strong ok maybe not as much
gussto<00:02:59.840> as<00:02:59.959> it<00:03:00.050> was<00:03:00.200> originally<00:03:00.709> we're<00:03:01.640> gonna

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
gussto as it was originally we're gonna

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.430 
gussto as it was originally we're gonna
go<00:03:01.940> ahead<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.180> shut<00:03:02.330> it<00:03:02.450> down<00:03:02.480> for<00:03:02.930> now<00:03:02.989> and

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
go ahead and shut it down for now and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.810 
go ahead and shut it down for now and
then<00:03:03.769> maybe<00:03:03.920> just<00:03:04.010> do<00:03:04.190> a<00:03:04.220> few<00:03:04.430> of<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:04.610> tests

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
then maybe just do a few of the tests

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.910 
then maybe just do a few of the tests
later<00:03:05.090> on<00:03:05.330> so<00:03:05.930> I'm<00:03:06.019> gonna<00:03:06.170> guess<00:03:06.410> almost<00:03:06.709> three

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
later on so I'm gonna guess almost three

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.250 
later on so I'm gonna guess almost three
hours<00:03:07.100> still<00:03:08.090> has<00:03:08.269> plenty<00:03:08.480> of<00:03:08.600> for<00:03:08.840> us<00:03:08.930> plenty

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
hours still has plenty of for us plenty

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.840 
hours still has plenty of for us plenty
of<00:03:09.350> kick<00:03:09.560> it<00:03:09.709> looks<00:03:09.890> like<00:03:10.100> we<00:03:10.340> could<00:03:10.459> see<00:03:10.489> down

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
of kick it looks like we could see down

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.310 
of kick it looks like we could see down
here<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.269> here<00:03:11.750> down<00:03:11.930> here<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:13.190> I<00:03:13.430> almost<00:03:13.820> say

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
here and here down here and I almost say

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.600 
here and here down here and I almost say
no<00:03:15.320> matter<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.680> water<00:03:15.860> level<00:03:16.190> in<00:03:16.280> here<00:03:16.459> it

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
no matter the water level in here it

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:17.920 
no matter the water level in here it
sounds<00:03:16.760> almost<00:03:17.030> about<00:03:17.360> the<00:03:17.450> same<00:03:17.660> as<00:03:17.810> when

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
sounds almost about the same as when

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.380 
sounds almost about the same as when
they<00:03:17.959> first<00:03:18.670> introduced<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.880> motor<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.360> the

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
they first introduced the motor to the

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.910 
they first introduced the motor to the
tub<00:03:20.900> here<00:03:21.110> quickly

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
tub here quickly

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.430 
tub here quickly
we<00:03:22.580> actually<00:03:22.760> reverse<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:23.420> polarity<00:03:24.019> on<00:03:24.230> the

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
we actually reverse the polarity on the

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.650 
we actually reverse the polarity on the
battery<00:03:24.860> when<00:03:25.550> going<00:03:25.730> forward<00:03:26.360> is<00:03:26.420> actually

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
battery when going forward is actually

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.120 
battery when going forward is actually
reversed<00:03:26.989> when<00:03:27.290> reverse<00:03:27.590> was<00:03:27.800> actually

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
reversed when reverse was actually

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.800 
reversed when reverse was actually
forward<00:03:28.580> we're<00:03:29.150> gonna<00:03:29.239> do<00:03:29.360> that<00:03:29.450> one<00:03:29.630> more

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
forward we're gonna do that one more

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.750 
forward we're gonna do that one more
time<00:03:29.840> that<00:03:30.260> was<00:03:30.410> sure<00:03:30.590> interesting<00:03:31.130> but

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
time that was sure interesting but

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.360 
time that was sure interesting but
there's<00:03:31.970> one<00:03:32.330> ok<00:03:33.220> here<00:03:34.220> now<00:03:34.430> again<00:03:34.790> is<00:03:34.970> to<00:03:36.370> now

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
there's one ok here now again is to now

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.390 
there's one ok here now again is to now
we<00:03:37.430> have<00:03:37.730> three<00:03:39.040> Wow

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
we have three Wow

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.449 
we have three Wow
yeah<00:03:41.239> I'm<00:03:41.600> definitely<00:03:41.900> seeing<00:03:42.380> at<00:03:43.370> least

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
yeah I'm definitely seeing at least

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.190 
yeah I'm definitely seeing at least
about<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.000> amount<00:03:44.180> of<00:03:44.239> force<00:03:44.510> that<00:03:44.570> was<00:03:44.959> on

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
about the amount of force that was on

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.180 
about the amount of force that was on
five<00:03:45.760> at<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:47.000> two<00:03:47.209> hours<00:03:47.600> here's<00:03:47.930> four

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
five at the two hours here's four

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.230 
five at the two hours here's four
that's<00:03:51.190> about<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.550> same<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:52.000> they<00:03:52.060> go<00:03:52.180> to

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
that's about the same and they go to

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.540 
that's about the same and they go to
five
