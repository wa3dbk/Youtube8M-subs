00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
guys showed where he was welding in

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.040 
guys showed where he was welding in
little<00:00:28.560> bursts<00:00:28.830> he'd<00:00:29.250> point<00:00:29.580> his<00:00:29.730> gun<00:00:30.060> in

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
little bursts he'd point his gun in

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.420 
little bursts he'd point his gun in
something<00:00:31.439> he'd<00:00:31.560> shoot<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.920> for<00:00:32.070> half<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
something he'd shoot it for half the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.310 
something he'd shoot it for half the
second<00:00:32.850> stop<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.510> then<00:00:33.629> do<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.870> again<00:00:33.960> and

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
second stop and then do it again and

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.049 
second stop and then do it again and
stop<00:00:34.589> and<00:00:34.949> then<00:00:35.129> he'd<00:00:35.250> move<00:00:35.400> around<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.820> cool

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
stop and then he'd move around to a cool

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.939 
stop and then he'd move around to a cool
part<00:00:36.330> of<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.449> metal<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.750> do<00:00:36.839> it<00:00:36.930> again<00:00:37.050> and

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
part of the metal and do it again and

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.189 
part of the metal and do it again and
that's<00:00:38.100> what<00:00:38.190> i've<00:00:38.339> been<00:00:38.370> doing<00:00:38.489> here<00:00:39.050> and<00:00:40.050> you

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
that's what i've been doing here and you

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.170 
that's what i've been doing here and you
can<00:00:40.350> see<00:00:40.730> that's<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.820> pretty<00:00:41.970> good-looking

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
can see that's a pretty good-looking

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.880 
can see that's a pretty good-looking
weld<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.839> wouldn't<00:00:43.049> take<00:00:43.170> much<00:00:43.320> grinding<00:00:43.830> to

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
weld it wouldn't take much grinding to

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.060 
weld it wouldn't take much grinding to
smooth<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.369> right<00:00:44.640> out<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.269> didn't<00:00:45.809> do<00:00:45.900> it

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
smooth that right out I didn't do it

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.740 
smooth that right out I didn't do it
probably<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> fabulous<00:00:47.670> job<00:00:47.699> of<00:00:48.000> having<00:00:48.420> my<00:00:48.690> two

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
probably a fabulous job of having my two

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.750 
probably a fabulous job of having my two
pieces<00:00:49.229> of<00:00:49.260> metal<00:00:49.650> line<00:00:49.830> up<00:00:50.010> perfectly<00:00:50.220> for

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
pieces of metal line up perfectly for

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.229 
pieces of metal line up perfectly for
this<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.600> if<00:00:52.110> i<00:00:52.229> had<00:00:52.470> with<00:00:53.369> a<00:00:53.430> nice<00:00:53.699> clean<00:00:54.030> well

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
this but if i had with a nice clean well

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.969 
this but if i had with a nice clean well
like<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.780> i<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:55.080> grind<00:00:55.290> death<00:00:55.589> make<00:00:55.860> it

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979 
like that i can grind death make it

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.520 
like that i can grind death make it
disappear<00:00:56.159> pretty<00:00:56.519> easily<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.290> that's<00:00:58.290> pretty

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
disappear pretty easily so that's pretty

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.100 
disappear pretty easily so that's pretty
good<00:00:58.739> i<00:00:58.799> did<00:00:59.040> a<00:00:59.070> big<00:00:59.280> ugly<00:00:59.430> well<00:00:59.790> here<00:01:00.210> now<00:01:00.600> I

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
good i did a big ugly well here now I

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.229 
good i did a big ugly well here now I
just<00:01:01.500> burned<00:01:01.860> a<00:01:02.100> hole<00:01:02.339> in<00:01:02.610> something<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.059> I

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
just burned a hole in something that I

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.570 
just burned a hole in something that I
shot<00:01:03.540> a<00:01:03.570> bunch<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.989> well<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.220> they're<00:01:05.369> trying

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
shot a bunch of well then they're trying

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.100 
shot a bunch of well then they're trying
to<00:01:05.640> fix<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.060> but<00:01:06.150> then<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.360> figured<00:01:06.450> out<00:01:06.810> over

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
to fix it but then I figured out over

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.080 
to fix it but then I figured out over
here<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.290> had<00:01:07.439> some<00:01:07.619> holes<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.189> figured<00:01:08.729> out<00:01:08.850> if<00:01:08.970> I

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
here I had some holes I figured out if I

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.719 
here I had some holes I figured out if I
wouldn't<00:01:09.390> rush<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:09.930> I'd<00:01:10.049> go<00:01:10.259> slow<00:01:10.729> support

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
wouldn't rush it if I'd go slow support

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.039 
wouldn't rush it if I'd go slow support
a<00:01:11.759> little<00:01:11.970> wire<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.330> there<00:01:12.479> let<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.750> cool<00:01:12.990> off

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
a little wire in there let it cool off

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.750 
a little wire in there let it cool off
and<00:01:13.530> come<00:01:13.770> back<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.920> little<00:01:14.010> bit<00:01:14.250> more<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.580> fill

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
and come back a little bit more and fill

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.430 
and come back a little bit more and fill
it<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:14.970> slowly<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.510> wouldn't<00:01:15.870> get<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> mess<00:01:16.230> like

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
it in slowly I wouldn't get a mess like

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.980 
it in slowly I wouldn't get a mess like
that<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:17.070> that's<00:01:17.910> pretty<00:01:18.120> cool<00:01:18.210> I'm<00:01:18.600> learning

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
that so that's pretty cool I'm learning

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.560 
that so that's pretty cool I'm learning
this<00:01:19.110> as<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> go<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.890> that's<00:01:20.700> obviously<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:21.210> much

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
this as a go and that's obviously a much

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.600 
this as a go and that's obviously a much
prettier<00:01:21.780> welding<00:01:22.410> some<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.310> those<00:01:23.370> first

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
prettier welding some of those first

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.300 
prettier welding some of those first
ones<00:01:23.880> i<00:01:24.000> did<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.740> that's<00:01:25.740> all<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> learning

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
ones i did so that's all the learning

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.140 
ones i did so that's all the learning
experience<00:01:26.370> for<00:01:26.790> me<00:01:27.030> i<00:01:28.909> think<00:01:29.909> i'm<00:01:30.030> gonna

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
experience for me i think i'm gonna

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.090 
experience for me i think i'm gonna
shoot<00:01:30.390> some<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.690> this<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.050> real<00:01:31.230> time<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.920> so

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
shoot some of this in real time just so

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.470 
shoot some of this in real time just so
you<00:01:32.159> can<00:01:32.430> see<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.120> can<00:01:33.240> get<00:01:33.330> an<00:01:33.420> idea

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
you can see it and you can get an idea

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.140 
you can see it and you can get an idea
of<00:01:33.980> what<00:01:34.980> i'm<00:01:35.100> doing<00:01:35.400> as<00:01:35.520> far<00:01:35.670> as<00:01:35.820> those<00:01:35.970> little

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
of what i'm doing as far as those little

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.810 
of what i'm doing as far as those little
short<00:01:36.450> bursts<00:01:36.750> here<00:01:37.190> basically<00:01:38.190> just<00:01:38.520> putting

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
short bursts here basically just putting

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.550 
short bursts here basically just putting
a<00:01:38.909> leather<00:01:39.120> throughout<00:01:39.630> almost<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.260> the<00:01:40.290> spot

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
a leather throughout almost on the spot

00:01:40.560 --> 00:02:02.130 
a leather throughout almost on the spot
i<00:01:40.620> went<00:01:40.890> well<00:01:42.470> pulling<00:01:43.470> trigger

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.310

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.790 
getting a little short bursts of weld
and<00:02:38.480> hooks<00:02:38.750> almost<00:02:39.080> like<00:02:39.200> they're<00:02:39.380> piling<00:02:39.590> up

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
and hooks almost like they're piling up

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.450
