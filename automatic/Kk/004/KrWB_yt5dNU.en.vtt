00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.679 
hi guys and welcome to today's video
today<00:00:02.580> I'm<00:00:02.850> doing<00:00:03.000> a<00:00:03.179> slightly<00:00:03.510> different

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
today I'm doing a slightly different

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.480 
today I'm doing a slightly different
video<00:00:03.959> and<00:00:04.500> I<00:00:04.799> thought<00:00:04.980> I<00:00:05.040> would<00:00:05.220> share<00:00:05.400> with

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
video and I thought I would share with

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.540 
video and I thought I would share with
you<00:00:05.609> my<00:00:05.759> five<00:00:06.120> favorite<00:00:06.660> matte<00:00:07.170> lipsticks<00:00:07.799> for

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
you my five favorite matte lipsticks for

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.610 
you my five favorite matte lipsticks for
a<00:00:08.610> while<00:00:08.910> I<00:00:09.269> kind<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.780> went<00:00:09.960> off<00:00:10.170> matte

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
a while I kind of went off matte

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.410 
a while I kind of went off matte
lipsticks<00:00:11.190> because<00:00:11.550> they're<00:00:12.120> not<00:00:12.300> the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
lipsticks because they're not the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.910 
lipsticks because they're not the
cheapest<00:00:12.780> they're<00:00:13.019> also<00:00:13.290> definitely<00:00:13.559> not<00:00:13.830> the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
cheapest they're also definitely not the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.550 
cheapest they're also definitely not the
most<00:00:14.070> expensive<00:00:14.429> but<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.660> don't<00:00:16.379> necessarily

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
most expensive but I don't necessarily

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.929 
most expensive but I don't necessarily
think<00:00:17.160> that<00:00:17.990> they're<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.859> hydrating<00:00:20.609> either

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
think that they're that hydrating either

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.150 
think that they're that hydrating either
that<00:00:21.660> said<00:00:21.930> if<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.170> could<00:00:22.350> use<00:00:22.529> one<00:00:22.740> brands

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
that said if I could use one brands

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.859 
that said if I could use one brands
lipsticks<00:00:23.730> for<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.939> rest<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.210> my<00:00:24.359> life<00:00:24.570> I

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
lipsticks for the rest of my life I

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.929 
lipsticks for the rest of my life I
would<00:00:25.500> probably<00:00:25.740> choose<00:00:26.160> Mac<00:00:26.490> just<00:00:26.730> because

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
would probably choose Mac just because

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.029 
would probably choose Mac just because
that<00:00:27.029> shade<00:00:27.330> range<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.900> incredible<00:00:28.740> they<00:00:28.890> have

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
that shade range is incredible they have

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.020 
that shade range is incredible they have
such<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.220> variety<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.849> finishes<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.920> just<00:00:32.759> I

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
such a variety of finishes and I just I

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.639 
such a variety of finishes and I just I
just<00:00:33.059> really<00:00:33.270> like<00:00:33.660> them<00:00:33.989> even<00:00:34.260> though<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.530> know

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
just really like them even though I know

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.130 
just really like them even though I know
they're<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.190> little<00:00:35.309> bit<00:00:35.579> drying<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.329> just<00:00:36.989> think

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
they're a little bit drying I just think

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.830 
they're a little bit drying I just think
that<00:00:37.290> they're<00:00:37.500> really<00:00:38.309> good<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:39.149> I've<00:00:39.480> chosen

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
that they're really good so I've chosen

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.950 
that they're really good so I've chosen
my<00:00:40.140> top<00:00:40.770> five<00:00:41.070> I'm<00:00:41.610> gonna<00:00:41.879> say<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.270> my<00:00:42.420> top<00:00:42.690> 5

for spring and summer because actually I

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.529

definitely is a red with a hint of

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.090 
definitely is a red with a hint of

brave<00:03:47.800> which<00:03:48.100> is<00:03:48.220> actually<00:03:48.489> what<00:03:48.610> I'm<00:03:48.700> wearing

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
brave which is actually what I'm wearing

think<00:03:51.280> it<00:03:51.370> just<00:03:51.459> works<00:03:51.700> with<00:03:51.880> any<00:03:52.150> eye<00:03:52.239> look

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
think it just works with any eye look

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.590 
think it just works with any eye look
any<00:03:52.959> season<00:03:53.830> it's<00:03:54.280> kind<00:03:54.670> of<00:03:54.820> like<00:03:55.000> patisserie

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
any season it's kind of like patisserie

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.360 
any season it's kind of like patisserie
but<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.870> little<00:03:56.110> bit<00:03:56.320> dark<00:03:56.530> it's<00:03:56.860> a<00:03:57.010> really<00:03:57.250> like

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
but a little bit dark it's a really like

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.259

creamy light move not dissimilar to

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.930 
creamy light move not dissimilar to
modesty<00:04:02.050> but<00:04:02.200> once<00:04:02.410> again<00:04:02.590> a<00:04:02.769> bit<00:04:03.100> lighter

darker than my lips I would say always a

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.490 
darker than my lips I would say always a

suspect<00:04:15.970> this<00:04:16.810> could<00:04:17.880> potentially<00:04:19.410> overtake

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
suspect this could potentially overtake

Zen we don't have for a little while now

Zen we don't have for a little while now
I've<00:04:28.080> actually<00:04:28.320> never<00:04:28.800> worn<00:04:29.220> it<00:04:29.370> by<00:04:29.550> itself<00:04:29.970> I

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
I've actually never worn it by itself I

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.960 
I've actually never worn it by itself I
don't<00:04:30.630> think<00:04:31.020> it's<00:04:31.470> a<00:04:31.560> rosy<00:04:31.950> beige<00:04:32.190> color<00:04:32.670> and

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
don't think it's a rosy beige color and

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.420 
don't think it's a rosy beige color and
it's<00:04:33.480> a<00:04:33.540> cream<00:04:33.810> machine<00:04:34.140> but<00:04:34.440> it's<00:04:34.800> not<00:04:35.040> the

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
it's a cream machine but it's not the

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.730 
it's a cream machine but it's not the
most<00:04:35.670> opaque<00:04:35.970> color<00:04:36.240> from<00:04:36.720> Mac<00:04:36.960> but<00:04:37.590> the

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
most opaque color from Mac but the

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.640 
most opaque color from Mac but the
reason<00:04:38.070> I<00:04:38.190> love<00:04:38.370> it<00:04:38.550> is<00:04:38.670> because<00:04:38.700> it<00:04:39.270> works

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
reason I love it is because it works

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.050 
reason I love it is because it works
beautifully<00:04:40.650> layered<00:04:41.220> over<00:04:41.520> other<00:04:41.640> products

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
beautifully layered over other products

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.330 
beautifully layered over other products
so<00:04:42.600> for<00:04:42.750> example<00:04:43.140> I<00:04:43.200> love<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.500> layer<00:04:43.770> over<00:04:43.950> lip

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
so for example I love to layer over lip

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.070 
so for example I love to layer over lip
liners<00:04:44.940> or<00:04:45.150> if<00:04:45.240> I've<00:04:45.360> got<00:04:45.510> a<00:04:45.630> lipstick<00:04:45.990> that's

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
liners or if I've got a lipstick that's

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.680 
liners or if I've got a lipstick that's
too<00:04:46.380> bright<00:04:46.710> I'll<00:04:47.220> put<00:04:47.640> this<00:04:47.760> on<00:04:47.820> top<00:04:48.330> to<00:04:48.480> kind

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
too bright I'll put this on top to kind

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.910 
too bright I'll put this on top to kind
of<00:04:48.720> tone<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.080> down<00:04:49.170> a<00:04:49.230> little<00:04:49.410> bit

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
of tone it down a little bit

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.380 
of tone it down a little bit
the<00:04:50.100> reason<00:04:50.400> I<00:04:50.520> don't<00:04:50.730> like<00:04:50.820> to<00:04:50.970> wear<00:04:51.090> it<00:04:51.240> by

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
the reason I don't like to wear it by

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.850 
the reason I don't like to wear it by
itself<00:04:51.420> is<00:04:51.960> because<00:04:52.200> it's<00:04:52.380> almost<00:04:52.650> a<00:04:52.740> little

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
itself is because it's almost a little

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.100 
itself is because it's almost a little
bit<00:04:52.920> too<00:04:53.010> beige<00:04:53.460> it<00:04:53.760> kind<00:04:54.000> of<00:04:54.120> leans<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:55.080> little

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
bit too beige it kind of leans a little

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.130 
bit too beige it kind of leans a little
bit<00:04:55.740> towards<00:04:56.190> concealer<00:04:56.700> lips<00:04:56.910> by<00:04:57.150> itself<00:04:57.480> but

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
bit towards concealer lips by itself but

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.900 
bit towards concealer lips by itself but
it's<00:04:58.860> a<00:04:59.040> great<00:04:59.340> one<00:04:59.550> to<00:04:59.610> have<00:04:59.790> in<00:04:59.880> your

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
it's a great one to have in your

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.850 
it's a great one to have in your
collection<00:05:00.090> just<00:05:00.690> tone<00:05:01.020> down<00:05:01.050> any<00:05:01.530> other

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
collection just tone down any other

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.580 
collection just tone down any other
lipstick<00:05:02.400> it's<00:05:03.330> great<00:05:03.780> if<00:05:03.990> you've<00:05:04.170> got<00:05:04.350> a<00:05:04.380> lips

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
lipstick it's great if you've got a lips

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.410 
lipstick it's great if you've got a lips
that<00:05:04.710> you<00:05:04.800> don't<00:05:04.980> love<00:05:05.310> I<00:05:05.580> think<00:05:05.910> mixing<00:05:06.090> this

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
that you don't love I think mixing this

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.150 
that you don't love I think mixing this
can<00:05:06.870> potentially<00:05:07.380> make<00:05:07.530> you<00:05:07.800> love<00:05:07.950> that
