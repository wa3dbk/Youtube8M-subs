00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.760 

with<00:02:22.220> this<00:02:22.400> one<00:02:22.670> I'm<00:02:22.850> cutting<00:02:23.360> each<00:02:23.840> side<00:02:24.380> as

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
with this one I'm cutting each side as

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.980 
with this one I'm cutting each side as
opposed<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:26.000> cutting<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.390> whole<00:02:26.600> thing<00:02:26.810> off

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
opposed to cutting the whole thing off

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.110 
opposed to cutting the whole thing off
cuz<00:02:27.230> i<00:02:27.530> guess<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.400> angle<00:02:28.730> is<00:02:28.850> a<00:02:28.880> little

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
cuz i guess the angle is a little

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.280 
cuz i guess the angle is a little
awkward<00:02:29.510> for<00:02:29.540> me<00:02:29.930> but<00:02:31.690> after<00:02:32.690> that<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:33.080> check

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
awkward for me but after that you check

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.810 
awkward for me but after that you check
the<00:02:33.440> necklace<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.040> just<00:02:34.220> trim<00:02:34.490> off<00:02:34.520> any

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
the necklace and you just trim off any

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.530 
the necklace and you just trim off any
excess<00:02:35.440> metal<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:36.740> you<00:02:36.860> see<00:02:37.270> so<00:02:38.270> i<00:02:38.300> have<00:02:38.480> a

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
excess metal that you see so i have a

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.970 
excess metal that you see so i have a
little<00:02:38.840> bit<00:02:39.020> right<00:02:39.170> here<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:39.590> i'm<00:02:39.680> just<00:02:39.740> going

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
little bit right here so i'm just going

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.370 
little bit right here so i'm just going
to<00:02:40.070> trim<00:02:40.280> that<00:02:40.340> off<00:02:40.520> and<00:02:40.970> see<00:02:41.810> this<00:02:41.960> is<00:02:42.140> where

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
to trim that off and see this is where

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.800 
to trim that off and see this is where
the<00:02:42.620> flush<00:02:43.070> cutter<00:02:43.490> comes<00:02:43.880> in<00:02:44.090> handy<00:02:44.330> because

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
the flush cutter comes in handy because

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.170 
the flush cutter comes in handy because
it<00:02:45.080> really<00:02:45.290> makes<00:02:45.620> a<00:02:45.890> nice<00:02:46.220> clean<00:02:46.580> cut<00:02:46.820> as<00:02:47.060> you

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
it really makes a nice clean cut as you

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.620 
it really makes a nice clean cut as you
can<00:02:47.330> see<00:02:47.570> it's<00:02:48.580> smoother<00:02:49.580> than<00:02:50.210> a<00:02:50.360> regular

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
can see it's smoother than a regular

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.140 
can see it's smoother than a regular
standard<00:02:51.410> cutter<00:02:51.740> and<00:02:52.010> what<00:02:52.100> you<00:02:52.220> do<00:02:52.400> next<00:02:52.910> is

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
standard cutter and what you do next is

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.420 
standard cutter and what you do next is
file<00:02:53.420> down<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:53.930> smooth<00:02:54.230> out<00:02:54.440> any<00:02:54.710> rough<00:02:55.010> or

file down and smooth out any rough or
uneven<00:02:55.670> areas<00:02:58.120> it's<00:02:59.120> just<00:02:59.420> like<00:02:59.770> filing<00:03:00.770> your

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
uneven areas it's just like filing your

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:08.560 
uneven areas it's just like filing your
nails<00:03:03.310> just<00:03:04.310> make<00:03:04.490> sure<00:03:04.520> it's<00:03:04.850> a<00:03:05.120> neat<00:03:07.570> just

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
nails just make sure it's a neat just

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.210 
nails just make sure it's a neat just
file<00:03:08.840> enough<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:09.440> that<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.740> looks<00:03:09.890> smooth<00:03:10.340> and

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
file enough so that it looks smooth and

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.340 
file enough so that it looks smooth and
and<00:03:13.220> that<00:03:14.030> is<00:03:14.180> like<00:03:14.300> a<00:03:14.360> natural<00:03:14.750> curve<00:03:14.960> i<00:03:15.170> guess

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
and that is like a natural curve i guess

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.780 
and that is like a natural curve i guess
and<00:03:15.650> also<00:03:16.550> trim<00:03:16.820> off<00:03:17.000> any<00:03:17.420> excess<00:03:17.810> metal<00:03:18.470> if

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.050 

and<00:05:06.730> you<00:05:07.300> don't<00:05:07.420> need<00:05:07.540> to<00:05:07.840> put<00:05:08.320> a<00:05:08.380> lot<00:05:08.740> on<00:05:09.060> don't

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
and you don't need to put a lot on don't

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.450 
and you don't need to put a lot on don't
try<00:05:10.330> to<00:05:10.390> you<00:05:10.990> know<00:05:11.020> what<00:05:11.950> a<00:05:11.980> bit<00:05:12.190> on<00:05:12.310> or

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
try to you know what a bit on or

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.220 
try to you know what a bit on or
anything<00:05:12.520> like<00:05:12.850> that<00:05:13.030> because<00:05:13.780> you<00:05:14.020> don't

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
anything like that because you don't

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.530 
anything like that because you don't
really<00:05:14.410> want<00:05:14.770> to<00:05:14.890> cover<00:05:15.520> up<00:05:15.850> the<00:05:16.120> little

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
really want to cover up the little

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.790 
really want to cover up the little
facets<00:05:17.140> on<00:05:17.410> the<00:05:17.820> stones<00:05:19.290> but<00:05:20.290> don't<00:05:20.530> make<00:05:20.650> it

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
facets on the stones but don't make it

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.740 
facets on the stones but don't make it
so<00:05:20.980> light<00:05:21.250> that<00:05:21.280> stones<00:05:22.120> show<00:05:22.420> through<00:05:22.660> of

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
so light that stones show through of

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.600 
so light that stones show through of
course<00:05:22.780> so<00:05:23.260> just<00:05:23.530> you<00:05:24.250> know<00:05:24.370> use<00:05:24.580> your

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
course so just you know use your

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.279 
course so just you know use your
judgment<00:05:25.240> your<00:05:25.420> judgment

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.439 

and<00:05:28.379> I<00:05:28.919> found<00:05:29.129> that<00:05:29.339> it<00:05:29.550> was<00:05:29.580> easier<00:05:30.210> to

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
and I found that it was easier to

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.799 
and I found that it was easier to
unclasp<00:05:31.379> the<00:05:32.159> necklace<00:05:32.610> and<00:05:32.879> lay<00:05:33.509> it<00:05:33.629> flat

00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:33.809 
unclasp the necklace and lay it flat

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:36.290 
unclasp the necklace and lay it flat
then<00:05:34.710> turn<00:05:35.069> it<00:05:35.099> around<00:05:35.339> and<00:05:35.789> make<00:05:35.879> any

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
then turn it around and make any

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.920 
then turn it around and make any
necessary<00:05:36.419> touch-ups<00:05:37.409> so<00:05:38.339> we<00:05:38.639> see<00:05:38.969> any<00:05:39.330> of

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
necessary touch-ups so we see any of

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.489 
necessary touch-ups so we see any of
that<00:05:40.139> sparkly<00:05:41.009> rhinestone<00:05:41.580> coming<00:05:41.969> through

00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:42.499 
that sparkly rhinestone coming through

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:46.639 
that sparkly rhinestone coming through
paint<00:05:43.499> over<00:05:43.860> that<00:05:44.689> that<00:05:45.689> usually<00:05:46.050> happens<00:05:46.409> on

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:46.649 
paint over that that usually happens on

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:48.649 
paint over that that usually happens on
the<00:05:46.770> edges<00:05:47.129> so<00:05:47.849> that's<00:05:48.059> what<00:05:48.240> I'm<00:05:48.330> doing<00:05:48.360> right

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 
the edges so that's what I'm doing right

here I'm just sort of filling in the

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:57.790 
here I'm just sort of filling in the
