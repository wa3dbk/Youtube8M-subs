sort of fine art career and a graph
career<00:02:00.260> and<00:02:01.070> I<00:02:01.130> think<00:02:01.370> the<00:02:01.490> one<00:02:01.670> sort<00:02:01.940> of

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
career and I think the one sort of

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.460 
career and I think the one sort of
balance<00:02:02.300> is<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.480> other<00:02:02.660> they<00:02:02.869> both<00:02:02.900> inform

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
balance is the other they both inform

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.510 
balance is the other they both inform
each<00:02:03.650> other<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:04.010> it's<00:02:04.100> like<00:02:04.190> when<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.369> get

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
people to piss off so I think that side

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.620 
people to piss off so I think that side
of<00:02:18.200> thing<00:02:18.410> keeps<00:02:18.650> you<00:02:18.800> real<00:02:19.010> because<00:02:19.610> once<00:02:20.540> you

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
of thing keeps you real because once you

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.270 
of thing keeps you real because once you
start<00:02:20.870> doing<00:02:21.020> heart<00:02:21.350> with<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.560> galleries<00:02:22.070> and

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
start doing heart with the galleries and

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.100 
start doing heart with the galleries and
stuff<00:02:22.459> like<00:02:22.640> that<00:02:22.700> start<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.480> become<00:02:23.630> a<00:02:23.840> little

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
stuff like that start to become a little

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.020 
stuff like that start to become a little
bit<00:02:24.200> institutionalized<00:02:25.070> and<00:02:25.400> it's<00:02:25.520> like

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
bit institutionalized and it's like

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.610 
bit institutionalized and it's like
joining<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.570> establishment<00:02:27.260> whereas<00:02:27.530> the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
joining the establishment whereas the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.550 
joining the establishment whereas the
whole<00:02:27.770> thing<00:02:28.610> about<00:02:28.760> rap<00:02:29.090> for<00:02:29.300> me<00:02:29.330> is<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.840> of

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
whole thing about rap for me is to of

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.740 
whole thing about rap for me is to of
anti-establishment<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:32.480> there's<00:02:32.630> a<00:02:32.660> little

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
anti-establishment so there's a little

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.300 
anti-establishment so there's a little
bit<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:32.990> contradiction<00:02:33.650> like<00:02:33.830> like<00:02:34.100> most

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
bit of contradiction like like most

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
bit of contradiction like like most
things<00:02:34.400> in<00:02:34.580> life<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:34.790> live<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.150> paradox

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.910
