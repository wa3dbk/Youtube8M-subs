00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.870
 hello everyone is welcome on 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:17.470
 metal gear solid 5 g 0 0 we're gone 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.760
 directly for the threat eliminate the 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.900
 renegade threat the mission i you the 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.939
 say we left for the mission 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.220
 greece without help without markers without 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.779
 reflex without these bullshit in hard game 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.930
 accurate without difficult you can 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:32.649
 check where to eliminate both 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.730
 targets so we can extract 100 without 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.380
 kill them but I'm going to kill them 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.239
 obviously rank does not mean 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.320
 not kill anything or anything 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.590
 I tell them every time 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.960
 So we're going to have the technique for me 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.219
 in any case it will be the sniper rifle but 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.840
 I'm not going but who pays for that 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.030
 which I have already used right away 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.170
 we're going to pick him up there 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.699
 right away I would say click the boxes 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.050
 of fruits the first guard you can 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.730
 you safely done to save 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.800
 time if you push him as he has 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.989
 reminded to dubai does not fall into bytecode 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.519
 on the ledge just below then 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.800
 do not mind guarding that off 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.110
 you do not need mayweather six 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.510
 he wanted to facilitate the escape but there are 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.100
 a jeep that will see them so make 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.120
 blunder because precisely the guard at the 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.580
 far and that I said he'll see you 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.050
 so do you cut there there is a 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.250
 just guard left and a guy who's going 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.320
 pass so be careful 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.980
 as soon as we hear it arrive here is dish 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.480
 belly she's not going this is the roach is going 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.970
 hangs sleep which starts 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.860
 to leave running abandoned him the app 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.660
 then we go to sleep greeted right at 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.010
 bout there is another left 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.590
 to fall asleep is for her a girl 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.790
 willow yves sorry actually he got 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.560
 returned he saw me but he fell asleep 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.210
 that's why you heard the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.100
 name lessons of the loss but he actually 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.770
 I can be suspicious was not 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.300
 spotted and we'll sleep that one why 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.920
 because I go to the watchtower just in 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.420
 high just left there to shoot at 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.010
 sniper rifle to him will hear me he'll 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.240
 to see me necessarily if I if I do not 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.550
 do not fall asleep so hurry up too 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.980
 tilted moving targets are 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.350
 enough how to say that can it can 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.090
 vary especially the one right there and kido 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.320
 watchtower at one point he gets stuck and 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.300
 suddenly it becomes boring for the 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.240
 kill so we'll go to the truck on it 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.470
 see from here attention there are guys 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.360
 pretty close but it's mostly the one 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.649
 that stuck to the trucks that is in front 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.209
 the truck in fact it must be 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.540
 organ to another in the distance we do not care 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.590
 if you 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.670
 you kill both targets enough 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.609
 quickly in time you are not 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.310
 spotted stack roof had fallen asleep on 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:21.620
 swiss was scared he's here go on 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.939
 do not go there and we'll go to the watchtower 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.099
 and we hurry 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:27.099
 so this mission there is pretty enough 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.659
 fast necessarily 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.909
 so for the sniper 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.859
 quickly fast quickly fast the proof that 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.180
 I am in arnage had no rifle on 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.769
 the shoulder at the start that's what we 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.530
 recognizes apart from the mission already seen 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.150
 so here's the helicopter because I call 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.739
 that the extraction must be when 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.760
 even fast enough tac now the 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.909
 first target we will start with 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.319
 the other one who is there and the food 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.239
 now we're hurrying right after 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.900
 there we have about five seconds to 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.329
 it was lille it was 5 at long 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.419
 beard now you see they are at 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.530
 these places the station plays the hardest 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:03.139
 to find it is the one she will do the 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.459
 show finally you do not know where to go 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.889
 exactly there I put myself in account 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.299
 that it has to be crossed out, that's it 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:11.480
 caution and I did not have any warning 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.680
 perfect yes except a few things 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.000
 but you see it off normally 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.579
 with the sniper bezel and I have him 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.040
 right after I shot the black that 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.510
 were in the soul and in the watchtower and 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.010
 then wrongly barred fast enough 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.109
 once she is the icon normally 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.760
 normally it's okay we're just waiting 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.739
 because that's the way it's 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.909
 here he is already here see I have 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.840
 did the most just before killing all the 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.430
 world and again I might have had 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.829
 call him taking son nile afraid in 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.909
 the truck I would have saved time because 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.430
 that he will not be spotted I think 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:41.930
 not in any case here at most I try 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.459
 to sleep in the distance but it's useless 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.799
 it was just to wait time but 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.239
 here I have the two targets I am 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.170
 went pretty fast so both kills 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.700
 obviously see West German wes I 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.840
 mean there is no fake wrong 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.579
 not kill people except for this 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.140
 mission there necessarily because you 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:03.420
 want to kill almost absolutely i would say 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:06.659
 decline of a trait the ico is going to be father and 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.190
 t here but it is not new one is 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:10.530
 not to spot these just the helicopter it's 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.629
 not it's not big bass that is they 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.040
 spotted by the way I have the chance 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.150
 that they can they can spot when 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.949
 you're in the helicopter once that's me 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.510
 already happened it's a little green that you 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.680
 have finished emission inclined that there you 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.229
 to be tricky to accept in holy 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.820
 adele but there I do not have I do not have 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:27.750
 hug father and so it's perfect for 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.780
 this question we had to do it in 4 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.150
 minutes and a few in my opinion see that 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.099
 really that it is very serious 3 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.960
 minutes 47 so that's perfect I got it 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.099
 there are better saved prisoners serves to 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.220
 anything he died in s 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:43.440
 so here's how I make myself a 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.240
 meaning to z all that without reflex nini 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.910
 other bullshit neither him nor the stuff of the 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.930
 early part day I give you years 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.729
 see you in the next video 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.080
 post your comments or questions 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.630
 and we meet again for the next 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.960
 row mission in hard mode at lecce 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.960
 everyone
