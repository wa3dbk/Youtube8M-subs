00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
anyways that day I was also expecting to

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.019 
anyways that day I was also expecting to
pick<00:00:15.870> up<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.529> all-star<00:00:16.890> Kobe's<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.940> was

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
pick up the all-star Kobe's that was

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.250 
pick up the all-star Kobe's that was
like<00:00:18.210> pretty<00:00:18.390> much<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.720> main<00:00:18.840> reason<00:00:19.140> why<00:00:19.230> I

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
like pretty much the main reason why I

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.500 
like pretty much the main reason why I
went<00:00:19.500> was<00:00:19.890> because<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.340> kind<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.580> figured<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.090> can

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
went was because I kind of figured I can

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.090 
went was because I kind of figured I can
get<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.720> Bruce<00:00:21.930> Lee's<00:00:22.140> later<00:00:22.380> but<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.920> thought

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
get the Bruce Lee's later but I thought

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.029 
get the Bruce Lee's later but I thought
these<00:00:23.250> might<00:00:23.310> show<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.730> little<00:00:23.880> bit<00:00:24.000> quicker

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
these might show a little bit quicker

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.109 
these might show a little bit quicker
anyways<00:00:26.039> they<00:00:26.400> actually<00:00:26.670> released<00:00:26.970> them
