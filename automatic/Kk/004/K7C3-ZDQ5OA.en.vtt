winder battery 1500 mah a smoke tech and

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.830 
winder battery 1500 mah a smoke tech and
yes<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.699> got<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:29.939> one<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.240> stainless<00:00:30.630> steel

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
yes I got this one in stainless steel

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.910 
yes I got this one in stainless steel
but<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.050> can<00:00:31.140> see<00:00:31.260> it's<00:00:31.349> got<00:00:31.470> all<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.679> couple

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
but you can see it's got all that couple

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.979 
but you can see it's got all that couple
different<00:00:32.309> kinds<00:00:32.610> err<00:00:32.700> scratch<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.690> reveal

different kinds err scratch to reveal

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.540 
different kinds err scratch to reveal
the<00:00:34.140> authentication<00:00:34.890> from<00:00:34.980> smoke<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.489> you

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
the authentication from smoke and you

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.370 
the authentication from smoke and you
can<00:00:35.640> see<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.880> label<00:00:36.090> on<00:00:36.329> there<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.290> an

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
can see that label on there and it is an

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.920 
can see that label on there and it is an
authentic<00:00:37.770> product<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.270> variable

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
authentic product so it is a variable

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.930 
authentic product so it is a variable
voltage<00:00:40.260> unit<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.250> say<00:00:41.370> it's<00:00:41.700> kind<00:00:41.910> of

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
voltage unit like I say it's kind of

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.200 
voltage unit like I say it's kind of
like<00:00:42.059> it's<00:00:42.329> similar<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.809> an<00:00:42.930> ego<00:00:43.910> right<00:00:44.910> quick

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
like it's similar to an ego right quick

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.750 
like it's similar to an ego right quick
similar<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.870> an<00:00:46.140> ego<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.950> know<00:00:47.039> style<00:00:47.430> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
similar to an ego you know style and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.459 
similar to an ego you know style and
everything<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:48.719> got<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> nice<00:00:49.050> fat

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
everything but it's got a nice fat

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.040 
everything but it's got a nice fat
little<00:00:49.680> body<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.879> down<00:00:51.059> here<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.930> got

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
little body to it down here and it's got

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.660 
little body to it down here and it's got
standard<00:00:52.440> push<00:00:52.620> button<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:52.980> there<00:00:53.129> five<00:00:53.370> times

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
standard push button on there five times

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.670 
standard push button on there five times
to<00:00:53.789> turn<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.120> five<00:00:54.420> times<00:00:54.660> turn<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.020> off<00:00:55.140> but

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
to turn it on five times turn it off but

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.810 
to turn it on five times turn it off but
on<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.829> bottom<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.399> where<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.640> has<00:00:56.789> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
on the bottom of it is where that has a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.939 
on the bottom of it is where that has a
variable<00:00:57.210> voltage<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.590> see<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.800> on

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
variable voltage and you can see this on

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.470 
variable voltage and you can see this on
the<00:00:58.980> very<00:00:59.190> bottom<00:00:59.460> right<00:00:59.789> now<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.090> set<00:01:00.270> just

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
the very bottom right now it's set just

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.420 
the very bottom right now it's set just
under<00:01:00.780> four<00:01:01.050> volts<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.949> goes<00:01:02.100> all<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.309> way

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
under four volts and it goes all the way

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.310 
under four volts and it goes all the way
around<00:01:02.609> four<00:01:03.300> point<00:01:03.510> four<00:01:03.719> or<00:01:03.899> four<00:01:04.049> point

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
around four point four or four point

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.600 
around four point four or four point
eight<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.769> then<00:01:05.280> around<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.580> other

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
eight and then around the other

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.429 
eight and then around the other
direction<00:01:05.850> down<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.450> three<00:01:06.960> point<00:01:07.229> two<00:01:07.409> volts

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
direction down to three point two volts

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.289 
direction down to three point two volts
so<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.130> twist<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> bottom<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.000> it's

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
so you just twist the bottom of it it's

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.030 
so you just twist the bottom of it it's
as<00:01:09.479> simple<00:01:09.630> as<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:09.960> twisted<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:10.619> all<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> way

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
as simple as that twisted up all the way

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.130 
as simple as that twisted up all the way
four<00:01:11.760> point<00:01:11.970> eight<00:01:12.119> all<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.840> way<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
four point eight all the way to the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.050 
four point eight all the way to the
bottom<00:01:13.439> three<00:01:13.770> point<00:01:14.010> two<00:01:14.220> I'm<00:01:14.760> going<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> run

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
bottom three point two I'm going to run

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.520 
bottom three point two I'm going to run
mine<00:01:15.270> about<00:01:15.450> four<00:01:15.720> volts<00:01:16.080> I'm<00:01:16.200> gonna<00:01:16.320> go<00:01:16.380> ahead

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
mine about four volts I'm gonna go ahead

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.920 
mine about four volts I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:01:16.619> put<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.520> tank<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.450> there<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:18.869> is
