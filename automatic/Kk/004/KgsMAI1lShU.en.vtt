00:05:50.430 --> 00:06:01.580 
you're familiar with the song you know
that<00:05:50.760> this<00:05:50.940> is

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:09.830 

right<00:06:02.590> so<00:06:02.920> just<00:06:03.250> using<00:06:03.810> this<00:06:04.810> part<00:06:05.230> over<00:06:05.590> here

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.740 

I'm<00:06:10.840> putting<00:06:11.140> it<00:06:11.230> over<00:06:11.380> the<00:06:11.590> track<00:06:12.510> right<00:06:13.510> this

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
I'm putting it over the track right this

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:32.280 
I'm putting it over the track right this
is<00:06:13.900> without<00:06:19.950> right<00:06:20.950> and<00:06:21.130> this<00:06:21.370> is<00:06:21.550> with<00:06:31.290> right

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.290 
is without right and this is with right

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.980 
is without right and this is with right
so<00:06:32.680> I<00:06:33.460> guess<00:06:34.270> that's<00:06:34.480> the<00:06:34.600> end<00:06:34.690> of<00:06:34.870> this

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
so I guess that's the end of this

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.990 
so I guess that's the end of this
