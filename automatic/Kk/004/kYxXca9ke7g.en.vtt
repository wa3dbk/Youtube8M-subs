00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
only reason why I stopped using it is

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.290 
only reason why I stopped using it is
because<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:35.810> heart<00:04:35.990> kind<00:04:36.260> of<00:04:36.320> fell<00:04:36.530> out<00:04:36.710> um

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
because the heart kind of fell out um

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.330 
because the heart kind of fell out um
this<00:04:38.300> is<00:04:38.510> like<00:04:38.690> five<00:04:38.960> dollars<00:04:39.200> by<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:39.770> way<00:04:40.040> and
