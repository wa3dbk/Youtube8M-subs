00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
 but 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.460
 thing you 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.200
 Excuse me, but I really wanted to 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.330
 to be able to say this sentence in front of the 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.930
 tele but almost better let alone the 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.930
 professionals 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.000
 annotated 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.570
 it seemed that this moment was never going to 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.310
 arrive but yes gentlemen return the 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.590
 clowns on TV with the musical how 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.419
 are you fito roddy and mónica 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.770
 Aragon will be in charge of this 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.890
 back to childhood for more than one 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.890
 generation 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.750
 the 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.130
 to travel always change 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.050
 Well, what everyone expects from the 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.210
 clowns of the TV that are therefore the 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.400
 great hits songs the 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.710
 written but presented in a way 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.180
 new and with a storyline that is 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.480
 something that until now we had not done 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.610
 never 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.950
 the child has to be hidden today 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.530
 you joke the end of the joke because if not 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.200
 as soon as you start telling the joke and 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.750
 you know the end especially in the most 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.210
 small of the house that previously played with 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.990
 a ball and a doll and today is 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.440
 guasa chat going and good with 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.440
 console 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.119
 two 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:36.820
 almost we both have our kittens 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.369
 also rest and rest that 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.850
 many times we ask to be at home 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.830
 and create create new comics 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.720
 Ratchet songs also the clown 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.659
 he deserves his vacation is a tribute 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.670
 I would not say amiri here because poor 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.590
 has been the last one that has left us 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.780
 the family but I think it's a 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.369
 tribute to gaby fofó and miliki to the three 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.740
 brothers at the moment we will be in 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.369
 Madrid until June if all goes well it 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.100
 we will tour around Spain and part 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.019
 of Latin America also by many then 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.880
 I would have to go through all of them but look 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.209
 one that is not too well known and that 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.590
 there is a little piece that we include here in the 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.040
 show and that is titled a smile 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.040
 and a flower 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:28.250
 If you want to hear my singing, I'll tell you 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.220
 that the smile is worth more than the 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.230
 flowers 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.910
 well, everyone, I'm Monica 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.680
