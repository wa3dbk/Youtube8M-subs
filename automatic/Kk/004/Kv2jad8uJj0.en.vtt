00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:01.290
 and well actually 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.339
 the more color you add the added nano zone 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.400
 for the color of the paper 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.660
 to understand or even cancel the added value the work area 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.319
 canceled editions 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.159
 they will see change the color of the paper 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:19.799
 only the color of the paper can be chosen when we all 

00:00:19.799 --> 00:00:20.949
 Sundays 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.880
 amp at the moment i'm creating an image maybe not but i only count six 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.880
 when we do new files 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.679
 l author rendering pixel dimensions of the image to output what you 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:31.249
 choose 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:33.830
 but they also ask you for the color of the paper 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.370
 and when you click on a peak at 6 6 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.720
 you can choose the color of the paper in a color wheel the site 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.300
 but if I will not do it 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.430
 so that's a first complete solution new borrower files 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.790
 you have the choice you can choose the color of the paper but they the 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.940
 rehousing we can still change the color of the paper after 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.440
 and that's what's called here 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.230
 so to change the color of the paper you have to find the flaw talk about 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.200
 this color 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.200
 we will call it colors 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.840
 p will have to put in the foreground box 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.920
 so right click on the foreground box to be sure you're working 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.750
 well be 15 foreground 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.620
 he will train in this ranking 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.030
 the color of the paper 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.840
 we will appeal 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.960
 the extreme case I want 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.960
 that the paper is pink 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.990
 is that I came from the big time the foreground box with the wheel 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.990
 chromatic 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.540
 Why 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.150
 you put the color you want it's just below or above 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.160
 the color of the paper rather than having whites 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.160
 we are told that the color of the paper is not everything 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.190
 there I just chose a color in the 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.280
 not the colors it is necessary that it makes understand the author that this color 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.630
 must be the color of my paper 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.200
 and for that I simply go to the menu image up to the line 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.880
 paper colors 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.189
 16h at the end everything smiled when I saw on this line 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.709
 and now it's painless that the color of the paper is pink 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.369
 by the way 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.989
 I go so he works very well on our reality I add again 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.989
 without pixel on the left 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:22.499
 and normally the area that darling pink theater 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:26.469
 afp 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:27.529
 okay 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:30.419
 we will cancel the fear at all the time of work of which I was shipping 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:32.720
 cancel the freeze and promise white butterflies 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.720
 and add the work area 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.719
 so it's noticeable 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.719
 in the foreground box 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.859
 in the colors 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.569
 so I'm going to picture 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.459
 paper color 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.819
 the author knows that white paper now 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.969
 and I go back to add the work area 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.519
 and there they have on the other hand he will take the color of the paper 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.519
 all the work that I add 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:06.929
 without mercy of her 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.399
 so to find I'll put the pallets back in standard layout where 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:19.009
 all windows layout of palettes standard layout 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:25.059
 we will start to duplicate the pixels so it is absolutely necessary that in the 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:26.820
 palette of general tools of puncher 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.999
 it is the brush that they are active the brush in the focus to the chief town 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:32.639
 for others I take the title 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.449
 duplicator 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:37.179
 he dies opacity 

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:40.179
 must be 100% 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.180
 zina we meet does not know yet in any case what this success 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.959
 must position the meter so here the case and much higher 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.929
 thirty as a reference the skyline 

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:55.029
 so I'm positioning the red triangle the mouse pointer on the line 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:55.869
 horizon 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:57.400
 always for his touch control 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.939
 I click 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:01.729
 the author knows that I know in this place for comfort for all 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:03.439
 unstoppable title controls 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:07.219
 without children especially control do not support the pool pointer 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:11.669
 and at the game begins to move the mouse that drives the knife on him and I 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.669
 move but we see that I want Picard 7 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.849
 see 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:35.729
 at stake 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.729
 I can comment on the next race 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.270
 quickly done well l 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.270
 ap 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.580
 balances much more see that there are repetitions not too bad for the 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.509
 dandelions a voice that drove the small groups to finish we can 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:58.270
 say 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.580
 random 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.480
 takes again the ass duplicator laugh a little bring similar variations 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:04.960
 long time 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.960
 a temple takes from his bed he targets 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.620
 while we are in control 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.220
 I believe they are related hebbadj especially this control and I'm going in 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.770
 get back from here 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.400
 here 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.570
 so still a little 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.990
 in the air just now 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.729
 I want deeper and if everything is clearer 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.729
 I want to click here 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.370
 good it takes a little 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.059
 it's a little retouching 

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:39.059
 this one will put it next 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.699
 I was very rare 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.810
 we'll put a second goal but we can go get a second baby 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.629
 in 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:08.969
 a step the same without it no things to do 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:12.379
 tokyo yes but even twins are daily identical 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.610
 to fetch evidence a baby in another mpp photograph 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.150
 exactly what we are going to see how we can also enjoy pixels of a 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.639
 photo to another 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.650
 we will save this image on the hard drive for security reasons 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.950
 have to start all over again so think save under 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:33.529
 m 

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:36.919
 here he has also passed 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:39.919
 nothing more 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:41.969
 in vain 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:44.969
 and they trade on hard drives work 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.490
 sometimes it can be interesting too to reduce the opacity to bring 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:54.849
 blurred 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:58.569
 if we judge that the worst moment of his big night too much duplication that 

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:01.669
 can decrease not quote here while opacity two minutes 

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:06.129
 60% for example 

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:07.639
 and when I want to duplicate 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:10.430
 it was actually bringing more doubt 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.430
 I'm going to make the picture more complex 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.020
 we can bring blurring to the point by duplicating 

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:23.529
 on this possible if it is a site solution 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.960
 we must think 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.899
 that we can also 

00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:34.009
 make up their art 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:37.159
 use the tools of the golden spike of each site 

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:38.199
 other than 100%
