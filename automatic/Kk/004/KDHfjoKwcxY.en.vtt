00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.980 
support so I'm really happy with this
new<00:00:25.170> support<00:00:25.529> because<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:25.949> does<00:00:26.070> allow<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.310> to

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
new support because it does allow it to

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.240 
new support because it does allow it to
compete<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.019> lot<00:00:28.289> better<00:00:28.529> with<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.920> current

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
compete a lot better with the current

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.319 
compete a lot better with the current
meta<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.330> course<00:00:30.560> my<00:00:31.560> two<00:00:31.759> combos<00:00:32.759> for<00:00:33.210> my

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
meta so of course my two combos for my

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.940 
meta so of course my two combos for my
boss<00:00:33.540> vanguard<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.140> course<00:00:34.350> will<00:00:34.500> be<00:00:34.559> my<00:00:34.710> Zen

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
boss vanguard of course will be my Zen

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.430 
boss vanguard of course will be my Zen
Baku<00:00:35.309> from<00:00:36.000> extra<00:00:36.300> booster<00:00:36.540> 1<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.899> sure<00:00:37.110> Yuki

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
Baku from extra booster 1 and sure Yuki

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.299 
Baku from extra booster 1 and sure Yuki
so<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.489> think<00:00:38.790> these<00:00:38.850> two<00:00:39.710> combine<00:00:40.710> essentially

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
so I think these two combine essentially

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.030 
so I think these two combine essentially
creates<00:00:41.899> like<00:00:42.899> an<00:00:43.020> antimatter<00:00:43.500> version<00:00:43.620> of

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
creates like an antimatter version of

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.529 
creates like an antimatter version of
this<00:00:44.160> deck<00:00:44.340> which<00:00:44.579> kind<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.210> like<00:00:45.329> whatever

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
this deck which kind of like whatever

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.540 
this deck which kind of like whatever
furthers<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.739> deck<00:00:46.920> has<00:00:47.070> yeah

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
furthers this to this deck has yeah

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.920 
furthers this to this deck has yeah
without<00:00:47.700> further<00:00:47.940> ado<00:00:48.180> let's<00:00:48.390> actually<00:00:48.510> get

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
without further ado let's actually get

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.290

very important to search for those the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:13.060 
very important to search for those the
trigger<00:01:05.549> line<00:01:05.790> up<00:01:06.680> it's<00:01:07.680> gonna<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:10.189> four<00:01:11.189> crit

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
trigger line up it's gonna be four crit

trigger line up it's gonna be four crit
for<00:01:14.070> more<00:01:14.250> crit<00:01:15.650> for<00:01:16.650> draw<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.220> four<00:01:18.119> heal

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
for more crit for draw and four heal

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.929 
for more crit for draw and four heal
this<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.860> essentially<00:01:20.100> gonna<00:01:20.250> be<00:01:20.430> somewhat<00:01:20.820> of

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
this is essentially gonna be somewhat of

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.999 
this is essentially gonna be somewhat of
a<00:01:21.090> aggressive<00:01:21.900> beat<00:01:22.049> down<00:01:22.200> style<00:01:22.500> deck<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.860> mean

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
a aggressive beat down style deck I mean

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.260 
a aggressive beat down style deck I mean
eight<00:01:23.220> grit<00:01:23.430> for<00:01:23.580> draw<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.850> always<00:01:24.090> going<00:01:24.180> to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
eight grit for draw is always going to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.749 
eight grit for draw is always going to
be<00:01:24.330> very<00:01:24.540> very<00:01:24.869> standard<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.860> would<00:01:26.340> try<00:01:26.640> out

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
be very very standard I would try out

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.219 
be very very standard I would try out
twelve<00:01:27.000> crits<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.630> draw<00:01:27.780> triggers<00:01:28.080> is

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
twelve crits but the draw triggers is

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.090 
twelve crits but the draw triggers is
really<00:01:28.439> help<00:01:28.619> because<00:01:28.710> there's<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> lot<00:01:29.070> of

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
really help because there's a lot of

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.710 
really help because there's a lot of

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
to be able to draw into then moving on

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.140 
to be able to draw into then moving on
to<00:01:33.860> grade<00:01:34.860> ones<00:01:35.270> you<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.450> your<00:01:37.130> four<00:01:38.130> 8k<00:01:38.640> very

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
thousand in my personal opinion when it

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.679

that murakumo receive and set 9 is

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.560

and<00:02:13.090> then<00:02:13.209> you<00:02:13.300> have<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.540> overwork<00:02:13.900> arts<00:02:14.370> so

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
and then you have to overwork arts so

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.330 
and then you have to overwork arts so
very<00:02:16.060> simple<00:02:16.360> all<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:16.660> do<00:02:16.840> is<00:02:17.050> when<00:02:17.260> when<00:02:18.220> you

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
very simple all you do is when when you

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.110 
very simple all you do is when when you
place<00:02:18.550> it<00:02:18.640> on<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.760> field

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
place it on the field

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.339 
place it on the field
you<00:02:19.330> just<00:02:19.750> shadow<00:02:20.380> clone<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.970> copy<00:02:21.970> card<00:02:22.750> on<00:02:23.170> the

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
you just shadow clone a copy card on the

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.780 
you just shadow clone a copy card on the
field<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:23.800> if<00:02:23.920> you<00:02:24.040> have<00:02:24.160> like<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.310> grade-two<00:02:24.670> on

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
field so if you have like a grade-two on

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.990 
field so if you have like a grade-two on
the<00:02:24.880> field<00:02:25.060> copy<00:02:25.690> another<00:02:25.989> one<00:02:26.340> just<00:02:27.340> superior

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
the field copy another one just superior

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.400 
the field copy another one just superior
call<00:02:28.239> one<00:02:28.420> from<00:02:28.569> your<00:02:28.630> deck<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.080> goes<00:02:29.260> in<00:02:29.349> the

three you do want to ride first because
his<00:03:42.069> ko<00:03:42.220> I'm<00:03:42.519> very<00:03:42.730> good<00:03:42.880> skill<00:03:43.620> his<00:03:44.620> skill<00:03:44.920> is

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
his ko I'm very good skill his skill is

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.860 
his ko I'm very good skill his skill is
at<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:45.730> beginning<00:03:45.850> of<00:03:46.239> your<00:03:46.359> opponent's<00:03:46.690> ride

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
at the beginning of your opponent's ride

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.629 
at the beginning of your opponent's ride
phase<00:03:47.109> if<00:03:47.440> your<00:03:47.680> opponent<00:03:48.040> has<00:03:48.069> a<00:03:48.160> great<00:03:48.459> three

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
phase if your opponent has a great three

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.460 
phase if your opponent has a great three
or<00:03:48.730> greater<00:03:48.760> vanguard<00:03:49.359> he<00:03:49.810> has<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:50.049> discard<00:03:50.350> a

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
or greater vanguard he has to discard a

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.620 
or greater vanguard he has to discard a
card<00:03:50.500> if<00:03:50.950> not<00:03:51.250> then<00:03:51.670> he<00:03:51.819> cannot<00:03:52.060> normal<00:03:52.450> ride

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
card if not then he cannot normal ride

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.750 
card if not then he cannot normal ride
so<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.440> whole<00:03:53.590> point<00:03:53.829> of<00:03:53.920> that<00:03:53.980> is<00:03:54.100> like<00:03:54.579> if

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
so the whole point of that is like if

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.220 
so the whole point of that is like if
you're<00:03:54.910> dealing<00:03:55.000> with<00:03:55.120> a<00:03:55.209> cross<00:03:55.450> ride<00:03:55.690> your

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
you're dealing with a cross ride your

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.349 
you're dealing with a cross ride your
opponent<00:03:56.650> has<00:03:56.829> to<00:03:57.069> discard<00:03:57.340> a<00:03:57.459> card<00:03:57.489> because

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
opponent has to discard a card because

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.180 
opponent has to discard a card because
if<00:03:58.810> your<00:03:58.930> opponent<00:03:59.290> cross<00:03:59.680> rides<00:03:59.950> they're

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
if your opponent cross rides they're

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.129 
if your opponent cross rides they're
technically<00:04:00.579> taking<00:04:00.970> a<00:04:01.090> minus<00:04:01.480> one<00:04:01.840> because

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
technically taking a minus one because

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.259 
technically taking a minus one because
they're<00:04:02.380> losing<00:04:02.590> third<00:04:02.829> negging<00:04:03.190> one<00:04:03.370> so<00:04:04.120> then

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
they're losing third negging one so then

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.020 
they're losing third negging one so then
the<00:04:04.600> Zen<00:04:04.750> baku<00:04:05.079> forces<00:04:05.470> an<00:04:05.620> extra<00:04:05.889> card<00:04:06.100> so<00:04:06.370> it

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
the Zen baku forces an extra card so it

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.160 
the Zen baku forces an extra card so it
kind<00:04:07.269> of<00:04:07.329> puts<00:04:07.569> everyone<00:04:07.810> in<00:04:07.840> awkward

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
kind of puts everyone in awkward

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.809 
kind of puts everyone in awkward
situation<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.859> can<00:04:09.160> also<00:04:09.310> punish<00:04:09.670> players

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
situation and can also punish players

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.759 
situation and can also punish players
who<00:04:10.180> can<00:04:10.450> who<00:04:10.720> do<00:04:10.900> not<00:04:11.079> ride<00:04:11.319> their<00:04:11.530> ideal

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
who can who do not ride their ideal

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.289 
who can who do not ride their ideal

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.710 
it's twenty thousand shield for 1
counter<00:05:13.590> blast<00:05:13.620> and<00:05:14.039> one<00:05:14.490> card<00:05:14.759> so<00:05:15.240> there's

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
counter blast and one card so there's

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.999 
counter blast and one card so there's
plenty<00:05:15.870> of<00:05:16.080> times<00:05:16.259> in<00:05:16.440> testing<00:05:16.830> where<00:05:16.979> I

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
plenty of times in testing where I

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.670 
plenty of times in testing where I
essentially<00:05:17.910> either<00:05:18.570> to<00:05:18.810> pass<00:05:19.020> my<00:05:19.349> opponent's

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
essentially either to pass my opponent's

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.920 
essentially either to pass my opponent's
Vanguard<00:05:19.979> or<00:05:20.070> no<00:05:20.310> pass<00:05:20.550> it<00:05:20.820> so<00:05:21.300> it's<00:05:21.539> a<00:05:21.599> really

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
Vanguard or no pass it so it's a really

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.060 
Vanguard or no pass it so it's a really
solid<00:05:22.050> card<00:05:22.349> because<00:05:22.530> you<00:05:22.590> must<00:05:22.800> stronger

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
solid card because you must stronger

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.740 
solid card because you must stronger
defense<00:05:23.340> than<00:05:23.550> mendala<00:05:24.060> Lord<00:05:24.330> and<00:05:24.479> it's<00:05:24.690> a

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
defense than mendala Lord and it's a

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.409 
defense than mendala Lord and it's a
lemon<00:05:24.870> kay<00:05:25.110> so<00:05:25.740> with<00:05:26.550> these<00:05:26.699> two<00:05:26.759> combined

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
lemon kay so with these two combined

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.010 
lemon kay so with these two combined
I<00:05:28.580> call<00:05:29.580> it<00:05:29.669> antimatter<00:05:30.030> because<00:05:30.389> it<00:05:30.840> can

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
I call it antimatter because it can

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.689 
I call it antimatter because it can
prevent<00:05:31.229> your<00:05:31.380> point<00:05:31.620> it<00:05:32.010> can<00:05:32.190> put<00:05:32.430> your<00:05:32.550> pull

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
prevent your point it can put your pull

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:33.950 
prevent your point it can put your pull
and<00:05:32.849> put<00:05:32.970> in<00:05:33.030> an<00:05:33.090> awkward<00:05:33.360> situation<00:05:33.479> when

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
and put in an awkward situation when

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.320 
and put in an awkward situation when
they<00:05:34.050> when<00:05:34.380> they<00:05:34.610> try<00:05:35.610> to<00:05:35.639> cross<00:05:35.729> right<00:05:36.030> or

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
they when they try to cross right or

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.170 
they when they try to cross right or
like<00:05:37.050> I<00:05:37.169> said<00:05:37.320> it<00:05:37.440> punishes<00:05:37.740> players<00:05:38.010> who<00:05:38.580> miss

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
like I said it punishes players who miss

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.390 
like I said it punishes players who miss
who<00:05:39.630> end<00:05:39.810> up<00:05:39.900> riding<00:05:40.080> a<00:05:40.320> nine<00:05:40.650> ideal<00:05:41.159> great

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
who end up riding a nine ideal great

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.800 
who end up riding a nine ideal great
three<00:05:41.610> such<00:05:41.909> a<00:05:41.940> you<00:05:42.090> know<00:05:42.120> pal<00:05:42.389> and<00:05:42.510> Metis<00:05:42.720> and

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
three such a you know pal and Metis and

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.399 
three such a you know pal and Metis and
they'll<00:05:43.110> be<00:05:43.909> you<00:05:44.909> know<00:05:45.110> midnight<00:05:46.110> invaders

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409 
they'll be you know midnight invaders

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:47.990 
they'll be you know midnight invaders
and<00:05:46.530> pill<00:05:46.680> moon<00:05:46.860> and<00:05:47.010> such<00:05:47.159> so<00:05:47.430> it<00:05:47.849> really

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
and pill moon and such so it really

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.260 
and pill moon and such so it really
helps<00:05:48.300> to<00:05:48.979> to<00:05:49.979> add<00:05:50.099> more<00:05:50.310> I<00:05:50.729> guess<00:05:50.880> you<00:05:51.000> can<00:05:51.090> say

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
helps to to add more I guess you can say

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.420 
helps to to add more I guess you can say
salt<00:05:51.780> to<00:05:51.930> the<00:05:52.050> wound<00:05:52.260> when<00:05:53.099> they<00:05:53.190> were<00:05:53.250> your

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
salt to the wound when they were your

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.129 
salt to the wound when they were your
points<00:05:53.729> in<00:05:53.760> that<00:05:53.880> situation<00:05:54.509> and<00:05:54.690> then<00:05:54.930> you

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
points in that situation and then you

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:58.219 
points in that situation and then you
ride<00:05:55.320> sure<00:05:55.530> you<00:05:55.650> later<00:05:56.070> just<00:05:56.940> start<00:05:57.229> because

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
ride sure you later just start because

00:05:58.229 --> 00:05:59.390 
ride sure you later just start because
ideally<00:05:58.650> you're<00:05:58.830> supposed<00:05:59.009> to<00:05:59.039> be<00:05:59.220> able<00:05:59.280> to

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
ideally you're supposed to be able to

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.129 
ideally you're supposed to be able to
draw<00:05:59.580> into<00:05:59.699> her<00:05:59.880> later<00:06:00.060> took<00:06:00.630> multiple<00:06:01.020> copies

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
draw into her later took multiple copies

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.279 
draw into her later took multiple copies
so<00:06:01.560> these<00:06:01.680> right<00:06:01.889> her<00:06:02.039> and<00:06:02.220> then<00:06:02.699> you<00:06:02.789> just

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
so these right her and then you just

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:06.050 
so these right her and then you just
save<00:06:04.289> a<00:06:04.409> lot<00:06:04.530> of<00:06:04.560> cards<00:06:04.919> with<00:06:05.070> her<00:06:05.220> the<00:06:05.880> amount

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
save a lot of cards with her the amount

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.029 
save a lot of cards with her the amount
of<00:06:06.120> defense<00:06:06.419> she<00:06:06.570> provides<00:06:06.870> so<00:06:07.650> it's<00:06:07.860> a<00:06:07.889> very

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
of defense she provides so it's a very

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:09.260 
of defense she provides so it's a very
beatdown<00:06:08.370> style<00:06:08.639> deck<00:06:08.820> but<00:06:09.060> it's<00:06:09.180> very

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
beatdown style deck but it's very

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.839 
beatdown style deck but it's very
effective<00:06:09.599> very<00:06:10.020> consistent<00:06:10.610> for<00:06:11.610> what<00:06:11.759> it

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:11.849 
effective very consistent for what it

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:14.360 
effective very consistent for what it
does<00:06:12.030> so<00:06:12.570> this<00:06:12.750> really<00:06:12.900> no<00:06:13.110> special<00:06:13.949> tricks<00:06:14.220> or

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
does so this really no special tricks or

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.920 
does so this really no special tricks or
gimmicks<00:06:14.400> that<00:06:15.030> move<00:06:15.180> Akuma<00:06:15.479> may<00:06:15.659> be<00:06:15.720> known

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
gimmicks that move Akuma may be known

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.620 
gimmicks that move Akuma may be known
for<00:06:16.169> but<00:06:16.380> it's<00:06:17.340> very<00:06:17.520> simple<00:06:17.789> very<00:06:18.000> consistent

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
for but it's very simple very consistent

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.270 
for but it's very simple very consistent
and<00:06:18.750> gets<00:06:19.110> the<00:06:19.229> job<00:06:19.259> done<00:06:19.620> for<00:06:19.830> you<00:06:19.889> so<00:06:20.130> these

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
and gets the job done for you so these

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.770 
and gets the job done for you so these
cards<00:06:20.669> is<00:06:20.940> really<00:06:21.150> what<00:06:21.270> makes<00:06:21.419> these<00:06:21.539> deck

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
cards is really what makes these deck

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.700 
cards is really what makes these deck
makes<00:06:22.740> this<00:06:22.860> deck<00:06:23.039> so<00:06:23.280> yeah<00:06:24.020> overall<00:06:25.020> that's

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
makes this deck so yeah overall that's

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.550 
makes this deck so yeah overall that's
the<00:06:25.889> update<00:06:26.190> to<00:06:26.280> murakumo<00:06:26.699> I<00:06:27.509> think<00:06:28.199> like<00:06:28.440> with

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
the update to murakumo I think like with

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.839 
the update to murakumo I think like with
this<00:06:28.710> type<00:06:28.860> of<00:06:29.009> build<00:06:29.159> it's<00:06:29.400> gonna<00:06:29.550> really

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:29.849 
this type of build it's gonna really

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:32.270 
this type of build it's gonna really
help<00:06:29.970> the<00:06:30.419> deck<00:06:30.570> stand<00:06:31.050> up<00:06:31.229> to<00:06:31.349> the<00:06:31.440> meta<00:06:31.620> in
