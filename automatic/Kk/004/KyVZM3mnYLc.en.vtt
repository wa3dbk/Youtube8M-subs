00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.839
 Hello, I welcome you to it 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.090
 a wonderful little bonus video 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.469
 and I'll eventually have two 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.360
 or three in the no idea of 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.710
 immensely told me that i still have it 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.240
 never such a clicker game really 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.100
 have played very far and that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.270
 I stop it so I can 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.430
 would be interested in what happens if 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.020
 you play it far enough as it is 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.160
 By chance I just want it here 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.560
 I 've done that yet 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:31.710
 in the afternoon time will be taken two 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:34.770
 hours like that and we were not there yet 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.030
 so far well German and that the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.980
 people have made the game 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.540
 These are the things you always have to 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.969
 start yes yes now I have to sound 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.520
 okay, let's look at the number there 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.649
 above no idea what a number it 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.500
 are you money because you see how much 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:01:03.090
 harm the power the miracle shows there 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:06.320
 everything is rosy and the instructor there so much 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.460
 gold I have mentioned so much further 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.909
 and 1000 fighters behind me 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.320
 it 's all down so the number 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.869
 accepted and yes looks at the others 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.890
 really do that 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.330
 2007 already has it so i got myself 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.950
 let's show how much money I have okay 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.909
 Let's take the house where you have the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.770
 you can upgrade values 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.780
 pay money for it and men knows 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.220
 just nothing but ok because 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.350
 so now you realize what fits times 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.049
 but it is only at the very beginning of it 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.579
 there we try it so far 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.720
 that costs okay the attack cost 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:46.130
 between palette fucking 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.810
 It is too expensive for me and my strength 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.970
 has risen further is what I made 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.410
 have to come this far 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.900
 Everyone tries in the game so first 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.160
 even though that is that 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.280
 bullshit also the rent if you have the 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.440
 upgrade that gets so strong it's called what 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.600
 one should burn on the blogs are what 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.970
 I gave her on 28 so many of them 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.830
 be formed then this tyler 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.660
 matt can level up further and the mine 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.120
 and the guest does not really care 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.620
 and then you can do so incredibly 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.690
 city ​​will take so long 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:20.510
 and let's go and have a fighter okay 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:26.720
 has six million 169 not 61 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.560
 million 695 1775 u11 my god 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.480
 units 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:37.630
 that was the fight so complete 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:40.900
 far we go the wilderness completed 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.190
 death trap death trap oh my god 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.320
 All dead, I still believe it 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.320
 to witness that someday an adversary 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.440
 I 've just seen something from 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.760
 the opponents very very short 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.590
 yes sometimes you can see the very short 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.100
 fight screen but overall i want 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.230
 time to say I think we can for on 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.959
 some that the opponents quite nicely 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.100
 fast then everyone and that get that 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.140
 never become as strong as I decided 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.959
 By the way, not all of me at that time 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.510
 Make 3000 fights for it or 300 like that 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.360
 completed countries of which I 123 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.210
 from and on the fight 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:22.180
 No idea 1200 you could afterwards 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:24.710
 already fighting 1200 and may not because 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.930
 that's important for three years 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.340
 but rather annoying it looks like this 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.130
 play out if you played two movies 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.210
 it has got to the absurdity I am 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.750
 sure that many are still there 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.490
 are much further than me but you can 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.900
 it's all right you can already prove by 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.720
 you just continue on the fields 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.130
 but look at the number fits 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.900
 not even as it does not fit up there 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.610
 Incidentally, play more one-sided too 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.380
 can also stop me because it is not 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.810
 motivation has more for me because of me 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.590
 do not see how strong I am but me 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.800
 get stronger 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:04:01.940
 Oh yes, that's just the way it is 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:05.770
 the awesome yes i want to say mine 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.770
 Addendum to good night
