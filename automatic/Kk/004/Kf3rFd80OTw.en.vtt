00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.550
 Welcome to Miami 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.370
 So my favorite corpse is 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.350
 of course the last corpse clearly 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.800
 More time saved the timeless movie 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.379
 took 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.379
 the drawings in question 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.800
 we have to wait with american habits 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.470
 Once you have sat or sat 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.360
 also drawn in detail and had the 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.580
 highly dramatic story in the robot 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.410
 He founds many easy google 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.090
 had blackout and himself in his 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.970
 the two is determined thing is 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.860
 dreadfully argue very much 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.140
 very comic moderately so a good one 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.680
 comic book adaptation or the jogger at the end 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.680
 was not like that 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.469
 No 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.810
 maybe I am a country 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.160
 In between I would reach 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.160
 I'm sure if something happens 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:37.290
 on my bike and say so 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.290
 service connection 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.100
 if to entertain the states so 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.510
 a decent at the table like him 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.630
 should be and I will probably 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.890
 rather, a few increase so many 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.200
 ask questions about life that it is 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.330
 I do not know everything about him and 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.190
 because yes he knows absolutely that is so 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.380
 was not interrogated what to do 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.870
 would be about me and i would be mine 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.500
 that sounds very flat because the relative 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.500
 women 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:17.239
 the most difficult question because millions so 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.819
 if there are many dead it is my home 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.439
 that is rich because you can every day 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.519
 discover water so Berlin is yes 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.519
 really and giving away 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.060
 play games in Charlottenburg, of course 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.850
 the comic of father and son that were 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.010
 the first comics I had 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.540
 And that is an extension and would have in 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.530
 Berlin 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.120
 drawn but there I still 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.870
 no sweet and on the shelf why not 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.870
 to donate 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.370
 That's why you should ask what you draw 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.770
 So now I could be one of the three 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.500
 Suit roles in the theater are what they are 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.870
 relatively normal suits in the neck 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.730
 madness, it's more like one with his 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.380
 Vokuhila then I did not think so 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.860
 Exciting, I said I 'll do it 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:18.270
 here such a small theater occurs 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.780
 grin and say the list of things the 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.780
 I still do 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:33.530
 This recognizes this picture is quite 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:38.400
 intended 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:40.670
 and this is the country I can do that 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.670
 do not resist 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.520
 Nothing came up here so good me 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.790
 would like to be the third again 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.880
 play or soda especially since it too and then 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.260
 I thought only one always found it 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.670
 funny to call especially where the 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.709
 Santa fell from the sky 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.959
 does not quite agree 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.959
 complete miscast 1 2 at night man 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.220
 the but I find that more
