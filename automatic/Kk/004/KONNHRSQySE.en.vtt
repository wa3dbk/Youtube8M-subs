does that translate into some of these

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.580 
does that translate into some of these

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
compared to let's say going through an

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.430 
compared to let's say going through an
NC<00:02:12.360> double-a<00:02:12.690> tournament<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:13.140> it

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
even added a little bit more elevated

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.340 
even added a little bit more elevated
level<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.210> is<00:02:15.360> because<00:02:15.540> everybody<00:02:16.050> here<00:02:16.260> is

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
level it is because everybody here is

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.660 
level it is because everybody here is
the<00:02:16.500> best<00:02:16.680> one<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.130> best<00:02:17.310> part<00:02:17.490> in<00:02:17.550> their

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
it's kind of multiply the pressures I'm

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.850 
it's kind of multiply the pressures I'm
in<00:02:27.330> layer<00:02:27.480> birds<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.930> course<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.290> dannion

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280

just you know the fact that I play hard
I<00:03:17.370> think<00:03:17.580> I've<00:03:17.670> about<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:17.940> high<00:03:18.270> basketball<00:03:18.600> IQ

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
I think I've about a high basketball IQ

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.030 
I think I've about a high basketball IQ
willing<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.459> take<00:03:20.550> charge<00:03:20.880> charges<00:03:21.920> just<00:03:22.920> do

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
willing to take charge charges just do

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.920 
willing to take charge charges just do
the<00:03:23.100> little<00:03:23.280> things<00:03:23.459> really<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.940> go<00:03:24.780> from

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
the little things really and go from

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.470 
the little things really and go from
there<00:03:25.110> so<00:03:25.590> so<00:03:26.070> what<00:03:26.670> have<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:26.820> been<00:03:26.910> projected

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
there so so what have you been projected

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.240 
there so so what have you been projected
as<00:03:27.570> far<00:03:27.780> as<00:03:27.930> potentially<00:03:28.739> where<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:29.040> might<00:03:29.220> go

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
as far as potentially where you might go

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.250 
as far as potentially where you might go
in<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.640> draft<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.150> also<00:03:30.480> where<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.050> might

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
in the draft and also where you might

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.440 
in the draft and also where you might
play<00:03:31.530> position<00:03:32.400> wise<00:03:32.520> when<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.820> get<00:03:32.940> in<00:03:33.060> I

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
play position wise when you get in I

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.479 
play position wise when you get in I
think<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:33.959> could<00:03:34.110> be<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.230> three<00:03:34.860> or<00:03:35.130> a<00:03:35.190> stretch

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
think I could be a three or a stretch

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.860 
think I could be a three or a stretch
for<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.940> think<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.239> other<00:03:36.360> two<00:03:36.480> positions<00:03:36.840> I

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
for I think the other two positions I

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.170 
for I think the other two positions I
could<00:03:36.989> definitely<00:03:37.110> play<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.739> then<00:03:38.040> in<00:03:38.940> terms

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
could definitely play and then in terms

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.820 
could definitely play and then in terms
of<00:03:39.360> being<00:03:39.510> drafted<00:03:39.690> I've<00:03:40.350> only<00:03:40.470> had<00:03:40.590> three

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
of being drafted I've only had three

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.530 
of being drafted I've only had three
workouts<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:41.730> draft<00:03:41.940> comments<00:03:42.360> coming

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
workouts and the draft comments coming

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.850 
workouts and the draft comments coming
up<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:42.780> got<00:03:42.900> invited<00:03:43.050> to<00:03:43.170> that<00:03:43.320> so<00:03:43.530> that's<00:03:43.650> good

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
up I got invited to that so that's good

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.740 
up I got invited to that so that's good
but<00:03:44.610> I<00:03:45.120> think<00:03:45.239> it's<00:03:45.330> still<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.510> little<00:03:45.600> too

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
but I think it's still a little too

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.820 
but I think it's still a little too
early<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:46.019> tell<00:03:46.230> I've<00:03:46.440> gotten<00:03:46.650> good<00:03:46.769> feedback

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
early to tell I've gotten good feedback

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.470 
early to tell I've gotten good feedback
I've<00:03:47.519> played<00:03:47.760> well<00:03:47.910> in<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.030> workouts<00:03:48.360> I've

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480
