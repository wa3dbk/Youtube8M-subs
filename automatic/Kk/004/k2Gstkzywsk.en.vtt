00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.530
 hello and welcome to this suite 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.850
 third phase of the game starts because captain I was talking like a fight 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.400
 personal and that it scares me to stéphanie girls it's me not 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.709
 will not comment forgotten 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.589
 the Caen have recently played their game by the Paris club by the father 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:20.350
 Christmas I have lots of videos that pile up and 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.510
 to overcome these six cable runs the technical criteria is 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.609
 a know-how 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.620
 so sir victoria of sweden how to drive the school how the conflict is going 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.470
 last 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.340
 so stressful first 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.220
 to know if it will arrive but would also be done the vietnam the playbook 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.410
 faymann and learn to reindeer croft so we have other options 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.130
 traffic 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.590
 clarification 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.890
 what is certain of what it is about 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.630
 this process also marked in the foot of the video 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.440
 either it is marked on the top left following the heavy rains 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.750
 so to configure in fact very simple when not playing with the afp under 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.840
 empty 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.400
 usually that's only the purse r of this school 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.100
 if these two contracts is to be emphasized and then you go in all directions which 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.100
 is amazing mood traffics then because it's a lot 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.100
 you know rescued healthy 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.760
 to stabbed enfield is ran all the meetings that that's what you 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.670
 want 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.920
 you do not touch society 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.380
 do not touch anything 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.810
 but against 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.970
 there you will touch something 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.410
 its simplicity is that the commands of the mouse before this summer 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.240
 it was 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.240
 and stuff like that 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.920
 what you traded his share at pittsford to the 1 6% look up 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.280
 and arrow keys of the bo 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.409
 following the suicide of one of his horses is on the right 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.050
 the players which is a minimum double if you are in the shit 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.980
 after the happy touch not except sarah the art of worries 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.209
 the tiny ships on the mouse so it's pretty simple summer 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.269
 significant and social to whoever is here still producing said 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.099
 consider that what happened happened live the species 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.319
 I use the key ctrl our parents it's also a configuration it's 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.450
 like from the ecomuseum earlier luck 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.779
 for until the lifting 

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:28.269
 you can very well but what happens that the space is not in 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:28.999
 the list 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:31.899
 because I have not at all 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:36.390
 so for bp like every project that had spread secondary shot 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.110
 as it says so well if the lists of missiles is who this time it is 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.110
 when it must be said that it is this one 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:47.109
 our societies 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.939
 it also depends on the cost of transport on all also grow 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:50.799
 other 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.519
 since a few years a sequel 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.050
 so that means that once all this is done we will go from the 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.469
 theory of practice but to move on as I do not know this thing the 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.529
 compass trend tct to it that was allotted 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.349
 who will leave one of his sales earlier 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.959
 so it's to change from what 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.379
 I speak we are disappointed by the fate maybe can 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.819
 change something 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.999
 all that will make it in France like that 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:20.999
 or its sensitivity in all its forms not at all 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.219
 go ahead 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:28.919
 facebook intends to move from theory to practice here serve them mid-October 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.129
 he's crazy about progressive rock 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.539
 lavalard so it's him find a priest went to wait 

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:38.559
 several seasons 

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:41.989
 there is finally a chopper that I could I do not know what they call tulle 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.339
 asked one hour places 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:50.499
 the place where no one vaccinated will tell us to allow you to 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:53.499
 follow the first straight strokes of man 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:01.329
 so here's nice guy benoit labonté conceded that you're back door the 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:07.099
 lack of fundamentals afterwards seem pretty cool enough to give 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.519
 blow it was like that counts by tons their concert to block it 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.189
 plant 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:17.229
 the rd8 football leisurely rba bar speed and tender and 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.590
 December in Athens 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.219
 3 his ambition you'll learn how to make it go just perfect march 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:31.180
 for all that is not lost hand in the pocket amounts promised a pool 

00:04:31.179 --> 00:04:33.029
 proglio blood 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:36.989
 inside that's why we're getting ready for the final climb 

00:04:36.989 --> 00:04:39.989
 gently 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:45.819
 here it is in teams the artistic quality by day the one that means 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.120
 a little roughed up 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.499
 at the club of the capital is 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:52.630
 it is not serious 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.340
 afraid to make cures 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.340
 because in fact the costs of the blow of bluff 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:02.300
 castleguay who put ko that arise yet you realize 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.809
 foursquare then yoyo rapal airplay fresh snow at mans in another 

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:09.020
 video 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.809
 advanced transport pretty much the same thing 

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:12.979
 for that 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.969
 hugely faster and to change the skin type you press foot off 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:21.050
 will not touch the good people but what happens here and here useful 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:26.889
 it is necessary that bercy watch the video but I think you liked it I confess to be 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:27.330
 a little 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.680
 time since it's a plus 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.740
 the party of ancient china or the primaries of what 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.550
 and that's true 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.930
 not many people who are going to watch this so 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.509
 thanks to 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:38.270
 nobody
