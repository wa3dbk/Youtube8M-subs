back<00:00:35.949> up<00:00:36.130> the<00:00:36.219> hill<00:00:36.399> so<00:00:36.910> I<00:00:36.940> thought<00:00:37.180> if<00:00:37.270> we

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
back up the hill so I thought if we

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.250 
back up the hill so I thought if we
combine<00:00:37.690> this<00:00:37.930> plus<00:00:38.770> of<00:00:38.950> this<00:00:39.070> equals<00:00:40.000> this<00:00:40.260> me

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
combine this plus of this equals this me
