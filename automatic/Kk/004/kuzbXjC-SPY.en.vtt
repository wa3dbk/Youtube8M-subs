his<00:03:26.459> level<00:03:26.609> 2<00:03:26.879> is<00:03:27.030> really<00:03:27.180> good<00:03:27.449> because<00:03:27.509> it'll

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
his level 2 is really good because it'll

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.839 
his level 2 is really good because it'll
go<00:03:27.959> across<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.919> map<00:03:29.099> I<00:03:29.250> don't<00:03:29.400> think<00:03:29.549> it<00:03:29.669> has<00:03:29.819> a

it's he's hard to use sometimes his

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.869 
it's he's hard to use sometimes his
level<00:04:01.079> one<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:01.469> really<00:04:01.949> overpowered<00:04:02.549> because

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
level one is really overpowered because

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.629 
level one is really overpowered because
it<00:04:03.030> fires<00:04:03.299> two<00:04:03.629> blasts<00:04:04.079> his<00:04:05.069> levels<00:04:05.340> two<00:04:05.489> is

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
it fires two blasts his levels two is

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.089 
it fires two blasts his levels two is
just<00:04:05.879> a<00:04:05.969> huge<00:04:06.479> dash<00:04:06.810> across<00:04:07.109> the<00:04:07.469> map<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:07.889> don't

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
just a huge dash across the map I don't

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.339 
just a huge dash across the map I don't
it<00:04:08.370> has<00:04:08.549> a<00:04:08.579> certain<00:04:09.120> range<00:04:09.269> but<00:04:09.479> it's<00:04:09.659> a<00:04:09.900> really

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
it has a certain range but it's a really

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.469 
it has a certain range but it's a really
really<00:04:10.500> long<00:04:10.859> range<00:04:11.189> and<00:04:11.459> then<00:04:12.090> his<00:04:12.209> level

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:12.479 
really long range and then his level

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.140 
really long range and then his level
three<00:04:12.719> he<00:04:12.840> basically<00:04:13.169> he's<00:04:13.590> in<00:04:13.739> limbo<00:04:13.919> and<00:04:14.400> he

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
three he basically he's in limbo and he

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.899 
three he basically he's in limbo and he
can<00:04:15.359> kill<00:04:15.509> everybody<00:04:16.310> nobody<00:04:17.310> else<00:04:17.609> can<00:04:17.729> move

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:17.909 
can kill everybody nobody else can move

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.180 
can kill everybody nobody else can move
so<00:04:18.150> you<00:04:18.209> know<00:04:18.449> coming<00:04:19.139> in<00:04:19.320> up<00:04:19.440> number<00:04:19.769> two<00:04:19.949> it

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
so you know coming in up number two it

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.149 
so you know coming in up number two it
is<00:04:20.219> the<00:04:20.579> legendary<00:04:21.060> Kratos<00:04:21.750> and<00:04:22.010> cradles<00:04:23.010> his

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
is the legendary Kratos and cradles his

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:24.620 
is the legendary Kratos and cradles his
moves<00:04:23.370> are<00:04:23.580> really<00:04:23.789> really<00:04:24.120> good<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.479> only

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
moves are really really good the only

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.330 
moves are really really good the only
reason<00:04:25.080> he's<00:04:25.260> not<00:04:25.289> at<00:04:25.650> number<00:04:25.860> one<00:04:26.039> is<00:04:26.159> because

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
reason he's not at number one is because

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.110 
reason he's not at number one is because
he's<00:04:26.490> way<00:04:26.789> too

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
he's way too

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.210 
he's way too
slow<00:04:27.449> they<00:04:28.139> can<00:04:28.320> easily<00:04:28.440> be<00:04:28.650> countered<00:04:29.190> by

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
slow they can easily be countered by

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.270 
slow they can easily be countered by
just<00:04:29.580> rolling<00:04:29.970> or<00:04:30.360> jumping<00:04:30.750> away<00:04:30.979> his<00:04:31.979> level

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
just rolling or jumping away his level

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.520
