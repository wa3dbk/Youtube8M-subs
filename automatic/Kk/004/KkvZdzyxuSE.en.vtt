very<00:05:27.699> very<00:05:27.939> thick<00:05:28.089> i<00:05:28.599> only<00:05:28.929> used<00:05:29.139> it<00:05:29.319> a<00:05:29.409> couple

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:29.439 
very very thick i only used it a couple

very very thick i only used it a couple
times<00:05:29.799> and<00:05:30.309> i<00:05:30.789> think<00:05:31.149> this<00:05:31.299> is<00:05:31.509> best<00:05:31.809> for<00:05:32.259> and

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:32.679 
times and i think this is best for and

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:34.799 
times and i think this is best for and
it<00:05:33.189> does<00:05:33.369> say<00:05:33.639> for<00:05:33.909> stretching<00:05:34.419> tightly

00:05:34.799 --> 00:05:34.809

it does say for stretching tightly
curled<00:05:35.079> hair<00:05:35.319> i<00:05:35.549> think<00:05:36.549> this<00:05:36.639> is<00:05:36.819> best<00:05:37.029> best

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
curled hair i think this is best best

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:40.769 
curled hair i think this is best best
for<00:05:37.749> a<00:05:38.009> tighter<00:05:39.009> curl<00:05:39.489> pattern<00:05:39.999> I<00:05:40.239> think<00:05:40.689> my

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:40.779 
for a tighter curl pattern I think my

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:42.179 
for a tighter curl pattern I think my
curl<00:05:41.019> pattern<00:05:41.349> is<00:05:41.469> a<00:05:41.499> little<00:05:41.709> bit<00:05:41.799> too<00:05:41.949> loose

00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:42.189 
curl pattern is a little bit too loose

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:43.709
