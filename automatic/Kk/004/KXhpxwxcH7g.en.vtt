00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.020 

there's<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.979> few<00:02:02.189> things<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.759> would<00:02:02.939> have

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
there's a few things that I would have

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.840 
there's a few things that I would have
changed<00:02:03.500> this<00:02:04.500> year<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.979> maybe<00:02:05.310> would<00:02:05.759> have

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
changed this year that maybe would have

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.139 
changed this year that maybe would have
made<00:02:06.060> things<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.479> little<00:02:06.600> bit<00:02:06.840> better<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:08.250> that

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
made things a little bit better and that

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.279 
made things a little bit better and that
would<00:02:09.390> be

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
would be

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.080 
would be
but<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:12.980> think<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.099> kids<00:02:14.250> are<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.519> little<00:02:14.760> bit

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
but I think the kids are a little bit

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.319 
but I think the kids are a little bit
more<00:02:15.329> into<00:02:15.719> it<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.019> year<00:02:16.969> it<00:02:17.969> was<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.090> little

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
more into it this year it was a little

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.080 
more into it this year it was a little
bit<00:02:18.599> shocking<00:02:18.959> I<00:02:19.230> think<00:02:19.849> until<00:02:20.849> all<00:02:20.969> of<00:02:21.000> a

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
bit shocking I think until all of a

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.959 
bit shocking I think until all of a
sudden<00:02:21.390> switch<00:02:21.689> from<00:02:22.049> a<00:02:22.530> regular<00:02:23.250> school<00:02:23.640> to

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:23.969 
sudden switch from a regular school to

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:27.140 
sudden switch from a regular school to

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
going to home school and staying home

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.759 
going to home school and staying home
and<00:02:27.989> having<00:02:28.650> their<00:02:29.069> strict<00:02:30.030> mom<00:02:30.390> be<00:02:31.379> their

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.130 
and having their strict mom be their
teacher<00:02:32.370> or<00:02:32.790> learning<00:02:33.209> coach<00:02:33.420> during<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.930> day

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
teacher or learning coach during the day

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.920 
teacher or learning coach during the day
and<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.859> need<00:02:35.099> to<00:02:35.280> learn<00:02:35.459> how<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.760> draw<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.599> line

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
and I need to learn how to draw the line

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.220 
and I need to learn how to draw the line
between<00:02:37.260> being<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.489> parent<00:02:38.939> and<00:02:39.180> being<00:02:39.389> the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
between being the parent and being the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.009 
between being the parent and being the
learning<00:02:40.650> coach<00:02:40.859> and<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.879> think<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.780> will

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
learning coach and I think that will

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.020 
learning coach and I think that will
make<00:02:43.230> things<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.739> little<00:02:43.889> bit<00:02:44.099> easier<00:02:44.489> on<00:02:44.549> me

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
make things a little bit easier on me

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.940 
make things a little bit easier on me
there<00:02:45.659> were<00:02:45.780> times<00:02:46.049> when<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.319> probably<00:02:46.650> should

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
there were times when I probably should

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.879 
there were times when I probably should
have<00:02:46.980> fallen<00:02:47.310> back<00:02:47.609> and<00:02:48.290> you<00:02:49.290> know<00:02:49.409> just<00:02:49.680> let

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
have fallen back and you know just let

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.970 
have fallen back and you know just let
them<00:02:50.069> learn<00:02:50.849> you<00:02:51.269> know<00:02:51.419> everything<00:02:52.049> instead

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
them learn you know everything instead

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.530 
them learn you know everything instead
of<00:02:53.159> you<00:02:53.400> know<00:02:53.430> being<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.819> parent<00:02:54.299> didn't

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
of you know being the parent didn't

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.449 
of you know being the parent didn't
constantly<00:02:55.230> all<00:02:55.379> day<00:02:55.620> long<00:02:55.889> ask<00:02:56.189> them<00:02:56.370> know

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
constantly all day long ask them know

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.920 
constantly all day long ask them know
did<00:02:56.669> you<00:02:56.760> do<00:02:56.909> this<00:02:57.090> did<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.299> do<00:02:57.510> that

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
did you do this did you do that

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.690 
did you do this did you do that
how<00:02:58.319> are<00:02:58.409> you<00:02:58.500> on<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.980> just<00:02:59.069> quizzing

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
how are you on that and just quizzing

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.099 
how are you on that and just quizzing
them<00:02:59.730> all<00:02:59.939> day<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.299> think<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.689> was<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.870> bit

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
them all day and I think that was a bit

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.830 
them all day and I think that was a bit
much<00:03:01.370> so<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.939> won't<00:03:03.150> be<00:03:03.299> happening<00:03:03.450> next

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
much so that won't be happening next

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.409 
much so that won't be happening next
year<00:03:04.019> hopefully<00:03:04.769> I'll<00:03:05.159> have<00:03:05.370> another<00:03:05.879> good

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:00.040 
I can see what the curriculum looks like
for<00:04:58.610> what<00:04:58.759> I've<00:04:58.849> learned<00:04:59.120> online<00:04:59.539> many<00:04:59.900> of<00:04:59.990> the

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
for what I've learned online many of the

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.890 
for what I've learned online many of the
curriculums<00:05:00.710> are<00:05:01.009> very<00:05:01.909> religious<00:05:02.539> based

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
curriculums are very religious based

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.029 
curriculums are very religious based
meaning<00:05:03.349> they<00:05:03.469> will<00:05:03.620> use<00:05:05.199> religious

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.010 

references<00:05:10.039> even<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:10.550> teach<00:05:10.759> math<00:05:11.120> so<00:05:11.659> I

references even to teach math so I

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.510 
references even to teach math so I
really<00:05:12.409> have<00:05:12.560> a<00:05:12.589> little<00:05:13.009> bit<00:05:13.129> of<00:05:13.219> a<00:05:13.279> problem

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
really have a little bit of a problem

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.980 
really have a little bit of a problem
with<00:05:13.729> that<00:05:13.909> I<00:05:13.969> don't<00:05:14.089> really<00:05:14.330> see<00:05:14.569> that<00:05:14.599> that's

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
with that I don't really see that that's

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.839
