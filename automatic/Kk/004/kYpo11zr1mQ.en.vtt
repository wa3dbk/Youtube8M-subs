00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.520 
instructors so having them make me feel
like<00:02:25.300> I<00:02:25.420> was<00:02:25.569> standing<00:02:25.750> still<00:02:26.110> on<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.350> track

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
like I was standing still on the track

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.080 
like I was standing still on the track
when<00:02:26.739> they<00:02:26.830> passed<00:02:27.069> me<00:02:27.280> was<00:02:27.459> inspiring

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
when they passed me was inspiring

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.069 
when they passed me was inspiring
I<00:02:28.239> think<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.720> aha<00:02:29.650> moment<00:02:30.130> for<00:02:30.190> me<00:02:30.519> was<00:02:31.299> I<00:02:31.750> was

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
I think the aha moment for me was I was

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.569 
I think the aha moment for me was I was
at<00:02:32.200> Weiss<00:02:32.350> ers<00:02:32.799> and<00:02:32.980> one<00:02:33.070> of<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.220> instructors

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579

at Weiss ers and one of the instructors
came<00:02:33.910> up<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.180> me<00:02:34.299> and<00:02:34.420> said<00:02:34.690> you<00:02:35.530> have<00:02:35.560> more

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
came up to me and said you have more

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.800 
came up to me and said you have more
lean<00:02:36.070> angle<00:02:36.250> on<00:02:36.519> your<00:02:36.549> bike<00:02:36.970> than<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.299> do<00:02:37.360> and

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
lean angle on your bike than I do and

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.930 
lean angle on your bike than I do and
I'm<00:02:38.440> probably<00:02:38.799> a<00:02:38.860> lot<00:02:39.010> faster<00:02:39.430> than<00:02:39.549> you<00:02:39.640> and

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
I'm probably a lot faster than you and

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.060 
I'm probably a lot faster than you and
he<00:02:40.030> showed<00:02:40.269> me<00:02:40.299> his<00:02:40.450> tires<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:41.590> he<00:02:41.709> had<00:02:41.890> like

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
he showed me his tires and he had like

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.340 
he showed me his tires and he had like
just<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.549> small<00:02:42.910> bit<00:02:43.390> of<00:02:43.420> unused<00:02:43.930> tire<00:02:44.140> on

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
just a small bit of unused tire on

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.740 
just a small bit of unused tire on
either<00:02:44.470> side<00:02:44.769> and<00:02:45.070> I<00:02:46.030> was<00:02:46.180> really<00:02:46.480> struck<00:02:46.720> by

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
either side and I was really struck by

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.039 
either side and I was really struck by
that<00:02:47.049> because<00:02:47.530> that's<00:02:48.160> what<00:02:48.430> it's<00:02:48.549> all<00:02:48.670> about

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
that because that's what it's all about

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.640 
that because that's what it's all about
going<00:02:50.049> faster<00:02:50.650> safer<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:52.350> what<00:02:53.350> he<00:02:53.530> was

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
going faster safer and what he was

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.620 
going faster safer and what he was
showing<00:02:53.859> me<00:02:54.010> was<00:02:54.280> you're<00:02:54.970> taking<00:02:55.480> way<00:02:55.600> too

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
showing me was you're taking way too

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.300 
showing me was you're taking way too
