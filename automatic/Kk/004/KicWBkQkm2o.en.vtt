00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.830
 Spain is in Estepona and is the work of 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.270

 intention now beat no record no 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.869
 but once finished we noticed 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.160
 how good is like a crawl there is a 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.920
 internet to see what work there was 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.990
 adapted dimensions and have not found 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.670
 no mural that has been made in Spain 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.109
 from this size the mural is a 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.240
 tribute to the fishermen of this 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.460
 Malaga municipality that is personalized 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.710
 in the figure of manuel aragón fisherman 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.920
 of 83 years portrayed in the mural 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.949
 divided towards the sea 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.440
 I was here then fish in all 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.440
 parts go well I 've gone 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.629
 well intended boat today has it in 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.100
 bike or the neighbors are delighted with 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.019
 the transformation that this has suffered 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.149
 set of buildings with more than one 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.750
 hundreds of homes in humor there are outside 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.750
 of work area 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.159
 from the neighborhood has been beautiful the 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.110
 drawings the truth to the murals that 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.970
 are divine we go three weeks has 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.070
 employed by the painter in this work that 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.110
 takes the day fishing day and occupies 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.940
 almost a thousand square meters drawing 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.580
 develops along 6 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.830
 six facades that are at distances 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.510
 different 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.700
 but from a point of view that is 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.820
 where where we have marked it on the ground 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.770
 the entire drawing comes together and it 's like it 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.250
 It is as if 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.100
 join the pieces and you see the scene in 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.320
 its totality has been very beautiful I did not 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.280
 I expected them to go and take all the 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.110
 blocks and the set of the photograph 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.609
 entire explosives to the truth is a 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.590
 very big change for what is the 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:50.900
 neighborhood that has always looked like this more 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.930
 dark and more 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.030
 and now in a different view a 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.740
 neighborhood that of Isabel Simón that adds to 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.240
 the route of artistic murals that the 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.270
 City Hall of Estepona launched 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.160
 in September 2012 and there are 16 the 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.770
 murals that have turned the streets of 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.340
 this locality in an original museum at 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.340
 outdoors
