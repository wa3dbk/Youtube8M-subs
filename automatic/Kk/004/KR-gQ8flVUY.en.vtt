00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
a little bit so I decide it's not the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.090 
a little bit so I decide it's not the
greatest<00:02:47.230> articulation<00:02:48.230> for<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.530> waste<00:02:48.800> but

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
greatest articulation for a waste but

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.070 
greatest articulation for a waste but
it's<00:02:49.340> you<00:02:49.610> know<00:02:49.640> if<00:02:49.850> there<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.120> nothing<00:02:50.480> he's

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
it's you know if there is nothing he's

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.840 
it's you know if there is nothing he's
got<00:02:51.290> like<00:02:51.470> these<00:02:51.650> ball<00:02:51.950> jointed<00:02:52.370> things<00:02:52.640> on

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
got like these ball jointed things on

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.060 
got like these ball jointed things on
his<00:02:52.940> legs<00:02:53.240> and<00:02:53.540> he<00:02:53.810> has<00:02:54.050> soft<00:02:54.680> material<00:02:55.220> on<00:02:55.400> his

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
his legs and he has soft material on his

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.670 
his legs and he has soft material on his
thing<00:02:58.070> so<00:02:58.370> he<00:02:58.489> can<00:02:58.700> get<00:02:59.209> his<00:02:59.270> legs<00:02:59.780> forward

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680

thing so he can get his legs forward
pretty<00:03:01.100> far<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.730> back<00:03:02.630> pretty<00:03:02.930> far<00:03:04.959> so<00:03:05.959> that's

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
pretty far and back pretty far so that's

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.250 
pretty far and back pretty far so that's
good<00:03:06.730> well<00:03:07.730> done<00:03:08.000> something<00:03:08.450> jazwares<00:03:08.930> could
