too<00:00:27.689> bad<00:00:28.189> 100<00:00:29.189> team<00:00:29.340> chemistry<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.240> leap

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
too bad 100 team chemistry for a leap

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.530 
too bad 100 team chemistry for a leap
that's<00:00:30.660> pretty<00:00:31.019> much<00:00:31.170> average<00:00:31.820> you<00:00:32.820> got<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
that's pretty much average you got the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.090 
that's pretty much average you got the
manager<00:00:33.989> Arsene<00:00:34.380> Wenger<00:00:34.590> there's<00:00:34.770> not<00:00:34.920> really

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
manager Arsene Wenger there's not really

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.229 
manager Arsene Wenger there's not really
any<00:00:36.800> legal<00:00:37.800> one<00:00:37.950> manager<00:00:38.340> than<00:00:38.640> he<00:00:38.760> thought<00:00:38.969> so

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
any legal one manager than he thought so

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.760 
any legal one manager than he thought so
i<00:00:39.300> thought<00:00:39.510> i<00:00:39.570> just<00:00:39.840> go<00:00:39.960> awesome<00:00:40.200> bang<00:00:40.559> yeah

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
i thought i just go awesome bang yeah

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.440 
i thought i just go awesome bang yeah
because<00:00:40.950> he<00:00:41.160> sort<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.399> closest<00:00:41.790> one<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.180> friend

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
because he sort of closest one to friend

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.560 
because he sort of closest one to friend
so<00:00:43.350> I'm<00:00:43.620> got<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.700> forward<00:00:45.120> toward<00:00:45.360> to

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
so I'm got the forward toward to

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.180 
so I'm got the forward toward to
formation<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.350> probably<00:00:46.590> got<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.010> thing

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
formation so you probably got this thing

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.470 
formation so you probably got this thing
look<00:00:47.340> cheaper<00:00:47.760> if<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.940> dump<00:00:48.090> different

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
look cheaper if you dump different

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.000 
look cheaper if you dump different
formation<00:00:48.989> but<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.620> thought<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.980> this

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
formation but I thought is this

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.040 
formation but I thought is this
formation<00:00:50.700> suits<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.329> meet<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.690> want<00:00:51.870> e

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
formation suits to meet you want e

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.500 
formation suits to meet you want e
anyway<00:00:52.980> um<00:00:53.250> that's<00:00:53.610> gone<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.910> team<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.180> got

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
anyway um that's gone to team you got

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.220 
anyway um that's gone to team you got
