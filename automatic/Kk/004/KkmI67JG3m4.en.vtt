00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
sure I get in the inside as well I'm

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.430 
sure I get in the inside as well I'm
just<00:02:17.390> going<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.570> go<00:02:17.630> my<00:02:17.840> fingers<00:02:18.200> through<00:02:18.410> it

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
just going to go my fingers through it

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.880 
just going to go my fingers through it

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
like this very slowly and very carefully

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.610 
like this very slowly and very carefully
because<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:23.480> whips<00:02:23.780> have<00:02:23.990> not<00:02:24.170> been<00:02:24.350> sealed

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
because the whips have not been sealed

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.949 
because the whips have not been sealed
and<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.190> do<00:02:25.250> not<00:02:25.520> want<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:26.800> pull<00:02:27.800> out<00:02:28.450> any<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.840> the

and I do not want to pull out any of the

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.900 
and I do not want to pull out any of the
am<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:32.390> is<00:02:32.420> definitely<00:02:32.810> soaked<00:02:33.470> through

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
am so this is definitely soaked through
