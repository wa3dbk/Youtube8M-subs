Objective C tutorials lesson 17 creating
the<00:00:11.340> implementation<00:00:12.179> which<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.870> methods

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
the implementation which is the methods

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.080 
the implementation which is the methods
now<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.750> interface<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.039> classes<00:00:17.520> public

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
now the interface is the classes public

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.210 
now the interface is the classes public
behavior<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:19.350> shows<00:00:19.590> what<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.949> class<00:00:20.160> is

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
behavior and it shows what the class is

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.890 
behavior and it shows what the class is
able<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.000> do<00:00:21.119> that's<00:00:21.330> what<00:00:21.510> we<00:00:21.600> were<00:00:21.689> talking

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
able to do that's what we were talking

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.810 
able to do that's what we were talking
about<00:00:21.930> last<00:00:22.080> lesson<00:00:22.710> but<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.039> implementation

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
about last lesson but the implementation

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.029 
about last lesson but the implementation
is<00:00:24.029> real<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.420> where<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.080> real<00:00:25.320> work<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
is real is where the real work of the

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.820 
is real is where the real work of the
class<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.609> actually<00:00:27.119> done<00:00:27.480> it's<00:00:28.140> also<00:00:28.500> where

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
class is actually done it's also where

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.529 
class is actually done it's also where
you<00:00:28.920> code<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> specific<00:00:29.699> functionality<00:00:30.179> of

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
you code the specific functionality of

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.479 
you code the specific functionality of
the<00:00:31.199> methods<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.890> don't<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.369> put

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
the methods and you don't have to put

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.639 
the methods and you don't have to put
the<00:00:32.550> methods<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> same<00:00:33.660> order<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.260> they

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
the methods in the same order that they

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.380 
the methods in the same order that they
are<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.399> interface<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.149> can<00:00:36.270> also

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
are in the interface and you can also

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.720 
are in the interface and you can also
code<00:00:36.750> methods<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:38.040> aren't<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
code methods that aren't in the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.569 
code methods that aren't in the
interface<00:00:40.219> now<00:00:41.219> um<00:00:41.780> first<00:00:42.780> things<00:00:43.370> when<00:00:44.370> you

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
interface now um first things when you

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.850 
interface now um first things when you
start<00:00:44.879> coding<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> implementation<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.440> need

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
start coding the implementation you need

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.250 
start coding the implementation you need
to<00:00:47.010> use<00:00:47.250> those<00:00:47.489> compiler<00:00:48.090> directives<00:00:48.809> like<00:00:49.079> we

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
to use those compiler directives like we

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.350 
to use those compiler directives like we
used<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.860> interface<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.940> put<00:00:51.180> at

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
used for the interface so you put at

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.299 
used for the interface so you put at
implementation<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.469> says<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
implementation and says this is the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.920 
implementation and says this is the
beginning<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.910> implementation<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.719> then

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
beginning of the implementation and then

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.920 
beginning of the implementation and then
you<00:00:55.050> put<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.440> name<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> class<00:00:56.629> that<00:00:57.629> you

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
you put the name of the class that you

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.630 
you put the name of the class that you
are<00:00:58.079> implementing<00:00:58.559> from<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.370> case

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
are implementing from in this case

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.479 
are implementing from in this case
budget<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:01.050> at<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.559> end<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.980> put<00:01:02.309> at

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
budget and then at the end you put at

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.030 
budget and then at the end you put at
and<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.570> says<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.530> end<00:01:04.739> of

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
and and says this is the end of

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.600 
and and says this is the end of
implementation<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.270> class<00:01:07.430> now<00:01:08.430> we're

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
implementation of the class now we're

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.219 
implementation of the class now we're
just<00:01:08.760> going<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.909> be<00:01:09.030> going<00:01:09.150> over<00:01:09.420> one<00:01:09.810> method

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
just going to be going over one method

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.750 
just going to be going over one method
in<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.530> keynote<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.250> method<00:01:11.610> is

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
in this keynote and that method is

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.050 
in this keynote and that method is
create<00:01:12.270> budget<00:01:12.960> now<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.470> first<00:01:13.830> line<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
create budget now the first line is the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.030 
create budget now the first line is the
exact<00:01:15.420> same<00:01:15.659> thing<00:01:15.960> as<00:01:16.170> what's<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
exact same thing as what's in the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.810 
exact same thing as what's in the
interface<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:19.320> how<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.100> first

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
interface and it's like how the first

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.520 
interface and it's like how the first
line<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.630> function<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.500> function

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
line of a function is the function

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.490 
line of a function is the function
prototype<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.180> correlates<00:01:24.780> very<00:01:24.930> well

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
prototype so it correlates very well

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.399 
prototype so it correlates very well
there<00:01:25.680> now<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.430> down<00:01:27.090> below<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.570> see<00:01:27.780> those<00:01:27.990> two

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
there now a down below you see those two

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.160 
there now a down below you see those two
lines<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.950> code<00:01:29.369> exchange<00:01:30.210> rate<00:01:30.600> equals<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
lines of code exchange rate equals and

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.060 
lines of code exchange rate equals and
exchange<00:01:31.500> rate<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.920> budget<00:01:32.310> equals<00:01:32.670> budget

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
exchange rate and budget equals budget

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.319 
exchange rate and budget equals budget
now<00:01:35.070> all<00:01:35.340> we're<00:01:35.610> doing<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.060> we're<00:01:36.299> just

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
now all we're doing is we're just

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.490 
now all we're doing is we're just
assigning<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.530> arguments<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:40.020> bar

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
assigning the arguments to the I bar

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.780 
assigning the arguments to the I bar
that<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.810> declared<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.200> interface<00:01:43.610> so<00:01:44.610> the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
that we declared in the interface so the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.880 
that we declared in the interface so the
I<00:01:44.820> bars<00:01:45.210> budget<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.869> argument<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.560> a

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
I bars budget in the argument is a

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.429 
I bars budget in the argument is a
budget<00:01:47.430> now<00:01:47.850> if<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.210> ibar<00:01:48.540> an<00:01:48.750> argument<00:01:49.259> had

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
budget now if the ibar an argument had

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.980 
budget now if the ibar an argument had
the<00:01:49.590> same<00:01:49.829> name<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.369> compiler<00:01:50.729> would<00:01:50.939> have<00:01:51.240> to

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
the same name the compiler would have to

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.080 
the same name the compiler would have to
decide<00:01:52.350> which<00:01:52.680> one<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:52.979> meant<00:01:53.399> when<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.759> try

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
decide which one you meant when you try

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.560 
decide which one you meant when you try
to<00:01:54.119> access<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.930> budget<00:01:55.320> variable<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.880> when

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
to access the budget variable so when

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.620 
to access the budget variable so when
you<00:01:57.719> named<00:01:57.990> our<00:01:58.759> arguments<00:01:59.759> like<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.119> budget

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
you named our arguments like a budget

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.469 
you named our arguments like a budget
explains<00:02:01.229> what<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> argument<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.219> for<00:02:02.610> but

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
explains what the argument is for but

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.410 
explains what the argument is for but
it's<00:02:03.659> not<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.110> same<00:02:04.439> exact<00:02:04.950> name<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:06.030> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
it's not the same exact name so the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.940 
it's not the same exact name so the
compiler<00:02:06.719> won't<00:02:07.079> get<00:02:07.200> confused<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.770> that's

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
compiler won't get confused so that's

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.199 
compiler won't get confused so that's
what<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.250> want<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.459> do<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.700> want<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:08.940> name<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
what you want to do you want to name the

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.540 
what you want to do you want to name the
arguments<00:02:09.599> close<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.770> what<00:02:11.160> you're<00:02:11.340> going<00:02:11.400> to

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
arguments close to what you're going to

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.240 
arguments close to what you're going to
assign<00:02:11.849> them<00:02:12.150> to

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
assign them to

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.070 
assign them to
but<00:02:13.400> not<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.790> exact<00:02:14.270> same<00:02:14.600> thing<00:02:14.900> because

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
but not the exact same thing because

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.680 
but not the exact same thing because
that<00:02:15.260> will<00:02:15.350> cause<00:02:15.560> problems<00:02:17.980> now<00:02:18.980> um<00:02:19.690> we're

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
that will cause problems now um we're

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.180 
that will cause problems now um we're
going<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.900> be<00:02:20.990> going<00:02:21.110> over<00:02:21.350> a<00:02:21.470> little<00:02:21.710> bit<00:02:21.890> more

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
going to be going over a little bit more

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.970 
going to be going over a little bit more
of<00:02:22.250> these<00:02:22.580> two<00:02:23.000> lines<00:02:23.330> of<00:02:23.510> code<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.200> there<00:02:24.740> you

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
of these two lines of code so there you

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.940 
of these two lines of code so there you
see<00:02:25.160> an<00:02:25.400> exchange<00:02:25.820> rate<00:02:25.970> is<00:02:26.590> assigned<00:02:27.590> to

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
see an exchange rate is assigned to

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.880 
see an exchange rate is assigned to
exchange<00:02:28.850> rate<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.240> a<00:02:29.480> budget<00:02:29.870> is<00:02:30.020> excited<00:02:30.740> is

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
exchange rate and a budget is excited is

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.490 
exchange rate and a budget is excited is
assigned<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.180> budget<00:02:32.780> now<00:02:33.110> in<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.320> previous

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
assigned to a budget now in the previous

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.920 
assigned to a budget now in the previous
lessons<00:02:34.280> we<00:02:34.400> did<00:02:34.580> this<00:02:34.730> in<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.030> following<00:02:35.600> way

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
lessons we did this in the following way

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.370 
lessons we did this in the following way
with<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.410> whole<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:37.450> struct<00:02:38.450> variable<00:02:38.959> dot

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
with the whole a struct variable dot

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.140 
with the whole a struct variable dot
exchange<00:02:39.950> rate<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.459> then<00:02:40.550> we<00:02:40.670> sign<00:02:40.940> the

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
exchange rate and then we sign the

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.050 
exchange rate and then we sign the
values<00:02:41.890> now<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:42.950> don't<00:02:43.220> want<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:43.490> do<00:02:43.610> this<00:02:43.730> now

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
values now you don't want to do this now

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
values now you don't want to do this now
because<00:02:44.860> assigning<00:02:45.860> values<00:02:46.450> directly<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.959> the

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
because assigning values directly to the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.760 
because assigning values directly to the
variables<00:02:48.770> is<00:02:48.980> not<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:50.060> good<00:02:50.330> idea<00:02:50.560> for<00:02:51.560> two

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
variables is not a good idea for two

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.820 
variables is not a good idea for two
reasons<00:02:52.180> because<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.360> I<00:02:53.390> bars<00:02:53.870> are<00:02:54.170> protected

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
reasons because the I bars are protected

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.460 
reasons because the I bars are protected
by<00:02:55.010> default<00:02:55.700> so<00:02:56.300> you<00:02:56.810> wouldn't<00:02:57.050> even<00:02:57.230> be<00:02:57.350> able

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
by default so you wouldn't even be able

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.260 
by default so you wouldn't even be able
to<00:02:57.680> access<00:02:57.830> them<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.610> if<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.820> did<00:02:59.090> it

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
to access them and if you did it

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.510 
to access them and if you did it
violates<00:02:59.780> encapsulation<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:00.860> we'll<00:03:01.310> go<00:03:01.489> over

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
violates encapsulation and we'll go over

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.400 
violates encapsulation and we'll go over
that<00:03:01.790> later<00:03:02.180> for<00:03:02.840> right<00:03:02.959> now<00:03:02.989> but<00:03:03.320> just

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
that later for right now but just

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.440 
that later for right now but just
remember<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.980> don't<00:03:04.220> want<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:04.459> assign<00:03:04.640> values

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
remember you don't want to assign values

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.720 
remember you don't want to assign values
directly<00:03:06.320> to<00:03:06.800> the<00:03:06.920> I<00:03:06.950> bars<00:03:08.620> now<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:10.100> rest<00:03:10.430> of

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
directly to the I bars now the rest of

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.720 
directly to the I bars now the rest of
the<00:03:10.880> methods<00:03:11.330> I<00:03:11.420> won't<00:03:11.660> go<00:03:11.840> over<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.890> next<00:03:13.459> two

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
the methods I won't go over the next two

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.900 
the methods I won't go over the next two
methods<00:03:14.800> because<00:03:15.800> they're<00:03:16.100> basically<00:03:16.760> the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
methods because they're basically the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.930 
methods because they're basically the
same<00:03:17.090> thing<00:03:17.450> as<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:21.230> functions<00:03:21.799> in<00:03:22.010> Lesson<00:03:22.760> 13

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
same thing as the functions in Lesson 13

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.410 
same thing as the functions in Lesson 13
but<00:03:23.930> we<00:03:24.049> will<00:03:24.350> move<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:24.890> NS<00:03:25.220> log<00:03:25.580> into<00:03:26.269> the

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
but we will move the NS log into the

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.100 
but we will move the NS log into the
methods<00:03:26.950> so<00:03:27.950> we<00:03:28.220> can<00:03:28.370> tell<00:03:28.640> exactly<00:03:28.940> when<00:03:29.540> the

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
methods so we can tell exactly when the

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.199 
methods so we can tell exactly when the
methods<00:03:30.739> are<00:03:30.980> implemented<00:03:31.670> now<00:03:31.820> so<00:03:32.030> that's

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
methods are implemented now so that's

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.130 
methods are implemented now so that's
the<00:03:32.299> only<00:03:32.390> really<00:03:32.930> different<00:03:33.440> thing<00:03:33.709> from<00:03:35.140> the

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
the only really different thing from the

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.070 
the only really different thing from the
functions<00:03:36.769> in<00:03:36.980> Lesson<00:03:37.730> 13<00:03:37.780> otherwise<00:03:38.780> they're

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
functions in Lesson 13 otherwise they're

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.699 
functions in Lesson 13 otherwise they're
the<00:03:39.380> exact<00:03:39.739> same<00:03:39.769> thing<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:41.110> of<00:03:42.110> course<00:03:42.140> at

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
the exact same thing and of course at

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.100 
the exact same thing and of course at
the<00:03:42.920> end<00:03:42.950> of<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.430> implementation<00:03:44.209> you<00:03:44.690> put<00:03:44.930> at

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
the end of the implementation you put at

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.160 
the end of the implementation you put at
end<00:03:45.560> and<00:03:46.070> says<00:03:46.370> hey<00:03:47.180> compiler<00:03:47.570> we're<00:03:47.930> done

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
end and says hey compiler we're done

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.090 
end and says hey compiler we're done
with<00:03:48.320> the<00:03:48.410> implementation<00:03:50.620> so<00:03:51.620> now<00:03:51.920> we're

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
with the implementation so now we're

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.650 
with the implementation so now we're
going<00:03:52.220> to<00:03:52.280> jump<00:03:52.820> into<00:03:53.060> Xcode<00:03:53.840> and<00:03:54.049> code<00:03:54.650> up<00:03:54.950> the

going to jump into Xcode and code up the

going to jump into Xcode and code up the
implementation<00:03:57.100> ok<00:03:58.100> so<00:03:58.160> here<00:03:58.700> we<00:03:58.820> are<00:03:58.940> in

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
below at end type at implementation and

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.860 
below at end type at implementation and
then<00:04:21.890> it<00:04:22.010> comes<00:04:22.220> up<00:04:22.490> with<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.000> format<00:04:23.450> for<00:04:23.840> the

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
then it comes up with the format for the

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.120 
then it comes up with the format for the
implementation<00:04:24.260> we're<00:04:24.860> going<00:04:24.979> to<00:04:25.070> be

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
implementation we're going to be

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.210 
implementation we're going to be
implementing<00:04:25.610> from

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
implementing from

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:33.860 
implementing from
budget<00:04:26.730> class<00:04:27.890> sup<00:04:28.890> here<00:04:29.610> we<00:04:29.730> go<00:04:29.850> I<00:04:32.330> its<00:04:33.330> void

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
budget class sup here we go I its void

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.940 
budget class sup here we go I its void
and<00:04:35.600> then<00:04:36.600> we're<00:04:36.840> going<00:04:36.960> to<00:04:37.020> first<00:04:37.440> start<00:04:37.590> off

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
and then we're going to first start off

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.160 
and then we're going to first start off
with<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.250> method<00:04:39.060> that<00:04:39.420> we<00:04:39.570> worked<00:04:39.810> with<00:04:39.960> in

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
with the method that we worked with in

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.080 
with the method that we worked with in
the<00:04:40.290> keynote<00:04:40.680> and<00:04:40.890> we're<00:04:41.580> just<00:04:41.760> going<00:04:41.910> to<00:04:41.940> be

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
the keynote and we're just going to be

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.630 
the keynote and we're just going to be
assigning<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.960> arguments<00:04:43.970> to<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.270> I<00:04:45.900> bars

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
assigning the arguments to the I bars

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.390 
assigning the arguments to the I bars
and<00:04:48.110> then<00:04:49.110> make<00:04:49.680> sure<00:04:49.710> it's<00:04:49.980> the<00:04:50.100> lowercase

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
and then make sure it's the lowercase

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.430 
and then make sure it's the lowercase
budget<00:04:50.970> and<00:04:51.410> then<00:04:52.410> assign<00:04:52.830> a<00:04:53.100> budget<00:04:53.730> to<00:04:53.940> it

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
budget and then assign a budget to it

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.050 
budget and then assign a budget to it
then<00:04:55.440> we're<00:04:55.620> done<00:04:55.830> with<00:04:56.220> that<00:04:56.580> method<00:04:58.790> now<00:04:59.790> on

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
then we're done with that method now on

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.850 
then we're done with that method now on
to<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.330> next<00:05:00.720> one<00:05:00.840> which<00:05:01.110> is<00:05:01.140> spend<00:05:01.620> dollars

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
to the next one which is spend dollars

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.020 
to the next one which is spend dollars
with<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.640> argument<00:05:03.120> of<00:05:03.690> dollars<00:05:04.230> and<00:05:05.030> we're

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
with the argument of dollars and we're

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.520 
with the argument of dollars and we're
just<00:05:06.180> going<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:06.450> subtract<00:05:08.510> dollars<00:05:09.510> from<00:05:10.200> the

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
just going to subtract dollars from the

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.880 
just going to subtract dollars from the
budget<00:05:11.160> and<00:05:11.250> then<00:05:11.520> reassign<00:05:12.330> that<00:05:12.810> value<00:05:13.320> to<00:05:13.860> a

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
budget and then reassign that value to a

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.800 
budget and then reassign that value to a
budget<00:05:14.490> and<00:05:14.580> then<00:05:14.880> we're<00:05:15.030> going<00:05:15.150> to<00:05:15.210> declare

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
budget and then we're going to declare

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.060 
budget and then we're going to declare
or<00:05:16.080> we're<00:05:16.320> going<00:05:16.440> to<00:05:16.500> show<00:05:16.740> this<00:05:16.920> in<00:05:17.450> NS<00:05:18.450> log<00:05:19.070> so

comma budget and then close that out
with<00:05:54.150> a<00:05:54.180> semicolon<00:05:54.930> and<00:05:55.260> then<00:05:55.919> we're<00:05:56.160> all<00:05:56.310> done

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
with a semicolon and then we're all done

with this method now the last method is

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.659 
with this method now the last method is
chant<00:06:03.030> or<00:06:03.240> charged<00:06:03.690> foreign<00:06:04.680> currency<00:06:05.390> and

chant or charged foreign currency and

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:16.370 
chant or charged foreign currency and
first<00:06:08.669> off<00:06:08.940> what<00:06:09.390> we<00:06:09.540> do<00:06:09.780> is<00:06:12.470> we<00:06:13.550> assign<00:06:15.380> well

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
first off what we do is we assign well

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.500 
first off what we do is we assign well
first<00:06:16.620> off<00:06:16.770> we<00:06:16.979> multiply<00:06:17.580> foreign<00:06:18.060> currency

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
first off we multiply foreign currency

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.980 
first off we multiply foreign currency
times<00:06:19.470> the<00:06:20.100> exchange<00:06:20.580> rate<00:06:20.700> and<00:06:21.030> then<00:06:21.810> we

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
times the exchange rate and then we

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.469 
times the exchange rate and then we
assign<00:06:22.350> it<00:06:22.530> to<00:06:22.560> the<00:06:22.890> exchange<00:06:23.479> transaction

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
assign it to the exchange transaction

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:27.230 
assign it to the exchange transaction
and<00:06:24.630> then<00:06:25.260> we<00:06:25.410> subtract<00:06:26.100> this<00:06:26.370> and<00:06:26.669> then

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
and then we subtract this and then

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.159 
and then we subtract this and then
reassign<00:06:28.050> the<00:06:28.410> value<00:06:28.890> to<00:06:29.790> we<00:06:30.240> subtract<00:06:30.990> it

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
reassign the value to we subtract it

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.839 
reassign the value to we subtract it
from<00:06:31.320> a<00:06:33.710> budget<00:06:34.710> and<00:06:34.800> then<00:06:34.950> we<00:06:35.070> re<00:06:35.430> sign<00:06:35.669> that

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:35.849 
from a budget and then we re sign that

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:37.300 
from a budget and then we re sign that
value<00:06:36.180> to<00:06:36.450> budget

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
value to budget

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.000 
value to budget
and<00:06:37.400> then<00:06:37.940> we<00:06:38.210> display<00:06:38.750> all<00:06:38.930> this<00:06:39.140> in<00:06:39.320> a<00:06:39.650> slog

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.010 
and then we display all this in a slog

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.690 
and then we display all this in a slog
so<00:06:40.190> this<00:06:40.370> is<00:06:40.520> exactly<00:06:41.120> like<00:06:41.650> what<00:06:42.650> we've<00:06:42.950> what

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
so this is exactly like what we've what

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.340 
so this is exactly like what we've what
we<00:06:43.880> did<00:06:44.120> back<00:06:44.660> in<00:06:44.720> Lesson<00:06:45.710> 13<00:06:46.660> so<00:06:47.660> charging

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.350 
we did back in Lesson 13 so charging

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.660 
we did back in Lesson 13 so charging
percent<00:06:49.160> up<00:06:49.280> to<00:06:49.460> F<00:06:49.610> in<00:06:49.820> foreign<00:06:51.670> currency

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:52.670 
percent up to F in foreign currency

00:06:52.670 --> 00:07:01.630 
percent up to F in foreign currency
leaves<00:06:54.580> dollar<00:06:55.580> sign<00:06:56.830> %<00:06:57.830> 2f<00:06:58.700> and<00:07:00.640> foreign

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:01.640 
leaves dollar sign % 2f and foreign

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.130 
leaves dollar sign % 2f and foreign
currency<00:07:02.140> comma<00:07:03.430> budgets<00:07:04.720> close<00:07:05.720> it<00:07:05.900> out<00:07:05.990> with

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:06.140 
currency comma budgets close it out with

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.470 
currency comma budgets close it out with
a<00:07:06.200> semicolon<00:07:06.530> and<00:07:07.010> close<00:07:07.850> it<00:07:07.880> out<00:07:08.240> with<00:07:08.450> the

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:08.480 
a semicolon and close it out with the

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.350 
a semicolon and close it out with the
bris<00:07:09.200> now<00:07:10.070> you<00:07:10.130> can<00:07:10.280> go<00:07:10.400> ahead<00:07:10.490> and<00:07:10.610> save<00:07:11.030> that

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 
bris now you can go ahead and save that

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.480 
bris now you can go ahead and save that
so<00:07:12.140> we're<00:07:12.590> all<00:07:12.830> done<00:07:13.100> with<00:07:13.370> the

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:13.490 
so we're all done with the

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.060 
so we're all done with the
implementation<00:07:14.260> here<00:07:15.260> so<00:07:15.650> that's<00:07:15.860> all<00:07:16.040> for

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:16.070 
implementation here so that's all for

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.070 
implementation here so that's all for
this<00:07:16.550> lesson<00:07:16.610> but<00:07:17.150> in<00:07:17.210> the<00:07:17.300> next<00:07:17.510> lesson<00:07:17.780> we're

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 
this lesson but in the next lesson we're

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.540 
this lesson but in the next lesson we're
actually<00:07:18.230> going<00:07:18.530> to<00:07:18.620> be<00:07:18.710> creating<00:07:19.190> an<00:07:19.310> object

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:19.550 
actually going to be creating an object

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.030
