okay<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:13.559> I've<00:00:14.009> received<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.549> lot<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.880> questions

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
okay so I've received a lot of questions

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:15.919 
okay so I've received a lot of questions
from<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.480> guys

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
from you guys

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.010 
from you guys
regarding<00:00:16.560> gesture<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.130> proportion<00:00:18.020> gesture

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
regarding gesture and proportion gesture

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.010 
regarding gesture and proportion gesture
is<00:00:19.230> primarily<00:00:20.039> without<00:00:20.580> proportion<00:00:21.330> but

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
is primarily without proportion but

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.730 
is primarily without proportion but
Roman<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.920> all<00:00:23.279> about<00:00:23.580> accurate<00:00:24.330> abortion<00:00:24.900> how

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
Roman is all about accurate abortion how

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.000 
Roman is all about accurate abortion how
do<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:26.010> use<00:00:26.099> each<00:00:26.730> well<00:00:27.630> first<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.170> all<00:00:28.260> gesture

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
do I use each well first of all gesture

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.790 
do I use each well first of all gesture
isn't<00:00:29.220> really<00:00:30.029> without<00:00:30.269> proportion<00:00:30.800> when

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
isn't really without proportion when

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.530 
isn't really without proportion when
practicing<00:00:32.340> gesture<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:33.120> shouldn't<00:00:33.420> be

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
practicing gesture you shouldn't be

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.200 
practicing gesture you shouldn't be
distracted<00:00:33.989> by<00:00:34.290> proportion<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:36.059> should

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
distracted by proportion but you should

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.810 
distracted by proportion but you should
still<00:00:36.450> consider<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:37.460> ideally<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.730> will

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
still consider it ideally you will

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.819 
still consider it ideally you will
capture<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.390> gesture<00:00:39.809> while<00:00:40.350> staying<00:00:40.710> true

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
capture the gesture while staying true

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.910 
capture the gesture while staying true
to<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.430> proportions<00:00:42.059> though<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.350> will<00:00:43.620> take

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
to the proportions though that will take

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.420 
to the proportions though that will take
time<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.309> train<00:00:44.789> your<00:00:44.940> eyes<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.420> see<00:00:45.660> but<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.770> see

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
time to train your eyes to see but I see

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.040 
time to train your eyes to see but I see
what<00:00:47.550> you're<00:00:47.700> saying<00:00:47.879> sometimes<00:00:48.480> you'll<00:00:48.989> need

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
what you're saying sometimes you'll need

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.229 
what you're saying sometimes you'll need
to<00:00:49.260> change<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.739> proportions<00:00:50.309> or<00:00:50.640> move<00:00:51.210> things

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
to change the proportions or move things

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.139 
to change the proportions or move things
around<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.930> improve<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.410> gesture<00:00:52.860> but<00:00:53.100> if<00:00:54.000> you

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
around to improve the gesture but if you

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.299 
around to improve the gesture but if you
do<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.710> you're<00:00:55.710> not<00:00:55.739> being<00:00:56.100> completely

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
do that you're not being completely

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.080 
do that you're not being completely
accurate<00:00:57.210> according<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.870> your<00:00:57.989> reference<00:00:58.500> I

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
accurate according to your reference I

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.000 
accurate according to your reference I
think<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.300> balance<00:01:00.500> sometimes<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.890> have

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
think it's a balance sometimes you have

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.770 
think it's a balance sometimes you have
to<00:01:02.160> lose<00:01:02.280> accuracy<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:03.239> create<00:01:03.539> better

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
to lose accuracy to create better

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.800 
to lose accuracy to create better
gesture<00:01:04.670> sometimes<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.970> job<00:01:06.210> requires

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
gesture sometimes the job requires

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.310 
gesture sometimes the job requires
complete<00:01:07.590> accuracy<00:01:08.360> it's<00:01:09.360> your<00:01:09.570> decision<00:01:10.080> how

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
complete accuracy it's your decision how

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.590 
complete accuracy it's your decision how
you<00:01:10.380> want<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.770> balance<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.420> personally<00:01:12.420> I

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
you want to balance it personally I

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.499 
you want to balance it personally I
usually<00:01:12.930> exaggerate<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> gesture<00:01:14.509> sometimes

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
usually exaggerate the gesture sometimes

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.710 
usually exaggerate the gesture sometimes
a<00:01:15.659> lot<00:01:15.869> sometimes<00:01:16.439> only<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> little<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:17.909> rarely

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
a lot sometimes only a little but rarely

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.899 
a lot sometimes only a little but rarely
will<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.049> need<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.500> exaggerate<00:01:19.920> gestures<00:01:20.610> so

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
will I need to exaggerate gestures so

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.320 
will I need to exaggerate gestures so
much<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> proportions<00:01:22.770> look<00:01:22.979> wrong<00:01:23.330> you

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
much that the proportions look wrong you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.140 
much that the proportions look wrong you
can<00:01:24.479> have<00:01:24.689> both<00:01:25.220> okay<00:01:26.250> moving<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.119> another

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
can have both okay moving on to another

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.640 
can have both okay moving on to another

this point when drawing gesture should I
be<00:01:34.170> thinking<00:01:34.200> about<00:01:34.619> proportions<00:01:35.430> or<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:36.329> the

my gesture drawings have bad proportions
is<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.689> something<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.229> with<00:01:43.470> more<00:01:43.770> gesture

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
is this something that with more gesture

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.179 
is this something that with more gesture
practice<00:01:44.670> I'm<00:01:44.880> gonna<00:01:45.210> overcome<00:01:45.750> or<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.189> won't

get<00:01:47.369> better<00:01:47.610> at<00:01:47.790> proportions<00:01:48.299> until<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:48.960> start

students<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:13.440> answer<00:02:13.590> isn't<00:02:14.160> as<00:02:14.280> simple<00:02:14.459> as

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
students the answer isn't as simple as

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.990 
students the answer isn't as simple as
study<00:02:15.810> gesture<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:16.620> then<00:02:16.920> study<00:02:17.340> proportions

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
study gesture and then study proportions

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.140 
study gesture and then study proportions
you<00:02:18.959> will<00:02:19.080> need<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.319> study<00:02:19.500> both<00:02:20.150> alternate

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
you will need to study both alternate

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.050 
you will need to study both alternate
them<00:02:21.330> as<00:02:21.569> you<00:02:21.750> wish<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.489> don't<00:02:23.489> forget<00:02:23.819> that

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
them as you wish and don't forget that

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.180 
them as you wish and don't forget that
art<00:02:24.450> isn't<00:02:24.959> something<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.500> graduate<00:02:26.160> from

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
into the mentality that you can study a

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.890 
into the mentality that you can study a
concept<00:02:48.810> then<00:02:49.380> move<00:02:49.650> on<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.250> next<00:02:50.900> instead

think<00:02:52.410> of<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.680> as<00:02:52.799> if<00:02:53.160> you're<00:02:53.340> adding<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.970> new

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
think of it as if you're adding a new

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.420 
think of it as if you're adding a new
concept<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.230> soup<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.709> all<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.280> other

concept to the soup of all the other
things<00:02:56.819> you're<00:02:57.239> already<00:02:57.380> practicing<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:59.280> can

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
things you're already practicing you can

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.550 
things you're already practicing you can
focus<00:02:59.700> on<00:02:59.940> one<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.599> then<00:03:00.750> focus<00:03:01.140> on<00:03:01.230> another

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
focus on one and then focus on another

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.800 
focus on one and then focus on another
but<00:03:02.250> remember<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.299> will<00:03:03.450> need<00:03:03.630> to

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
but remember that you will need to

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.509 
but remember that you will need to
regularly<00:03:04.459> revisit<00:03:05.459> them<00:03:06.620> anyway<00:03:07.620> going<00:03:08.220> back

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
regularly revisit them anyway going back

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.400 
regularly revisit them anyway going back
to<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:09.090> gesture<00:03:09.510> versus<00:03:09.870> proportions

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
to the gesture versus proportions

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.849 
to the gesture versus proportions
question<00:03:10.820> it<00:03:11.820> will<00:03:11.940> be<00:03:12.090> tough<00:03:12.359> at<00:03:12.660> first<00:03:12.859> your

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
question it will be tough at first your

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.130 
question it will be tough at first your
gesture<00:03:14.250> drawings<00:03:14.730> will<00:03:14.880> look

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
gesture drawings will look

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.360 
gesture drawings will look
disproportionate<00:03:16.140> until<00:03:16.829> you've<00:03:16.980> trained

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
disproportionate until you've trained

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.370 
disproportionate until you've trained
your<00:03:17.549> eye<00:03:17.630> enough<00:03:18.630> to<00:03:18.840> capture<00:03:19.079> the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
your eye enough to capture the

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.979 
your eye enough to capture the
proportions<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.250> gesture<00:03:20.989> simultaneously

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
proportions and gesture simultaneously

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.770 
proportions and gesture simultaneously
you<00:03:22.890> will<00:03:22.920> improve<00:03:23.489> with<00:03:23.790> proportions<00:03:24.329> even

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
you will improve with proportions even

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.050 
you will improve with proportions even
if<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:24.989> don't<00:03:25.220> specifically<00:03:26.220> focus<00:03:26.730> on<00:03:26.910> just

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
if you don't specifically focus on just

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.650 
if you don't specifically focus on just
proportions<00:03:27.630> a<00:03:27.900> lot<00:03:28.799> of<00:03:28.920> drawing<00:03:29.340> is

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
proportions a lot of drawing is

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.930 
proportions a lot of drawing is
observation<00:03:30.660> so<00:03:31.260> as<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.829> observe<00:03:32.250> your<00:03:32.880> eye

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
observation so as you observe your eye

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.750 
observation so as you observe your eye
is<00:03:33.120> slowly<00:03:33.690> tuning<00:03:34.380> itself<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:35.069> you<00:03:35.609> get

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
is slowly tuning itself and you get

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.690 
is slowly tuning itself and you get
better<00:03:36.030> at<00:03:36.299> seeing<00:03:36.690> accurate<00:03:37.380> proportion<00:03:37.799> but

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
better at seeing accurate proportion but

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.970 
better at seeing accurate proportion but
of<00:03:38.940> course<00:03:39.359> if<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:40.079> focus<00:03:40.440> on<00:03:40.590> studying

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
of course if you focus on studying

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.819 
of course if you focus on studying
proportion<00:03:41.549> and<00:03:41.870> specific<00:03:42.870> exercises<00:03:43.440> for

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
proportion and specific exercises for

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.720 
proportion and specific exercises for
proportion<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:45.060> will<00:03:45.269> improve<00:03:45.660> quicker

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
proportion you will improve quicker

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.330 
proportion you will improve quicker
here's<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.819> plug<00:03:48.090> in<00:03:48.530> my<00:03:49.530> premium<00:03:50.040> figure

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
here's a plug in my premium figure

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.460 
here's a plug in my premium figure
course<00:03:50.609> I<00:03:50.880> show<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.540> how<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:51.900> can<00:03:52.200> practice

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
course I show you how you can practice

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.979 
course I show you how you can practice
measuring<00:03:53.220> proportions<00:03:53.819> and<00:03:54.060> checking<00:03:54.959> your

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
measuring proportions and checking your

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.949 
measuring proportions and checking your
own<00:03:55.319> measurements<00:03:56.329> getting<00:03:57.329> feedback<00:03:57.750> is

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
own measurements getting feedback is

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.559 
own measurements getting feedback is
critical<00:03:58.410> in<00:03:58.950> recognizing<00:03:59.790> and<00:03:59.970> fixing<00:04:00.450> your

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
critical in recognizing and fixing your

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.020 
critical in recognizing and fixing your
mistakes<00:04:00.829> so<00:04:01.829> if<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.430> don't<00:04:02.609> have<00:04:02.700> someone

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
mistakes so if you don't have someone

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.229 
mistakes so if you don't have someone
that<00:04:03.269> is<00:04:03.329> always<00:04:03.600> critiquing<00:04:04.470> your<00:04:04.680> drawings

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
that is always critiquing your drawings

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.000 
that is always critiquing your drawings
you<00:04:06.239> need<00:04:06.389> to<00:04:06.480> do<00:04:06.600> it<00:04:06.690> yourself<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.859> next

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
you need to do it yourself the next

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.390 
you need to do it yourself the next

question comes from Sid hassel ttan I

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.250 
question comes from Sid hassel ttan I
started<00:04:11.400> seriously<00:04:11.880> practicing<00:04:12.569> gesture<00:04:13.019> end

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
started seriously practicing gesture end

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.949 
started seriously practicing gesture end
of<00:04:13.709> January<00:04:14.280> I'm<00:04:14.519> still<00:04:15.390> struggling<00:04:15.720> with

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
of January I'm still struggling with

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.740 
of January I'm still struggling with
timed<00:04:16.470> gesture<00:04:17.130> drawing<00:04:17.400> I<00:04:17.669> can't<00:04:18.419> seem<00:04:18.720> to

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
timed gesture drawing I can't seem to

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.729 
timed gesture drawing I can't seem to
complete<00:04:19.260> anything<00:04:19.769> under

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
complete anything under

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.400 
complete anything under
and<00:04:21.069> when<00:04:21.759> I<00:04:21.789> do<00:04:21.940> there<00:04:22.630> are<00:04:22.660> key<00:04:23.080> pieces

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
and when I do there are key pieces

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.950 
and when I do there are key pieces
missing<00:04:23.910> and/or<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:25.060> proportions<00:04:25.600> are<00:04:25.810> out

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
missing and/or the proportions are out

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.379 
missing and/or the proportions are out
of<00:04:25.990> whack<00:04:26.289> is<00:04:26.680> there<00:04:27.520> anything<00:04:27.819> else<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.360> should

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
of whack is there anything else I should

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.200 
of whack is there anything else I should
be<00:04:28.690> considering<00:04:29.259> like<00:04:30.190> starting<00:04:30.729> the<00:04:30.819> gesture

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
be considering like starting the gesture

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.809 
be considering like starting the gesture
with<00:04:31.449> the<00:04:31.690> bean<00:04:31.900> or<00:04:32.199> do<00:04:33.039> I<00:04:33.069> just<00:04:33.160> need<00:04:33.580> more

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:33.819 
with the bean or do I just need more

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:37.710 
with the bean or do I just need more
practice<00:04:35.340> yeah<00:04:36.340> you<00:04:36.699> probably<00:04:37.210> just<00:04:37.630> need

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
practice yeah you probably just need

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.689 
practice yeah you probably just need
more<00:04:37.960> practice<00:04:38.139> you've<00:04:39.039> only<00:04:39.310> been<00:04:39.490> doing

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
more practice you've only been doing

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.300 
more practice you've only been doing
this<00:04:39.880> for<00:04:40.210> a<00:04:40.240> few<00:04:40.449> months<00:04:40.840> it's<00:04:41.620> normal<00:04:42.130> not<00:04:42.250> to

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
this for a few months it's normal not to

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.089 
this for a few months it's normal not to
see<00:04:42.610> results<00:04:43.000> immediately<00:04:43.410> if<00:04:44.410> two<00:04:44.860> years

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:45.099 
see results immediately if two years

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.430 
see results immediately if two years
from<00:04:45.280> now<00:04:45.340> you<00:04:45.490> look<00:04:45.880> back<00:04:45.910> and<00:04:46.389> there<00:04:47.199> was<00:04:47.289> no

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
from now you look back and there was no

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.300 
from now you look back and there was no
progress<00:04:48.419> well<00:04:49.419> then<00:04:49.630> there's<00:04:49.870> a<00:04:49.960> problem<00:04:50.500> but

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
progress well then there's a problem but

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.430 
progress well then there's a problem but
month-to-month<00:04:51.840> it's<00:04:52.840> hard<00:04:53.139> to<00:04:53.259> see<00:04:53.410> a

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
month-to-month it's hard to see a

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.980 
month-to-month it's hard to see a
significant<00:04:54.070> difference<00:04:54.220> it's<00:04:55.150> a<00:04:55.270> very<00:04:55.630> slow

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
significant difference it's a very slow

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.050 
significant difference it's a very slow
process<00:04:56.289> that's<00:04:57.280> why<00:04:57.460> you<00:04:57.580> just<00:04:57.759> have<00:04:57.940> to

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
process that's why you just have to

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.870 
process that's why you just have to
enjoy<00:04:58.539> it<00:04:58.570> you're<00:04:59.440> gonna<00:04:59.530> spend<00:04:59.889> years<00:05:00.430> doing

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
enjoy it you're gonna spend years doing

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.490 
enjoy it you're gonna spend years doing
this<00:05:01.150> until<00:05:01.720> you<00:05:01.780> get<00:05:02.020> some<00:05:02.259> sort<00:05:02.440> of

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
this until you get some sort of

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.879 
this until you get some sort of
satisfaction<00:05:03.150> so<00:05:04.150> if<00:05:04.900> you<00:05:05.110> don't<00:05:05.320> enjoy<00:05:05.500> the

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
satisfaction so if you don't enjoy the

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.020 
satisfaction so if you don't enjoy the
process<00:05:06.630> it's<00:05:07.630> gonna<00:05:08.020> be<00:05:08.169> tough<00:05:08.380> you<00:05:08.880> asked<00:05:09.880> if

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
process it's gonna be tough you asked if

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.550 
process it's gonna be tough you asked if
there's<00:05:10.389> anything<00:05:10.810> else<00:05:11.080> you<00:05:11.320> should<00:05:11.349> be

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
there's anything else you should be

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.939 
there's anything else you should be
considering<00:05:12.220> like<00:05:12.580> starting<00:05:13.300> with<00:05:13.389> the<00:05:13.509> bean

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.409 
considering like starting with the bean
well<00:05:14.949> you<00:05:15.220> can<00:05:15.400> start<00:05:15.639> with<00:05:15.729> the<00:05:15.880> beam<00:05:16.060> or<00:05:16.330> the

well you can start with the beam or the

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:19.620 
well you can start with the beam or the
Robo<00:05:17.259> bean<00:05:17.470> or<00:05:17.740> with<00:05:18.520> simple<00:05:19.090> gesture<00:05:19.449> lines

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
time you're making you anxious

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.839 
time you're making you anxious
especially<00:05:32.139> when<00:05:32.770> you<00:05:32.860> first<00:05:33.070> start<00:05:33.370> doing<00:05:33.699> it

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 
especially when you first start doing it

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:36.270 
especially when you first start doing it
go<00:05:34.659> ahead<00:05:34.810> and<00:05:34.930> give<00:05:35.169> yourself<00:05:35.259> a<00:05:35.770> few<00:05:36.219> extra

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
go ahead and give yourself a few extra

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.760 
go ahead and give yourself a few extra
minutes<00:05:36.900> there's<00:05:37.900> nothing<00:05:38.199> wrong<00:05:38.349> with<00:05:38.409> that

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
minutes there's nothing wrong with that

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.159 
minutes there's nothing wrong with that
the<00:05:39.400> purpose<00:05:39.759> of<00:05:39.909> the<00:05:40.030> timer<00:05:40.300> is<00:05:40.599> to<00:05:40.900> prevent

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
the purpose of the timer is to prevent

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.249 
the purpose of the timer is to prevent
you<00:05:41.349> from<00:05:41.380> drawing<00:05:41.949> too<00:05:42.280> many<00:05:42.490> details<00:05:43.120> not<00:05:43.990> to

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:44.259 
you from drawing too many details not to

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:46.740 
you from drawing too many details not to
make<00:05:44.440> you<00:05:44.620> move<00:05:44.830> your<00:05:45.009> hand<00:05:45.280> quicker<00:05:45.580> so<00:05:46.419> if

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
make you move your hand quicker so if

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.779 
make you move your hand quicker so if
you<00:05:46.990> find<00:05:47.229> yourself<00:05:47.320> trying<00:05:47.889> to<00:05:48.009> draw<00:05:48.340> quickly

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 
you find yourself trying to draw quickly

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:50.909 
you find yourself trying to draw quickly
and<00:05:49.000> you<00:05:49.750> think<00:05:49.990> you've<00:05:50.139> simplified<00:05:50.530> as<00:05:50.889> much

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
and you think you've simplified as much

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.370 
and you think you've simplified as much
as<00:05:51.190> you<00:05:51.310> could<00:05:51.570> then<00:05:52.570> it's<00:05:52.870> better<00:05:53.050> to<00:05:53.229> add

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
as you could then it's better to add

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.740 
as you could then it's better to add
some<00:05:53.770> time<00:05:54.009> you<00:05:54.820> will<00:05:54.849> get<00:05:55.120> faster<00:05:55.599> as<00:05:55.719> you

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
some time you will get faster as you

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.320 
some time you will get faster as you
practice<00:05:56.289> but<00:05:57.099> if<00:05:57.310> you're<00:05:57.520> spending<00:05:57.820> too<00:05:58.300> much

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
practice but if you're spending too much

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.930 
practice but if you're spending too much
time<00:05:58.539> because<00:05:59.259> you're<00:05:59.560> focusing<00:06:00.130> on<00:06:00.190> too<00:06:00.759> much

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
time because you're focusing on too much

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.930 
time because you're focusing on too much
detail<00:06:01.740> then<00:06:02.740> you<00:06:02.860> just<00:06:03.070> need<00:06:03.219> to<00:06:03.370> simplify<00:06:03.729> it

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
detail then you just need to simplify it

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.600 
detail then you just need to simplify it
more<00:06:04.229> different<00:06:05.229> length<00:06:05.440> sketches<00:06:05.949> are<00:06:06.190> meant

more different length sketches are meant

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.870 
more different length sketches are meant
for<00:06:06.669> different<00:06:07.360> amounts<00:06:07.539> of<00:06:07.990> detail<00:06:08.820> if<00:06:09.820> you

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
for different amounts of detail if you

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.050 
for different amounts of detail if you
only<00:06:10.210> have<00:06:10.419> 30<00:06:10.780> seconds<00:06:11.289> to<00:06:11.469> two<00:06:11.770> minutes<00:06:12.060> you

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
only have 30 seconds to two minutes you

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.909 
only have 30 seconds to two minutes you
only<00:06:13.210> have<00:06:13.449> enough<00:06:13.750> time<00:06:14.050> to<00:06:14.320> do<00:06:14.440> a<00:06:14.469> few<00:06:14.860> simple

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
only have enough time to do a few simple

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
lines indicating the main flow if you

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.180 
lines indicating the main flow if you
have<00:06:18.610> 5<00:06:18.969> to<00:06:19.000> 10<00:06:19.509> minutes<00:06:19.900> then<00:06:20.770> you<00:06:20.889> can<00:06:21.039> add

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
have 5 to 10 minutes then you can add

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.189 
have 5 to 10 minutes then you can add
the<00:06:21.400> anatomy<00:06:21.880> and<00:06:21.909> details<00:06:22.570> like<00:06:22.870> I<00:06:22.990> showed
