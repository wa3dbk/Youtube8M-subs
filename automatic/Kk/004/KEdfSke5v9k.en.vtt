00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
explosive rounds in my opinion in PvP

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.430 
explosive rounds in my opinion in PvP
I<00:04:03.640> wouldn't<00:04:04.150> use<00:04:04.180> explosive<00:04:04.810> rounds<00:04:05.110> I<00:04:05.200> mean

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
there's not much of a difference I'd

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.420 
there's not much of a difference I'd
rather<00:04:07.330> have<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.840> extended<00:04:08.500> range<00:04:08.769> using

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
rather have the extended range using

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.250 
rather have the extended range using
that<00:04:09.640> hammer<00:04:09.820> forged<00:04:10.120> I<00:04:10.330> mean<00:04:10.510> there's<00:04:11.110> a

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
that hammer forged I mean there's a

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.860 
that hammer forged I mean there's a
slight<00:04:12.190> difference<00:04:12.640> I<00:04:12.700> mean<00:04:12.820> yes<00:04:13.030> you<00:04:13.209> do<00:04:13.360> 13

my<00:04:16.959> opinion<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.410> brother<00:04:17.680> go<00:04:17.919> with<00:04:18.130> range<00:04:18.400> I

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
my opinion a brother go with range I

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.330 
my opinion a brother go with range I
really<00:04:18.940> would<00:04:19.180> now<00:04:19.840> in<00:04:20.169> PvE<00:04:20.620> I<00:04:21.040> would

have a speed reload perk as well but a

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.750 
have a speed reload perk as well but a
standard<00:04:57.790> it<00:04:58.150> reloads<00:04:58.570> at<00:04:58.720> 2.2<00:04:59.410> 6<00:04:59.740> seconds<00:05:00.640> as

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
standard it reloads at 2.2 6 seconds as

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.090 
standard it reloads at 2.2 6 seconds as
an<00:05:00.880> average<00:05:01.120> and<00:05:01.660> with<00:05:02.350> the<00:05:02.500> speed<00:05:02.710> reload

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
an average and with the speed reload

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.100 
an average and with the speed reload
perk<00:05:03.370> it<00:05:03.640> reloads<00:05:04.180> at<00:05:04.330> two<00:05:04.480> point<00:05:04.780> one<00:05:05.080> eight

seconds so in my opinion I'd love to

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.540 
seconds so in my opinion I'd love to
still<00:05:07.990> go<00:05:08.230> with<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:08.560> hammer<00:05:08.710> forged<00:05:09.010> or<00:05:09.220> the

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
still go with the hammer forged or the

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.370 
still go with the hammer forged or the
explosive<00:05:10.030> rounds<00:05:10.390> now<00:05:10.720> get<00:05:10.900> back<00:05:11.080> to<00:05:11.170> speed

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
explosive rounds now get back to speed

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.500 
explosive rounds now get back to speed

anyway and it doesn't make a significant
difference<00:05:15.550> using<00:05:16.270> that<00:05:16.540> speed<00:05:16.810> reload

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200
