00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.740
 present everything please of course 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.269
 with pleasure so I'm on minecraft 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.449
 since 1.2 points 5 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.500
 I made a main map solo on 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.190
 which I built a manor house 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:40.480
 obsidian and I started since 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.660
 january 2014 llp solo on a map a 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.240
 invaded there is also a survival mode and so 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.300
 thanks to that I was able to join the 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.380
 charming red hood server community 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.590
 I have been following the 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.910
 videos and so suddenly I felt 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.280
 the ability now to be able 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.290
 join the server and and I am very 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.980
 happy because I was my candidate 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.390
 was retained 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.190
 so I immediately had a small 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.059
 thought also for those who have posted 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.960
 their candidacy and who have not been 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.920
 selected but so far so far 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.240
 I made videos solo and 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.079
 now it's going to be really good 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.539
 because I will be able to make 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:16.179
 videos with with the world and with a 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.369
 friendly community so it's very 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:20.859
 very well 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.259
 so for small projects this 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:25.780
 may be for that a base all 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.950
 automate a factor is stone and then 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.020
 I like to build replicas of 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.409
 mansions and castles so here we go 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.990
 do that too on the server and then 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.659
 full of straw full of projects like 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.359
 of the community also so that's 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:45.520
 very well as the famous d europe is doing 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:47.770
 since from wailly but these trolls all 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.109
 it's good but god, it's because 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.659
 we arrive at a server that is 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:54.159
 already advanced so we have not galley at 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.869
 start to accumulate all 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:00.700
 resources and and all the stuff like that 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:02.850
 was shut down so I remember that 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.850
 who 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.509
 so maybe we need to talk about what they 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.150
 still want to continue doing 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.340
 applications did not close 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.020
 so you can continue it too 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.209
 are some people who have posted 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.770
 their application and we have not yet 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.140
 Finally, we have not yet examined everything 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.810
 well in depth so rest assured 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.209
 for now we will take account 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.110
 drops but it's not because you 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.450
 do not be detained today 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.870
 that you will not be detained at 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.739
 final so we were in the process of 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.390
 look at the applications that have been 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.830
 sent and besides do not hesitate 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.700
 content he continued to send your 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.620
 applications 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.690
 yes, we continue to watch them 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.610
 not because we were afraid that basically 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.140
 until you have received an email 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.090
 that he tells you that you are not caught 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.590
 or who tells you that you are priced is 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:57.160
 low that means we have not yet 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.350
 you're here it's good seen four 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.650
 Parisians who are struggling to join his 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.790
 hand you wait good I think if we 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.769
 has no other questions to ask 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.870
 we will be able to finish the last word for 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:12.700
 keeper yes here he is maybe going to 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:17.470
 little explanation of the skin that I have 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:20.560
 I tried to represent the 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:24.010
 qin kai who is the hunt guard of the 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.540
 manor iphone in in the last 12 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.079
 seconds so the james bond that 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.280
 is called skyfall here I do not know if 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.630
 it's really very successful but hey I 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.430
 do my best but in any case we 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.239
 is hot it's a bit like a man 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.680
 and maple 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.670
 ah if a fairly advanced age so I think 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.560

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.910
 yes here is just a gamekeeper 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.739

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.760
 of manors you see we are yes you do not 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.150
