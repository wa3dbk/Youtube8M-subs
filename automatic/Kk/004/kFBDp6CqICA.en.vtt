00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:54.619 
in a few minutes or hopefully sooner

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:57.759 
in a few minutes or hopefully sooner
than<00:00:54.799> that<00:00:54.830> of<00:00:55.220> how<00:00:56.150> I<00:00:56.180> use<00:00:56.869> the<00:00:57.080> flash<00:00:57.350> in<00:00:57.739> the

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
than that of how I use the flash in the

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.219 
than that of how I use the flash in the
indoors<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:59.000> it<00:00:59.360> didn't<00:00:59.720> turn<00:00:59.839> out<00:00:59.960> too<00:01:00.199> well

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
indoors and it didn't turn out too well

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.789 
indoors and it didn't turn out too well
so<00:01:00.769> we<00:01:01.640> also<00:01:01.790> have<00:01:02.170> compared<00:01:03.170> on<00:01:03.320> one<00:01:03.530> single

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
so we also have compared on one single

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.310 
so we also have compared on one single

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.959 

that<00:06:24.270> was<00:06:24.539> amazing

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:28.969 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:30.860 

just<00:06:29.969> take<00:06:30.090> it<00:06:30.180> off<00:06:30.240> there<00:06:30.509> with<00:06:30.630> the<00:06:30.719> X

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.439 
just take it off there with the X
alright<00:06:31.650> so<00:06:31.949> if<00:06:32.099> that<00:06:32.250> was<00:06:32.400> a<00:06:32.430> indirect<00:06:33.180> test

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:33.449 
alright so if that was a indirect test

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:35.659 
alright so if that was a indirect test
of<00:06:33.719> pop-up<00:06:34.289> video<00:06:34.560> which<00:06:34.830> works<00:06:35.099> very<00:06:35.250> well

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:35.669 
of pop-up video which works very well

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:39.950 
of pop-up video which works very well
very<00:06:36.120> smoothly<00:06:36.479> but<00:06:37.440> I<00:06:37.469> could<00:06:37.770> not<00:06:37.919> rotate<00:06:38.960> the

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
very smoothly but I could not rotate the

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.100 
very smoothly but I could not rotate the
video<00:06:40.080> which<00:06:41.069> was<00:06:41.279> odd<00:06:41.460> it<00:06:41.969> won't<00:06:42.240> auto<00:06:42.539> rotate

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
video which was odd it won't auto rotate

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.079 
video which was odd it won't auto rotate
it<00:06:43.229> will<00:06:43.320> just<00:06:43.469> stay<00:06:43.740> in<00:06:43.919> that<00:06:43.969> part<00:06:44.969> right

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:45.089 
it will just stay in that part right

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:47.370 
it will just stay in that part right
there<00:06:45.300> I<00:06:45.330> can't<00:06:45.599> utilize<00:06:45.719> the<00:06:46.080> whole<00:06:46.169> screen

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
there I can't utilize the whole screen

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.070 
there I can't utilize the whole screen
so<00:06:47.530> same<00:06:48.190> thing<00:06:48.220> I<00:06:48.700> can<00:06:48.730> share<00:06:49.090> this<00:06:49.360> to

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
so same thing I can share this to
