00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
while I played bass it's for when I was

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.459 
while I played bass it's for when I was
about<00:00:33.780> sort<00:00:34.399> between<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.640> 16<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.120> 18<00:00:36.469> but

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
about sort between of 16 and 18 but

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.770 
about sort between of 16 and 18 but
never<00:00:37.710> really<00:00:37.950> finds<00:00:38.280> people<00:00:39.120> who'd<00:00:39.390> want<00:00:39.660> to

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
never really finds people who'd want to

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.180 
never really finds people who'd want to
join<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.320> kind<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.620> fan<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.950> I'd<00:00:41.040> really

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
join the kind of fan that I'd really

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.639 
join the kind of fan that I'd really
wanted<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.579> be<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.960> and<00:00:42.960> then<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.140> started<00:00:43.440> DJing

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
wanted to be in and then I started DJing

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.619 
wanted to be in and then I started DJing
on<00:00:44.070> bass<00:00:44.250> while<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.789> was<00:00:44.969> at<00:00:45.030> university

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
on bass while I was at university

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.420 
on bass while I was at university
because<00:00:46.469> my<00:00:46.829> friend<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> pair<00:00:47.399> of

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
because my friend and a pair of

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.490 
because my friend and a pair of
turntables<00:00:47.930> and<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.989> didn't<00:00:49.200> think<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.469> looked

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
turntables and I didn't think it looked

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.529 
turntables and I didn't think it looked
that<00:00:49.710> difficult<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.640> got<00:00:50.789> pair<00:00:51.000> turntables

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
that difficult so I got pair turntables

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.180 
that difficult so I got pair turntables
to<00:00:51.600> start<00:00:51.840> doing<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.289> not<00:00:52.649> about<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:53.010> year

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
to start doing that and not about a year

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.630 
to start doing that and not about a year
of<00:00:53.280> DJing<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.820> wasn't<00:00:54.149> really<00:00:54.829> enough<00:00:55.829> it

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
of DJing it wasn't really enough it

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.160 
of DJing it wasn't really enough it
wasn't<00:00:56.879> really<00:00:57.120> satisfying<00:00:57.570> anymore<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.109> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
wasn't really satisfying anymore in a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.869 
wasn't really satisfying anymore in a
way<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.039> basically<00:00:59.340> was<00:00:59.699> just

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
way so I just basically was just

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.549 
way so I just basically was just
clicking<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.270> logic<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.750> kind<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.320> working

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
clicking on logic and kind of working

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.770 
clicking on logic and kind of working
out<00:01:01.770> for<00:01:01.920> myself<00:01:02.039> what<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.579> could<00:01:02.789> do<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.210> think

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
out for myself what it could do I think

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.050 
out for myself what it could do I think
about<00:01:04.260> two<00:01:04.470> months<00:01:04.739> later<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.100> actually<00:01:05.430> made

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
about two months later on actually made

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.480 
about two months later on actually made
a<00:01:06.090> noise<00:01:06.360> with<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.110> spend<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.310> long

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
a noise with it and spend so long

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.190 
a noise with it and spend so long
clicking<00:01:09.000> around<00:01:09.119> not<00:01:09.510> really<00:01:09.540> understanding

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
clicking around not really understanding

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.350 
clicking around not really understanding
what<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> hell's<00:01:10.560> going<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.150> think

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
what the hell's going on and I think

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.969 
what the hell's going on and I think
from<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.510> moment<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.200> was<00:01:13.500> quite<00:01:13.710> hooked

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
from that moment on I was quite hooked

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.039 
from that moment on I was quite hooked
when<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.700> was<00:01:14.790> DJing<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.270> clubs<00:01:15.479> before<00:01:15.780> maybe

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
when I was DJing in clubs before maybe

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.960 
when I was DJing in clubs before maybe
like<00:01:16.200> four<00:01:16.439> five<00:01:16.619> six<00:01:16.890> years<00:01:17.189> before<00:01:17.369> anyone

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
like four five six years before anyone

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.859 
like four five six years before anyone
even<00:01:18.180> really<00:01:19.640> heard<00:01:20.640> any<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.450> my<00:01:21.600> tunes

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
even really heard any of my tunes

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.740 
even really heard any of my tunes
outside<00:01:22.380> with<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.740> one<00:01:22.920> DJ<00:01:23.280> set<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.060> think

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
outside with like one DJ set so I think

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.590 
outside with like one DJ set so I think
with<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.799> tune<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.310> first<00:01:27.090> kind<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.360> broke

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
with the tune that first kind of broke

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.240 
with the tune that first kind of broke
me<00:01:27.840> out<00:01:27.900> at<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.259> was<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> tune<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.220> wrote

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
me out at that was a tune that I wrote

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
like tumors are quite University

like tumors are quite University
structures<00:02:38.050> like<00:02:38.200> you've<00:02:38.350> got<00:02:38.440> 32<00:02:38.860> bars<00:02:39.100> of

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
structures like you've got 32 bars of

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
it drops into beats and bakes then it

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.110 
it drops into beats and bakes then it
breaks<00:02:44.170> down<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.830> same<00:02:45.010> room<00:02:45.250> I<00:02:45.460> don't

of centered around that arrangement I
wanted<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.770> do<00:02:50.890> something<00:02:51.280> where<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:52.660> was<00:02:52.720> more

song<00:02:53.350> structures<00:02:53.980> which<00:02:54.370> would<00:02:54.550> allow

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
song structures which would allow

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.580 
song structures which would allow
vocalists<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.570> come<00:02:55.780> in<00:02:55.900> so<00:02:56.080> you've<00:02:56.200> got<00:02:56.380> like

verses choruses bridges middle eights

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.190 
verses choruses bridges middle eights
and<00:03:00.160> stuff<00:03:00.340> like<00:03:00.490> that<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:00.840> I've<00:03:01.840> always<00:03:02.110> said

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
and stuff like that and I've always said

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.050 
and stuff like that and I've always said
as<00:03:02.470> well<00:03:02.650> I<00:03:02.680> want<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.280> keep<00:03:03.489> challenging

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
as well I want to keep challenging

myself<00:03:04.270> as<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.750> producer<00:03:05.020> in<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.350> studio<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:06.280> I

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
myself as a producer in the studio and I

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.949 
myself as a producer in the studio and I
think<00:03:06.730> that<00:03:06.880> was<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.150> next<00:03:07.300> step<00:03:07.600> trying<00:03:07.870> to

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
think that was the next step trying to

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.750 
think that was the next step trying to
take<00:03:08.730> my<00:03:09.730> sound<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.770> twist<00:03:11.770> it<00:03:11.920> again<00:03:12.280> into<00:03:12.610> a

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
take my sound and twist it again into a

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.910 
take my sound and twist it again into a
different<00:03:13.120> way<00:03:13.300> where<00:03:13.630> you<00:03:14.500> could<00:03:14.680> fit<00:03:14.890> a

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
different way where you could fit a

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.620 
different way where you could fit a
vocalist<00:03:15.400> on<00:03:15.520> top<00:03:15.670> of<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:16.180> you<00:03:16.330> can<00:03:16.450> write

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
vocalist on top of it and you can write

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.870 
vocalist on top of it and you can write
basically<00:03:17.380> instead<00:03:17.530> of<00:03:17.590> writing<00:03:17.860> beat<00:03:18.220> my

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
basically instead of writing beat my

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.880 
basically instead of writing beat my
songs<00:03:19.270> the<00:03:19.900> track<00:03:20.140> that<00:03:20.260> I<00:03:20.290> did<00:03:20.470> with<00:03:20.560> Quito

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
songs the track that I did with Quito

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.460 
songs the track that I did with Quito
and<00:03:20.920> Sam<00:03:21.220> Frank<00:03:21.520> I<00:03:21.640> really<00:03:22.030> liked<00:03:22.300> the<00:03:23.110> tracks

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
and Sam Frank I really liked the tracks

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.060 
and Sam Frank I really liked the tracks
that<00:03:23.770> some<00:03:24.070> Frank<00:03:24.310> had<00:03:24.520> done<00:03:24.730> with<00:03:26.070> scream

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
that some Frank had done with scream

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.340 
that some Frank had done with scream
really<00:03:27.880> like<00:03:28.120> those<00:03:28.360> it<00:03:28.570> was<00:03:28.630> I'd<00:03:28.959> like<00:03:29.230> the

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
really like those it was I'd like the

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.470 
really like those it was I'd like the
way<00:03:29.470> was<00:03:29.650> they<00:03:30.459> twisted<00:03:30.880> something<00:03:31.300> quite

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
way was they twisted something quite

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.390 
way was they twisted something quite
commercial<00:03:31.959> sounding<00:03:32.410> that<00:03:32.680> was<00:03:32.800> kind<00:03:33.070> of<00:03:33.160> odd

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
commercial sounding that was kind of odd

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.090 
commercial sounding that was kind of odd
as<00:03:33.580> well<00:03:33.760> it<00:03:33.940> was<00:03:34.000> like<00:03:34.180> Roger<00:03:35.140> Troutman's<00:03:35.739> app

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
as well it was like Roger Troutman's app

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.030 
as well it was like Roger Troutman's app
for<00:03:36.580> like<00:03:36.750> 2012<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:38.110> I<00:03:38.350> was<00:03:38.470> really<00:03:38.739> into<00:03:38.920> what

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
for like 2012 and I was really into what

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.780 
for like 2012 and I was really into what
they<00:03:39.160> did<00:03:39.390> so<00:03:40.390> we<00:03:41.110> had<00:03:41.320> I<00:03:41.650> did<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.220> backing

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
they did so we had I did the backing

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.130 
they did so we had I did the backing
track<00:03:42.970> of<00:03:43.090> Keita<00:03:43.390> we<00:03:43.510> did<00:03:43.630> two<00:03:43.780> at<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:43.989> time

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
track of Keita we did two at the time

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.710
