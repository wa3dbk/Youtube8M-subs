00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 Yes, I think I got into gaming 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.899
 insight headquarters sneaked 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.910
 what is today via post you came you see 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.620
 already on the table are really cool 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.059
 world of warcraft mists of pandaria 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.519
 collector's edition 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.310
 yes and I've caught ding times 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.720
 I have here the drawn pascal to rate 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.670
 two cameras are built and we show 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.680
 you now something that went really 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.680
 Everything in there was so curious 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.579
 First you have to say it looks right 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.230
 horny so if you have something for a 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.880
 cabinet needs then I get the thing 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.390
 here, perhaps it could not quite 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.800
 but he is a kind of engraving me 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.420
 Almost say here on this wave 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.100
 and super quality looks from the back 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.480
 just like an old book that is 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.120
 it can you even with papa or mama i 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.329
 put in the bookshelf and perfect 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.329
 masked 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.690
 Of course there is an overview what 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.570
 you find everything in there in this 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.769
 collector's edition 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.119
 what you will not find in the now 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:10.399
 box of course the ingame content that 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.300
 mount and the pad you get here 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:12.710
 right 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.000
 I hope you can see it shortly if 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.560
 I just go in game and watch it 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.610
 to you 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.860
 otherwise you get also portraits for 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:25.490
 data on two and a banner for 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:26.570
 diablo 3 course very important what 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.929
 not from a collector's edition 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.929
 missing an art book is in again 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.970
 also very noble here everything made in 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.170
 So it kept gold old 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.800
 makes something in any case 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.340
 I think it has about 180 somehow 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.850
 There is more capital on the side 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:55.700
 In any case, you will definitely be on your side 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.590
 a bit off it should not be 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.910
 forget the leveling but you have to 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.259
 you team but you here the 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.479
 classic sketches again for mops or 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.239

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:30.230
 cool from the back also a nice seal 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.620

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.830
 perfect for the bookshelf then of course 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.690
 Also very important for a collector's 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.269
 edition a matching mouse pad to 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:46.610

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.940
 lie 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.310

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.050
 look behind the scenes 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.210

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.650
 such a game or such an extension 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:55.870
 arises or thoughts flow there 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:01.090

 stand and finally, of course 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.270
 not missing 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.790

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:27.550
