first one now the psp-3000 much more

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.760 
first one now the psp-3000 much more
lighter<00:01:14.130> way<00:01:15.060> lighter<00:01:15.479> than<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.170> PSP

here<00:01:20.330> which<00:01:21.330> i<00:01:21.450> think<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> better<00:01:22.049> feature

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
here which i think is a better feature

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.770 
here which i think is a better feature
because<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.369> music<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.880> coming<00:01:24.060> at<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.600> and

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
because the music is coming at you and

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.249 
because the music is coming at you and
not<00:01:25.110> towards<00:01:26.040> your<00:01:26.310> body<00:01:26.490> or<00:01:26.960> towards<00:01:27.960> your

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
not towards your body or towards your

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.660 
not towards your body or towards your
legs<00:01:28.470> if<00:01:28.890> you're<00:01:29.070> sitting<00:01:29.280> like<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.490> and

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
legs if you're sitting like this and

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.469 
legs if you're sitting like this and
it's<00:01:29.970> pointing<00:01:30.299> down<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.990> see<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:33.000> buttons

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
it's pointing down you see the buttons

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.590 
it's pointing down you see the buttons
are<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.869> guess<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.880> same<00:01:38.240> yeah<00:01:39.240> they're<00:01:39.450> all

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
are I guess the same yeah they're all

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.350 
are I guess the same yeah they're all
the<00:01:39.750> same<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:41.549> only<00:01:41.700> thing<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
the same but the only thing is the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.270 
the same but the only thing is the
analog<00:01:42.810> stick<00:01:43.079> isn't<00:01:43.290> removable<00:01:43.829> anymore

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
analog stick isn't removable anymore

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.249 
analog stick isn't removable anymore
unless<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.299> haven't<00:01:45.630> tried<00:01:45.810> hard<00:01:46.020> enough<00:01:46.079> to

unless I haven't tried hard enough to

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.850 
unless I haven't tried hard enough to
take<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.500> off<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:48.320> analog<00:01:49.320> stick<00:01:49.590> seems

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
take it off but the analog stick seems

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.840 
take it off but the analog stick seems
more<00:01:50.100> firm<00:01:50.430> stayed<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:52.130> let's<00:01:53.130> see<00:01:53.430> what<00:01:53.579> else
