00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.430 
let me see the gauges Tyson okay I'm in
the<00:02:45.530> cockpit<00:02:46.250> here<00:02:46.610> okay<00:02:47.540> so<00:02:47.600> maybe<00:02:48.020> we<00:02:48.140> are

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
the cockpit here okay so maybe we are

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.710 
the cockpit here okay so maybe we are
you<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.620> new<00:02:48.800> autopilot<00:02:49.340> system<00:02:50.000> okay<00:02:50.570> I'm

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
you a new autopilot system okay I'm

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.970 
you a new autopilot system okay I'm
thinking<00:02:50.840> we<00:02:51.020> need<00:02:51.050> one<00:02:51.320> of<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.500> hose<00:02:51.650> and

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
thinking we need one of the hose and

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.100 
thinking we need one of the hose and
then<00:02:52.400> more<00:02:52.640> power<00:02:53.030> supply<00:02:53.420> that's<00:02:53.630> about<00:02:53.930> it

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
then more power supply that's about it

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.540 
then more power supply that's about it
and<00:02:54.410> this<00:02:54.830> thing<00:02:55.010> should<00:02:55.040> be<00:02:55.250> up<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.489> running

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
and this thing should be up and running

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.590 
and this thing should be up and running
so<00:02:56.510> we<00:02:56.600> need<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:56.870> do<00:02:57.020> the<00:02:57.350> auto<00:02:57.590> auto<00:02:58.459> thing

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
so we need to do the auto auto thing

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.960 
so we need to do the auto auto thing
well<00:02:59.810> autopilot<00:03:00.739> system<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.459> would<00:03:01.640> have<00:03:01.820> to

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
well autopilot system I would have to

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.720 
well autopilot system I would have to
think<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.300> this<00:03:03.019> big<00:03:03.530> building<00:03:04.160> here<00:03:04.190> would

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
think that this big building here would

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.060 
think that this big building here would
have<00:03:04.880> some<00:03:05.180> type<00:03:05.420> of<00:03:05.450> storage<00:03:05.930> area<00:03:06.500> where

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
have some type of storage area where

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.259 
have some type of storage area where
they<00:03:07.220> probably<00:03:07.459> store<00:03:07.730> stuff<00:03:07.940> like<00:03:08.120> that

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
they probably store stuff like that

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.050 
they probably store stuff like that

need<00:03:43.700> a<00:03:44.000> lever<00:03:44.390> and<00:03:44.600> some<00:03:44.780> redstone<00:03:45.400> okay<00:03:46.400> now

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
need a lever and some redstone okay now

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.820 
need a lever and some redstone okay now
be<00:03:47.180> careful<00:03:47.630> guys<00:03:47.840> their<00:03:48.260> component<00:03:48.590> I<00:03:48.620> found

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
be careful guys their component I found

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.470 
be careful guys their component I found
a<00:03:48.980> lever<00:03:49.160> on<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.370> wall<00:03:49.640> and<00:03:49.850> I<00:03:49.940> just<00:03:49.970> pulled<00:03:50.330> it

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
a lever on a wall and I just pulled it

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.300 
a lever on a wall and I just pulled it
off<00:03:50.600> so<00:03:50.900> no<00:03:51.110> that's<00:03:51.440> not<00:03:51.680> what's<00:03:51.980> not<00:03:52.160> gonna

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
work that's not circuited for the

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.140 
work that's not circuited for the
computer<00:03:54.410> well<00:03:55.280> are<00:03:55.370> we<00:03:55.489> sure<00:03:55.670> it's<00:03:55.820> not<00:03:55.970> can

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
computer well are we sure it's not can
