00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.690
 very good to all friends to finish what 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.700
 such how are we here van oliver western 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.070
 and understand or followed plataformero 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.469
 favorite and today I come to bring you a 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.919
 gameplay about sony close world for 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.810
 nintendo 3ds let's start and I'm going to 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:20.450
 teach the first level that is the level 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.570
 tutorial to give you an idea of 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.460
 how is this are and tell you that this 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.470
 sonic los war is exclusive for 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.910
 nintendo consoles so it is not 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.470
 you on other platforms like 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.250
 offers 3 or xbox 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.250
 let's start 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.030
 good to tell you to clarify that the version 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.949
 of 3ds do not expect to find a 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.719
 version like the one of wiiu not much less 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:49.030
 a row of wiiu is much prettier 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.680
 spectacular this makes it much more 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.890
 complete let's say this is a version 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.140
 somewhat decaffeinated but does not want 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.689
 to say that it is not entertaining that it is 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.100
 It is also quite entertaining but 

00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:02.619
 good the spectacularity you are going to 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.980
 find in the wii version but 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:08.400
 well let's start 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.040
 in which would be the tutorial level 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.480
 and let's give it 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.140
 OK right 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.950
 to begin with as you can see they are and it does not move 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.470
 it does not run as fast as the 3d sony ones 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.940
 previous ones but it goes slower though 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.820
 is now we press all right now the 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.310
 lining a kind little more and then this 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.920
 measure was adopted so let's say because 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.930
 users complained that the 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.360
 last are and they came out in 3-d was 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.210
 more a racing game more like a 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.030
 some races and now it has 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.560
 chosen more triple by the exploration and 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.680
 more the more leisurely rhythm more 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.380
 plataformeros 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.850
 this is a part in 3-d then also 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.780
 there are them with lateral scroll 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.250
 where they closely resemble those of 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.580
 the time of megadrive 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.750
 and good beige and beige 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:11.250
 and good that they are and makes use of their 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:13.430
 most known attacks like are the one 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.430
 we have 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.910
 then the path maybe the attack 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.910
 remote control 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.290
 He married one of the new movements 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.290
 can scale walls 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.659
 those who think they are equal as 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.189
 this as of mario super mario galaxy no 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:37.340
 they are completely wrong the truth 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:40.640
 because the truth that you notice that the hand 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.220
 of nintendo being behind but also 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.290
 it is true that it is not entirely a 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.920
 galaxy sound if you prefer to call it that 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.489
 but the gameplay is formula of 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.349
 sony extreme with a chapter in the saga 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.900
 that went to the heights for the end 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.230
 we finished curdling those of the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.239
 gameplay more of that style not 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.080
 good we have let's get to kill 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.080
 dig giant water 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.850
 and well that's the truth 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.650
 that the truth is that little is 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.019
 quite entertaining is not a game 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.000
 to hang out the truth is that it's 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.060
 very well 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.060
 Y 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.010
 as far as I can I will teach you the 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.750
 version of wii you see this is also 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.490
 another of the new movements can 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.490
 make calculations with the walls 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.100
 and we have reached the end of the level 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.710
 we have reached the box where also 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.210
 company are the animals and now we 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.330
 they score according to how well we have it 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.150
 fact 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.070
 in this case they have given me an 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.000
 You see they are and they also speak Spanish 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:53.060
 as they are and generation the game comes 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.310
 whole doubled to the language and good the 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.940
 truth is that they are and cosworth for 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.520
 nintendo 3ds is very entertaining and the 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.650
 truth is that it has satisfied me not 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.300
 as much as the liberal wii version 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.870
 in the video 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:12.620
 It's spectacular but good to tell you 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.440
 It's a pretty fun game and it's not 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.840
 It would not be a bad buy, because that's 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.820
 all friends I hope you liked it and 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.320
 see you in the next game play a 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.320
 greeting and see you later
