little bit discolored nothing major
still<00:02:53.730> works<00:02:53.940> very<00:02:54.030> well<00:02:55.070> and<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.550> think<00:02:56.730> the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
still works very well and I think the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.490 
still works very well and I think the
new<00:02:57.030> version<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.540> this<00:02:57.720> hog<00:02:57.959> is<00:02:58.230> about<00:02:58.470> a

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
new version of this hog is about a

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.930 
new version of this hog is about a
hundred<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.920> thirty<00:02:59.010> four<00:02:59.400> dollars<00:02:59.580> or

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
hundred and thirty four dollars or

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.490 
hundred and thirty four dollars or
something<00:03:00.120> like<00:03:00.270> that<00:03:00.420> so<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:01.430> think<00:03:02.430> I'll<00:03:02.640> be
