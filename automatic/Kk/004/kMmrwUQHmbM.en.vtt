going<00:06:38.050> our<00:06:38.259> way<00:06:38.289> and<00:06:39.180> heck<00:06:40.180> somehow<00:06:40.539> not

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
going our way and heck somehow not

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.659 
going our way and heck somehow not
enough<00:06:41.020> 38<00:06:41.380> 7<00:06:41.680> that<00:06:41.860> first<00:06:42.069> quarter<00:06:42.280> offense

enough 38 7 that first quarter offense

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:44.010 
enough 38 7 that first quarter offense
