and today i'm going to be speaking about
to<00:00:05.069> type<00:00:05.279> of<00:00:05.430> combination<00:00:05.640> locks<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.390> lever

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
to type of combination locks a lever

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.379 
to type of combination locks a lever
powered<00:00:07.560> combination<00:00:08.160> lock<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.849> button

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
powered combination lock and a button

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.930 
powered combination lock and a button
powered<00:00:09.719> combination<00:00:10.469> first<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:11.610> i'll<00:00:11.759> go

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
powered combination first so i'll go

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.480 
powered combination first so i'll go
ahead<00:00:11.969> with<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.540> levers<00:00:12.840> which<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:14.099> most

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
ahead with the levers which is the most

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:22.429 
ahead with the levers which is the most
simplest<00:00:15.500> where<00:00:18.949> so<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.160> opens<00:00:21.080> so<00:00:22.080> what<00:00:22.320> it

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
simplest where so that opens so what it

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.300 
simplest where so that opens so what it
is<00:00:22.590> basically<00:00:24.170> the<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.769> leaders<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.220> you

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
is basically the the leaders that you

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.730 
is basically the the leaders that you
don't<00:00:26.490> use<00:00:26.730> they're<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:27.869> there<00:00:28.140> for<00:00:28.170> their

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
don't use they're just there for their

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.080 
don't use they're just there for their
basic<00:00:28.859> accessory<00:00:29.519> they're<00:00:29.730> just<00:00:29.880> they're

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
basic accessory they're just they're

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.979 
basic accessory they're just they're
just<00:00:30.330> for<00:00:31.230> looks<00:00:31.439> they<00:00:31.679> have<00:00:31.890> no<00:00:32.130> no<00:00:32.989> that's

this<00:00:42.020> so<00:00:43.020> they<00:00:43.590> all<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.010> be<00:00:44.040> turned<00:00:44.280> off

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
this so they all have to be turned off

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.459 
this so they all have to be turned off
in<00:00:44.640> order<00:00:44.789> for<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.629> redstone<00:00:46.050> torch

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469

in order for this this redstone torch
right<00:00:46.710> here<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.910> be<00:00:48.000> turned<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.469> so<00:00:49.469> if<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.620> turn

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
right here to be turned on so if I turn

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.080 
right here to be turned on so if I turn
this<00:00:49.890> one<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:53.280> redstone<00:00:53.640> torch<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.940> turn

this one on the redstone torch you turn

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.819 
this one on the redstone torch you turn
off<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.539> does<00:00:54.660> not<00:00:54.840> affect<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.620> any

off and it does not affect this in any
way<00:00:56.090> unless<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.270> turn<00:00:57.329> all<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:57.989> them<00:00:58.410> off<00:01:00.649> in

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
way unless I turn all of them off in

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.500 
way unless I turn all of them off in

which all the red stones are off which

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.380 
which all the red stones are off which
powers<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.530> opens<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> door<00:01:05.369> now<00:01:06.090> for

powers this and opens the door now for

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.740 
powers this and opens the door now for
the<00:01:06.450> button<00:01:06.720> powered<00:01:07.500> um<00:01:08.630> combination<00:01:09.630> of

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
the button powered um combination of

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.859 
the button powered um combination of
gonna<00:01:10.320> need<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.530> talk<00:01:10.740> about<00:01:11.270> RS<00:01:12.270> nor<00:01:12.479> latch<00:01:12.540> is

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
gonna need to talk about RS nor latch is

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.770 
gonna need to talk about RS nor latch is
and<00:01:13.020> Amba<00:01:13.409> gates<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:14.640> an<00:01:14.700> RS<00:01:15.060> nor<00:01:15.270> latch<00:01:15.330> is

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
and Amba gates it's an RS nor latch is

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.429 
and Amba gates it's an RS nor latch is
basically<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:17.270> that's<00:01:18.270> hard<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.720> explain<00:01:19.049> so

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
basically a that's hard to explain so

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.280 
basically a that's hard to explain so
when<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.130> push<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.549> button<00:01:20.659> it<00:01:21.659> sends<00:01:21.930> up<00:01:21.990> our

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
when I push this button it sends up our

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.270 
when I push this button it sends up our
current<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.130> these<00:01:23.670> are<00:01:23.909> power<00:01:24.090> up<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:25.189> when<00:01:26.189> I

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
current so these are power up and when I

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.910 
current so these are power up and when I
push<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.600> opposite<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.500> found<00:01:28.740> all

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
push this it opposite this I found all

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.319 
push this it opposite this I found all
right<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.220> can't<00:01:29.520> really<00:01:29.759> explain<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.119> better

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
right I can't really explain it better

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.859 
right I can't really explain it better
than<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:32.670> end<00:01:32.880> gate<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:35.240> these<00:01:36.240> both

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
than that and the end gate is these both

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.960 
than that and the end gate is these both
of<00:01:36.900> these<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.650> pushed<00:01:38.040> down<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.640> order

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
of these have to be pushed down in order

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.510 
of these have to be pushed down in order
for<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.689> red<00:01:39.869> stone<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.950> be<00:01:41.040> loaded<00:01:41.280> up<00:01:41.310> which

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
for the red stone to be loaded up which

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.920 
for the red stone to be loaded up which
is<00:01:41.640> basically<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.060> same<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.509> leaves<00:01:42.630> over

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
is basically the same as the leaves over

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.039 
is basically the same as the leaves over
there<00:01:43.610> where<00:01:44.610> if<00:01:45.149> one<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.600> lights<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
there where if one of the lights on the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.219 
there where if one of the lights on the
red<00:01:46.439> stone<00:01:46.619> will<00:01:46.799> stay<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:48.090> saying<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.840> we

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
red stone will stay on so saying that we

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.999 
red stone will stay on so saying that we
can<00:01:49.409> go<00:01:49.560> over<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:51.360> combination<00:01:52.290> look<00:01:52.439> so

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
can go over to the combination look so

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.030 
can go over to the combination look so
it's<00:01:53.159> called<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.720> reset<00:01:54.720> /<00:01:54.960> try<00:01:55.409> again<00:01:55.710> button

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
it's called a reset / try again button

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.030 
it's called a reset / try again button
the<00:01:56.310> door<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:58.170> combination<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.590> see<00:01:58.890> you

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
the door and the combination so see you

and five nothing will happen because
it's<00:02:05.840> all<00:02:06.520> because<00:02:07.520> they're<00:02:07.730> not<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:07.970> crack

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
it's all because they're not the crack

accommodation lock in but inform is a
lot<00:02:22.250> more<00:02:23.650> difficult<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:25.240> it's<00:02:26.240> all<00:02:26.630> actually

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
lot more difficult and it's all actually

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.770 
lot more difficult and it's all actually
not<00:02:27.590> really<00:02:27.950> it<00:02:28.250> looks<00:02:28.520> here<00:02:28.730> because<00:02:29.060> these

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
not really it looks here because these

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.700 
not really it looks here because these
are<00:02:29.960> just<00:02:30.050> a<00:02:30.200> series<00:02:30.530> of<00:02:31.030> RS<00:02:32.030> nor<00:02:32.210> latch<00:02:32.270> a--'s

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
are just a series of RS nor latch a--'s

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.920 
are just a series of RS nor latch a--'s
so<00:02:33.710> eaten<00:02:34.070> it<00:02:34.370> looks<00:02:34.940> more<00:02:35.060> complicated<00:02:35.780> than

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
so eaten it looks more complicated than

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.780 
so eaten it looks more complicated than
actually<00:02:36.320> is<00:02:36.410> so<00:02:36.890> it's<00:02:36.980> just<00:02:37.070> an<00:02:37.220> RS<00:02:37.520> nor<00:02:37.730> latch

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
actually is so it's just an RS nor latch

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.640 
actually is so it's just an RS nor latch
and<00:02:38.720> then<00:02:39.880> this<00:02:40.880> goes<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.240> an<00:02:41.360> end<00:02:41.630> gate<00:02:41.870> so<00:02:42.530> the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
and then this goes to an end gate so the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.100 
and then this goes to an end gate so the
first<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:43.160> go<00:02:43.670> to<00:02:43.700> an<00:02:43.880> end<00:02:44.060> gate<00:02:44.330> which<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:44.990> then

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
first to go to an end gate which is then

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.199 
first to go to an end gate which is then
powered<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:46.310> another<00:02:46.490> young<00:02:46.640> gay<00:02:46.790> which<00:02:47.000> is

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
powered to another young gay which is

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.050 
powered to another young gay which is
controlled<00:02:47.630> by<00:02:47.870> that<00:02:48.200> so<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.190> know<00:02:49.430> it's<00:02:49.820> pretty

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
controlled by that so I know it's pretty

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.320 
controlled by that so I know it's pretty
hard<00:02:50.270> I'll<00:02:50.450> leave<00:02:51.200> my<00:02:51.410> world<00:02:51.709> in<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.160> link<00:02:53.000> now

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
hard I'll leave my world in the link now

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.120 
hard I'll leave my world in the link now
I'll<00:02:53.959> link<00:02:54.200> my<00:02:54.440> world<00:02:54.709> into<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:56.239> description

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
I'll link my world into the description

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.940 
I'll link my world into the description
for<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.310> guys<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.760> see<00:02:58.940> and<00:02:59.120> such<00:02:59.330> and<00:02:59.950> yeah

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950

for you guys to see and such and yeah
this<00:03:01.280> is<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.640> reset<00:03:02.000> button<00:03:02.030> so<00:03:02.690> what<00:03:02.900> this

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
this is the reset button so what this

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.100 
this is the reset button so what this
does<00:03:03.320> you<00:03:03.920> set<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.310> pulse<00:03:04.550> down<00:03:04.940> there<00:03:05.360> which

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
does you set the pulse down there which

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.340 
does you set the pulse down there which
then<00:03:06.320> comes<00:03:06.590> up<00:03:06.950> through<00:03:07.790> here<00:03:08.050> turns<00:03:09.050> on<00:03:09.200> this

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
then comes up through here turns on this

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.560 
then comes up through here turns on this
RS<00:03:09.709> nor<00:03:09.860> latch<00:03:10.450> so<00:03:11.450> look<00:03:12.320> liar<00:03:13.390> so<00:03:14.390> when<00:03:14.540> I

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
RS nor latch so look liar so when I

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.680 
RS nor latch so look liar so when I
press<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:16.340> can<00:03:16.580> we<00:03:16.670> see<00:03:16.880> both<00:03:17.060> are<00:03:17.300> hopefully

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
press so can we see both are hopefully

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.360 
press so can we see both are hopefully
yep<00:03:18.850> sorry<00:03:19.850> about<00:03:19.910> this<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:21.620> powers<00:03:21.890> that<00:03:22.220> up

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
yep sorry about this it powers that up

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.310 
yep sorry about this it powers that up
which<00:03:22.580> follows<00:03:22.880> this<00:03:23.000> redstone<00:03:23.390> all<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:24.170> way

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
which follows this redstone all the way

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.320 
which follows this redstone all the way
tweeted<00:03:25.250> to<00:03:25.489> the<00:03:25.910> very<00:03:26.150> last<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:26.840> gate<00:03:27.290> and

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
tweeted to the very last and gate and

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.940 
tweeted to the very last and gate and
same<00:03:29.330> happens<00:03:29.780> with<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.470> 5<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:32.030> 4<00:03:32.950> when

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
same happens with the 5 and the 4 when

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.400 
same happens with the 5 and the 4 when
these<00:03:34.130> are<00:03:34.280> both<00:03:34.370> turned<00:03:34.820> on<00:03:35.090> they<00:03:35.959> power<00:03:36.320> up

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
these are both turned on they power up

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.190 
these are both turned on they power up
to<00:03:36.769> the<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:37.220> gate<00:03:37.340> and<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:38.600> does<00:03:38.660> this<00:03:38.959> one

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
to the and gate and so does this one

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.410 
to the and gate and so does this one
when<00:03:39.769> they're<00:03:39.920> both<00:03:40.070> off<00:03:40.310> this<00:03:40.670> turns<00:03:41.030> on<00:03:41.209> and

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
when they're both off this turns on and

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.650 
when they're both off this turns on and
when<00:03:42.080> these<00:03:42.230> are<00:03:42.410> both<00:03:42.590> on<00:03:43.060> red<00:03:44.060> stones<00:03:44.299> off

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
when these are both on red stones off

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.400 
when these are both on red stones off
and<00:03:45.049> yada<00:03:46.040> yada<00:03:46.310> yada<00:03:46.640> it's<00:03:47.080> opens<00:03:48.080> the<00:03:48.230> door
