00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.670
 as surely they saw me mention it 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.530
 before I am one of the great 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.990
 admirers of jazz cars 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.380
 unfortunately I have never 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.200
 could buy one of his direct authorship 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.329
 but with the collaboration combo that is 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.270
 possible to get knives like the 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:28.250
 Reynoid backbone and others who review this 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.140
 it's not from the walker plus series but from the 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.530
 walker series soling which means 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.719
 which is made in germany for which it is 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.140
 slightly more expensive than the others 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:41.809
 knives series that handles mouth 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.820
 authorship of box but this has some 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.859
 of the characteristics that to me more 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.960
 they draw attention on a knife by 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:50.870
 Of course I am a great box fan 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.149
 therefore that was a very parameter 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.519
 important to me the second thing that if 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.469
 you have visited the channel before 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:01.579
 You will have heard that I am an admirer 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.739
 also from the world series n 690 I see how 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.380
 they see that he has this knife is a 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.210
 cobalt steel similar to the one they have 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.690
 the extremes of action as he had 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:16.220
 however said earlier version 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:20.360
 of steel that has this has a 1% 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.910
 17 percent chrome coal remember 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.310
 which is 12% onwards is considered 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.810
 stainless steel therefore 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.330
 you can expect it to have a 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.550
 excellent behavior in front of the 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.380
 resistance to deterioration in addition to having 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.680
 molybdenum vanadium manganese nickel 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.860
 silica and what makes it characteristic 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.830
 which it is one and a half thomas this is 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.380
 a really complex alloy inside 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.130
 of the cutlery but that throws a 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.230
 extremely tenacious steel and at the same 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.990
 time with excellent retention of 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.240
 edged even knowing that we are talking 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.520
 from a series of oxidable outside the 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.830
 manufactured directly by box I can 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.600
 say that this is really a 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.000
 pureblood European because he has the 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.880
 bots design has the Austrian steel 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.920
 and is manufactured in Germany according to box 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.040
 keys or design a knife what 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.400
 thick enough to leverage and 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.930
 open boxes that was a legacy of a 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.760
 research that he did 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.640
 about the use of knives that give you 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.519
 the soldiers in iraq and he also wanted that 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.040
 was able to cut wire due to 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.049
 who usually use the wire in 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.290
 Place of other ropes to tie 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:36.829
 bags and bulges the thickness of the sheet is 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.120
 of 6.9 millimeters which tells us 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.489
 also that the sheet with which they 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.030
 manufactured is a sheet of different 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.980
 standard that is manufactured in volleyball for 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.200
 the Italian knives between 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.290
 characteristics that he wanted to give box is 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.939
 the south chip the falling tip that is proper 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.609
 of the utility knives because 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:57.859
 allows you to put pressure on it 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:00.409
 large concavity for the index and some 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.150
 Super deep notches for the thumb 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.549
 grabbing it in your hand is something 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.609
 absolutely natural because of the profile of 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.870
 the letter and it feels supremely alive 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.909
 one of the things that to me 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.889
 impressed was that according to what I 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.950
 I had seen in the images on the internet 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.969
 I had the idea that it was a knife 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.530
 significantly smaller than what 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.720
 actually 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.660
 actually how can you see it in human 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.060
 it's pretty big pretty strong and it 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.940
 feels very heavy comes with the 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.340
 Cadex case that allows you to hang them 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.280
 according to box in the neck to carry it in 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.290
 any time or in the company of the tech 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.510
 Volcker would be mounted not only 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.819
 in the belt but also my vest 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.980
 tactical for a long time I wanted 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.840
 I make this comparison and so far 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.840
 I have the opportunity to make a 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.670
 Parallel side by side with the booker bot 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.860
 also the authority of mods have 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.380
 of course a pretty utility 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.080
 similar the bot of course is 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.510
 designed and conceived in your engineering 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.580
 to be quite cheaper and to be 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.800
 a little bigger possibly offers 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.110
 a slightly higher application range 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.510
 the finished ones are equivalent as well 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.880
 the materials except the material 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.850
 of the leaf that in the case of the boat is a 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.489
 Japanese steel made in China and in 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.160
 the first one is an Austrian steel 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.769
 German manufacturing if I had to 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.350
 choose between these two knives that 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.520
 they are quite similar in reality for 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.949
 I would be very 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.379
 because both are designed to do 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.900
 practically the same possibly the 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:34.419
 box is a camping knife 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.580
 because it is slightly larger and the 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.069
 range of uses is slightly higher 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.110
 due to the grinding of the blade but in 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:43.629
 general terms were designed to 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.729
 have the same use the finished ones and the 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:47.819
 walker quality control is like what 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.190
 I said before in these two pieces 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:52.930
 absolutely impeccable now if I had 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.120
 I recommend it for someone 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.190
 I would simply say that for the public in 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.470
 general possibly one of the best 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.419
 knives for the evasion bag or 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.090
 for general use they can get is 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.919
 pop and prime can perfectly 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.229
 be my way of seeing one of the 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.240
 infallible knives for a 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.909
 collector of course 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.580
 although although it is a bit more 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:17.889
 expensive that the box its price is not coming 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.020
 for nothing to an original piece of 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:22.750
 forests and you have at the same time the 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.710
 spirit and nature of a knife 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.710
 designer
