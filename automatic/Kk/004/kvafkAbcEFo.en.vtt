00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
emotions like love if he did say that he

was only telling her a lie to make her
feel<00:00:44.430> better<00:00:44.700> after<00:00:45.329> all<00:00:45.390> he<00:00:45.690> was<00:00:45.780> about<00:00:46.020> to

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
feel better after all he was about to

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.720 
feel better after all he was about to
kill<00:00:46.320> her<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.649> he<00:00:47.039> was<00:00:47.160> under<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> impression

kill her and he was under the impression

kill her and he was under the impression
that<00:00:47.940> he<00:00:48.270> was<00:00:48.300> about<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.809> die<00:00:48.989> too<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.770> it

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
that he was about to die too so it

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.860 
that he was about to die too so it
didn't<00:00:50.160> really<00:00:50.190> matter<00:00:50.579> what<00:00:50.940> he<00:00:51.210> said<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
didn't really matter what he said the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.350 
didn't really matter what he said the
second<00:00:52.170> possibility<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.949> I've<00:00:53.129> thought<00:00:54.090> up

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
second possibility that I've thought up

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.720 
second possibility that I've thought up
is<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.899> he<00:00:55.050> said<00:00:55.350> thank<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.039> but<00:00:56.550> there's

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
is that he said thank you but there's

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.270 
is that he said thank you but there's
actually<00:00:57.149> two<00:00:57.539> different<00:00:58.020> possible<00:00:58.859> meanings

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
actually two different possible meanings

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.650 
actually two different possible meanings
to<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.699> one

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
to this one

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.049 
to this one
acceptance<00:01:01.649> he<00:01:02.129> could<00:01:02.370> have<00:01:02.489> been<00:01:02.640> thanking

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
acceptance he could have been thanking

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.780 
acceptance he could have been thanking
her<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.239> being<00:01:03.660> genuine<00:01:04.320> not<00:01:04.559> only<00:01:05.010> thanking

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
her and being genuine not only thanking

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.859 
her and being genuine not only thanking
her<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:05.970> her<00:01:06.180> help

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
her for her help

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.260 
her for her help
with<00:01:07.080> nerve<00:01:07.470> but<00:01:07.979> also<00:01:08.159> for<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> physical

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
with nerve but also for the physical

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.539 
with nerve but also for the physical
pleasures<00:01:09.810> she's<00:01:10.439> been<00:01:10.650> providing<00:01:11.159> him<00:01:11.310> over

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
pleasures she's been providing him over

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.910 
pleasures she's been providing him over
the<00:01:11.670> past<00:01:11.700> couple<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.299> years<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:12.869> if<00:01:13.409> he<00:01:13.619> did

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the past couple of years but if he did

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.429 
the past couple of years but if he did
say<00:01:14.220> thank<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.729> then<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.119> believe<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.840> more

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
say thank you then I believe it's more

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.960 
say thank you then I believe it's more
likely<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.189> he<00:01:17.369> was<00:01:17.490> saying<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.240> as<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.710> snarky

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
likely that he was saying it as a snarky

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.740 
likely that he was saying it as a snarky

not having to give anything in return I
don't<00:01:34.890> know<00:01:34.979> why<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.189> get<00:01:35.460> no<00:01:35.640> sounds<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.180> that

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
don't know why I get no sounds like that

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.039 
don't know why I get no sounds like that
in<00:01:36.479> my<00:01:36.570> head

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
in my head

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.190 
in my head
considering<00:01:37.920> Jen<00:01:38.280> doz<00:01:38.520> personality<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.869> his

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
considering Jen doz personality and his

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.590 
considering Jen doz personality and his
tendency<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.860> take<00:01:41.130> without<00:01:41.450> reciprocating<00:01:42.450> I

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
tendency to take without reciprocating I

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.139 
tendency to take without reciprocating I
think<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.259> snarky<00:01:43.890> response<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.520> more<00:01:44.729> likely

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
think the snarky response is more likely

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.410 
think the snarky response is more likely
both<00:01:45.540> responses<00:01:46.320> are<00:01:46.439> lies<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.850> some<00:01:48.090> degree

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
both responses are lies to some degree

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.660 
both responses are lies to some degree
the<00:01:48.810> genuine<00:01:49.320> thank-you<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> lie<00:01:50.130> because

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
the genuine thank-you is a lie because

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.160 
the genuine thank-you is a lie because
he's<00:01:50.850> about<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.180> kill<00:01:51.390> her<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.780> that's<00:01:51.869> an<00:01:52.049> odd

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
he's about to kill her and that's an odd

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.170 
he's about to kill her and that's an odd
way<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.409> thank<00:01:52.740> someone<00:01:53.100> for<00:01:53.310> their<00:01:53.729> years<00:01:54.000> of

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
way to thank someone for their years of

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.170 
way to thank someone for their years of
hard<00:01:54.390> work<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.899> fun<00:01:55.710> work<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.700> snarky

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
hard work and fun work and the snarky

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.819 
hard work and fun work and the snarky
thank-you<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.750> lie<00:01:57.960> because<00:01:58.200> his<00:01:58.530> intention

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
thank-you is a lie because his intention

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.039 
thank-you is a lie because his intention
would<00:01:59.100> be<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.430> create<00:01:59.579> hate<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.689> she

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
would be to create hate so that she

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.030 
would be to create hate so that she
would<00:02:01.469> feel<00:02:02.070> okay<00:02:02.909> about<00:02:03.229> hating<00:02:04.229> him<00:02:04.439> when<00:02:04.799> he

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
would feel okay about hating him when he

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.560 
would feel okay about hating him when he
shoots<00:02:05.280> her<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.119> two<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.360> do<00:02:06.630> think<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
shoots her of the two I do think the

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.660 
shoots her of the two I do think the
-<00:02:07.690> thank<00:02:07.930> you<00:02:08.020> is<00:02:08.170> more<00:02:08.320> likely<00:02:08.710> the<00:02:09.039> third<00:02:09.369> and

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
- thank you is more likely the third and

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.150 
- thank you is more likely the third and
final<00:02:10.000> possibility<00:02:10.330> in<00:02:10.929> my<00:02:11.260> head<00:02:11.530> is<00:02:11.770> perhaps

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
final possibility in my head is perhaps

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.010 
final possibility in my head is perhaps
the<00:02:12.460> most<00:02:12.490> likely<00:02:13.210> and<00:02:13.420> that<00:02:13.450> is<00:02:13.690> something

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
the most likely and that is something

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.790 
the most likely and that is something
along<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.740> lines<00:02:14.950> of<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:16.360> were<00:02:16.600> right<00:02:16.959> some

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
along the lines of you were right some

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.580 
along the lines of you were right some
sort<00:02:18.160> of<00:02:18.310> vague<00:02:18.990> affirmation<00:02:19.990> that<00:02:20.020> showed

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
sort of vague affirmation that showed

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.910 
sort of vague affirmation that showed
that<00:02:21.040> even<00:02:21.400> though<00:02:21.880> risco<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:22.540> about<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:23.170> die

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
that even though risco is about to die

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.880 
that even though risco is about to die
she<00:02:24.760> was<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.570> victor<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:26.350> could<00:02:26.620> have<00:02:26.740> been

she was the victor it could have been

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.550 
she was the victor it could have been
something<00:02:27.220> like<00:02:27.430> I'll<00:02:27.850> miss<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:28.570> or<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:29.140> should
