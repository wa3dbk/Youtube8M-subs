00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
killstreaks kind of like what i have

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.650 
killstreaks kind of like what i have
here<00:05:00.810> you<00:05:00.990> know<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.350> UAB<00:05:01.740> counter<00:05:02.669> UAV<00:05:02.850> and<00:05:03.360> just

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
here you know a UAB counter UAV and just

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.340 
here you know a UAB counter UAV and just
shut<00:05:03.990> them<00:05:04.380> out<00:05:04.560> on<00:05:04.980> I<00:05:05.550> like<00:05:06.450> the<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:07.080> counter

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
shut them out on I like the the counter

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.190 
shut them out on I like the the counter
UAV<00:05:07.500> because<00:05:08.100> that<00:05:08.400> means<00:05:08.810> seven<00:05:09.810> people

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
UAV because that means seven people

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.440 
UAV because that means seven people
don't<00:05:10.500> know<00:05:10.680> what's<00:05:11.280> going<00:05:11.550> on<00:05:11.700> but<00:05:12.120> you<00:05:12.300> do

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
don't know what's going on but you do

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.659 
don't know what's going on but you do
that's<00:05:12.750> a<00:05:12.900> huge<00:05:13.290> advantage<00:05:13.470> to<00:05:13.980> yourself<00:05:14.460> and

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
that's a huge advantage to yourself and

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.510 
that's a huge advantage to yourself and
of<00:05:15.600> course<00:05:15.990> when<00:05:16.169> you<00:05:16.320> run<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.950> Blackbird<00:05:17.400> it

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
of course when you run the Blackbird it

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.940 
of course when you run the Blackbird it
is<00:05:17.700> total<00:05:18.210> domination<00:05:19.200> when<00:05:19.620> you're<00:05:19.770> using

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
is total domination when you're using

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.890 
is total domination when you're using
this<00:05:20.250> when<00:05:20.880> you<00:05:21.000> get<00:05:21.150> that<00:05:21.360> kill<00:05:21.570> ship<00:05:21.750> when

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
this when you get that kill ship when

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.650 
this when you get that kill ship when
you<00:05:21.990> earn<00:05:22.140> it<00:05:22.380> when<00:05:22.530> you<00:05:22.620> just<00:05:23.370> destroy<00:05:24.180> people

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
you earn it when you just destroy people

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.530 
you earn it when you just destroy people
with<00:05:24.810> it<00:05:25.020> so<00:05:25.350> it's<00:05:25.889> a<00:05:26.070> good<00:05:26.280> kill<00:05:26.940> streak<00:05:27.210> those

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
with it so it's a good kill streak those

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.159 
with it so it's a good kill streak those
are<00:05:27.840> you<00:05:28.680> can<00:05:28.800> also<00:05:28.950> run<00:05:29.310> kind<00:05:29.669> of<00:05:29.729> like<00:05:29.880> a<00:05:30.169> like

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
are you can also run kind of like a like

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:32.930 
are you can also run kind of like a like
if<00:05:31.320> you<00:05:31.350> want<00:05:31.500> to<00:05:31.650> kind<00:05:31.860> of<00:05:31.979> send<00:05:32.250> my<00:05:32.370> camp<00:05:32.669> or

kind of just hold off an area using a
guardian<00:05:35.669> in<00:05:35.850> a<00:05:35.940> sense<00:05:36.180> your<00:05:36.330> gun<00:05:36.450> works

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
guardian in a sense your gun works

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
good on that map on hijacked it's pretty

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.370 
good on that map on hijacked it's pretty
good<00:05:50.760> I<00:05:50.789> liked<00:05:51.180> it<00:05:51.390> but<00:05:51.660> this<00:05:51.900> gameplay<00:05:52.140> is

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
good I liked it but this gameplay is

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.730 
good I liked it but this gameplay is
also<00:05:52.710> really<00:05:52.890> good<00:05:53.010> because<00:05:53.700> I'm<00:05:54.390> not<00:05:54.710> I'm<00:05:55.710> not
