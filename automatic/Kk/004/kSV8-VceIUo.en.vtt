you'll see when you look at this there's
a<00:00:43.469> little<00:00:43.770> bit<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.280> gray<00:00:44.670> haze<00:00:45.180> over<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
a little bit of a gray haze over the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.720 
a little bit of a gray haze over the
photo<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.320> looks<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.770> little<00:00:46.920> bit<00:00:47.100> flat<00:00:47.489> and

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
photo it looks a little bit flat and

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.569 
photo it looks a little bit flat and
that's<00:00:48.210> really<00:00:48.570> typical<00:00:49.250> generally<00:00:50.250> photos

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
that's really typical generally photos

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.130 
that's really typical generally photos
come<00:00:50.820> out<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> camera<00:00:51.390> looking<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.020> little

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
come out of the camera looking a little

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.569 
come out of the camera looking a little
bit<00:00:52.320> flat<00:00:52.559> especially<00:00:53.160> if<00:00:53.250> you're<00:00:53.370> shooting

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
bit flat especially if you're shooting

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.360 
bit flat especially if you're shooting
in<00:00:53.850> RAW<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.690> there's<00:00:55.199> some<00:00:55.649> really<00:00:55.829> quick<00:00:56.129> easy

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
in RAW so there's some really quick easy

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.310 
in RAW so there's some really quick easy
processing<00:00:57.180> tricks<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.629> can<00:00:57.690> do<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.989> fix<00:00:58.140> that

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
processing tricks you can do to fix that

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.830 
processing tricks you can do to fix that
one<00:00:59.190> thing<00:00:59.460> could<00:00:59.699> be<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.329> raise<00:01:00.600> up<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
one thing could be to raise up the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.009 
one thing could be to raise up the
exposure<00:01:01.410> just<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.890> little<00:01:02.100> bit<00:01:02.780> already<00:01:03.780> that

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
exposure just a little bit already that

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.840 
exposure just a little bit already that
improves<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.799> lighting<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> photo<00:01:05.580> and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
improves the lighting in the photo and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.120 
improves the lighting in the photo and
then<00:01:06.450> another<00:01:06.900> thing<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.920> come

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
then another thing you can do is to come

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.330 
then another thing you can do is to come
down<00:01:08.310> here<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.729> tone<00:01:09.000> curve<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.340> adjust

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
down here to the tone curve and adjust

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.520 
down here to the tone curve and adjust
it<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:11.820> by<00:01:11.939> pulling<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:13.140> upper<00:01:13.500> right

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
it just by pulling up on the upper right

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.100 
it just by pulling up on the upper right
hand<00:01:13.860> corner<00:01:14.010> here<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.820> down<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.840> lower

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
hand corner here and down on the lower

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.920 
hand corner here and down on the lower
left<00:01:16.470> corner<00:01:16.830> here<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.790> what<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.720> does<00:01:18.869> is

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
left corner here and what that does is

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.980 
left corner here and what that does is
it<00:01:19.110> brings<00:01:19.530> out<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> brights<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:21.240> darkens

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
it brings out the brights and it darkens

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.719 
it brings out the brights and it darkens
down<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> darks<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.009> little<00:01:23.220> bit<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.549> give

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
down the darks just a little bit to give

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.100 
down the darks just a little bit to give
your<00:01:23.939> photo<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.330> little<00:01:24.390> bit<00:01:24.689> more<00:01:24.869> dimension

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
your photo a little bit more dimension

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.649 
your photo a little bit more dimension
so<00:01:26.070> let's<00:01:26.520> look<00:01:26.640> at<00:01:26.759> how<00:01:26.909> we're<00:01:27.090> doing<00:01:27.299> and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
so let's look at how we're doing and

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.179 
so let's look at how we're doing and
look<00:01:27.750> at<00:01:27.869> our<00:01:27.990> before<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.350> after<00:01:28.770> here's<00:01:29.040> our

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
look at our before and after here's our

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.499 
look at our before and after here's our
before<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:31.250> here's<00:01:32.250> after<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:32.729> cropped<00:01:33.210> it

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
before and here's after we cropped it

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.940 
before and here's after we cropped it
and<00:01:34.400> then<00:01:35.400> from<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.390> crop<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.350> changes

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and then from the crop to the changes

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.810 
and then from the crop to the changes
there<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:38.970> go<00:01:39.119> let's<00:01:39.900> go<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.259> next<00:01:40.439> photo

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
there we go let's go to the next photo

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
there we go let's go to the next photo
so<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.939> looks<00:01:42.090> like<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.360> photo<00:01:42.570> has<00:01:42.659> already

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
so it looks like this photo has already

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.480 
so it looks like this photo has already
been<00:01:43.049> processed<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.710> little<00:01:43.950> bit<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.189> turn<00:01:44.369> it

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
been processed a little bit to turn it

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.120 
been processed a little bit to turn it
into<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.759> black<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.270> white<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.799> I'm<00:01:46.799> going<00:01:47.100> to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
into a black and white and I'm going to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.010 
into a black and white and I'm going to
do<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> couple<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.180> things<00:01:48.240> I'm<00:01:48.600> going<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.810> start

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
do a couple of things I'm going to start

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.530 
do a couple of things I'm going to start
by<00:01:49.200> cropping<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.890> using<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.310> crop<00:01:50.610> tool<00:01:50.850> just

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
by cropping it using the crop tool just

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.090 
by cropping it using the crop tool just
because<00:01:51.810> we<00:01:51.930> already<00:01:52.049> cropped<00:01:52.380> off<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.890> tip

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
because we already cropped off the tip

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.770 
because we already cropped off the tip
of<00:01:53.130> our<00:01:53.399> head<00:01:53.670> here<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.180> tip<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.390> her<00:01:54.570> bun

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
of our head here and the tip of her bun

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.539 
of our head here and the tip of her bun
so<00:01:55.020> I'm<00:01:55.110> going<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.350> make<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.100> little<00:01:56.340> bit

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
so I'm going to make that a little bit

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.350 
so I'm going to make that a little bit
of<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.570> deeper<00:01:57.780> crop<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.619> looks<00:01:58.890> like<00:01:59.130> it's

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
of a deeper crop so it looks like it's

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.590 
of a deeper crop so it looks like it's
really<00:02:00.360> done<00:02:00.600> purposefully<00:02:01.610> that<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.969> then

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
really done purposefully that and then

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.139 
really done purposefully that and then
I'm<00:02:03.719> also<00:02:03.869> going<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.200> bring<00:02:04.439> up<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.640> exposure

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
I'm also going to bring up the exposure

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.390 
I'm also going to bring up the exposure
a<00:02:06.270> bit<00:02:06.509> because<00:02:06.719> it's<00:02:06.930> pretty<00:02:07.170> dark

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:08.400 
a bit because it's pretty dark

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.760 
a bit because it's pretty dark
there<00:02:09.400> we<00:02:09.520> go<00:02:09.700> can<00:02:10.540> also<00:02:10.660> bring<00:02:11.050> in<00:02:11.230> some<00:02:11.470> fill

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
there we go can also bring in some fill

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.590 
there we go can also bring in some fill
light<00:02:12.070> and<00:02:12.430> what<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.760> fill<00:02:12.910> light<00:02:13.060> does<00:02:13.270> is<00:02:13.450> it

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
light and what the fill light does is it

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.570 
light and what the fill light does is it
lightens<00:02:14.290> up<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.440> darker<00:02:14.920> areas<00:02:14.950> of<00:02:15.490> the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
lightens up the darker areas of the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.090 
lightens up the darker areas of the
photo<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:16.300> then<00:02:16.810> pull<00:02:17.440> in<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.590> little<00:02:17.680> bit<00:02:18.010> of

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
photo and then pull in a little bit of

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.390 
photo and then pull in a little bit of
blacks<00:02:18.340> just<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.940> bring<00:02:19.870> in<00:02:20.080> some<00:02:20.410> dark<00:02:20.710> to<00:02:21.310> the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
blacks just to bring in some dark to the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.510 
blacks just to bring in some dark to the
darker<00:02:21.790> areas<00:02:21.820> of<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.570> photo<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.520> we'll

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
darker areas of the photo and we'll

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.700 
darker areas of the photo and we'll
apply<00:02:24.760> a<00:02:24.850> tone<00:02:25.240> curve<00:02:25.660> change<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.350> this<00:02:26.470> one

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
apply a tone curve change to this one

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.280 
apply a tone curve change to this one
too<00:02:26.980> pulling<00:02:27.940> up<00:02:28.060> on<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.360> right<00:02:28.510> side<00:02:28.840> and

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
too pulling up on the right side and

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.190 
too pulling up on the right side and
down<00:02:29.440> on<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.680> left<00:02:29.920> side<00:02:30.100> here<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.660> let's

down on the left side here and let's

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.410 
down on the left side here and let's
look<00:02:32.320> at<00:02:32.470> our<00:02:32.620> before<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.220> after<00:02:33.700> here's<00:02:34.210> our

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
photographer had left a little bit of

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.870

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
so let's see what we can do again we

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.570 
so let's see what we can do again we
have<00:02:57.670> this<00:02:57.790> little<00:02:58.210> slight<00:02:58.720> bit<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.200> gray<00:02:59.710> film

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
have this little slight bit of gray film

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.070 
have this little slight bit of gray film
over<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.090> photo<00:03:01.300> it<00:03:01.450> looks<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.750> little<00:03:01.870> bit

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
over the photo it looks a little bit

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.230 
over the photo it looks a little bit
flat<00:03:02.350> and<00:03:02.590> again<00:03:02.800> that<00:03:02.980> just<00:03:03.160> comes<00:03:04.030> with

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
flat and again that just comes with

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.440 
flat and again that just comes with
digital<00:03:04.780> photography<00:03:05.380> so<00:03:06.160> let's<00:03:06.970> see<00:03:07.180> what<00:03:07.360> we

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
digital photography so let's see what we

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.180 
digital photography so let's see what we
can<00:03:07.600> do<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:07.960> fix<00:03:08.140> that<00:03:08.320> I'm<00:03:08.650> going<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:08.920> bring<00:03:09.070> up

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
can do to fix that I'm going to bring up

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.010 
can do to fix that I'm going to bring up
the<00:03:09.310> exposure<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:09.940> little<00:03:10.240> bit<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:12.660> maybe<00:03:13.660> pop

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
the exposure a little bit and maybe pop

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.050 
the exposure a little bit and maybe pop
in<00:03:14.230> some<00:03:14.440> blacks<00:03:14.770> to<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.040> darker<00:03:15.460> areas<00:03:15.490> to

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
in some blacks to the darker areas to

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.940 
in some blacks to the darker areas to
give<00:03:16.210> it<00:03:16.300> a<00:03:16.360> little<00:03:16.450> more<00:03:16.600> dimension<00:03:16.950> I'm

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
give it a little more dimension I'm

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.140 
give it a little more dimension I'm
going<00:03:18.100> to<00:03:18.190> come<00:03:18.340> down<00:03:18.490> here<00:03:18.550> to<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.940> tone

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
going to come down here to the tone

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.090 
going to come down here to the tone
curve<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:19.600> do<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.780> same<00:03:20.050> thing<00:03:20.320> again<00:03:20.590> up<00:03:20.830> on

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
curve and do the same thing again up on

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.740 
curve and do the same thing again up on
the<00:03:21.190> right<00:03:21.340> side<00:03:22.530> down<00:03:23.530> on<00:03:23.770> the<00:03:23.860> left<00:03:24.040> side<00:03:24.750> and

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
the right side down on the left side and

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.060 
the right side down on the left side and
what<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:25.900> does<00:03:26.170> is<00:03:26.230> not<00:03:26.530> only<00:03:26.830> does<00:03:26.950> it

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
what that does is not only does it

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.380 
what that does is not only does it
increase<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.580> difference<00:03:27.910> between<00:03:28.060> your

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
increase the difference between your

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.270 
increase the difference between your
bright<00:03:28.630> areas<00:03:29.050> and<00:03:29.230> your<00:03:29.380> dark<00:03:29.650> areas<00:03:30.100> giving

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
bright areas and your dark areas giving

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.980 
bright areas and your dark areas giving
your<00:03:30.520> photo<00:03:30.700> more<00:03:30.940> dimension<00:03:31.480> but<00:03:31.690> it<00:03:31.810> also

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
your photo more dimension but it also

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.260 
your photo more dimension but it also
adds<00:03:32.440> more<00:03:33.100> richness<00:03:33.430> into<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:33.940> colored

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
adds more richness into the colored

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.690 
adds more richness into the colored
areas<00:03:34.690> too<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:36.040> let's<00:03:36.280> look<00:03:36.340> at<00:03:36.460> our<00:03:36.520> before

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
areas too so let's look at our before

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.510 
areas too so let's look at our before
and<00:03:36.940> after<00:03:37.420> here<00:03:37.780> here's<00:03:38.110> our<00:03:38.290> original

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
and after here here's our original

photo has sort of a green hue to it you

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.570 
photo has sort of a green hue to it you
can<00:03:58.560> tell<00:03:58.740> because<00:03:58.860> when<00:03:59.130> you<00:03:59.220> look<00:03:59.340> at<00:03:59.460> the

person's<00:03:59.970> skin<00:04:00.330> you<00:04:00.510> can<00:04:00.600> see<00:04:00.780> that<00:04:00.810> the

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
person's skin you can see that the

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.720 
person's skin you can see that the
person's<00:04:01.350> skin<00:04:01.710> itself<00:04:02.040> is<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.310> little<00:04:02.580> bit

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
person's skin itself is a little bit

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.820 
person's skin itself is a little bit
green<00:04:03.690> which<00:04:04.080> is<00:04:04.260> something<00:04:04.620> that<00:04:04.740> you

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
green which is something that you

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.250 
green which is something that you
definitely<00:04:04.950> don't<00:04:05.460> want<00:04:05.700> so<00:04:06.390> coming<00:04:06.870> up<00:04:06.960> here

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
definitely don't want so coming up here

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.580 
definitely don't want so coming up here
to<00:04:07.530> WB<00:04:08.370> which<00:04:08.610> means<00:04:08.850> white<00:04:09.150> balance<00:04:09.690> over

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
to WB which means white balance over

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.200 
to WB which means white balance over
here<00:04:10.740> i'm<00:04:10.830> going<00:04:10.950> to<00:04:11.040> click<00:04:11.220> on<00:04:11.370> auto<00:04:11.640> to<00:04:11.910> see

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
here i'm going to click on auto to see

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.540 
here i'm going to click on auto to see
what<00:04:12.360> that<00:04:12.480> does<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.110> immediately<00:04:13.770> i<00:04:14.130> can<00:04:14.370> see

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
what that does and immediately i can see

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.610 
what that does and immediately i can see
that<00:04:14.580> that<00:04:14.760> makes<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.660> big<00:04:15.870> difference<00:04:15.900> in<00:04:16.470> the

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
that that makes a big difference in the

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.310 
that that makes a big difference in the
skin<00:04:16.799> it's<00:04:17.700> not<00:04:17.820> quite<00:04:18.120> an<00:04:18.239> exact<00:04:18.570> science<00:04:18.840> and

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
skin it's not quite an exact science and

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.630 
skin it's not quite an exact science and
you<00:04:19.380> also<00:04:19.530> just<00:04:19.830> want<00:04:19.980> to<00:04:20.100> use<00:04:20.250> your<00:04:20.400> eye<00:04:20.459> to

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
you also just want to use your eye to

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.790 
you also just want to use your eye to
see<00:04:21.000> what<00:04:21.150> you<00:04:21.239> think<00:04:21.510> so<00:04:22.140> i<00:04:22.170> think<00:04:22.380> that<00:04:22.680> this

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
see what you think so i think that this

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.620 
see what you think so i think that this
is<00:04:22.860> better<00:04:23.220> than<00:04:23.340> our<00:04:23.670> original<00:04:23.790> and<00:04:24.390> i'm<00:04:24.480> also

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
is better than our original and i'm also

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.990 
is better than our original and i'm also
going<00:04:24.960> to<00:04:25.050> apply<00:04:25.380> a<00:04:25.590> tone<00:04:25.920> curve<00:04:26.250> to<00:04:26.580> it<00:04:26.610> a

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
going to apply a tone curve to it a

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.510 
going to apply a tone curve to it a
little<00:04:27.570> bit<00:04:27.900> up<00:04:28.110> on<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.560> right<00:04:28.740> a<00:04:29.130> little<00:04:29.190> bit

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
little bit up on the right a little bit

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.030 
little bit up on the right a little bit
down<00:04:29.820> on<00:04:29.850> the<00:04:30.120> left<00:04:30.440> one<00:04:31.440> other<00:04:31.590> thing<00:04:31.830> i<00:04:31.890> want

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
really careful not to crop off anything

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.630 
really careful not to crop off anything
like<00:04:36.180> little<00:04:36.420> toes<00:04:36.720> or<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:37.890> top<00:04:38.100> of<00:04:38.310> someone's

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
like little toes or the top of someone's

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.940 
like little toes or the top of someone's
head<00:04:38.880> in<00:04:39.210> this<00:04:39.630> case<00:04:39.840> we're<00:04:39.990> missing<00:04:40.320> just<00:04:40.560> a

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
head in this case we're missing just a

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.160 
head in this case we're missing just a
little<00:04:41.160> pinky<00:04:41.610> toe<00:04:41.790> of<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.030> Frog<00:04:42.390> so<00:04:43.080> I've

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
little pinky toe of the Frog so I've

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.900 
little pinky toe of the Frog so I've
simulated<00:04:43.710> what<00:04:43.890> this<00:04:44.040> would<00:04:44.190> look<00:04:44.220> like<00:04:44.400> if

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
simulated what this would look like if

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.760 
simulated what this would look like if
we<00:04:45.360> were<00:04:45.450> able<00:04:45.600> to<00:04:45.750> catch<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.230> toe<00:04:46.410> in<00:04:46.710> the

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
we were able to catch the toe in the

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.940 
we were able to catch the toe in the
photo<00:04:47.160> and<00:04:48.050> that<00:04:49.050> makes<00:04:49.260> a<00:04:49.350> huge<00:04:49.560> difference

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
photo and that makes a huge difference

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.150 
photo and that makes a huge difference
all<00:04:50.880> right<00:04:51.000> we<00:04:51.120> have<00:04:51.240> a<00:04:51.270> family<00:04:51.750> here<00:04:52.140> again<00:04:52.950> we

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
all right we have a family here again we

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.520 
all right we have a family here again we
see<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:53.460> same<00:04:53.700> thing<00:04:54.120> sort<00:04:54.419> of<00:04:54.480> a<00:04:54.570> gray<00:04:54.960> film

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
see the same thing sort of a gray film

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.610 
see the same thing sort of a gray film
over<00:04:56.070> the<00:04:56.220> entire<00:04:56.580> photo<00:04:57.000> so<00:04:57.750> let's<00:04:57.990> see<00:04:58.169> if<00:04:58.440> we

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
over the entire photo so let's see if we

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.170 
over the entire photo so let's see if we
can<00:04:58.890> maybe<00:04:59.280> pull<00:04:59.610> up<00:04:59.760> the<00:04:59.910> exposure<00:05:00.360> a<00:05:00.540> bit<00:05:00.840> and

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
can maybe pull up the exposure a bit and

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.710 
can maybe pull up the exposure a bit and
come<00:05:03.180> down<00:05:03.510> to<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:04.050> tone<00:05:04.290> curve<00:05:04.620> again<00:05:04.800> and

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
come down to the tone curve again and

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.530 
come down to the tone curve again and
brighten<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:07.230> brights<00:05:07.730> and<00:05:08.730> darken<00:05:09.390> the

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
brighten the brights and darken the

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.650 
brighten the brights and darken the
darks<00:05:10.070> just<00:05:11.070> a<00:05:11.220> little<00:05:11.340> bit<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:11.850> if<00:05:12.330> we<00:05:12.419> go<00:05:12.570> to

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
darks just a little bit and if we go to

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.680 
darks just a little bit and if we go to
our<00:05:12.690> original<00:05:13.140> and<00:05:13.770> our<00:05:14.100> processed<00:05:14.730> you<00:05:15.540> can

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
our original and our processed you can

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.930 
our original and our processed you can
see<00:05:15.900> that<00:05:15.930> just<00:05:16.380> that<00:05:16.560> tiny<00:05:17.280> little<00:05:17.490> change

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
see that just that tiny little change

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.960 
see that just that tiny little change
made<00:05:18.210> a<00:05:18.240> huge<00:05:18.570> difference<00:05:18.840> I<00:05:19.320> also<00:05:20.220> see<00:05:20.640> down

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
made a huge difference I also see down

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.280 
made a huge difference I also see down
here<00:05:21.150> and<00:05:21.300> some<00:05:21.450> of<00:05:21.540> the<00:05:21.630> whites<00:05:21.840> there<00:05:22.080> might

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
here and some of the whites there might

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.970 
here and some of the whites there might
be<00:05:22.320> a<00:05:22.500> little<00:05:22.680> bit<00:05:22.919> of<00:05:23.160> a<00:05:23.900> teal<00:05:24.900> color<00:05:24.930> so<00:05:25.860> I'm

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
be a little bit of a teal color so I'm

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.090 
be a little bit of a teal color so I'm
going<00:05:26.160> to<00:05:26.190> try<00:05:26.430> my<00:05:26.990> color<00:05:27.990> picker<00:05:28.290> over<00:05:28.650> here

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
going to try my color picker over here

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.190 
going to try my color picker over here
and<00:05:29.280> hover<00:05:29.520> over<00:05:29.940> something<00:05:30.900> that's<00:05:31.080> supposed

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
and hover over something that's supposed

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.260 
and hover over something that's supposed

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
that's too yellow so let's try again

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.310 
that's too yellow so let's try again
another<00:05:36.150> spot<00:05:37.430> that's<00:05:38.430> better<00:05:38.730> in<00:05:39.240> this<00:05:40.020> photo

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
another spot that's better in this photo

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.380 
another spot that's better in this photo
there<00:05:40.980> are<00:05:41.130> two<00:05:41.310> things<00:05:41.340> that<00:05:41.700> I<00:05:41.790> notice<00:05:42.180> right

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
there are two things that I notice right

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.210 
there are two things that I notice right
away<00:05:42.450> I<00:05:42.630> notice<00:05:42.810> that<00:05:43.290> the<00:05:43.440> trees<00:05:43.770> and<00:05:44.160> the

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
away I notice that the trees and the

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.800 
away I notice that the trees and the
background<00:05:44.700> lean<00:05:45.030> over<00:05:45.360> to<00:05:45.480> the<00:05:45.600> right<00:05:45.780> a

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
background lean over to the right a

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.260 
background lean over to the right a
little<00:05:45.990> bit<00:05:46.230> so<00:05:46.980> we<00:05:47.070> need<00:05:47.220> to<00:05:47.340> rotate<00:05:47.610> it<00:05:48.060> to

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
little bit so we need to rotate it to

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.420 
little bit so we need to rotate it to
fix<00:05:48.660> that<00:05:48.900> and<00:05:49.080> that<00:05:49.650> there's<00:05:49.860> also<00:05:50.070> this

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
fix that and that there's also this

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.290 
fix that and that there's also this
shadow<00:05:50.820> underneath<00:05:51.270> the<00:05:51.419> groom's<00:05:51.720> I

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
shadow underneath the groom's I

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.089 
shadow underneath the groom's I
here<00:05:52.599> so<00:05:53.080> we're<00:05:53.169> going<00:05:53.259> to<00:05:53.379> try<00:05:53.500> to<00:05:53.620> fix<00:05:53.889> that

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
here so we're going to try to fix that

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:56.040 
here so we're going to try to fix that
too<00:05:54.370> the<00:05:55.000> first<00:05:55.240> thing<00:05:55.389> we're<00:05:55.509> going<00:05:55.599> to<00:05:55.659> do<00:05:55.810> is

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
too the first thing we're going to do is

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.499 
too the first thing we're going to do is
turn<00:05:56.259> on<00:05:56.319> the<00:05:56.530> crop<00:05:56.770> tool<00:05:57.069> over<00:05:57.460> here<00:05:57.819> and<00:05:58.000> this

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
turn on the crop tool over here and this

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:00.990 
turn on the crop tool over here and this
also<00:05:58.780> allows<00:05:58.990> us<00:05:59.319> to<00:05:59.470> rotate<00:05:59.949> the<00:06:00.099> photo<00:06:00.340> so

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
also allows us to rotate the photo so

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.029 
also allows us to rotate the photo so
when<00:06:01.300> you<00:06:01.389> grab<00:06:01.629> the<00:06:01.810> edge<00:06:02.020> of<00:06:02.470> the<00:06:02.650> photo<00:06:02.860> you

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 
when you grab the edge of the photo you

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.270 
when you grab the edge of the photo you
can<00:06:03.340> just<00:06:03.550> drag<00:06:03.879> it<00:06:03.909> up<00:06:04.210> a<00:06:04.500> little<00:06:05.500> bit<00:06:05.620> there

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
can just drag it up a little bit there

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.790 
can just drag it up a little bit there
and<00:06:06.759> this<00:06:07.270> great<00:06:07.569> appears<00:06:08.080> so<00:06:08.319> I<00:06:08.349> can<00:06:08.530> line<00:06:08.770> up

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
and this great appears so I can line up

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.490 
and this great appears so I can line up
the<00:06:09.039> trees<00:06:09.310> to<00:06:09.520> the<00:06:09.550> grid<00:06:09.940> and<00:06:10.229> that<00:06:11.229> looks

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
the trees to the grid and that looks

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
the trees to the grid and that looks
pretty<00:06:11.770> good<00:06:11.949> so<00:06:12.009> I'll<00:06:12.430> turn<00:06:12.879> off<00:06:13.090> my<00:06:13.300> tool<00:06:13.569> and

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
pretty good so I'll turn off my tool and

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.279 
pretty good so I'll turn off my tool and
now<00:06:15.520> to<00:06:15.580> fix<00:06:15.940> this<00:06:16.090> shadow<00:06:16.419> under<00:06:16.870> his<00:06:17.050> eyes

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:19.509 
i'm going to try pulling up the exposure

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:22.200 
i'm going to try pulling up the exposure
a<00:06:19.659> little<00:06:19.960> bit<00:06:20.110> first<00:06:20.500> and<00:06:20.979> i<00:06:21.639> like<00:06:21.819> what<00:06:22.090> that

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:45.390 
I'm going to paint over this dark area
right<00:06:42.310> here<00:06:43.590> so<00:06:44.590> I<00:06:44.620> didn't<00:06:44.919> see<00:06:45.039> much<00:06:45.190> of<00:06:45.250> a

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
right here so I didn't see much of a

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.309 
right here so I didn't see much of a
change<00:06:45.430> right<00:06:45.879> away<00:06:45.940> but<00:06:46.270> I<00:06:46.569> can<00:06:46.780> go<00:06:46.930> in<00:06:47.110> and

00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:47.319 
change right away but I can go in and

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:50.399 
change right away but I can go in and
readjust<00:06:48.069> it<00:06:48.280> after<00:06:48.759> the<00:06:48.849> fact<00:06:49.139> see<00:06:50.139> you<00:06:50.289> can

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:50.409 
readjust it after the fact see you can

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:53.430 
readjust it after the fact see you can
adjust<00:06:50.530> way<00:06:51.009> up<00:06:51.370> that's<00:06:51.610> way<00:06:51.849> too<00:06:51.909> much<00:06:52.449> down

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
adjust way up that's way too much down

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.890 
adjust way up that's way too much down
it<00:06:53.919> looks<00:06:54.069> like<00:06:54.219> he's<00:06:54.340> wearing<00:06:54.430> sunglasses<00:06:54.900> so

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 
it looks like he's wearing sunglasses so

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.019 
it looks like he's wearing sunglasses so
it's<00:06:56.409> just<00:06:56.710> really<00:06:57.130> a<00:06:57.250> matter<00:06:57.430> of<00:06:57.550> finding<00:06:57.880> the

00:06:58.019 --> 00:06:58.029 
it's just really a matter of finding the

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:01.649 
it's just really a matter of finding the
sweet<00:06:58.300> spot<00:06:59.909> and<00:07:00.909> that<00:07:01.060> looks<00:07:01.210> pretty<00:07:01.449> good

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:01.659 
sweet spot and that looks pretty good

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:04.399 
sweet spot and that looks pretty good
for<00:07:01.810> me<00:07:01.930> so<00:07:02.199> we'll<00:07:02.349> turn<00:07:02.500> that<00:07:02.710> off<00:07:03.180> and

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:04.409 
for me so we'll turn that off and

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:07.409 
for me so we'll turn that off and
another<00:07:05.409> tone<00:07:05.770> curve<00:07:06.159> adjustment<00:07:06.460> here<00:07:07.090> could

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:07.419 
another tone curve adjustment here could

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:09.390 
another tone curve adjustment here could
help<00:07:07.630> out<00:07:07.840> to<00:07:08.139> a<00:07:08.169> little<00:07:08.529> bit<00:07:08.650> pull<00:07:09.009> up<00:07:09.159> on<00:07:09.310> the

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.400 
help out to a little bit pull up on the

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.850 
help out to a little bit pull up on the
right<00:07:09.610> and<00:07:09.849> down<00:07:09.909> on<00:07:10.240> the<00:07:10.270> left<00:07:10.650> to<00:07:11.650> make<00:07:11.830> a

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:11.860 
right and down on the left to make a

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.249 
right and down on the left to make a
brights<00:07:12.219> brighter<00:07:12.610> in<00:07:12.819> the<00:07:12.849> darks<00:07:13.210> darker<00:07:13.690> and

00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:14.259 
brights brighter in the darks darker and

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:16.499 
brights brighter in the darks darker and
I<00:07:15.039> think<00:07:15.250> that's<00:07:15.400> looking<00:07:15.699> pretty<00:07:15.729> good<00:07:16.120> let's

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:16.509 
I think that's looking pretty good let's

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:18.779 
I think that's looking pretty good let's
look<00:07:16.630> at<00:07:16.779> our<00:07:16.810> before<00:07:17.259> and<00:07:17.560> after<00:07:18.099> here's<00:07:18.580> the
