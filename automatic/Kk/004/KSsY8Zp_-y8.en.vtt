mean we just heard gunshots and some guy

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.840

being<00:02:01.670> killed<00:02:02.060> probably<00:02:02.960> by<00:02:03.140> revenant<00:02:03.850> don't

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
being killed probably by revenant don't

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.399 
being killed probably by revenant don't
you<00:02:05.060> think<00:02:05.299> we<00:02:05.420> should<00:02:05.539> maybe<00:02:05.930> hole<00:02:06.229> up

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
you think we should maybe hole up

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.389 
you think we should maybe hole up
somewhere<00:02:06.439> just<00:02:07.039> in<00:02:07.280> case<00:02:07.520> god<00:02:08.239> Dennis

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
somewhere just in case god Dennis

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.190 
somewhere just in case god Dennis
sometimes<00:02:10.399> I<00:02:10.610> wonder<00:02:10.849> why<00:02:11.090> we<00:02:11.540> ever<00:02:11.690> built<00:02:11.989> you

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
sometimes I wonder why we ever built you

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.480 
sometimes I wonder why we ever built you
in<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.440> first<00:02:12.620> place<00:02:13.120> why

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.120 

because<00:02:18.480> you're<00:02:18.750> easily<00:02:18.990> influenced<00:02:19.890> by

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
because you're easily influenced by

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.400 
because you're easily influenced by
television<00:02:20.820> just<00:02:21.180> like<00:02:21.390> all<00:02:21.600> those<00:02:21.840> zoned<00:02:22.230> out

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
television just like all those zoned out

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.440 
television just like all those zoned out
humans<00:02:23.130> who<00:02:23.250> will<00:02:23.520> inevitably<00:02:23.820> become

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
humans who will inevitably become

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.310 
humans who will inevitably become
enslaved<00:02:25.170> bias<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:27.330> just<00:02:27.660> watched<00:02:28.080> the
