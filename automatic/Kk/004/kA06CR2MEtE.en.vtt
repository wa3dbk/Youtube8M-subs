00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
app that Microsoft once again released

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.160 
app that Microsoft once again released
essentially<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.400> same<00:00:11.700> as<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.389> old<00:00:12.599> YouTube

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
essentially the same as the old YouTube

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.259 
essentially the same as the old YouTube
app<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:13.679> they<00:00:13.889> released<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.730> then<00:00:14.910> had<00:00:15.240> to

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
app that they released and then had to

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.810 
app that they released and then had to
pull<00:00:15.690> but<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.560> one<00:00:16.800> actually<00:00:17.340> complies<00:00:17.789> with

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
pull but this one actually complies with

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.640 
pull but this one actually complies with
Google's<00:00:18.570> requirements<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.289> has<00:00:19.470> been

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
Google's requirements and has been

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.310

officially<00:00:20.100> approved<00:00:20.580> by<00:00:20.730> Google<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.199> is

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
officially approved by Google so this is

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
between these you actually have to hit

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.300

more<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.460> little<00:01:11.939> odd<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:13.010> otherwise<00:01:14.010> has<00:01:14.280> a

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310

more so little odd but otherwise has a
pretty<00:01:14.700> nice<00:01:14.880> interface<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:16.759> another<00:01:17.759> thing

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
pretty nice interface and another thing

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.969 
pretty nice interface and another thing
they<00:01:18.240> added<00:01:18.780> was<00:01:20.390> in-stream<00:01:21.390> video<00:01:21.750> ads<00:01:22.229> so

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
they added was in-stream video ads so

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.499 
they added was in-stream video ads so
every<00:01:23.369> time<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.640> go<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.790> watch<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.240> video

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
every time you go to watch a video

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.109 
every time you go to watch a video
basically<00:01:25.229> every<00:01:25.470> time<00:01:25.670> you'll<00:01:26.670> always<00:01:26.820> get<00:01:27.060> a

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
basically every time you'll always get a

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.819 
basically every time you'll always get a
video<00:01:27.869> ad<00:01:28.110> before<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.840> ad<00:01:31.079> seemed<00:01:31.650> B

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
video ad before it and the ad seemed B

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.980 
video ad before it and the ad seemed B
even<00:01:32.040> way<00:01:32.400> more<00:01:32.430> frequent<00:01:33.240> than<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> desktop

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
even way more frequent than the desktop

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.630 
even way more frequent than the desktop
website<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:34.860> really<00:01:35.130> annoying

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
website so it's really annoying

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.819 
website so it's really annoying
pretty<00:01:36.329> much<00:01:36.390> every<00:01:36.720> video<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.049> watched<00:01:37.350> every

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
pretty much every video I watched every

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.240 
pretty much every video I watched every
single<00:01:37.979> time<00:01:38.369> had<00:01:38.640> an<00:01:38.790> advertisement<00:01:39.540> but<00:01:40.250> you

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
single time had an advertisement but you

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.760 
single time had an advertisement but you
got<00:01:41.400> your<00:01:41.520> details<00:01:42.060> view<00:01:42.479> here<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.140> then

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
got your details view here and then

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.370 
got your details view here and then
comments<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.570> actually<00:01:45.720> tap<00:01:46.110> to

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
comments and you can actually tap to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.469 
comments and you can actually tap to
reply<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:47.040> comment<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:48.000> that's<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.329> nice

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
reply to a comment so that's a nice

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.100 
reply to a comment so that's a nice
feature<00:01:48.619> but<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.979> interface<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> little

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
feature but the interface is a little

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.530 
feature but the interface is a little
confusing<00:01:52.110> here<00:01:52.560> with<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.040> video<00:01:53.189> screen<00:01:53.729> it

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
confusing here with the video screen it

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.389 
confusing here with the video screen it
doesn't<00:01:54.990> always<00:01:55.320> work<00:01:55.710> well<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.159> just<00:01:56.250> a

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
doesn't always work well and just a

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.880 
doesn't always work well and just a
little<00:01:56.520> little<00:01:57.180> laggy<00:01:57.570> while<00:01:58.439> it's<00:01:58.649> playing

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
little little laggy while it's playing

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.170 
little little laggy while it's playing
the<00:01:59.040> video<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.640> definitely<00:01:59.729> want<00:02:00.090> to

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
the video so you definitely want to

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.270 
the video so you definitely want to
pause<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.810> while<00:02:01.140> you're<00:02:01.320> doing<00:02:01.469> something<00:02:02.070> on

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
pause it while you're doing something on

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.179 
pause it while you're doing something on
the<00:02:02.969> page<00:02:03.210> because<00:02:03.509> otherwise<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:05.009> app

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
the page because otherwise the app

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.749 
the page because otherwise the app
basically<00:02:05.759> becomes<00:02:06.360> unusable<00:02:06.689> here<00:02:07.759> even

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
basically becomes unusable here even
