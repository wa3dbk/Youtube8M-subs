 Hello friends in the continuation of the topic 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.080
 let's talk about batteries today 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.200
 about one interesting accessory which 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.780
 will save you a lot of time it will be about 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.000
 external charger for your 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.130
 action cameras such chargers 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.190
 Meets for both Chinese cameras 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.369
 and for gopro hero cameras for the original 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.290
 gopro cameras you can meet like 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.600
 accessory by the company is gopro 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.890
 a huge number of Chinese fakes 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.360
 from simple to tricked 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.820
 the only advice is not to buy cheap 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.700
 Chinese chargers because you can 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.829
 get a bunch of problems from them whether 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.200
 dead batteries or just not 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.120
 will charge you from therefore advise 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.410
 read reviews and choose something 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.840
 still more expensive linden brothers 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.800
 original charger 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.660
 huge plus of this charger 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.550
 device is an opportunity 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.399
 save time and charge two at once 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.320
 batteries by charging 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.090
 your battery using external 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.160
 chargers you can 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.069
 secure your camera action against 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.300
 voltage drops as charging rules 

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:17.520
 devices designed for 2 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:23.039
 battery can be charged as one so 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.420
 and two batteries at the same time as 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.000
 rule such chargers 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.819
 equipped with standard yusbi cables 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.920
 but also has additional 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.630
 girlfriend outlets and charger 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.000
 that may be at your fingertips 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.490
 and now I connected the charger 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.979
 device to normal usb connector from 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.289
 phone and as you can see started charging 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.750
 the lights turned red as soon as 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.800
 any of the batteries will 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.830
 fully charged honey 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.509
 changing color to green in different charger 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.610
 device who can display 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.110
 I really different 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.319
 I recommend using an external charger 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.940
 device be it on one battery in 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.860
 Ideally, Irina has two batteries 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.840
 firstly saves a huge amount 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.149
 time well and as I said all the same 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.890
 charge batteries in external 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.080
 chargers is more 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.760
 safe charging method like this 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.530
 accessory for action cameras we reviewed 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.659

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.349
 useful so do not forget to put 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.670
