most<00:02:23.640> recently<00:02:24.209> I<00:02:24.299> used<00:02:24.629> it<00:02:24.780> because<00:02:25.019> I<00:02:25.049> was

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
most recently I used it because I was

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.850 
most recently I used it because I was
out<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.680> balance<00:02:26.069> after<00:02:26.580> having<00:02:26.909> sex<00:02:27.239> and

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
out of balance after having sex and

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.330 
out of balance after having sex and
using<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:29.099> latex<00:02:29.640> condom<00:02:30.049> so<00:02:31.220> because<00:02:32.220> I'm

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
using a latex condom so because I'm

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.160 
using a latex condom so because I'm
allergic<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.700> latex<00:02:33.060> condoms<00:02:33.540> but<00:02:33.659> sometimes

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
allergic to latex condoms but sometimes

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.309 
allergic to latex condoms but sometimes
a<00:02:34.560> man<00:02:35.430> may<00:02:35.610> be<00:02:35.670> too<00:02:35.940> large<00:02:36.209> or<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.840> don't<00:02:37.110> have

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
a man may be too large or I don't have

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.470 
a man may be too large or I don't have
any<00:02:37.560> non<00:02:37.799> latex<00:02:38.220> condoms<00:02:38.700> at<00:02:38.819> my<00:02:39.000> easy-access

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
any non latex condoms at my easy-access

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.690 
any non latex condoms at my easy-access
so<00:02:39.989> I<00:02:40.230> will<00:02:40.590> have<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:40.799> use<00:02:40.860> one<00:02:41.129> which<00:02:41.370> causes

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
so I will have to use one which causes

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.059 
so I will have to use one which causes
allergic<00:02:41.819> reaction<00:02:42.420> which<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.379> why<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.590> won't

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
allergic reaction which is why I won't

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.920 
allergic reaction which is why I won't
be<00:02:44.250> doing<00:02:44.519> that<00:02:44.670> anymore<00:02:44.910> but<00:02:45.629> needless<00:02:45.810> to

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
be doing that anymore but needless to

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.400 
be doing that anymore but needless to
say<00:02:46.129> when<00:02:47.129> I<00:02:47.160> wanted<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.670> get<00:02:47.819> back<00:02:47.970> in<00:02:48.180> balance

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410
