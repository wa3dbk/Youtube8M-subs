everybody is in on it everybody's part
of<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.330> trick<00:00:12.540> so<00:00:13.250> essentially<00:00:14.250> what<00:00:14.370> we're

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
of the trick so essentially what we're

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.709 
of the trick so essentially what we're
gonna<00:00:14.549> have<00:00:14.759> happen<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.240> we're<00:00:15.480> going<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.630> have

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
gonna have happen is we're going to have

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.410 
gonna have happen is we're going to have
a<00:00:15.780> shuffle<00:00:16.139> deck<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.789> four<00:00:17.789> people<00:00:17.970> get<00:00:18.150> a

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
a shuffle deck and four people get a

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.120 
a shuffle deck and four people get a
star<00:00:18.690> okay<00:00:20.000> four<00:00:21.000> different<00:00:21.720> random<00:00:22.289> selected

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
star okay four different random selected

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.730 
star okay four different random selected
cards<00:00:23.460> from<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.760> shuffled<00:00:24.240> deck<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.840> normal

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
cards from a shuffled deck of normal

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.580 
cards from a shuffled deck of normal
playing<00:00:26.340> cards<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:27.660> can<00:00:27.840> be<00:00:27.930> done<00:00:28.109> at<00:00:28.470> a

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
playing cards this can be done at a

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.259 
playing cards this can be done at a
moment's<00:00:29.010> notice<00:00:29.039> which<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.460> part<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.090> what's

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
moment's notice which is part of what's

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.970 
moment's notice which is part of what's
great<00:00:30.390> about<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.140> now<00:00:31.289> we<00:00:31.320> take<00:00:31.590> these<00:00:31.740> four

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
great about it so now we take these four

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.069 
great about it so now we take these four
cards<00:00:32.160> which<00:00:32.610> we<00:00:32.790> probably<00:00:33.000> won't<00:00:33.270> expect<00:00:33.989> it

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
cards which we probably won't expect it

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.190 
cards which we probably won't expect it
as<00:00:34.230> probably<00:00:34.530> will<00:00:34.649> not<00:00:34.739> show<00:00:34.980> us<00:00:35.130> these<00:00:35.280> cards

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
as probably will not show us these cards

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.569 
as probably will not show us these cards
it<00:00:37.200> makes<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> little<00:00:37.680> cooler<00:00:37.980> if<00:00:38.340> they

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
it makes it a little cooler if they

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.369 
it makes it a little cooler if they
don't<00:00:38.790> but<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.329> doesn't<00:00:39.570> matter<00:00:39.719> if<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.200> see

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
don't but it doesn't matter if you see

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.040 
don't but it doesn't matter if you see
them<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.610> take<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.879> first<00:00:42.030> card<00:00:42.329> slide<00:00:42.899> it

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
them so we take the first card slide it

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.600 
them so we take the first card slide it
in<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.200> pack<00:00:43.379> some<00:00:43.890> random<00:00:44.190> point<00:00:44.430> right

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
in the pack some random point right

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.420 
in the pack some random point right
there<00:00:44.989> alright<00:00:45.989> I'm<00:00:46.079> enough<00:00:46.309> respected<00:00:47.309> for

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
there alright I'm enough respected for

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.220 
there alright I'm enough respected for
the<00:00:47.520> spectator<00:00:47.940> cell<00:00:48.180> yeah<00:00:48.420> cuz<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.840> random

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
the spectator cell yeah cuz it is random

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.490 
the spectator cell yeah cuz it is random
the<00:00:49.860> second<00:00:50.190> one<00:00:50.340> goes<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:53.000> third<00:00:54.000> one<00:00:54.500> follows

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
the second one goes in third one follows

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.060 
the second one goes in third one follows
and<00:00:55.829> worth<00:00:56.190> them<00:00:56.399> all<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.699> close<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.750> deck

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
and worth them all so close in the deck

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.039 
and worth them all so close in the deck
and<00:00:59.120> then<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.480> will<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:01.379> do<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> triple<00:01:01.890> cut

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
and then we will just do a triple cut

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.310 
and then we will just do a triple cut
and<00:01:04.460> we<00:01:05.460> actually<00:01:05.640> now<00:01:06.000> have<00:01:06.299> all<00:01:06.630> four<00:01:07.020> cards

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
and we actually now have all four cards

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.500 
and we actually now have all four cards
on<00:01:07.439> top<00:01:07.619> but<00:01:08.490> you'd<00:01:08.700> probably<00:01:08.729> want<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.390> do

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
on top but you'd probably want to do

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.990 
on top but you'd probably want to do
some<00:01:09.750> pretty<00:01:10.080> cool<00:01:10.350> reveals<00:01:10.830> with<00:01:11.130> all<00:01:11.729> these

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000

do is the first one the first ones the
hardest<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:27.299> take<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.630> eight<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.780> Hearts

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
hardest we take the eight of Hearts

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.700 
hardest we take the eight of Hearts
slide<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.009> into<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.280> pack<00:01:29.579> about<00:01:30.710> two-thirds

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
slide it into the pack about two-thirds

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.800 
slide it into the pack about two-thirds
of<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.860> way<00:01:31.920> down<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.329> slightly

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
of the way down and so it's slightly

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.690 
of the way down and so it's slightly
poking<00:01:34.290> out<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.650> while<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.460> slightly

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
poking out and while it's slightly

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.100 
poking out and while it's slightly
poking<00:01:36.060> out<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.450> show<00:01:36.630> them<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.930> it's

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
poking out you can show them that it's
