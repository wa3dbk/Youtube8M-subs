this for the I guess for the the serious
side<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.609> things<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.390> know<00:01:18.509> they<00:01:18.659> throw

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
side of things you know they throw

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.440 
side of things you know they throw
themselves<00:01:19.350> at<00:01:19.979> obstacle<00:01:20.640> courses<00:01:20.939> like<00:01:21.210> this

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
themselves at obstacle courses like this

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.559 
themselves at obstacle courses like this
and<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.829> see<00:01:23.070> their<00:01:23.640> times<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.360> what<00:01:24.450> it

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:24.569 
and just to see their times and what it

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:25.910 
and just to see their times and what it
is<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.719> they<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.469> then<00:01:25.560> everyone<00:01:25.799> can

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
is that they do and then everyone can

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.719 
is that they do and then everyone can
benchmark<00:01:26.250> off<00:01:26.609> of<00:01:26.789> that<00:01:28.250> all<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.429> take<00:01:29.579> these

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
benchmark off of that all it take these

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:30.889 
benchmark off of that all it take these
for<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.119> get<00:01:30.240> out<00:01:30.360> there<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.569> have<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.719> go

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
you don't really need a huge level of

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.969 
you don't really need a huge level of
fitness<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.959> get<00:01:37.200> there<00:01:37.439> with<00:01:37.649> a<00:01:37.709> group<00:01:37.860> of

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
fitness you get there with a group of

mates and you can push each other along
and<00:01:39.479> get<00:01:39.600> through<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.810> course<00:01:41.119> it<00:01:42.119> was<00:01:42.209> a

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
and get through the course it was a

and get through the course it was a
really<00:01:42.420> tough<00:01:42.719> course<00:01:43.049> lots<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.530> hills<00:01:43.709> and

00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:44.099 
really tough course lots of hills and

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:46.279 
really tough course lots of hills and
there<00:01:44.549> was<00:01:44.640> much<00:01:44.849> running<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> space

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
there was much running like the space

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:47.960 
there was much running like the space
for<00:01:46.470> running<00:01:46.739> so<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.950> was<00:01:47.039> either<00:01:47.159> up<00:01:47.520> or<00:01:47.729> down

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
for running so it was either up or down

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.960 
for running so it was either up or down
and<00:01:49.099> obstacles<00:01:50.099> so<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.399> couldn't<00:01:50.579> really<00:01:50.759> get

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
and obstacles so we couldn't really get

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.149 
and obstacles so we couldn't really get
into<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> rhythm<00:01:51.539> for<00:01:52.020> running<00:01:52.349> so<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.039> was<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
into a rhythm for running so it was a

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.630 
into a rhythm for running so it was a
tough<00:01:53.700> little<00:01:53.849> course<00:01:54.950> that's<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.189> fun<00:01:56.369> like

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
tough little course that's just fun like

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.359 
tough little course that's just fun like
it<00:01:56.819> here<00:01:57.030> mates<00:01:57.630> together<00:01:57.840> group<00:01:58.709> environment

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
it here mates together group environment

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.859 
it here mates together group environment
try<00:01:59.640> something<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> little<00:02:00.209> bit<00:02:00.299> different<00:02:00.720> and

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
try something a little bit different and
