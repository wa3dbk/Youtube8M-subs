00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
hi welcome back what we're going to do

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.490 
hi welcome back what we're going to do
in<00:00:03.600> this<00:00:03.870> tutorial<00:00:04.110> is<00:00:04.770> I<00:00:05.220> am<00:00:05.580> going<00:00:05.609> to<00:00:06.500> show

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
in this tutorial is I am going to show

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.480 
in this tutorial is I am going to show
you<00:00:07.529> how<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.799> digitize<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.610> scoliosis

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
you how to digitize a scoliosis

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.430 
you how to digitize a scoliosis
assessment<00:00:11.750> which<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> little<00:00:13.080> different

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
assessment which is a little different

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.860 
assessment which is a little different
than<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.769> traditional<00:00:14.420> x-ray<00:00:15.420> line<00:00:15.660> drawn

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
than the traditional x-ray line drawn

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.320 
than the traditional x-ray line drawn
analysis<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.949> what<00:00:17.699> we're<00:00:17.820> going<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.000> do<00:00:18.119> is

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
analysis and what we're going to do is

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.210 
analysis and what we're going to do is
I've<00:00:18.600> already<00:00:18.840> imported<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.470> image<00:00:19.770> here<00:00:20.039> and

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
I've already imported the image here and

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.370 
I've already imported the image here and
you<00:00:21.029> can<00:00:21.119> see<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.689> orthopedist<00:00:22.260> had

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
you can see that the orthopedist had

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.900 
you can see that the orthopedist had
already<00:00:22.529> drawn<00:00:22.859> some<00:00:23.070> lines<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
already drawn some lines on the on the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.029 
already drawn some lines on the on the
film<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:24.570> patient<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.769> an<00:00:25.890> actual

x-ray<00:00:29.900> with<00:00:30.900> my<00:00:31.080> camera<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.090> always

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
x-ray with my camera so like I always

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.020 
x-ray with my camera so like I always
like<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.570> say<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.680> poor<00:00:34.920> man's<00:00:35.130> digital<00:00:35.730> x-ray

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
like to say the poor man's digital x-ray

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.229 
like to say the poor man's digital x-ray
system<00:00:36.739> so<00:00:37.739> again<00:00:38.250> what<00:00:38.610> we'll<00:00:38.730> do<00:00:38.850> from<00:00:39.059> this

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
system so again what we'll do from this

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.940 
system so again what we'll do from this
view<00:00:39.540> here<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:39.989> we're<00:00:40.379> going<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.530> go<00:00:40.649> ahead<00:00:40.770> and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
view here is we're going to go ahead and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.490 
view here is we're going to go ahead and
say<00:00:41.280> what<00:00:42.059> vertebra<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:42.600> we<00:00:42.690> see<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:43.140> can<00:00:43.290> see

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
say what vertebra can we see we can see

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.279 
say what vertebra can we see we can see
T<00:00:43.890> 1<00:00:44.070> through<00:00:44.309> t<00:00:44.460> 12<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.059> that's<00:00:45.210> fine<00:00:45.480> next

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
T 1 through t 12 so that's fine next

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.150 
T 1 through t 12 so that's fine next
thing<00:00:46.440> we're<00:00:46.590> going<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.739> do<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:46.980> we're<00:00:47.070> going

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
thing we're going to do is we're going

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.220 
thing we're going to do is we're going
to<00:00:47.219> go<00:00:47.340> here<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.640> clues<00:00:48.149> choose<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.750> scoliosis

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
to go here and clues choose a scoliosis

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.279 
to go here and clues choose a scoliosis
tab<00:00:50.000> now<00:00:51.000> we're<00:00:51.300> going<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.480> click<00:00:51.660> appearances

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
tab now we're going to click appearances

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.040 
tab now we're going to click appearances
digitize<00:00:52.739> using<00:00:53.100> scoliosis<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:54.899> to

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
digitize using scoliosis and we have to

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.970 
digitize using scoliosis and we have to
decide<00:00:55.289> what<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:57.289> superior<00:00:58.289> portion<00:00:58.559> of

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
decide what the the superior portion of

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.459 
decide what the the superior portion of
the<00:00:59.070> scoliosis<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.930> most<00:01:01.170> inferior

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
the scoliosis is and the most inferior

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.950 
the scoliosis is and the most inferior
portion<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.129> curve<00:01:02.340> as<00:01:02.640> well<00:01:03.359> as<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> apex

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
portion of the curve as well as the apex

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.050 
portion of the curve as well as the apex
so<00:01:04.559> I've<00:01:04.769> already<00:01:04.949> counted<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.519> vertebra<00:01:05.880> it

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
so I've already counted the vertebra it

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.539 
so I've already counted the vertebra it
appears<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.659> me<00:01:06.810> as<00:01:07.080> did<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.890> orthopedist<00:01:08.430> at

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
appears to me as did the orthopedist at

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.840 
appears to me as did the orthopedist at
about<00:01:08.729> t<00:01:08.939> five<00:01:09.180> starts<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.720> scoliosis<00:01:10.049> and

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
about t five starts of scoliosis and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.000 
about t five starts of scoliosis and
twelve<00:01:11.850> eleven<00:01:12.119> ten<00:01:12.270> nine<00:01:12.510> eight<00:01:13.020> about<00:01:13.500> t8

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
twelve eleven ten nine eight about t8

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.149 
twelve eleven ten nine eight about t8
would<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.670> apex<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.900> let's<00:01:16.200> put<00:01:16.380> t<00:01:16.560> 12<00:01:16.830> as

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
would be the apex and let's put t 12 as

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.179 
would be the apex and let's put t 12 as
the<00:01:17.549> base<00:01:17.990> and<00:01:18.990> again<00:01:19.380> here<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:19.740> there<00:01:19.890> was<00:01:20.009> two

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
the base and again here if there was two

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.499 
the base and again here if there was two
curves<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.640> school<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.180> i<00:01:21.210> would<00:01:21.360> go<00:01:21.479> ahead

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
curves and school is so i would go ahead

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.929 
curves and school is so i would go ahead
and<00:01:21.720> select<00:01:22.560> those<00:01:22.860> two<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.369> there's<00:01:23.520> one<00:01:23.759> in

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
and select those two but there's one in

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.749 
and select those two but there's one in
this<00:01:24.150> one<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:25.380> i'm<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.009> click<00:01:26.100> points

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
this one so i'm going to click points

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.100 
this one so i'm going to click points
now<00:01:26.939> what's<00:01:27.600> different<00:01:28.670> excuse<00:01:29.670> me<00:01:29.840> in<00:01:30.840> this

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
now what's different excuse me in this

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
now what's different excuse me in this
is<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.500> we're<00:01:31.590> going<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.799> go<00:01:31.890> ahead<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
is that we're going to go ahead and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.330 
is that we're going to go ahead and
choose<00:01:32.420> to<00:01:33.420> digitize<00:01:33.900> using<00:01:34.500> all<00:01:34.829> four

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
choose to digitize using all four

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.550 
choose to digitize using all four
corners<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.909> vertebral<00:01:36.299> body<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.930> of

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
corners of the vertebral body and of

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.170 
corners of the vertebral body and of
course<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.159> would<00:01:38.310> make<00:01:38.520> sense<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.970> what

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
course that would make sense to what

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.510 
course that would make sense to what
we're<00:01:39.360> going<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.570> do<00:01:39.770> for<00:01:40.770> obvious<00:01:41.100> reasons

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
we're going to do for obvious reasons

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.310 
we're going to do for obvious reasons
because<00:01:41.670> we're<00:01:42.000> going<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.210> do<00:01:42.329> calculate<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
because we're going to do calculate the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.770 
because we're going to do calculate the
centroid<00:01:44.000> using<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> riser<00:01:45.270> Ferguson

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
centroid using the riser Ferguson

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.649 
centroid using the riser Ferguson
methods<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.470> I'm<00:01:47.159> going<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.369> go<00:01:47.490> ahead<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.030> let

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
methods so I'm going to go ahead and let

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.230 
methods so I'm going to go ahead and let
me<00:01:48.689> go<00:01:48.930> ahead<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.170> click<00:01:49.439> these<00:01:49.740> points<00:01:50.579> I'm

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
me go ahead and click these points I'm

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.609 
me go ahead and click these points I'm
going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> go<00:01:51.570> ahead<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.930> digitize<00:01:52.350> this

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
going to go ahead and digitize this

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.050 
going to go ahead and digitize this
first<00:01:55.250> okay<00:01:56.250> so

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.399 

and<00:01:59.350> having<00:02:00.350> a<00:02:00.500> nice<00:02:01.100> big<00:02:01.399> screen<00:02:01.610> here<00:02:02.409> makes

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
and having a nice big screen here makes

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:10.540 
and having a nice big screen here makes
life<00:02:03.890> a<00:02:04.159> lot<00:02:04.369> easier<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:09.009> again<00:02:10.009> you<00:02:10.039> already

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
life a lot easier and again you already

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.229 
life a lot easier and again you already
know<00:02:10.670> how<00:02:10.789> to<00:02:10.819> do<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.300> pathology<00:02:11.980> I<00:02:13.239> already

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
know how to do the pathology I already

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.320 
know how to do the pathology I already
showed<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.540> how<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.810> do<00:02:15.050> that<00:02:15.670> but<00:02:16.670> when<00:02:17.180> you

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
showed you how to do that but when you

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.509 
showed you how to do that but when you
do<00:02:17.480> scoliosis<00:02:17.989> it<00:02:18.500> becomes<00:02:19.370> very

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
do scoliosis it becomes very

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.490 
do scoliosis it becomes very
time-consuming<00:02:20.209> especially<00:02:20.930> if<00:02:21.380> you're

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
time-consuming especially if you're

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.040 
time-consuming especially if you're
going<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.680> do<00:02:21.769> comparisons<00:02:22.489> and<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.780> what

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
going to do comparisons and so what

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.330 
going to do comparisons and so what
we're<00:02:24.140> going<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.349> do<00:02:24.440> here<00:02:24.470> is<00:02:25.330> I'm<00:02:26.330> going<00:02:26.630> to

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
we're going to do here is I'm going to

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.150 
we're going to do here is I'm going to
finish<00:02:28.340> there<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:28.970> if<00:02:29.690> you<00:02:29.870> generate<00:02:30.830> the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
finish there and if you generate the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.100 
finish there and if you generate the
lines<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:31.580> can<00:02:31.760> go<00:02:31.850> ahead<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.120> see<00:02:32.420> that<00:02:33.080> we

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
lines you can go ahead and see that we

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.430 
lines you can go ahead and see that we
did<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.500> best<00:02:33.530> fit<00:02:33.980> line<00:02:34.220> through<00:02:34.580> here<00:02:34.850> and

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
did the best fit line through here and

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.740 
did the best fit line through here and
if<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.650> do<00:02:36.709> show<00:02:37.549> the<00:02:37.670> results<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.239> can<00:02:38.299> see<00:02:38.569> the

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
if I do show the results you can see the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.259 
if I do show the results you can see the
results<00:02:39.140> are<00:02:39.260> right<00:02:39.440> here<00:02:39.709> already<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:41.030> we<00:02:41.150> can

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
results are right here already so we can

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.050 
results are right here already so we can
see<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.480> riser<00:02:41.660> Ferguson<00:02:42.230> t52<00:02:42.920> through<00:02:43.280> t12

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
see the riser Ferguson t52 through t12

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.660 
see the riser Ferguson t52 through t12
is<00:02:44.299> 29.1<00:02:45.140> degrees<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.739> cob<00:02:45.950> angle<00:02:46.310> measured
