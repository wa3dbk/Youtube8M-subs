00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190 

somebody<00:00:00.240> should<00:00:00.480> probably<00:00:00.719> ask<00:00:01.020> I<00:00:01.760> am<00:00:03.200> even

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
somebody should probably ask I am even

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.919 
somebody should probably ask I am even
even<00:00:04.890> bothering<00:00:05.339> with<00:00:06.379> anezka<00:00:08.389> but<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.420> guess

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
even bothering with anezka but I guess

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.850 
even bothering with anezka but I guess
it's<00:00:10.139> two<00:00:10.380> reasons<00:00:10.860> one<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:12.860> I'm

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
it's two reasons one is that I'm

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.689 
it's two reasons one is that I'm
learning<00:00:14.460> how<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.360> tinker<00:00:15.839> with<00:00:15.870> these<00:00:16.170> things

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
learning how to tinker with these things

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.730 
learning how to tinker with these things
for<00:00:17.699> years<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.330> watched<00:00:18.779> my<00:00:19.050> dad<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.439> listen<00:00:19.680> to

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
for years I watched my dad and listen to

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.390 
for years I watched my dad and listen to
my<00:00:19.859> dad

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
my dad

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.490 
my dad
tinker<00:00:21.210> with<00:00:21.359> these<00:00:21.539> things<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.109> how<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.260> do

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
tinker with these things and how to do

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.410 
tinker with these things and how to do
it<00:00:22.529> but<00:00:23.250> I've<00:00:23.400> never<00:00:23.430> really<00:00:23.850> done<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:24.269> my

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
it but I've never really done it on my

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.519 
it but I've never really done it on my
own<00:00:24.590> without<00:00:25.590> him<00:00:26.070> around<00:00:26.930> so<00:00:27.930> I'm<00:00:28.230> kind<00:00:28.470> of

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
own without him around so I'm kind of

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.259 
own without him around so I'm kind of
learning<00:00:28.800> on<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.279> one<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.880> guess<00:00:30.060> it's

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
learning on this one and I guess it's

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.730 
learning on this one and I guess it's
probably<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.779> pretty<00:00:30.929> good<00:00:31.050> engine<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.560> learn

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
probably a pretty good engine to learn

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.520 
probably a pretty good engine to learn
on<00:00:32.270> because<00:00:33.270> if<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.510> mess<00:00:33.690> something<00:00:33.870> up<00:00:34.290> it's

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
on because if you mess something up it's

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.569 
on because if you mess something up it's
only<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.920> Eska<00:00:36.770> but<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.920> other<00:00:38.070> thing<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.550> that

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
only in Eska but the other thing is that

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.400 
only in Eska but the other thing is that
I<00:00:39.420> kind<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.050> grown<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:41.690> because<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:43.140> bought

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
I kind of grown to like because I bought

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.779 
I kind of grown to like because I bought
the<00:00:43.620> original<00:00:43.710> at<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.219> garage<00:00:44.430> sale<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:49.789> all

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
the original at a garage sale and all

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.680 
the original at a garage sale and all
right<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.239> one<00:00:51.539> thing<00:00:51.780> I've<00:00:51.960> noticed<00:00:52.760> is<00:00:53.760> that

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
right so one thing I've noticed is that

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.090 
right so one thing I've noticed is that
color<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.570> Pathfinder<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:58.620> better<00:00:58.859> of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
color on the Pathfinder the better of

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.729 
color on the Pathfinder the better of
the<00:00:59.219> two<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.699> thought<00:01:00.170> except<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.410> crack

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
the two I thought except for the crack

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.340 
the two I thought except for the crack
there<00:01:02.239> that's<00:01:03.239> why<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.510> swapped<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.019> out<00:01:04.110> cuz

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
there that's why I swapped it out cuz

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.090 
there that's why I swapped it out cuz
the<00:01:04.500> crack<00:01:05.689> has<00:01:06.689> way<00:01:07.020> less<00:01:07.049> play<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> prop

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
the crack has way less play in the prop

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.789 
the crack has way less play in the prop
you<00:01:08.580> can't<00:01:08.880> really<00:01:09.150> move<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.990> back<00:01:10.260> side<00:01:10.619> to

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
you can't really move it back side to

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.870 
you can't really move it back side to
side<00:01:11.040> but<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.180> older<00:01:12.840> one<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.170> golden<00:01:13.560> jet

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
side but this older one the golden jet

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.090 
side but this older one the golden jet
there's<00:01:14.880> lots<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.360> play<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.659> I'm<00:01:16.650> gonna<00:01:16.799> pull

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
there's lots of play so I'm gonna pull

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.859 
there's lots of play so I'm gonna pull
the<00:01:17.189> props<00:01:17.490> off<00:01:19.610> this<00:01:20.610> cotter<00:01:21.119> pin<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.750> then

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
the props off this cotter pin and then

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.310 
the props off this cotter pin and then
you<00:01:21.990> screw<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.590> off<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.040> guess<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:24.600> I'm<00:01:25.170> gonna

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
you screw this off I guess and I'm gonna

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.899 
you screw this off I guess and I'm gonna
inspect<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.950> propellers<00:01:28.340> one<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.460> these<00:01:29.610> two

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
inspect the propellers one of these two

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.149 
inspect the propellers one of these two
engines<00:01:30.150> both<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.290> these<00:01:31.409> engines<00:01:31.920> have<00:01:32.130> a

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
engines both of these engines have a

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.899 
engines both of these engines have a
neutral<00:01:33.140> clutch<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.950> neutral<00:01:35.400> clutch<00:01:35.640> on

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
neutral clutch the neutral clutch on

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.069 
neutral clutch the neutral clutch on
these<00:01:36.119> engines<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.869> nothing<00:01:37.439> more<00:01:37.710> than<00:01:38.579> this

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
these engines is nothing more than this

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.620 
these engines is nothing more than this
intermediate<00:01:40.490> spring-loaded<00:01:41.490> device<00:01:41.700> that

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
intermediate spring-loaded device that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.480 
intermediate spring-loaded device that
goes<00:01:42.810> between<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.560> power<00:01:43.770> head<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
goes between the power head and the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.010 
goes between the power head and the
drive<00:01:44.790> shaft<00:01:45.950> we<00:01:46.950> think<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.640> one<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.630> we

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
drive shaft we think the one that we

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.700 
drive shaft we think the one that we
want<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:50.119> save<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.420> motor<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.320> good

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
want to save on the motor on the good

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.740 
want to save on the motor on the good
motor<00:01:53.329> as<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:55.140> broken<00:01:55.979> spring<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.880> which<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.570> not

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
motor as a broken spring so which is not

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.749 
motor as a broken spring so which is not
uncommon<00:01:58.229> by<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.649> way<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:58.920> we're<00:01:59.310> going<00:01:59.579> to

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
uncommon by the way so we're going to

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.569 
uncommon by the way so we're going to
try<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.060> swap<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.750> out<00:02:00.990> with<00:02:01.829> another<00:02:02.219> motor

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
try to swap this out with another motor

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.899 
try to swap this out with another motor
and<00:02:03.500> it<00:02:04.500> should<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:04.920> interchangeable<00:02:05.640> so

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
and it should be interchangeable so

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.320 
and it should be interchangeable so
that's<00:02:06.119> what<00:02:06.299> we're<00:02:06.479> doing<00:02:06.780> now<00:02:09.500> we're

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
that's what we're doing now we're

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.810 
that's what we're doing now we're
that's<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.660> bad<00:02:11.840> one<00:02:12.130> that's<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.400> bad<00:02:13.580> one

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
that's the bad one that's the bad one

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.210 
that's the bad one that's the bad one
this<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.480> bed<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:15.440> we're<00:02:15.680> gonna<00:02:15.770> swap<00:02:16.160> it

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
this is the bed and we're gonna swap it

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.660 
this is the bed and we're gonna swap it
with<00:02:16.460> the<00:02:16.670> one<00:02:16.850> we<00:02:17.000> took<00:02:17.180> off<00:02:17.420> yes<00:02:21.430> one<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.460> the

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
with the one we took off yes one of the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.610 
with the one we took off yes one of the
things<00:02:22.700> that<00:02:23.330> we<00:02:23.930> found<00:02:24.880> difficult<00:02:26.320> now<00:02:27.320> we've

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
things that we found difficult now we've

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.590 
things that we found difficult now we've
got<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.980> motor<00:02:28.190> upside<00:02:28.730> down<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:29.300> wouldn't

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
got the motor upside down you wouldn't

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.550 
got the motor upside down you wouldn't
be<00:02:29.720> working<00:02:29.960> on<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.500> this<00:02:30.680> way<00:02:30.950> but<00:02:31.310> we<00:02:31.880> are<00:02:32.090> so

be working on it this way but we are so

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.750 
be working on it this way but we are so
one<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.770> things<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.190> we<00:02:34.280> found<00:02:34.490> so

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
one of the things that we found so

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.660 
one of the things that we found so
difficult<00:02:35.270> was<00:02:35.540> aligning<00:02:36.050> these<00:02:36.410> four<00:02:37.040> screw

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
difficult was aligning these four screw

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.580 
difficult was aligning these four screw
and<00:02:38.650> bolt<00:02:39.650> screw<00:02:40.460> and<00:02:40.640> nut<00:02:40.670> arrangements<00:02:41.630> that

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
and bolt screw and nut arrangements that

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.040 
and bolt screw and nut arrangements that
hold<00:02:42.950> that<00:02:43.340> are<00:02:43.790> four<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.570> six<00:02:44.750> bolts

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
hold that are four of the six bolts

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.070 
hold that are four of the six bolts
holding<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.680> power<00:02:45.980> head<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.360> exhaust

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
holding the power head to the exhaust

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.699 
holding the power head to the exhaust
housing<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:48.970> probably<00:02:49.970> an<00:02:50.180> easy<00:02:50.540> trick<00:02:51.080> is<00:02:51.380> to

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
housing and probably an easy trick is to

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.449 
housing and probably an easy trick is to
take<00:02:51.980> some<00:02:52.459> Vaseline<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.450> anchor<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.620> nut<00:02:54.890> to

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
take some Vaseline and anchor the nut to

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.140 
take some Vaseline and anchor the nut to
the<00:02:55.580> top<00:02:55.850> of<00:02:56.060> your<00:02:56.120> finger<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:57.520> then<00:02:58.520> you<00:02:59.000> got

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
the top of your finger and then you got

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.790 
the top of your finger and then you got
to<00:02:59.240> go<00:02:59.360> under<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.780> curb<00:03:00.430> that's<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:02.800> holding

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
to go under the curb that's it holding

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.840 
to go under the curb that's it holding

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.820 
that up against the bottom of the
housing<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:12.290> can<00:03:12.620> start<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:14.300> screw<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:15.080> once

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
housing you can start the screw and once

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.250 
housing you can start the screw and once
you've<00:03:16.040> got<00:03:16.310> it<00:03:16.340> started<00:03:17.680> then<00:03:19.780> no<00:03:20.780> need<00:03:21.019> to
