00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.960
 yes they also people in four of his sons and welcome to one Adele 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.849
 View to the Orber Media 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.619
 da Christel Ketchup Arte in HD 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:15.789
 what can this device do here 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.679
 For the first time, of course, it can look very good, in comparison to the Hardy p 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:20.539
 Previous year 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.489
 which we also like to approve as comparison value 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.859
 the 92 9 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.279
 In comparison of the two you can clearly see the HD PVR is a bit 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.489
 chunky a bit bigger 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.600
 Of course, the designer does not do as much for me as the designer does for me 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.520
 low 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.850
 there you have to say quite honestly but here is really what the design 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.550
 concerns a lot of action 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.970
 I think it fits so well PlayStation fits the Xbox 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.670
 they are quite cool out there in the food variant here how it works 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.270
 and otherwise in no further elaboration the Holy Fire is in 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.520
 This simple wedding held in simple black 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.050
 at that time new netbooks pages and these are the most interesting sites for 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.880
 watching movies 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.450
 who do not watch live 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.820
 that we notice a staggering difference here and that you can see here 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.660
 Do you have a HDMI output? 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.830
 around the as well 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.430
 and in good shape 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.130
 In which ten under par remained his trade so have the components 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.680
 Dr 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.590
 Main victim entirely out of the hall as well as Lindsay Lohan 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.890
 around the miners so this components Charles out and has none 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.050
 I'm scared 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.960
 just as you can see here 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.350
 since the Audio Engineer once here 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.970
 Red and white 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.390
 and the audio inputs and outputs by optical aspect Horst Lenk 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.630
 that does not settle this work in comparison 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.100
 you have to say very clearly not necessarily 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.990
 if you had hapere it could also connect third Munsterischen 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.040
 that was no reason for me 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.840
 to whom he prefers the sacred fire 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.120
 From the influence here you can see USB 2 points and the power plug 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.340
 that's exactly the same thing at work 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.869
 So sp2 municipalities and the like power plug advantage for many gamers 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:09.999
 will be 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:13.980
 the HDMI out covenant down at work that means they can be there for example 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:15.119
 he dissolves already 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:17.729
 but let the hdmi cable infect 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:20.729
 and so has the opportunity to play Corradini 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.619
 both consoles 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:25.699
 both consoles or both captures which better said 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:29.149
 against a recording Erfurt Orlishausen 18 years 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:31.590
 that means she has the opportunity 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.839
 to record in almost full 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:38.369
 around the games however mostly with resolutions and house around 80 times 720 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:42.549
 that means that after resolution of 720p 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.919
 that's my three bigger ones about 500 MW in ten minutes 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:48.959
 Video of gameplay about 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.289
 will hold the games of the Super League 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:53.569
 called Anna also a little something to call 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.119
 Percent of their wines just a bit of what makes up the whole 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:01.139
 and in the middle but medially included in the price is just these captchas 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:01.989
 Danish 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.740
 the software to record 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.410
 the cables are there for what you need it of course to one more 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.969
 Component cables for the respective console 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:11.309
 speak for the Xbox 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:12.899
 or for the ps3 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:16.649
 Of course, the same also applies to our main program IP fire 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.409
 He also needs one 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.029
 AR Commander had for the Xbox for the ps3 for the Wii 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:24.240
 with such natural 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.640
 Every Sobotka worries there is one municipality each came in for the TV 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.939
 to close but not for the console 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.049
 the words maybe still who costs the cable because of course two 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.219
 copies 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.700
 if, for example, headset or destroy a tsunami close Wolf 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:44.979
 yes of connectivity, these two are pretty much the same one sees 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.690
 yes again ABMS video input 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.200
 and around our normal video input the parable both but never smoked 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.269
 what the price for the woman before Cadel Evans is clearly high 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.209
 was like working down comparing both prices 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.469
 and let's have a look at the key features 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.369
 but the medial can deliver us files as in the tests 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:11.089
 Format are 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:16.349
 around the main advantages of danger Â«gives us materials m2ts or mp4 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:20.169
 that is, setting the active reality of two materials 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.569
 With both software supplied with Dr it is possible these test procedures are here 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:25.710
 arise 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.960
 and the em-second it files that are converted here to convert percent and 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.389
 then fire program for example for Sony Vegas or just for 

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:37.769
 but OK rather pro as to what he says there of the two recordings program 

00:04:37.769 --> 00:04:38.610
 uses 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.909
 so feel 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:43.500
 I have to say that the Holy Fire was Missy more involved with that 

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:47.319
 the drivers in Windows 7 at first some spots on problems with the 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:51.110
 infected with the Triba update of the software update 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.559
 This has made a lot of work easier in infectious ways 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:58.619
 plug in the Xbox and then Wars that 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.669
 the iPhone destination for me very well 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.379
 you can if you now as a conclusion, these two juxtaposed 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:07.210
 of course you have to say it very clearly 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.790
 The design here is very simple SID but also very good 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.110
 out at the main group Hauppauge the previous year it is also very simple 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.849
 kept but a little bit wise big because of the design ago 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:19.060
 I can be very clear here 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.639
 But they have never been there in any case 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.389
 the nose in front 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.219
 what the possibilities in the air in the case of definitely enough 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:32.039
 permanently pull the conclusion for the one hundred and fifty euros approximately 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:35.699
 definitely with something technical that puts the HD PVR in the shade 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.009
 You have to say that clearly because the work has a lot to do 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:39.900
 benefits 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.800
 and around 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.250
 and also a lot 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.309
 around features the sacred fire does not respond to the example hdmi output 

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:49.580
 on the one hand you have to say the main castle HD PVR 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.020
 is a traitor we already know you know a light in the cell a lot 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.610
 more 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.930
 but you have to honestly say the work is definitely on you 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:57.930
 great 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.630
 great competition right now and that is getting bigger and bigger and bigger 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.570
 what i have here and what i have seen from the quality 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.669
 have seen 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.379
 I got this gray donor as the main brand HD PVR catching 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:11.500
 very good 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.840
 Did not bother you because you saw that in some videos of 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.040
 Some commentators have to say quite honestly that is not here 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.259
 through this village 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:22.400
 and you have a very good price for a much cheaper price 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.580
 quality 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.180
 In comparison, one can not yet be sure if the Holy People 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.469
 now 180 euros 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:31.779
 with the whole but so probably comes to the 200 euros 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:34.669
 approximately 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:38.400
 As a conclusion one can say that when they were presented they are on everyone 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.160
 case 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.720
 the non plus under what there is currently if you want HD Capture I prefer 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:49.010
 Definitely one of the two depending on what you have for a system 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.930
 you have to say very clearly if you prefer to play with hdmi-output 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:53.530
 Media 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.270
 if he says courage I would definitely like 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.770
 it is that you have something brighter about it so knows how to 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.600
 Example 500 others 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.020
 there must take to HDTV 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.419
 On the whole, you can definitely say both are dry 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:11.800
 But they are not a bit in the lead for me, because they are the only one 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.699
 Newcomer has made it down a bit more 

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:16.520
 and it's a little bit better 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.479
 we have now you can still judge this year I hope 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:22.030
 I've helped you a bit further as far as the decision is concerned 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.770
 what your capture met 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.490
 Could affect investments in the near future 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.930
 and then i would have said i percent makes the links and new ones in the 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:33.100
 Description and then have us next time and then I say Schaub 

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:34.349
 Bayern that also solves people
