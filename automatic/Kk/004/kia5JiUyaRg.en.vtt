00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
now you're probably asking why is it so

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.450 
now you're probably asking why is it so
cheap<00:00:23.670> well<00:00:24.300> there's<00:00:24.570> actually<00:00:24.960> two<00:00:25.560> reasons

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
cheap well there's actually two reasons

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.339 
cheap well there's actually two reasons
with<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:27.090> why<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:27.420> really<00:00:27.810> cheap<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
with that why it's really cheap the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.839 
with that why it's really cheap the
first<00:00:28.619> reason<00:00:28.800> it's<00:00:29.160> only<00:00:29.429> going<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.640> come

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
first reason it's only going to come

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.389 
first reason it's only going to come
with<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> 4<00:00:30.480> gigabyte<00:00:30.929> hard<00:00:31.439> drive<00:00:31.619> or<00:00:31.800> it's<00:00:32.279> not

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
with a 4 gigabyte hard drive or it's not

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.950 
with a 4 gigabyte hard drive or it's not
even<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.700> hard<00:00:32.880> drive<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:33.390> coming<00:00:33.600> with<00:00:33.719> 4

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
even a hard drive so it's coming with 4

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.990 
even a hard drive so it's coming with 4
gigabytes<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.530> 4<00:00:34.710> gigabyte<00:00:35.040> console<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.670> it

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
gigabytes a 4 gigabyte console and it

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.520 
gigabytes a 4 gigabyte console and it
comes<00:00:36.239> with<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.480> Kinect<00:00:36.870> sensor<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.350> that's

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
comes with the Kinect sensor so that's

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.959 
comes with the Kinect sensor so that's
the<00:00:37.680> plus<00:00:37.860> right<00:00:38.160> there<00:00:38.399> if<00:00:38.579> you're

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
the plus right there if you're

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.490 
the plus right there if you're
interested<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:39.510> connect<00:00:39.899> it'll<00:00:40.170> come<00:00:40.290> and

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
interested in connect it'll come and

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.440 
interested in connect it'll come and
connect<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.950> think<00:00:41.460> Microsoft's<00:00:41.940> really

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
connect I think Microsoft's really

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.729 
connect I think Microsoft's really
pushing<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.870> whole<00:00:42.989> connecting<00:00:43.469> because

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
pushing the whole connecting because

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.889 
pushing the whole connecting because
most<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.460> their<00:00:44.640> bundles<00:00:45.059> nowadays<00:00:45.510> have

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
most of their bundles nowadays have

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.130 
most of their bundles nowadays have
connect<00:00:46.500> built<00:00:47.280> into<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.730> anyways<00:00:48.570> at<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
connect built into it anyways at the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.049 
connect built into it anyways at the
second<00:00:49.800> thing<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.190> makes<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.520> really

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
second thing that makes this really

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.819 
second thing that makes this really
cheap<00:00:51.449> for<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.989> ninety<00:00:52.230> nine<00:00:52.379> dollar<00:00:52.590> price

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
cheap for the ninety nine dollar price

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.569 
cheap for the ninety nine dollar price
point<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.789> monthly<00:00:54.180> subscription<00:00:54.930> fee<00:00:54.960> of

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
point is the monthly subscription fee of

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.189 
point is the monthly subscription fee of
$15<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.760> that's<00:00:56.969> where<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.420> catches<00:00:57.809> me<00:00:57.960> and

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
$15 so that's where it catches me and

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.439 
$15 so that's where it catches me and
that's<00:00:58.379> where<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.980> would<00:00:59.670> just<00:00:59.879> stay<00:01:00.180> away<00:01:00.390> from

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
that's where I would just stay away from

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.260 
that's where I would just stay away from
this<00:01:00.780> as<00:01:00.989> far<00:01:01.289> as<00:01:01.440> possible<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.370> again<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
this as far as possible this again is a

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.240 
this as far as possible this again is a
leak<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:03.840> more<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.320> rumor<00:01:04.680> leaked<00:01:04.920> by

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
leak it's more of a rumor leaked by

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.820 
leak it's more of a rumor leaked by
anyways<00:01:05.869> there's<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.960> lot<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.229> sources<00:01:07.530> that

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
anyways there's a lot of sources that

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.370 
anyways there's a lot of sources that
are<00:01:07.890> saying<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.479> does<00:01:09.780> seem<00:01:10.049> real

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
are saying this so this does seem real

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.530 
are saying this so this does seem real
and<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:11.040> reported<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.880> verge<00:01:12.090> with<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
and it's reported on the verge with the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.760 
and it's reported on the verge with the
verge<00:01:12.720> said<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.110> they<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.320> trusted

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
verge said that they have trusted

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.219 
verge said that they have trusted
sources<00:01:14.159> reliable<00:01:14.700> sources<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:15.990> might

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
sources reliable sources so this might

sources reliable sources so this might
seem<00:01:16.500> real<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.369> isn't<00:01:17.549> really<00:01:17.820> that

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
seem real and it this isn't really that

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.240 
seem real and it this isn't really that
far-fetched<00:01:18.450> if<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.259> think<00:01:19.500> about<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
far-fetched if you think about it the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.310 
far-fetched if you think about it the
thing<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:21.330> bundle<00:01:21.630> will<00:01:21.900> only<00:01:21.990> be

on Microsoft stores at launch so you

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.249

a<00:01:32.340> microsoft<00:01:32.759> store<00:01:32.880> looks<00:01:33.180> like<00:01:33.329> because

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
a microsoft store looks like because

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.300 
a microsoft store looks like because
they<00:01:33.990> don't<00:01:34.170> have<00:01:34.229> one<00:01:34.470> around<00:01:34.740> their<00:01:34.920> area

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
they don't have one around their area

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.700 
they don't have one around their area
but<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.970> just<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.240> separate<00:01:36.750> store<00:01:37.229> with<00:01:37.470> its

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
but it's just a separate store with its

probably multiplied by the number of
months<00:04:55.900> like<00:04:56.020> a<00:04:56.050> set<00:04:56.409> fee<00:04:56.590> x<00:04:57.479> by<00:04:58.479> the<00:04:58.539> number<00:04:58.840> of

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
months like a set fee x by the number of

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.540 
months like a set fee x by the number of
months<00:04:59.289> you<00:04:59.680> have<00:04:59.860> remaining<00:05:00.189> in<00:05:00.400> your

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
months you have remaining in your

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.719 
months you have remaining in your
contract<00:05:00.879> so<00:05:01.590> like<00:05:02.590> I<00:05:02.680> said<00:05:02.740> it's<00:05:03.159> two<00:05:03.460> years

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
contract so like I said it's two years

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.399 
contract so like I said it's two years
if<00:05:03.969> you<00:05:04.060> wish<00:05:04.240> to<00:05:04.389> cancel<00:05:04.569> before<00:05:04.840> that<00:05:05.199> you

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
if you wish to cancel before that you

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:07.110 
if you wish to cancel before that you
will<00:05:05.830> have<00:05:06.039> to<00:05:06.189> pay<00:05:06.219> the<00:05:06.490> early<00:05:06.819> termination

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
will have to pay the early termination

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.469 
will have to pay the early termination
fee<00:05:07.689> and<00:05:07.930> that<00:05:08.889> basically<00:05:09.460> sucks<00:05:10.029> right<00:05:10.270> there

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
fee and that basically sucks right there

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.379 
fee and that basically sucks right there
so<00:05:10.719> obviously<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.800> xbox<00:05:12.189> 360<00:05:12.699> might<00:05:13.000> not<00:05:13.180> even

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
so obviously the xbox 360 might not even

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.959 
so obviously the xbox 360 might not even
go<00:05:13.779> be<00:05:14.080> around<00:05:14.349> in<00:05:14.680> two<00:05:15.039> years<00:05:15.189> I<00:05:15.430> mean<00:05:15.759> it'll

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:15.969 
go be around in two years I mean it'll

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:17.939 
go be around in two years I mean it'll
still<00:05:16.270> be<00:05:16.539> around<00:05:16.659> but<00:05:16.900> it<00:05:17.110> won't<00:05:17.289> like<00:05:17.500> most

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
still be around but it won't like most

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.089 
still be around but it won't like most
likely<00:05:18.250> the<00:05:18.370> 720<00:05:19.089> xbox<00:05:19.479> 720<00:05:19.810> or<00:05:19.990> next<00:05:20.740> xbox

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
likely the 720 xbox 720 or next xbox

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:23.070 
likely the 720 xbox 720 or next xbox
will<00:05:21.279> be<00:05:21.400> here<00:05:21.639> by<00:05:21.759> that<00:05:21.969> time<00:05:22.000> and<00:05:22.360> this<00:05:22.870> is<00:05:23.050> a

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
will be here by that time and this is a

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.140 
will be here by that time and this is a
smart<00:05:23.439> smart<00:05:23.979> move<00:05:24.129> by<00:05:24.310> Microsoft<00:05:24.789> because

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
smart smart move by Microsoft because

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.969 
smart smart move by Microsoft because
they're<00:05:25.659> basically<00:05:26.110> getting<00:05:26.439> ready<00:05:26.740> for<00:05:26.889> the

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
they're basically getting ready for the

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.519 
they're basically getting ready for the
future<00:05:27.189> because<00:05:27.370> once<00:05:27.729> that<00:05:27.819> xbox<00:05:28.300> 720<00:05:28.629> comes

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:29.529 
future because once that xbox 720 comes

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:31.079 
future because once that xbox 720 comes
out<00:05:29.680> guess<00:05:29.919> what<00:05:30.009> not<00:05:30.339> a<00:05:30.400> lot<00:05:30.610> of<00:05:30.729> people<00:05:30.849> will

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:31.089 
out guess what not a lot of people will

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:34.019 
out guess what not a lot of people will
buy<00:05:31.270> a<00:05:31.330> xbox<00:05:31.689> 360<00:05:32.620> so<00:05:33.039> Microsoft<00:05:33.460> is<00:05:33.580> locking

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:34.029 
buy a xbox 360 so Microsoft is locking

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:35.909 
buy a xbox 360 so Microsoft is locking
them<00:05:34.180> into<00:05:34.330> a<00:05:34.449> contract<00:05:34.839> basically<00:05:35.289> similar

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
them into a contract basically similar

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.279 
them into a contract basically similar
to<00:05:36.189> how<00:05:36.279> carriers<00:05:37.089> do<00:05:37.360> with<00:05:37.569> your<00:05:37.779> cell<00:05:38.020> phones

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
on this matter it's it's a pretty big

on this matter it's it's a pretty big
matter<00:06:05.919> this<00:06:06.219> could<00:06:06.520> be<00:06:06.669> a<00:06:06.699> huge<00:06:07.060> thing

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
matter this could be a huge thing

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.089 
matter this could be a huge thing
because<00:06:07.659> it'll<00:06:08.050> open<00:06:08.199> the<00:06:08.409> market<00:06:08.740> for<00:06:08.860> a<00:06:08.919> lot

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099 
because it'll open the market for a lot

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:10.950 
because it'll open the market for a lot
of<00:06:09.219> casual<00:06:09.610> people<00:06:09.909> that<00:06:10.330> see<00:06:10.539> the<00:06:10.659> ninety

monthly subscription and jump on board

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.950 
monthly subscription and jump on board
because<00:06:15.849> they<00:06:16.120> don't<00:06:16.270> do<00:06:16.389> the<00:06:16.539> math<00:06:16.719> they

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
because they don't do the math they

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.990 
because they don't do the math they
don't<00:06:17.139> calculate<00:06:17.439> it<00:06:17.889> and<00:06:18.039> they<00:06:18.610> find<00:06:18.879> that

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
don't calculate it and they find that

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.050 
don't calculate it and they find that
they<00:06:19.419> think<00:06:19.689> they<00:06:20.110> might<00:06:20.409> think<00:06:20.710> that<00:06:20.770> this<00:06:20.979> is

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
they think they might think that this is

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.790 
they think they might think that this is
this<00:06:22.060> is<00:06:22.210> a<00:06:22.240> word<00:06:22.479> this<00:06:22.870> bundle<00:06:23.169> is<00:06:23.409> worth<00:06:23.589> it

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
this is a word this bundle is worth it

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.769 
this is a word this bundle is worth it
of<00:06:23.919> course<00:06:24.370> it<00:06:24.580> is<00:06:24.699> worth<00:06:24.909> if<00:06:25.149> you<00:06:25.360> don't<00:06:25.629> have

00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:25.779 
of course it is worth if you don't have

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:28.200 
of course it is worth if you don't have
the<00:06:25.930> money<00:06:26.080> up<00:06:26.500> front<00:06:26.949> and<00:06:27.129> you<00:06:27.339> are<00:06:27.729> willing

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
the money up front and you are willing

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.869 
the money up front and you are willing
to<00:06:28.330> pay<00:06:28.449> forty<00:06:28.899> dollars<00:06:29.229> in<00:06:29.500> in<00:06:30.129> total<00:06:30.550> after

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:30.879 
to pay forty dollars in in total after

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:32.999 
to pay forty dollars in in total after
so<00:06:31.569> it's<00:06:31.689> basically<00:06:31.899> like<00:06:32.259> a<00:06:32.319> credit<00:06:32.800> card
