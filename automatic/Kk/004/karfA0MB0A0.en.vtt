that down the back on the fuel unit I

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.080 
that down the back on the fuel unit I
just<00:01:24.240> put<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> surface<00:01:25.290> mount<00:01:25.320> lead<00:01:26.000> into<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
just put a surface mount lead into the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.090 
just put a surface mount lead into the
back<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.750> it's<00:01:28.320> independent<00:01:28.619> of

back of that and it's independent of

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.929 
back of that and it's independent of
just<00:01:29.790> using<00:01:30.890> added<00:01:31.890> wipers<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.759> bottom

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
just using added wipers on to the bottom

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.610 
just using added wipers on to the bottom
of<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.920> underneath<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:36.390> got<00:01:36.659> reliable

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
of that underneath so it's got reliable

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.190 
of that underneath so it's got reliable
power<00:01:39.250> all<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.640> time<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:40.060> it<00:01:40.180> there<00:01:40.360> without

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
power all the time to it there without

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.650 
power all the time to it there without
having<00:01:42.160> to<00:01:42.340> look<00:01:42.940> helped<00:01:43.570> having<00:01:43.900> to<00:01:44.050> run

and<00:03:24.739> then<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.010> turbine<00:03:27.129> come<00:03:28.129> down<00:03:28.340> this<00:03:28.489> way

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.540 

so<00:03:32.990> what<00:03:33.350> I'm<00:03:33.470> getting<00:03:33.740> out<00:03:33.860> here<00:03:34.100> is<00:03:34.250> putting

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
so what I'm getting out here is putting

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.220 
so what I'm getting out here is putting
a<00:03:34.610> high<00:03:34.790> bass<00:03:35.030> speaker<00:03:35.510> which<00:03:35.720> has<00:03:35.870> got<00:03:36.020> low

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
a high bass speaker which has got low

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.030 
a high bass speaker which has got low
frequencies<00:03:36.940> output<00:03:37.990> at<00:03:38.990> the<00:03:39.500> top<00:03:39.860> of<00:03:39.890> the

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
frequencies output at the top of the

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.170 
frequencies output at the top of the
reins<00:03:40.280> is<00:03:40.460> about<00:03:40.700> 1.5<00:03:42.370> whereas<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.880> small

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
reins is about 1.5 whereas the small

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.270 
reins is about 1.5 whereas the small
oval<00:03:44.780> speakers<00:03:45.200> got<00:03:45.350> a<00:03:45.380> high<00:03:45.560> frequency<00:03:45.830> of

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
oval speakers got a high frequency of

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.430 
oval speakers got a high frequency of
about<00:03:48.070> 3.5<00:03:49.270> the<00:03:50.270> higher<00:03:50.540> pitched<00:03:50.870> sounds<00:03:51.290> for

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
about 3.5 the higher pitched sounds for

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.460 
about 3.5 the higher pitched sounds for
the<00:03:51.500> wine<00:03:51.770> are<00:03:52.190> coming<00:03:52.580> out<00:03:52.730> of<00:03:52.760> that<00:03:52.850> clear

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
the wine are coming out of that clear

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.320 
the wine are coming out of that clear
yet<00:03:54.470> if<00:03:54.710> it<00:03:54.980> was<00:03:55.100> just<00:03:55.130> out<00:03:55.490> of<00:03:55.610> this<00:03:55.700> one<00:03:55.910> here

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
yet if it was just out of this one here

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:03.660 
yet if it was just out of this one here
and<00:03:56.480> i'll<00:03:56.690> take<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.430> disconnect<00:03:58.430> this

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.649 

now<00:04:04.670> we're<00:04:04.849> going<00:04:04.969> to<00:04:05.090> just<00:04:05.239> up<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.480> highway

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
now we're going to just up the highway

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:12.040 
now we're going to just up the highway
speak<00:04:06.170> with<00:04:06.409> the<00:04:06.530> wine<00:04:06.739> on<00:04:06.950> it

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.080 

and<00:04:12.590> that's<00:04:12.770> nowhere<00:04:13.100> near<00:04:13.370> getting<00:04:13.790> that

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
and that's nowhere near getting that

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.170 
and that's nowhere near getting that
fire<00:04:14.300> pitch<00:04:14.630> sounds<00:04:15.170> is<00:04:15.980> what<00:04:16.190> you<00:04:16.340> do<00:04:16.519> I'll

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
fire pitch sounds is what you do I'll

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.710 
fire pitch sounds is what you do I'll
put<00:04:17.390> this<00:04:17.510> back<00:04:17.720> on<00:04:17.750> again

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.890 

evolution

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:34.100 

what<00:04:28.100> sorry<00:04:30.890> I'm<00:04:31.890> definitely<00:04:32.130> in<00:04:32.810> is<00:04:33.810> with<00:04:34.020> the

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
what sorry I'm definitely in is with the

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:43.760 
what sorry I'm definitely in is with the
Vice<00:04:34.290> Blake<00:04:34.560> is<00:04:34.710> connected

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:05:18.180 

Oh

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.190 

that's<00:05:18.850> pretty<00:05:19.120> good<00:05:19.330> sound<00:05:19.660> coming<00:05:19.960> out<00:05:20.140> of

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
that's pretty good sound coming out of

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.440 
that's pretty good sound coming out of
that<00:05:20.350> so<00:05:21.010> the<00:05:21.130> combination<00:05:21.370> of<00:05:21.910> a<00:05:22.030> high<00:05:22.180> base

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
that so the combination of a high base

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
that so the combination of a high base
to<00:05:22.690> diesel<00:05:22.990> and<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:25.060> high<00:05:25.330> frequency<00:05:26.020> speaker

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
to diesel and the high frequency speaker

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.230 
to diesel and the high frequency speaker
for<00:05:28.770> for<00:05:29.770> the<00:05:29.860> turbine<00:05:30.400> which<00:05:30.940> has<00:05:31.090> got<00:05:31.180> a

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
for for the turbine which has got a

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.990 
for for the turbine which has got a
higher<00:05:31.600> pitched<00:05:31.990> whine<00:05:32.730> seems<00:05:33.730> to<00:05:33.880> be<00:05:33.970> very

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
higher pitched whine seems to be very

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000 
higher pitched whine seems to be very
right<00:05:34.450> and<00:05:34.690> Jerry<00:05:34.870> Hopkins<00:05:35.320> has<00:05:35.440> done<00:05:35.620> some<00:05:35.860> of

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
right and Jerry Hopkins has done some of

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.460 
right and Jerry Hopkins has done some of
this<00:05:36.100> see<00:05:36.400> that<00:05:36.880> probably<00:05:37.150> pioneered<00:05:37.660> that

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
this see that probably pioneered that

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.120 
this see that probably pioneered that
but<00:05:39.190> also<00:05:39.600> I've<00:05:40.600> mounted<00:05:41.140> the<00:05:41.410> speakers<00:05:41.890> on

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
but also I've mounted the speakers on

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.060 
but also I've mounted the speakers on
double<00:05:42.610> sided<00:05:42.850> foam<00:05:43.210> tape<00:05:43.740> two<00:05:44.740> thicknesses

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
double sided foam tape two thicknesses

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.110 
double sided foam tape two thicknesses
to<00:05:45.580> stop<00:05:45.790> any<00:05:46.060> chance<00:05:46.390> of<00:05:46.540> any<00:05:46.690> vibration<00:05:47.440> or

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
to stop any chance of any vibration or

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.820 
to stop any chance of any vibration or
transferring<00:05:49.120> into<00:05:49.360> the<00:05:49.450> brass<00:05:49.660> body<00:05:49.960> on<00:05:50.230> both

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
transferring into the brass body on both

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.800 
transferring into the brass body on both
of<00:05:50.860> those<00:05:51.130> speakers<00:05:51.460> I've<00:05:52.210> made<00:05:52.480> a<00:05:52.510> large

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
of those speakers I've made a large

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.750 
of those speakers I've made a large
enclosure<00:05:53.380> for<00:05:53.530> the<00:05:53.740> high<00:05:53.890> bass<00:05:54.130> speaker<00:05:54.490> and

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
enclosure for the high bass speaker and

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.380 
enclosure for the high bass speaker and
a<00:05:54.880> small<00:05:55.240> enclosure<00:05:55.690> for<00:05:55.930> the<00:05:56.320> high<00:05:57.390> high

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
a small enclosure for the high high

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.960 
a small enclosure for the high high
frequency<00:05:59.020> oval<00:05:59.440> speaker<00:05:59.830> and<00:06:00.040> I<00:06:00.130> think<00:06:00.190> the

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
frequency oval speaker and I think the

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.470 
frequency oval speaker and I think the
size<00:06:01.300> of<00:06:01.540> a<00:06:01.630> enclosure<00:06:02.790> really<00:06:03.790> does<00:06:04.000> make<00:06:04.270> a

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:04.480 
size of a enclosure really does make a

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.540 
size of a enclosure really does make a
difference<00:06:04.810> to<00:06:05.080> what<00:06:05.200> sound<00:06:05.710> comes<00:06:06.190> out<00:06:06.400> of

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
difference to what sound comes out of

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.080 
difference to what sound comes out of
the<00:06:06.640> speaker<00:06:07.060> as<00:06:07.210> well<00:06:07.990> as<00:06:08.310> aiming<00:06:09.310> the

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
the speaker as well as aiming the

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.270 
the speaker as well as aiming the
speakers<00:06:10.600> so<00:06:11.290> that<00:06:11.500> there's<00:06:11.710> nothing<00:06:12.160> in

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
speakers so that there's nothing in

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.010 
speakers so that there's nothing in
front<00:06:12.430> of<00:06:12.610> them<00:06:12.670> to<00:06:12.910> inhibit<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:13.510> sound<00:06:13.780> wave

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
front of them to inhibit the sound wave

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.820 
front of them to inhibit the sound wave
coming<00:06:14.650> out<00:06:15.120> so<00:06:16.120> why<00:06:16.390> I<00:06:16.810> think<00:06:17.350> that's<00:06:17.500> some

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
coming out so why I think that's some

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.830 
coming out so why I think that's some
some<00:06:18.640> pretty<00:06:18.880> interesting<00:06:19.090> stuff<00:06:19.330> I<00:06:19.660> don't

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
some pretty interesting stuff I don't

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.790 
some pretty interesting stuff I don't
think<00:06:20.800> I'm<00:06:20.920> the<00:06:20.950> only<00:06:21.040> person<00:06:21.220> doing<00:06:21.700> this<00:06:21.970> but

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
think I'm the only person doing this but

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.020 
think I'm the only person doing this but
when<00:06:23.800> you<00:06:23.890> find<00:06:24.160> these<00:06:24.370> sort<00:06:24.640> of<00:06:24.669> things<00:06:24.760> that

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
when you find these sort of things that

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.310 
when you find these sort of things that
I<00:06:25.060> think<00:06:25.180> it's<00:06:25.390> worthwhile<00:06:25.570> sharing<00:06:26.200> them

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
I think it's worthwhile sharing them

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.170 
I think it's worthwhile sharing them
with<00:06:26.350> the<00:06:26.710> others<00:06:26.919> so<00:06:27.669> that<00:06:27.700> you<00:06:28.030> can

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
with the others so that you can

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.330 
with the others so that you can
experiment<00:06:28.570> with<00:06:28.840> your<00:06:29.020> stubble<00:06:29.350> speakers<00:06:29.890> in

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
experiment with your stubble speakers in

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.730 
experiment with your stubble speakers in
it<00:06:30.820> there<00:06:31.060> this<00:06:31.720> one's<00:06:31.990> got<00:06:32.200> to<00:06:34.740> mishima

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
it there this one's got to mishima

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.100 
it there this one's got to mishima
motors<00:06:36.100> in<00:06:36.310> here<00:06:36.550> back-to-back<00:06:37.300> driving<00:06:37.990> each
