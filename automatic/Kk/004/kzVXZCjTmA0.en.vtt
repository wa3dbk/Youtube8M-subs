00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
first you'll need tree branches you can

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.290 
first you'll need tree branches you can
get<00:00:40.800> them<00:00:40.980> off<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.129> rail<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.550> tree<00:00:41.789> or<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.149> can

get them off a rail a tree or you can

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.299 
get them off a rail a tree or you can
buy<00:00:42.420> from<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.719> craft<00:00:42.929> store<00:00:43.019> like<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.379> did

your tree glitter ribbon and a styrofoam

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.010 
your tree glitter ribbon and a styrofoam
block<00:01:10.759> the<00:01:11.759> first<00:01:11.939> step<00:01:12.210> would<00:01:12.329> be<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.570> measure

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
block the first step would be to measure

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.780 
block the first step would be to measure
the<00:01:13.200> branch<00:01:13.439> length<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.950> cut<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.369> out<00:01:14.520> how<00:01:14.729> you

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the branch length and cut it out how you

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.520 
the branch length and cut it out how you
want<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.210> be<00:01:15.329> it's<00:01:15.840> safe<00:01:16.079> to<00:01:16.200> keep<00:01:16.350> it

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
want it to be it's safe to keep it

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.410 
want it to be it's safe to keep it
inside<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.009> vase<00:01:17.159> while<00:01:17.399> doing<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.390> you

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
inside the vase while doing this so you

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.630 
inside the vase while doing this so you
can<00:01:18.630> know<00:01:18.810> how<00:01:19.079> tall<00:01:19.380> above<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.920> vase<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
can know how tall above the vase the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.429 
can know how tall above the vase the
branch<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.149> the<00:01:21.270> branch<00:01:21.299> arms<00:01:21.960> are<00:01:22.110> gonna<00:01:22.229> be

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
branch and the branch arms are gonna be

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.050 
branch and the branch arms are gonna be
next<00:01:23.070> you're<00:01:23.189> gonna<00:01:23.250> measure<00:01:23.520> where<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.880> want

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
next you're gonna measure where you want

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.670 
next you're gonna measure where you want
the<00:01:24.149> branch<00:01:24.360> arms<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.810> be<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.500> want<00:01:25.619> to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
the branch arms to be and you want to

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.880 
the branch arms to be and you want to
keep<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.100> vase<00:01:26.250> for<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.549> part<00:01:26.790> to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.109 

and<00:01:33.890> you're<00:01:34.070> gonna<00:01:34.189> take<00:01:34.460> your<00:01:34.640> branches<00:01:35.000> that

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
and you're gonna take your branches that

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.480 
and you're gonna take your branches that
you<00:01:35.180> just<00:01:35.450> cut<00:01:35.689> and<00:01:35.869> attach<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.770> branch<00:01:37.009> arms

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
you just cut and attach the branch arms

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.179 
you just cut and attach the branch arms
that<00:01:37.640> you<00:01:37.790> have<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.899> base<00:01:39.080> branch<00:01:39.470> by

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
that you have to the base branch by

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.310 
that you have to the base branch by
wrapping<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.729> twine<00:01:41.030> around<00:01:41.450> it<00:01:41.689> you<00:01:42.170> might

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
wrapping the twine around it you might

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.230 
wrapping the twine around it you might
want<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.590> leave<00:01:42.920> it<00:01:42.979> in<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.520> out<00:01:43.640> of<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.090> base

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
want to leave it in and out of the base

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.690 
want to leave it in and out of the base
branch<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:44.899> the<00:01:45.110> branch<00:01:45.140> arm<00:01:45.680> just<00:01:46.399> so<00:01:46.549> it'll

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
branch and the branch arm just so it'll

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:58.840 
branch and the branch arm just so it'll
make<00:01:46.909> it<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.060> little<00:01:47.149> more<00:01:47.270> steady

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.190 

so<00:01:59.850> keep<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.210> mind<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.630> when<00:02:00.810> you're<00:02:00.960> putting

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
so keep in mind that when you're putting

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.960 
so keep in mind that when you're putting
your<00:02:01.500> branch<00:02:01.860> arms<00:02:02.220> on<00:02:02.370> your<00:02:02.490> face<00:02:02.640> branch

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
your branch arms on your face branch

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.910 
your branch arms on your face branch
that<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.660> want<00:02:03.900> to<00:02:03.990> put<00:02:04.110> them<00:02:04.260> out<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.470> angle

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
that you want to put them out of angle

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.160 
that you want to put them out of angle
because<00:02:05.790> it'll<00:02:06.240> give<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.510> more<00:02:06.690> room<00:02:06.900> to

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
because it'll give you more room to

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.469 
because it'll give you more room to
place<00:02:07.380> your<00:02:07.560> jewelry<00:02:07.920> if<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.850> base<00:02:08.970> branch<00:02:09.270> is

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
place your jewelry if the base branch is

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.410 
place your jewelry if the base branch is
too<00:02:09.720> close<00:02:10.350> to<00:02:10.680> your<00:02:10.830> arm<00:02:11.070> then<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.210> jewelry

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
too close to your arm then the jewelry

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.960 
too close to your arm then the jewelry
will<00:02:12.660> slide<00:02:12.930> down<00:02:12.960> onto<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:14.160> vase<00:02:14.340> branch<00:02:14.670> and

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
will slide down onto the vase branch and

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.210 
will slide down onto the vase branch and
they<00:02:15.420> won't<00:02:15.600> really<00:02:15.720> be<00:02:15.960> displayed<00:02:16.380> so<00:02:16.650> make

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
they won't really be displayed so make

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.340 
they won't really be displayed so make
sure<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.430> either<00:02:17.730> stick<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.270> branch<00:02:18.510> the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
sure you either stick the branch the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.400 
sure you either stick the branch the
branch<00:02:19.380> arm<00:02:19.830> off<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:21.060> side<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.690> straight

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
branch arm off to the side and straight

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.890
