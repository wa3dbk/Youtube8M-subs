left the same amount of times so that

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.539 
left the same amount of times so that
you<00:02:02.829> don't<00:02:03.249> develop<00:02:03.819> a<00:02:04.090> weak<00:02:04.299> arm<00:02:04.539> or<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:06.130> weak

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
leg and I mean obviously most of us are

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.160 
leg and I mean obviously most of us are
one-handed<00:02:10.990> or<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.349> other<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:11.860> so<00:02:13.170> to

one of my right so I would kind of force
myself<00:02:54.820> to<00:02:55.330> do<00:02:55.510> more<00:02:55.720> work<00:02:55.959> with<00:02:56.200> my<00:02:56.320> left<00:02:56.530> hand

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
myself to do more work with my left hand

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.130 
myself to do more work with my left hand
and<00:02:57.330> concentrate<00:02:58.330> on<00:02:58.450> my<00:02:58.540> left<00:02:58.750> hand<00:02:58.900> because

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
and concentrate on my left hand because

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.670 
and concentrate on my left hand because
my<00:02:59.260> right<00:02:59.470> hand<00:02:59.650> was<00:02:59.739> naturally<00:03:00.430> just<00:03:00.700> better

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
my right hand was naturally just better

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.530 
my right hand was naturally just better
more<00:03:02.850> more<00:03:03.850> instantly<00:03:05.550> obtainable<00:03:06.550> to<00:03:07.360> do

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
more more instantly obtainable to do

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.729 
more more instantly obtainable to do
what<00:03:07.750> I<00:03:07.780> was<00:03:07.989> trying<00:03:08.380> to<00:03:08.470> do<00:03:08.910> so<00:03:09.910> anyway<00:03:10.739> the

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
what I was trying to do so anyway the

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.790 
what I was trying to do so anyway the
very<00:03:11.950> first<00:03:12.250> lesson<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:12.820> want<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.120> do<00:03:13.239> is<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:14.019> very

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
very first lesson I want to do is a very

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.250 
very first lesson I want to do is a very
simple<00:03:15.310> thing<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:16.690> a<00:03:16.720> friend<00:03:17.019> of<00:03:17.080> mine

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
simple thing that a friend of mine

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.120 
simple thing that a friend of mine
taught<00:03:17.500> me<00:03:17.700> who<00:03:18.720> had<00:03:19.720> taken<00:03:20.050> a<00:03:20.500> few<00:03:20.860> drum

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
taught me who had taken a few drum

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.310 
taught me who had taken a few drum
lessons<00:03:21.579> and<00:03:21.790> then<00:03:21.880> just<00:03:22.120> sort<00:03:22.810> of<00:03:22.900> given<00:03:23.140> it

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
lessons and then just sort of given it

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.740 
lessons and then just sort of given it
up<00:03:23.459> but<00:03:24.459> he<00:03:24.700> said<00:03:24.970> that<00:03:25.150> this<00:03:25.239> is<00:03:25.420> what<00:03:25.600> his

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
up but he said that this is what his

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.470 
up but he said that this is what his
drum<00:03:26.079> teacher<00:03:26.350> taught<00:03:26.799> him<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.970> very<00:03:28.120> first

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
drum teacher taught him the very first

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.460 
drum teacher taught him the very first
day<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:30.329> basically<00:03:31.329> it's<00:03:31.690> just<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:32.049> simple

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
day so basically it's just a simple

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.940 
day so basically it's just a simple
triplet<00:03:33.870> played<00:03:34.870> with<00:03:35.170> two<00:03:35.350> hands<00:03:35.769> and<00:03:35.860> the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
triplet played with two hands and the

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:58.730 
triplet played with two hands and the
way<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.400> get<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.730> triplets<00:03:37.150> is<00:03:37.329> by<00:03:37.570> accent

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.910 

okay<00:03:59.740> so<00:03:59.800> it's<00:04:00.400> just<00:04:00.580> basically<00:04:00.850> if<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:02.680> do<00:04:02.830> it

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
okay so it's just basically if you do it

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:12.840 
okay so it's just basically if you do it
with<00:04:03.040> one<00:04:03.070> hand<00:04:03.280> it's<00:04:03.760> this<00:04:11.580> put<00:04:12.580> the<00:04:12.700> two

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
with one hand it's this put the two

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:20.610 
with one hand it's this put the two
together<00:04:18.030> what<00:04:19.030> I<00:04:19.060> like<00:04:19.359> to<00:04:19.510> do<00:04:19.720> when<00:04:20.470> I'm

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
together what I like to do when I'm

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.070 
together what I like to do when I'm
teaching<00:04:20.829> a<00:04:21.160> student<00:04:21.220> on<00:04:22.740> how<00:04:23.740> to<00:04:23.800> do<00:04:24.070> this<00:04:24.250> is

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
teaching a student on how to do this is

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.290 
teaching a student on how to do this is
show<00:04:26.080> him<00:04:26.380> that<00:04:26.710> what<00:04:27.520> you're<00:04:27.640> doing<00:04:27.940> with<00:04:28.060> one

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
show him that what you're doing with one

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.500 
show him that what you're doing with one
hand<00:04:28.570> is<00:04:28.810> not<00:04:29.050> very<00:04:29.410> difficult<00:04:29.650> so<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:31.240> way<00:04:31.480> I

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
hand is not very difficult so the way I

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.830 
hand is not very difficult so the way I
do<00:04:31.720> that<00:04:32.020> is<00:04:32.080> I'll<00:04:32.860> play<00:04:33.580> the<00:04:33.910> beat<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:34.390> then

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
do that is I'll play the beat and then

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.170 
do that is I'll play the beat and then
I'll<00:04:35.020> take<00:04:35.350> one<00:04:35.800> hand<00:04:36.100> off<00:04:36.370> and<00:04:36.669> play<00:04:36.910> on<00:04:37.030> my

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
I'll take one hand off and play on my

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.380 
I'll take one hand off and play on my
leg<00:04:37.480> so<00:04:38.350> that<00:04:38.380> he<00:04:38.680> can<00:04:38.919> essentially<00:04:39.700> not<00:04:40.060> hear

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
leg so that he can essentially not hear

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:54.469 
leg so that he can essentially not hear
it<00:04:40.510> so<00:04:41.320> for<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:41.650> triplets<00:04:42.070> it<00:04:42.280> would<00:04:42.400> be<00:04:42.520> this

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:00.800 

okay<00:04:55.479> so<00:04:55.540> it's<00:04:55.900> obvious<00:04:56.470> you're<00:04:56.830> just<00:04:57.040> going

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.030 

strong<00:05:01.810> weak<00:05:01.990> weak<00:05:02.200> strong<00:05:02.560> week<00:05:02.830> with

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
strong weak weak strong week with

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.300 
strong weak weak strong week with
strongly<00:05:03.580> strongly<00:05:05.640> okay<00:05:06.640> so<00:05:06.700> and<00:05:07.979> then<00:05:08.979> all

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
strongly strongly okay so and then all

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.600 
strongly strongly okay so and then all
you<00:05:09.490> have<00:05:09.520> to<00:05:09.760> do<00:05:09.970> is<00:05:10.180> whip<00:05:10.479> that<00:05:10.690> up<00:05:10.750> into<00:05:11.229> a

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
you have to do is whip that up into a

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:18.420 
you have to do is whip that up into a
fast<00:05:15.990> triplet<00:05:16.990> feel<00:05:17.229> and<00:05:17.470> it's<00:05:17.740> amazing<00:05:18.070> how

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
fast triplet feel and it's amazing how

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.310 
fast triplet feel and it's amazing how
fast<00:05:18.669> it<00:05:18.940> can<00:05:18.970> sound<00:05:19.240> and<00:05:19.479> I'm<00:05:19.570> not<00:05:19.750> playing<00:05:20.140> it

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
fast it can sound and I'm not playing it

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.260 
fast it can sound and I'm not playing it
very<00:05:20.350> quickly<00:05:20.740> so<00:05:21.370> I'll<00:05:21.460> just<00:05:21.490> do<00:05:21.820> that<00:05:22.000> and

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
very quickly so I'll just do that and

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.780 
very quickly so I'll just do that and
and<00:05:22.540> another<00:05:22.810> thing<00:05:23.050> I<00:05:23.169> like<00:05:23.290> to<00:05:23.350> do<00:05:23.640> when<00:05:24.640> I'm

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
and another thing I like to do when I'm

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:30.120 
and another thing I like to do when I'm
practicing<00:05:25.000> is<00:05:27.240> you<00:05:28.240> know<00:05:28.330> all<00:05:28.570> times<00:05:29.410> be

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
practicing is you know all times be

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.360 
practicing is you know all times be
fluid<00:05:30.669> use<00:05:31.120> the<00:05:31.330> continuum<00:05:31.960> of<00:05:32.140> time<00:05:32.470> from

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
fluid use the continuum of time from

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:39.520 
fluid use the continuum of time from
really<00:05:34.000> slow

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:45.470 

to<00:05:40.530> really<00:05:40.920> fast<00:05:41.990> and<00:05:43.730> do<00:05:44.730> it<00:05:44.880> all<00:05:45.060> the<00:05:45.090> way<00:05:45.360> up

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
to really fast and do it all the way up

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.210 
to really fast and do it all the way up
and<00:05:45.630> all<00:05:45.930> the<00:05:45.990> way<00:05:46.080> back<00:05:46.290> so<00:05:46.650> let's<00:05:46.980> just

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
and all the way back so let's just

00:05:47.220 --> 00:06:09.920 
and all the way back so let's just
demonstrate<00:05:47.760> that<00:05:47.910> quickly<00:05:48.180> here<00:06:08.480> okay<00:06:09.480> so<00:06:09.540> go

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
demonstrate that quickly here okay so go

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.320 
demonstrate that quickly here okay so go
up<00:06:10.170> and<00:06:10.470> back<00:06:10.710> and<00:06:10.740> up<00:06:11.130> and<00:06:11.400> back<00:06:11.610> and<00:06:11.640> hover<00:06:12.120> in

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
up and back and up and back and hover in

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.880 
up and back and up and back and hover in
the<00:06:12.420> middle<00:06:12.750> and<00:06:12.930> do<00:06:13.080> whatever<00:06:13.320> you<00:06:13.620> need<00:06:13.650> to

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
the middle and do whatever you need to

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:22.190 
the middle and do whatever you need to
do<00:06:14.220> to<00:06:16.880> sort<00:06:17.880> of<00:06:19.730> get<00:06:20.730> used<00:06:20.790> to<00:06:21.270> all<00:06:21.450> the<00:06:21.900> times

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
do to sort of get used to all the times

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.730 
do to sort of get used to all the times
that<00:06:22.860> you<00:06:23.190> can<00:06:23.220> play<00:06:23.610> that<00:06:23.850> and<00:06:24.090> get<00:06:24.650> when<00:06:25.650> you

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
that you can play that and get when you

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.640 
that you can play that and get when you
approach<00:06:26.040> your<00:06:26.070> limit<00:06:26.670> kind<00:06:27.270> of<00:06:27.420> a<00:06:27.530> you<00:06:28.530> know

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
approach your limit kind of a you know

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.710 
approach your limit kind of a you know
your<00:06:29.040> arms<00:06:29.280> start<00:06:29.520> aching<00:06:29.700> or<00:06:30.150> you<00:06:30.270> risk<00:06:30.450> get

your arms start aching or you risk get

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.200 
your arms start aching or you risk get
sore<00:06:31.070> then<00:06:32.070> just<00:06:32.310> bring<00:06:32.460> it<00:06:32.610> down<00:06:32.790> just<00:06:32.820> a

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
sore then just bring it down just a

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.150 
sore then just bring it down just a
little<00:06:33.360> bit<00:06:33.450> so<00:06:33.960> let's<00:06:34.350> say<00:06:34.560> your<00:06:34.740> limit<00:06:35.040> is

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
little bit so let's say your limit is

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.400 
little bit so let's say your limit is
160<00:06:35.850> beats<00:06:36.030> per<00:06:36.150> minute<00:06:36.450> then<00:06:36.960> put<00:06:37.290> it<00:06:37.380> back

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410 
160 beats per minute then put it back

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.980 
160 beats per minute then put it back
down<00:06:37.530> to<00:06:37.830> 140<00:06:38.370> and<00:06:38.550> then<00:06:39.030> do<00:06:39.420> that<00:06:39.660> for<00:06:39.930> a

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
down to 140 and then do that for a

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.180 
down to 140 and then do that for a
little<00:06:40.080> while<00:06:40.260> it's<00:06:40.590> sort<00:06:40.740> of<00:06:40.830> like<00:06:40.890> weight

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
little while it's sort of like weight

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.210 
little while it's sort of like weight
lifting<00:06:41.220> if<00:06:41.820> you<00:06:42.600> go<00:06:42.810> past<00:06:42.840> your<00:06:43.470> limit<00:06:43.830> just<00:06:44.130> a

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
lifting if you go past your limit just a

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.120 
lifting if you go past your limit just a
little<00:06:44.460> bit<00:06:44.610> then<00:06:45.360> the<00:06:45.540> next<00:06:45.690> day<00:06:45.950> you'll<00:06:46.950> be

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
little bit then the next day you'll be

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.250

able<00:06:47.190> to<00:06:47.340> go<00:06:47.460> a<00:06:47.490> little<00:06:47.820> further<00:06:48.120> and<00:06:48.480> then<00:06:49.020> go

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.260 
able to go a little further and then go

little further and it just baby steps
you<00:06:55.200> know<00:06:55.290> and<00:06:55.910> eventually<00:06:56.910> you'll<00:06:57.480> just<00:06:57.660> whip

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
you know and eventually you'll just whip

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:03.580 
you know and eventually you'll just whip
it<00:06:57.990> right<00:06:58.230> up<00:06:58.410> to

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:03.590 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.930 

okay<00:07:04.590> so<00:07:04.650> now<00:07:06.199> to<00:07:07.199> show<00:07:07.440> you<00:07:07.500> how<00:07:07.919> this<00:07:08.699> is

okay so now to show you how this is

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.850 
okay so now to show you how this is
useful<00:07:09.300> to<00:07:10.370> play<00:07:11.370> something<00:07:11.759> in<00:07:12.539> itself<00:07:13.440> it's

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 
useful to play something in itself it's

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.660 
useful to play something in itself it's
not<00:07:14.130> useful<00:07:14.370> other<00:07:14.910> than<00:07:15.270> playing
