image with Versamark ink and then once

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.780 
image with Versamark ink and then once
you<00:00:47.390> get<00:00:47.660> it<00:00:47.840> all<00:00:48.680> covered<00:00:48.980> you<00:00:49.280> want<00:00:49.490> to<00:00:49.580> stick

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
you get it all covered you want to stick

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.790 
you get it all covered you want to stick
it<00:00:49.910> right<00:00:50.060> into<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.750> embossing<00:00:51.290> enamel<00:00:51.680> we're

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
it right into the embossing enamel we're

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.580 
it right into the embossing enamel we're
using<00:00:52.160> ultra<00:00:52.550> thick<00:00:52.790> embossing<00:00:53.480> an<00:00:53.570> mo<00:00:53.780> or<00:00:54.050> UT

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
using ultra thick embossing an mo or UT

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.740 
using ultra thick embossing an mo or UT
it's<00:00:55.310> thicker<00:00:55.610> than<00:00:55.730> regular<00:00:55.880> embossing

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
it's thicker than regular embossing

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.000 
it's thicker than regular embossing
powder<00:00:56.960> that<00:00:57.170> you<00:00:57.230> might<00:00:57.380> be<00:00:57.530> used<00:00:57.650> to<00:00:57.770> using

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
powder that you might be used to using

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.580 
powder that you might be used to using
it's<00:00:58.310> more<00:00:58.550> like<00:00:58.730> a<00:00:58.760> sugar<00:00:59.120> consistency<00:01:00.050> and

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
it's more like a sugar consistency and

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.069 
it's more like a sugar consistency and
it's<00:01:00.920> definitely<00:01:01.160> just<00:01:01.460> like<00:01:01.610> a<00:01:01.640> thicker<00:01:02.079> just

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
it's definitely just like a thicker just

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.069 
it's definitely just like a thicker just
a<00:01:03.260> thicker<00:01:03.560> embossing<00:01:04.159> powder<00:01:04.399> and<00:01:04.990> what<00:01:05.990> I'm

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:06.079

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:07.600 
a thicker embossing powder and what I'm
gonna<00:01:06.170> do<00:01:06.380> here<00:01:06.619> is<00:01:06.649> I'm<00:01:06.860> heating<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.369> first

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
gonna do here is I'm heating the first

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.910 
gonna do here is I'm heating the first
layer<00:01:07.880> it's<00:01:08.210> gonna<00:01:08.360> take<00:01:08.720> about<00:01:08.990> three<00:01:09.619> layers

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
layer it's gonna take about three layers

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.550 
layer it's gonna take about three layers
to<00:01:10.369> get<00:01:10.729> at<00:01:11.000> what<00:01:11.270> I'm<00:01:11.360> going<00:01:11.659> for<00:01:11.689> is<00:01:12.110> a<00:01:12.140> really

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
to get at what I'm going for is a really

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.219 
to get at what I'm going for is a really
nice<00:01:12.770> smooth<00:01:13.600> coating<00:01:14.600> over<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.049> whole

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
nice smooth coating over the whole

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.389 
nice smooth coating over the whole
surface<00:01:15.530> of<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.189> image<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:17.600> it's<00:01:18.590> you<00:01:19.130> kind

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
surface of the image and it's you kind

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.550 
surface of the image and it's you kind
of<00:01:19.490> have<00:01:19.579> to<00:01:19.700> work<00:01:19.819> fast<00:01:20.179> because<00:01:20.630> you<00:01:20.780> want<00:01:21.289> to

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
of have to work fast because you want to

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.550 
of have to work fast because you want to
get<00:01:21.889> that<00:01:22.069> image<00:01:22.310> back<00:01:22.639> into<00:01:22.670> that<00:01:23.119> embossing

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
get that image back into that embossing

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.719 
get that image back into that embossing
enamel<00:01:24.560> after<00:01:24.979> you've<00:01:25.100> heated<00:01:25.280> it<00:01:25.520> because

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
enamel after you've heated it because

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.370 
enamel after you've heated it because
it's<00:01:25.939> when<00:01:26.179> it's<00:01:26.329> warm<00:01:26.600> then<00:01:26.840> it<00:01:26.960> will<00:01:27.079> stick

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
it's when it's warm then it will stick

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.209 
it's when it's warm then it will stick
to<00:01:27.649> the<00:01:28.549> image<00:01:28.899> and<00:01:29.899> here<00:01:30.590> we're<00:01:30.740> doing<00:01:31.009> the

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
to the image and here we're doing the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:33.459 
to the image and here we're doing the
second<00:01:31.609> layer<00:01:31.850> you<00:01:32.840> can<00:01:32.959> already<00:01:33.139> tell<00:01:33.229> it's

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
second layer you can already tell it's

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:37.149 
second layer you can already tell it's
definitely<00:01:33.859> smoother<00:01:35.590> but<00:01:36.590> like<00:01:36.799> I<00:01:36.829> said<00:01:37.130> I

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
definitely smoother but like I said I

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.819 
definitely smoother but like I said I
usually<00:01:37.700> do<00:01:37.880> about<00:01:37.909> three<00:01:38.600> layers<00:01:39.409> of<00:01:39.530> the

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
usually do about three layers of the

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.340 
usually do about three layers of the
embossing<00:01:40.340> enamel<00:01:40.789> so<00:01:41.600> here<00:01:41.810> we'll<00:01:41.929> do<00:01:42.079> one

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
embossing enamel so here we'll do one

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:50.050 
embossing enamel so here we'll do one
more<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:47.350> we'll<00:01:48.350> just<00:01:48.560> heat<00:01:49.310> it<00:01:49.340> one<00:01:49.789> last

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
more and we'll just heat it one last

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.190 
more and we'll just heat it one last
time<00:01:51.759> and<00:01:52.759> I<00:01:53.060> apologize<00:01:53.240> my<00:01:53.659> heat<00:01:53.869> gun<00:01:53.899> got

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
time and I apologize my heat gun got

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.160 
time and I apologize my heat gun got
right<00:01:54.439> in<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.679> way<00:01:55.569> but<00:01:56.569> you'll<00:01:56.719> be<00:01:56.779> able<00:01:56.929> to

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
right in the way but you'll be able to

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.449 
right in the way but you'll be able to
see<00:01:57.349> her<00:01:57.469> in<00:01:57.499> a<00:01:57.679> second

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:04.449 

already<00:02:01.459> the<00:02:01.729> nice<00:02:01.969> smooth<00:02:03.249> coating<00:02:04.249> over

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
already the nice smooth coating over

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:13.729 
already the nice smooth coating over
that<00:02:04.609> whole<00:02:04.819> front<00:02:05.179> of<00:02:05.359> that<00:02:05.479> image

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.990 

so<00:02:14.739> then<00:02:14.860> you're<00:02:14.980> gonna<00:02:15.069> take<00:02:15.370> that<00:02:15.700> and

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
so then you're gonna take that and

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000 
so then you're gonna take that and
you're<00:02:16.360> gonna<00:02:16.480> let<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:16.870> cool<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.440> then<00:02:17.890> we're

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
you're gonna let it cool and then we're
