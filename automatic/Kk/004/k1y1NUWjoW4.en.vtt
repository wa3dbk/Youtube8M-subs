00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
own experience and coupled them with

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.900 
own experience and coupled them with
anatomical<00:03:00.250> information<00:03:02.910> targeted

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
anatomical information targeted

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:11.690 
anatomical information targeted
exercises<00:03:04.390> strengthen<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.709> foot<00:03:05.950> muscles

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700
