00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.100
 we are alone even now 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.470
 Japanese is just this morning has 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.590
 presented its new line up for the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.390
 2014 and we are here with the new device 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.869
 sony flag bearer is called 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.770
 xperia z2 let's start from the important things 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:40.190
 then a 52 inch full hd screen 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.180
 1900 20 x 1080 pixels a definition 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.580
 really 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.000
 important we can confirm this 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.700
 we are seeing from here and technology 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.010
 display call them luminous and sony 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.739
 declares that practically that was the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.390
 same technology as the LCD displays of 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.730
 large ones from home we say 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.440
 was brought into a 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.010
 mobile device then a 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.160
 phone 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:11.160
 other features and qualcomm 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:15.330
 snapdragon 801 then 2.3 gigahertz quad 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.619
 core like all the z series we say from the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.180
 his birth 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.090
 you can also remember this 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.930
 device is certified p55 and p 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.970
 58 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.310
 which means that resistant does not 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.440
 just sketches as you could 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.210
 and thinking but also resistant 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.690
 to the dive up to a meter and a half 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.860
 in the water for a maximum of 30 minutes 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.240
 the immersion and this is the beauty not 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.550
 inhibits the potential of the telephone 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.160
 that is, it is also possible to shoot 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.690
 photographs shoot videos while we have 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.210
 the underwater phone the important thing is 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.060
 let it be respected let's say time 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.190
 half-hour frame another 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.100
 very important feature of the 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.369
 device that just to have 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.810
 proportions and of this size 5.3 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.980
 inch frames are enough 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:08.550
 narrow but thanks to the 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.710
 let's say very reduced thickness and al 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.600
 weight also reduced we remember that the 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.990
 frame is all completely made of aluminum 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.120
 a single block of excavated aluminum 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.040
 while front and back 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.900
 we have two tempered glass plates e 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.000
 shock resistant and resistant to 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.070
 scratches we said 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.980
 another important feature of 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.510
 this device is its camera 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.510
 exmor r da sensor 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:42.090
 sorry 20.7 megapixel resolution 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.180
 front sensor always exmor r ma 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.780
 this time 2 megapixel resolution 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.160
 adreno graphics accelerator 330 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.440
 expandability of the asc and of the memory 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:58.050
 internal up to 64 GB with external microsd 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.570
 while inside we can well up to 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.000
 16 GB of RAM 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.610
 here too we have dimensions from 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.940
 supremacy 3 gigabytes of ram memory 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.130
 integrated radio clearly lte and not 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.490
 could be missing on the top of the range device 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:18.450
 of 2014 by Sony is provided 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:21.080
 with android 4.4 and we would like them to show 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.440
 now a small one 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.850
 let's say small a little ride 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.550
 inside the capacities 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.500
 the camera application then the 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.370
 camera is the one we say 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.750
 the application interface 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.120
 camera and the one they have us 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.340
 accustomed by now sony but we'll see some 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.220
 let's say special features 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:44.270
 you saw we opened the scene menu 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.490
 so it's called let's try to make 4k videos 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.470
 we do not do it because it would not result 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.470
 in video try to make a time shift 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.320
 video what a tennis video means is 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.630
 a video in which the recording 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.260
 original is taken 120 frames per 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.220
 second 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.590
 but then we can decide to slow down 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.270
 a certain part of the video to get 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.430
 an effect remembered in this 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.540
 particularly the slow and slow effect 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.620
 a quarter 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.620
 let's take an example 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.170
 record 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.079
 ok 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.169
 once it comes from registration 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:26.590
 we have this slider that is expandable 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:28.810
 or closable that will tell us where we are 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.909
 we want to see the effect realized 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.000
 slows down a bit like the iPhone 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:36.550
 for the iPhone 5 it is seriously for the slow 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.530
 motion you see live thanks to 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:44.379
 very handsome processor comes 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:46.900
 all this takes a while 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:50.139
 but in very limited time for 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:53.650
 save everything anyway a camera 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:56.379
 which looks very good indeed 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.629
 we hope to try it as soon as possible for 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:01.199
 now it's all a greeting from ispazio ed 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:01.199
