00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
like a lot the first one the plot itself

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.860 
like a lot the first one the plot itself
is<00:02:59.340> tricky<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.700> explain<00:02:59.820> because<00:03:00.240> everything

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
is tricky to explain because everything

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.450 
is tricky to explain because everything
kind<00:03:01.080> of<00:03:01.140> comes<00:03:01.350> together<00:03:01.620> at<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.070> end<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.370> the

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
kind of comes together at the end of the

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.070 
kind of comes together at the end of the
first<00:03:02.670> book<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.030> continues<00:03:03.510> on<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:03.930> don't

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
first book and continues on so I don't

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.720 
first book and continues on so I don't
really<00:03:04.140> want<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.440> say<00:03:04.650> well<00:03:04.920> what<00:03:04.950> happens

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
really want to say well what happens

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.700 
really want to say well what happens
because<00:03:06.360> it's<00:03:06.600> kind<00:03:06.750> of<00:03:06.780> spoilers<00:03:07.230> but<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.470> will

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
because it's kind of spoilers but I will

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.500 
because it's kind of spoilers but I will
say<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.730> follows<00:03:09.030> four<00:03:09.240> different

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
say it follows four different

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.690 
say it follows four different
perspectives<00:03:09.630> a<00:03:10.350> princess<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.220> heir<00:03:11.460> a

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
lives and stories intertwine and becomes

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.960 
lives and stories intertwine and becomes
something<00:03:15.690> much<00:03:15.960> larger<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:17.400> first<00:03:17.580> book<00:03:17.790> was

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
something much larger the first book was

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.520 
something much larger the first book was
pretty<00:03:18.240> good<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.690> found<00:03:19.170> it<00:03:19.320> slightly

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
pretty good I found it slightly

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.050 
pretty good I found it slightly
predictable<00:03:20.160> well<00:03:20.280> not<00:03:20.460> slight<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.670> found<00:03:20.940> it

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
predictable well not slight I found it

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.760 
predictable well not slight I found it
pretty<00:03:21.240> predictable<00:03:21.540> but<00:03:22.260> overall<00:03:22.500> very

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
pretty predictable but overall very

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.150 
pretty predictable but overall very
entertaining<00:03:23.250> however<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.480> second<00:03:24.870> book

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160
