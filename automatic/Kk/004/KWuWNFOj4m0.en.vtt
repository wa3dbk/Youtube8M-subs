00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.020
 stupid and assumed tutorial in which 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:12.019
 I will show you how to do 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:15.440
 spit minecraft then to start 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:20.920
 you will create a new map 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:25.930
 so the name does not care about creative 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:29.380
 generate structures not even type we're going 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.360
 put a super satisfied ostomy flask 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.170
 So you will take 7 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.950
 here you erase this case there 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:42.760
 you are writing 5 x 46 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:46.760
 5 x 46 so all tied with an x 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.800
 miniscule you make the price 7 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.039
 you make tons you do new creature 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.039
 world 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.210
 this is my going to put a little bit of 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.500
 time whatever the case in any case 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.760
 performance of your pc 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.360
 I will not cut it 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.520
 necessarily minecraft will spit you 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.049
 you may have already understood 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.399
 Why 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.659
 but there you go you go 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.930
 understand if you have not yet 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.770
 understood when you go to see the head of 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.759
 the map I just generated so 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.100
 here is a map while tnt 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:29.280
 fully in TNT 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:33.710
 I did five deep here that's yes to 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.710
 nothing underneath we'll go back up 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.780
 here and now my you take a 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.430
 red stone torch or a lever 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.869
 or a button will you choose me I 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.740
 go take a blog at red stone and 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:53.009
 then you activate a TNT and there 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:55.670
 it's the end here 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.670
 really very con 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.229
 So here I am already planted and we are going 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.729
 soon to arrive at the crash 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.729
 oula oula 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.429
 basically ben if you know the effect 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.460
 successive explosions of tmt ben 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.710
 here is the whole map that will fart and 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.550
 that's it's going to crash is 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.550
 so there is tnt 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.800
 surprisingly I have not yet sliced 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.480
 but it should happen soon considering the 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.860
 poor performance of my pc i 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.680
 spit an intel core i5 with with 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.780
 it 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.780
 this is me I have a place baker 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.709
 here I think it'll be put 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.330
 here 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.099
 Well here I found it cheek red 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.830
 had nothing to do and you the famous 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.830
 minecraft window at this scratch crash 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.530
 this forgiveness and that's all the towers 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.110
 error report all that and that's it 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.610
 this is the end of this video a little 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.099
 stupid but assumed as I said at the 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.840
 start and foot there soon for 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.840
