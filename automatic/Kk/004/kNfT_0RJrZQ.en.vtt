00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.799
 here human go narrowing 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.379
 today the 25th installment of chelsea 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.150
 box and we start with something me 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.310
 look because you see here that the number has 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.769
 has and our watch list 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.960
 you see that yes here angry 66,000 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.500
 holes and here building never became 67 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.630
 500 but actually yes of 66,000 got it 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.570
 anyway because the true that was true 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.399
 on the road we now offer 41 k so one 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.630
 little act in can win vision one 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.129
 and 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.290
 there we can buy her saddle so me 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.480
 guess what i 'm going to wait with 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.430
 mappa and so first buy things because 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.920
 yes I like that 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.539
 And yes it is certainly achievable maybe 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.280
 that it will drop quite a bit in the 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.539
 who knows in the coming weeks 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.219
 but I 'm just going to try so soon 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.660
 possible to start our level 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.100
 first match 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.260
 I just did not show counter bid 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.070
 for team you play me that makes whole 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.199
 much out 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.030
 it was a level really a racing team 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.700
 I think because here a fan made for a 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.890
 torus a 0 in the second minute though and 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.930
 then in your tours 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.979
 and then after then this happens Marchien 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.780
 block 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.060
 marine block and then the ball becomes 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.130
 rusted away then lambert bring it again 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.530
 a conti best ridge seat is where the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.020
 good action and yes the ball shoots wonderfully 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.900
 feel free to omrin the cloth and so come 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.060
 hopping on 2 0 me he in ten with say 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.009
 but with ytong call 7 aeduans the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.229
 when and you see it too 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.310
 his name is the ball luiz gustavo go to 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.869
 Carlos Edardo 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.310
 to food we run run run run 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.820
 Run Run Run Run Run 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.680
 run 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.900
 high stitch run run run and 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.299
 round this then it will be wonderfully finished though 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.920
 first heard and went in a row with really 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.290
 abuse it very much 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.720
 He's in the film goal he see 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.280
 you yahiko while i'm out again 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.620
 then this is how you cross then me 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.900
 live run run run 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.670
 run and then you train so that was 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.160
 it a little yes the level of this 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.780
 A man's level was really very high 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.870
 sad 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.550
 and yes so calm very quickly on 2 2 and 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.950
 if you are sure if you see this 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.240
 china race overview and then you see 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.979
 how he shot three has three 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.880
 gain with 10 shots 6 or purpose that 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.250
 I thought the ball possession was a bit 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.470
 geranium market than who is much out of it 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.180
 yeah that was this man's good story he 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.830
 played really very sad 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.840
 So baking is right as a marine 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.730
 good movement along the man makes the bow 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.860
 for has a thoracic in three 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.110
 two get used to it and then yes I can do this 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.460
 call nothing but justice like 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.110
 I already yes 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.320
 seven times and have shot more three 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.550
 times more on purpose or if so then it is 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.410
 just pull but here you see it 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.330
 party again and get quite random 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.730
 suddenly yes luckily another free kick 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.110
 against but good for david luiz but 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.610
 finally made no sense to the type 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.420
 had the ball so it is nothing 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.310
 to happen 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.460
 early he also cut this free kick 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.560
 again on the bar and yes and I found it 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.570
 in the wall I was happy with that 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.730
 but here again a sick paintballs one 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.959
 high cross over my dating make nothing 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.340
 can put on 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.870
 and then you see what I am very sorry for 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.420
 all my goalkeeper a funny just to 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.300
 number of times in this episode 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.160
 as well as he you in this moment 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.630
 comes one already he thinks I could too 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.310
 me with my chicken restaurants the 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.260
 perfect ball our keeper a mets 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.120
 left leg and so we take the lead 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.520
 with ten men because I think that after those three 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.150
 you I'm hopeless but he just went 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.770
 by 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.750
 run run run run 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.160
 and yes here he made it too 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.680
 a nice eagle 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.110
 really a nice cool but i found this one 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.480
 mouth spit really all very sad but now 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.510
 right here it was my level though 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.519
 was nice and then 13 4 4 but then comes 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.320
 who plays moses and metrics against me 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.940
 side also expect back 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.800
 he leaks above it, quietly wide 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.690
 torres it is not a real tram but me 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.310
 always feel a bit sad when you 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.709
 so is short but i do it the last 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.060
 time comes quite often it knows pretty well 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.350
 then with the there here again 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.280
 comes along yes that does from this girl 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.140
 keep it 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.940
 hey i always think you can not 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.830
 call it inhibition it is also certainly one 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.600
 trend but if he is sick type living in the 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.160
 goal let alone then I just had myself 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.049
 shot it is that he does that himself 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.700
 I can't help you either 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.680
 and he went over is still over anyway 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.799
 a nice run but again I fall 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.420
 am my keeper 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.280
 but again it was p school out of the 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.110
 counter but does not make it all 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.239
 more out because it became 6 5 and that was 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.709
 ultimately also the final score of this 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.689
 competition and I ask you again 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.239
 don't forget to like this episode 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:19.979
 of course well 6 5 is the final score 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.109
 by the way, not at all because here was possible 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.030
 eventually in an epic mine moses 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.650
 also had a run run run with them 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.490
 types and then throws he wore one and 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.490
 tour-s markelo 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.370
 7575 and I went along quite irritating 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.050
 are the width so I am just dead 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.880
 rinse and you will finally see it here 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.949
 the end of the competition c5 dogs with 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.270
 a red card 4 goals made with 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:43.289
 10 men 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.680
 pretty neat so we go now you can 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:49.949
 once I made streak 12.12 win 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.320
 Only that's right there so not 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:55.020
 and it had to be 14 so that was best 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.539
 a very hard pole because it had to 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.250
 really be in last time and nuon 14 want 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:02.130
 when you watch bed we won first 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.800
 division turned a seven 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.000
 to me to islam glenn the classics 11 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.870
 and now we have won 3 times 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.760
 so that is then 14 and start now according to 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.639
 or five tens and also unwise for years 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.830
 in in 90 19th minute we arrived one or 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.360
 hear via monuta 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.810
 but a moment later it went wrong as here 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.510
 a penalty has no throat but yes 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.760
 watch what will happen because yes 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.590
 Check this suit just fantastic paul 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.570
 by now from the intersection and 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.820
 professional secrecy and choirs and who decided 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.889
 john terry delicious to finish 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.260
 yes agile little ball from john terry and 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.550
 so we come to 2 0 follows 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.199
 yes and then it should be decided 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.479
 are and 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.940
 but ultimately just deep 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.710
 lighting technology your domain association with 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.690
 falcao literally too through it 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.020
 koso fifa lodge i just love it 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.789
 ringer boy could do through people 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.680
 and so it was weeping for that 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:58.139
 also tense except as a tourist want 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.060
 This does dorothy and the good comes and 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:02.669
 26 men from grimaces and then 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.680
 destroy the swipe and the bowl on three 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.840
 one and then it is actually decided 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.880
 he will eventually come back 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.750
 in the 60th minute and that again why 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.639
 an e-type 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.810
 I hear all along the goal state 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:13.660
 I don't know what I'm doing, man 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.420
 system 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.440
 now what those three two mike stresses 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.970
 but I nobody 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.280
 yes i just could have been much more than that 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:24.310
 this guy and I knew he was the ball well 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.810
 well come and it comes 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.680
 eventually even if here again the 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.390
 ball looks 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.370
 nice switch you do back inside 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:33.520
 and then delicious finess 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.590
 shop bottom right corner yes keeper 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.390
 hopeless rustic ball eventually 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.280
 goes carey still your score well i think 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.960
 this one of the only times is on terry 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.520
 score twice in a match 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.340
 everyone because we need this moment 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.980
 cherish but then ultimately 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.850
 Also in the 90th minute with another honor 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.800
 it's me 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.750
 are still 5 3 because then yes I am not really 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.210
 very serious with her playing k van 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.950
 yes which shall stuff and go not crazy then 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.480
 grown and stay serious 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.010
 actually it becomes 5 three 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.170
 that means 15 matches
