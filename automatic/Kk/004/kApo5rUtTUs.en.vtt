for<00:01:09.490> them<00:01:09.729> to<00:01:09.909> reboot<00:01:10.180> this<00:01:10.570> game<00:01:10.900> because<00:01:11.380> it

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
for them to reboot this game because it

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.670 
for them to reboot this game because it
has<00:01:11.950> such<00:01:12.370> a<00:01:12.729> different<00:01:13.659> following<00:01:14.140> compared

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
has such a different following compared

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.810 
has such a different following compared
to<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.159> other<00:01:15.310> games<00:01:15.550> that<00:01:15.610> they've

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
to the other games that they've

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.910 
to the other games that they've
attempted<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.300> reboot<00:01:16.570> in<00:01:16.659> the<00:01:16.720> past<00:01:16.960> also<00:01:17.890> I

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
attempted to reboot in the past also I

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.500 
attempted to reboot in the past also I
think<00:01:18.159> a<00:01:18.370> lot<00:01:18.520> of<00:01:18.550> people<00:01:18.640> are<00:01:18.940> excited<00:01:19.299> about

think a lot of people are excited about

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.450 
think a lot of people are excited about
this<00:01:19.840> reboot<00:01:20.170> because<00:01:20.560> it<00:01:20.740> has<00:01:20.920> a<00:01:20.950> really<00:01:21.250> good

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
this reboot because it has a really good

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.310 
this reboot because it has a really good
company<00:01:21.850> behind<00:01:22.000> it<00:01:22.330> whereas<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:22.960> double<00:01:23.200> may

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
company behind it whereas the double may

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.910 
company behind it whereas the double may
cry<00:01:23.590> one<00:01:23.770> doesn't<00:01:24.100> have<00:01:24.250> as<00:01:24.570> well<00:01:25.570> received<00:01:26.470> of

a<00:01:27.010> company<00:01:27.400> behind<00:01:27.549> it<00:01:27.880> so<00:01:28.380> there<00:01:29.380> is<00:01:29.620> a<00:01:29.650> new

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
a company behind it so there is a new

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.590 
a company behind it so there is a new
tomb<00:01:30.370> raider<00:01:30.580> game<00:01:30.850> coming<00:01:31.180> out<00:01:31.299> we<00:01:31.479> don't

space<00:03:19.630> marine<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.470> it's<00:03:20.590> actually<00:03:20.920> a

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
space marine and it's actually a

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.620 
space marine and it's actually a
third-person<00:03:21.459> shooter<00:03:22.000> people<00:03:22.420> are

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
third-person shooter people are

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.980 
third-person shooter people are
comparing<00:03:23.410> it<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:23.830> lot<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.880> Gears<00:03:25.180> of<00:03:25.240> War<00:03:25.360> which

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
comparing it a lot to Gears of War which

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.080 
comparing it a lot to Gears of War which
i<00:03:26.140> think<00:03:26.200> is<00:03:26.350> kind<00:03:26.500> of<00:03:26.650> silly<00:03:26.860> I<00:03:27.190> don't<00:03:28.000> think

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
i think is kind of silly I don't think

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.550 
i think is kind of silly I don't think
that<00:03:28.420> there's<00:03:28.540> really<00:03:28.750> any<00:03:29.020> connection

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
that there's really any connection

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.980 
that there's really any connection
beyond<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.280> fact<00:03:30.520> that<00:03:30.670> it's<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.300> third-person

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
beyond the fact that it's a third-person

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.500 
beyond the fact that it's a third-person
shooter<00:03:32.470> and<00:03:32.709> you're<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:32.980> giant<00:03:33.850> Hulk<00:03:34.090> of<00:03:34.240> a<00:03:34.330> man
