00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
would feel absolutely awful like it was

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.340 
would feel absolutely awful like it was
going<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.000> explode<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.170> would<00:01:37.320> feel

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
going to explode and it just would feel

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.080 
going to explode and it just would feel
worse<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.040> worse<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.310> worse<00:01:38.460> every<00:01:38.820> day<00:01:38.850> and

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
worse and worse and worse every day and

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.730 
worse and worse and worse every day and
I<00:01:39.119> had<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.540> many<00:01:39.630> different<00:01:39.900> tests<00:01:40.290> done<00:01:40.409> on<00:01:40.470> me

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
I had so many different tests done on me

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.830 
I had so many different tests done on me
it<00:01:40.890> was<00:01:41.040> unbelievable<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:42.450> nothing<00:01:42.600> was

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
it was unbelievable but nothing was

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.020 
it was unbelievable but nothing was
really<00:01:43.020> fixing<00:01:43.470> itself<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.860> took<00:01:43.920> pills<00:01:44.369> for<00:01:44.909> my

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
really fixing itself I took pills for my

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.340 
really fixing itself I took pills for my
anxiety<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.509> nothing<00:01:45.869> would<00:01:45.960> really<00:01:46.200> help

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
anxiety and nothing would really help

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.920 
anxiety and nothing would really help
and<00:01:46.590> then<00:01:46.799> basically<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:48.030> just<00:01:48.090> led<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.750> me

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
and then basically it just led to me

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.420 
and then basically it just led to me
missing<00:01:49.409> more<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.740> more<00:01:49.860> school<00:01:50.100> because<00:01:50.310> I'd

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
missing more and more school because I'd

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.649 
missing more and more school because I'd
show<00:01:50.670> up<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.000> feel<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.479> was<00:01:51.570> gonna

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
show up and I feel like I was gonna

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.999 
show up and I feel like I was gonna
throw<00:01:51.899> up<00:01:51.930> all<00:01:52.140> day<00:01:52.259> or<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.439> would<00:01:52.680> throw<00:01:52.829> up

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
throw up all day or I would throw up

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.310

because<00:01:53.070> i<00:01:53.430> made<00:01:53.880> my<00:01:54.030> air<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.240> thought<00:01:54.540> my<00:01:55.079> mind

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
because i made my air I thought my mind

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.139 
because i made my air I thought my mind
made<00:01:55.619> me<00:01:55.799> think<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.340> was<00:01:56.490> sick<00:01:56.700> enough<00:01:56.909> and

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
made me think that I was sick enough and

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.280 
made me think that I was sick enough and
I<00:01:57.210> would<00:01:57.299> actually<00:01:57.540> end<00:01:57.570> up<00:01:57.689> throwing<00:01:57.869> up<00:01:58.140> or

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
I would actually end up throwing up or

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.139 
I would actually end up throwing up or
something<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.619> end<00:01:58.860> up<00:01:58.950> going<00:01:59.250> home<00:01:59.430> or<00:01:59.700> just

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
something I end up going home or just

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.520 
something I end up going home or just
wouldn't<00:02:00.479> show<00:02:00.630> up<00:02:00.659> at<00:02:00.840> all<00:02:00.930> because<00:02:01.079> I'd<00:02:01.320> wake

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
wouldn't show up at all because I'd wake

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.649 
wouldn't show up at all because I'd wake
up<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.829> feel<00:02:02.009> awful<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:03.270> don't<00:02:03.509> really

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.150 
know why this even all started because
