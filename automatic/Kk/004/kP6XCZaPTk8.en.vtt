00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello to all the friends of gigetto weil 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.519
 we are here today in the company of gt2 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.019
 again because first of all I wanted to 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.849
 show you both the kit cup update 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.460
 4.4.2 which has been out for a while but also 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.650
 to give some do some 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.840
 consideration on this device 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.119
 after using as first 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.510
 device for most of the time 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.439
 we are now four months and before 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.410
 change it again we arrived 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.890
 however at a very affordable cost 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.610
 compared to the exit, we are already talking about 320 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.110
 that renzi europe 370 euros 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.300
 like all the other top of the range of 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.270
 2013 after all 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.820
 we begin to unlock the device as 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.579
 you always see the knock on that 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.699
 would therefore be double tap for 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.809
 turn on the display improved compared 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.579
 to the jelly bean version however not 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.640
 always receives one hundred percent 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.950
 however as you can see it has improved 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.200
 drastically 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.390
 however if we get on a surface 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.020
 and sometimes it happens that you don't get it 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.560
 very good touch what changed 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.540
 first in the right settings 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.430
 to take a ride 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.840
 as you can see 4.4.2 this is the usual kernel 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.840
 vodafone brand version 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.509
 however apart from the initial debut with 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.090
 vodafone logo does not differ in anything 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.759
 compared to the open market 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.570
 I was saying what changes with respect to 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.280
 jelly Bean 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.909
 first of all we have a reactivity 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.920
 greater than the system even if not 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:53.460
 we talk about incredible speeds 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.110
 we're on the jets because now it's because 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.189
 it was already like you can see there is some little one 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.760
 lag that is sometimes annoying but that 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.370
 anyway 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.880
 absolutely compromises the experience a 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.350
 part this this part not widgets 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.700
 they are present however numerous 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.680
 slowdowns 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.980
 I must say that I did not make a 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.160
 restoration of factory data on 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.260
 device then some pond 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.900
 sometimes it appears bad can also be 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.370
 due to this I didn't do it because 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:30.310
 I updated it with lg flash on the pil e 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.710
 a rom team above so I had to have 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.000
 changed drastically and I have not 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.800
 deleted nothing on the phone has me 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.630
 saved all the data above and then 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.850
 not to lose them anyway I don't have 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.180
 done the restore if we go on the 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:48.970
 stock browser of cheerful we see how 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:52.200
 there are no more sudden crashes 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.200
 let's go for example on hdblog 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.209
 dissolved as usual you don't do well 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:11.689
 at my home 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:15.980
 let's go with the 3g which we say as you see 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:18.049
 the fluidity and also excellent zoom track 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.170
 the browser has always been fluid too 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:24.469
 ingestible for the problem were i 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.389
 too many crashes coming during 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:28.159
 I must say that this was the use 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:31.639
 resolved the part of lg 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:35.599
 another problem is the camera 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:37.970
 recording in 1080p at 60 frames per 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.849
 second, it was quite slow when 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.650
 we were in bad light 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.409
 I must say that it was slightly 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.540
 improved even if it is not at its maximum 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.620
 of fluidity when we already have some 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.810
 in the dark 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:56.419
 the shot is always fast I make you 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:04:02.150
 see why our collapse like 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:04.639
 said very fast enough it is not 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:10.340
 been entered in a recording in 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:13.419
 4k as for example on 13 or even the 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.680
 ii book that just came out stops 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:20.530
 1080p at 60 frames per second 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:23.930
 however there are changes 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.220
 with which through the root is possible 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.139
 install these changes e 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.590
 record them in 4k and did not do it but 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.900
 I think very soon I will try it 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.620
 say then we have the curtain in place here 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.480
 of notifications which is transparent therefore 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.470
 is no longer the 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.990
 in gray color but it is possible 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.210
 have the background that uses the 52 inches 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.160
 of the display 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.290
 there are no other news besides 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.470
 fact that it is possible 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.510
 as you see print can print the 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.880
 phone file phone documents 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.670
 via wifi by connecting another 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.850
 our printer an update that has 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:08.330
 the performance is moderate but in part 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:12.290
 however it was not necessary apart 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.330
 just to say kat kit let's say and for 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.770
 pamper your customers a little 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.210
 let's make some considerations about 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.330
 I have to say that this device is me 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:24.650
 really found the display very well 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:26.920
 fantastic we often hear of phones 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.560
 that with two cups he should be able to 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.620
 short but that I don't think anyway 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.170
 revolution will revolutionize 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.990
 the really beautiful user experience 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:42.370
 make these things not a background 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:46.550
 those of htc juan n 8 lyric are 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.800
 really fantastic camera is 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.660
 acceptable 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.450
 we say an excellent level is acceptable 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.850
 which however is not the top registration 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:06:00.770
 video the same we have a battery that 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:02.510
 it lasts really a lot i have to say that it lasts a 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.030
 a little less than the first time with 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.770
 used after four months 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.440
 I think it's a little strange I think it's a bit 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:12.590
 I change some problems though I don't know a 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:16.400
 a little less perhaps because I use the 3g more 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:19.490
 but often I don't know what to say 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.090
 we are still advised to purchase 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:27.410
 I would say yes we have a device 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:31.750
 that if you play it easily with new ones 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:34.430
 exit as if 5 juan n 8 of course 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.160
 we don't have the distortion 101 that 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.660
 I remember it is only 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.370
 the overclocked version of the nineteenth century 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.990
 we have technorete before fantastic 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.700
 so apart from the material that 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:49.690
 will be a little low level 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.160
 behind it is the plastic that sometimes 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:56.500
 creaks 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:58.750
 I must say that he does not feel like moving to 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:04.150
 a phone of us generation then of 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:07.570
 new generations let's not just say what 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:09.820
 still needs the lg interface not 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:12.040
 it is among the best but of course yes 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:17.470
 knows that with the revival of alternatives yes 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:20.380
 it can however modify the entire input 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:22.180
 graphic let's say a phone that me 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.310
 I recommend especially now that you are 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.740
 finds around 320 euros and I think so 

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:32.530
 the best phone in that range 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:35.080
 price also s4 one are located around 

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:36.940
 that price not yet z1 but I think 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.370
 you know the z2 also in italy site 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:43.930
 also great as a phone will 

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:46.120
 therefore I recommend it for those who are still 

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.500
 undecided whether to buy it now 

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.380
 that's about to come out that's about to come out 

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:54.070
 that will come out within a few months of me 

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:56.880
 I say to proceed a greeting for Giuseppe 

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.880
 Hello
