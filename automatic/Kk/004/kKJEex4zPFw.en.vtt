constructed<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:21.150> couple<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.720> comments<00:00:21.900> about

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
constructed a couple of comments about

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.349 
constructed a couple of comments about
the<00:00:22.320> fit<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.680> finish<00:00:22.830> though<00:00:23.300> there's<00:00:24.300> a

couple of things just don't line up the
way<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.039> think<00:00:26.189> they<00:00:26.519> should<00:00:26.760> for<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> $350<00:00:28.619> case

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939

me<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.110> trim<00:00:37.410> came<00:00:37.620> off<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.070> didn't<00:00:38.250> really

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
me the trim came off but I didn't really

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.160 
me the trim came off but I didn't really
believe<00:00:38.460> them<00:00:38.879> but<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.840> see<00:00:39.989> if<00:00:40.050> they're

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
believe them but I see if they're

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.720 
believe them but I see if they're
talking<00:00:40.290> about<00:00:40.530> now<00:00:40.829> it's<00:00:41.100> just<00:00:41.309> not<00:00:41.700> very

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
talking about now it's just not very

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.540 
talking about now it's just not very
secure<00:00:42.920> those<00:00:43.920> kind<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.219> things

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
secure those kind of things

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.910 
secure those kind of things

what<00:00:52.680> I'm<00:00:52.800> kind<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.070> frustrated<00:00:53.520> with<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.879> that

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
what I'm kind of frustrated with is that

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.260 
what I'm kind of frustrated with is that
as<00:00:54.570> great<00:00:54.840> as<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.020> case<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:56.030> there<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
as great as this case is there is a

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.290 
as great as this case is there is a
problem<00:00:57.840> with<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.500> little<00:00:58.859> handle<00:00:59.579> popping

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
problem with this little handle popping

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.389 
problem with this little handle popping
open<00:01:00.449> when<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:00.840> not<00:01:00.930> supposed<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.399> this

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
open when it's not supposed to this

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.880

in<00:02:48.030> any<00:02:48.150> case<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.450> want<00:02:48.690> people<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:49.019> be<00:02:49.140> aware

now to see if I can get this replaced

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.970 
now to see if I can get this replaced
for<00:03:02.340> V<00:03:02.610> 46<00:03:03.209> or<00:03:03.360> V<00:03:03.540> 47<00:03:04.200> since<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:04.680> would

for V 46 or V 47 since that would
actually<00:03:05.400> completely<00:03:06.209> fix<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.480> problem

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
actually completely fix the problem

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.289 
actually completely fix the problem
putting<00:03:07.769> in<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.980> replacement<00:03:08.340> part<00:03:08.760> won't<00:03:08.970> fix

putting in a replacement part won't fix

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.580 
putting in a replacement part won't fix
it<00:03:09.510> because<00:03:09.660> it's<00:03:09.930> going<00:03:10.049> to<00:03:10.110> be<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.319> exact

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
it because it's going to be the exact

it because it's going to be the exact
