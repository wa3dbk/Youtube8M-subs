00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.909
 we will see the realization in the room 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:05.500
 in a show not 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.030
 we will be able to realize this benefit of course they must have meat 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:14.589
 chop them normally with a knife here or there we have for the preparation of 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.990
 rules of hygiene of the minced meat machine that has just been the name of 

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:20.460
 a few moments ago 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.259
 to decorate this preparation 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.140
 we will use different ingredients 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.099
 we start in the bank by no one else 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.320
 king had missed salt pepper domota and then the untenable give a 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.150
 based 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.950
 mayonnaise 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.399
 that we are flavored to the reported wolves 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.630
 of tabasco with english sauce 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.400
 and that you are afraid 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.720
 before introducing 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.340
 sadly chiseled 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.850
 rock ledges 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.970
 small optical theaters 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.860
 from 6am to 6am 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.980
 to the demon of the benefit I start so with a 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.980
 dasquiÃ© guillaume placed in the center of a soup plate 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.950
 to that I add all 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.950
 an old woman 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.150
 since she 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.150
 alexander 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.060
 I know 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.310
 generous 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.950
 because those and everyone I've been able to 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.680
 in the folder he messed up cyclists 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.560
 necessary for large sizes 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.770
 my staff 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.840
 thank you 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.470
 generously also 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.660
 and so I'm already going 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.980
 mix this preparation 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.970
 so I work well with yahoo 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.500
 the dish of the fork 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.200
 turning his in one direction as in the other 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.200
 to me a new model but he is already at the start 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.280
 my preparation 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.280
 then because he simply 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.540
 p 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.650
 so you need to this course for a delicate mans him 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.340
 so that the same no 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.250
 we have a mayonnaise that come 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.120
 in which case it would be necessary to restart the preparation 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.469
 so I turn 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.469
 and always continue as you go 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.609
 in order to advance in the work 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:16.709
 I have already prepared an abandon 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.679
 a mayonnaise that will allow me 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:20.229
 to work a little faster 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:22.489
 to this mayonnaise 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.489
 I will add 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:31.639
 I will tell 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:32.849
 few drops 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.289
 very bitter point 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:36.899
 the 62nd 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:40.389
 if borloo is like the preparation 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:41.879
 few drops 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:42.989
 from tabasco 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.049
 after the tartare must be noted otherwise it is not too late 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:49.459
 the mixture with water 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.459
 all this preparation 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:55.389
 an agreement to understand it well 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.619
 Normally it's already good aromas to emerge simon already we 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:59.599
 give a little bit 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.599
 the trend from the static point 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:06.489
 once this price is recorded 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.869
 using my savage serge place 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:11.399
 I still have pop 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.399
 chopped onions 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.339
 I just love it 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:20.339
 the hidden cornices 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.939
 this poses in january 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.669
 without all these products are all very important lots for preparation 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.129
 because everyone 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.389
 my family a sad specific 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.099
 to the preparation 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:38.989
 add three quarters 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.219
 others hide in it 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:43.229
 I'm going with a fork 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:45.769
 biarritz crashed 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.789
 we have six injured the gap 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:52.219
 who wants to clear a maximum of trees 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:55.280
 so it's a bit like preparing a cocktail at daegu 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.649
 the diocese of lemon 

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:59.819
 the text 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:00.989
 of these products 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.199
 which of course go aromatic and then 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:04.969
 our language c 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:07.639
 so you have to work well 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:08.799
 in a way 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.799
 very homogeneous 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:13.759
 to be able to drink 

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:15.719
 preparation 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:17.650
 that the maputo client afp 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.919
 appreciated 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.009
 we will of course have taken care to ask the customer before 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.009
 below and his steak tartar rather raised 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.210
 traditional 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.520
 because they 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.439
 the group 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.289
 to tell it at the beginning 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.650
 if we have to rectify the seasoning at the end 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.650
 it's not exactly the same 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.059
 so if we worked well for him 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:44.110
 I want to be quiet 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.889
 my minced meat 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.529
 that his head is put 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:51.529
 in my preparation 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:05.059
 and I come 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.479
 so my club needs to prepare our source 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:13.550
 this mixture 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.809
 homogenously with minced meat 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:18.909
 that all the particles 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:20.270
 samir laabidi 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.889
 so it goes without saying that when you have a tartare 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:23.819
 a meat 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:25.719
 for the barca which is hidden with a knife 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:28.059
 we need much less 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:29.000
 from afp source 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.319
 given 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:32.999
 that not the pieces being bigger 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:37.059
 the homogenization of the myth and the bassem led to be made of 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:38.969
 way 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:41.669
 but there they have a life between 6am and machines 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.569
 it takes a lot more worries 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:45.050
 at the end of the afternoon 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.050
 all the particles of violence 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.599
 how the preparation 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:55.969
 we will simply grab 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.300
 Customer's steel 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.300
 after having of course taste the product 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:05.819
 thing that I'm not going to do here on this video because 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:07.249
 it does not make sense 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:10.150
 the video does not allow to show through 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.389
 but he magnifying 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.099
 and so I'm just going 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:17.879
 get rid 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:20.879
 negotiators 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.930
 to me from the army 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.430
 in which this year filed 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.430
 this preparation 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:34.180
 so two senses between all 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.360
 and restore them 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.360
 the steak that ever 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:08.009
 he was absent 

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:11.009
 to smooth 

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:25.680
 my father's dream if access 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.680
 to finish the presentation of my steak tartare 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.310
 and I am ready to serve the service
