00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
because it was like a little bit of

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.100 
because it was like a little bit of
propaganda<00:01:56.280> for<00:01:56.580> two<00:01:56.850> for<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.810> German

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
propaganda for two for the German

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.200 
propaganda for two for the German
soldiers<00:01:58.530> when<00:01:58.890> they<00:01:58.920> would<00:01:59.399> storm<00:01:59.789> the<00:01:59.940> enemy

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
soldiers when they would storm the enemy

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.779 
soldiers when they would storm the enemy
lines<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.229> English<00:02:02.190> took<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.580> and<00:02:02.700> they

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
lines so that English took that and they

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.940 
lines so that English took that and they
just<00:02:03.000> accept<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.539> as<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.960> assault<00:02:04.289> assault

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
just accept it as the assault assault

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.070 
just accept it as the assault assault
instead<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.490> storm<00:02:05.819> so<00:02:06.569> it's<00:02:06.690> kinda<00:02:06.899> like<00:02:06.959> the

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
instead of storm so it's kinda like the

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:55.490 
I just always like this gun and I
usually<00:06:53.099> use<00:06:53.370> the<00:06:53.550> telescopic<00:06:54.240> sight<00:06:55.169> on<00:06:55.409> this

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 
usually use the telescopic sight on this

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.830 
usually use the telescopic sight on this
map<00:06:55.710> because<00:06:56.009> it's<00:06:56.219> really<00:06:56.370> big<00:06:56.639> map<00:06:56.879> and<00:06:57.150> that

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 
map because it's really big map and that

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.350 
map because it's really big map and that
telescopic<00:06:58.289> sight<00:06:58.800> helps<00:06:59.370> a<00:06:59.460> lot<00:06:59.639> it<00:06:59.969> has<00:07:00.120> like

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
telescopic sight helps a lot it has like

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.580 
telescopic sight helps a lot it has like
it<00:07:00.539> seems<00:07:00.750> like<00:07:00.870> it<00:07:00.990> puts<00:07:01.169> a<00:07:01.229> little<00:07:01.349> bit<00:07:01.500> of

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
it seems like it puts a little bit of

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.369 
it seems like it puts a little bit of
recoil<00:07:01.949> in<00:07:02.189> but<00:07:03.000> it<00:07:03.210> doesn't<00:07:03.599> it<00:07:04.020> seems<00:07:04.259> like

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:04.379 
recoil in but it doesn't it seems like

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:05.990 
recoil in but it doesn't it seems like
it<00:07:04.439> he'll<00:07:04.620> help<00:07:04.919> a<00:07:05.039> lot<00:07:05.189> and<00:07:05.490> it<00:07:05.610> looks<00:07:05.819> like

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 
it he'll help a lot and it looks like

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.300 
it he'll help a lot and it looks like
the<00:07:06.210> ACOG<00:07:06.750> on<00:07:07.110> that<00:07:07.699> m40a3<00:07:09.169> from<00:07:10.169> the<00:07:10.349> call<00:07:11.250> of
