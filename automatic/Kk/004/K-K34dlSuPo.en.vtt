00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:45.929 
was a hairdryer and it made it go a lot

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:48.169 
was a hairdryer and it made it go a lot
faster<00:00:46.170> as<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.859> can<00:00:47.070> see<00:00:47.219> we<00:00:47.370> started<00:00:47.820> off<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:48.179 
faster as you can see we started off the

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:51.400 
faster as you can see we started off the
same<00:00:48.390> way<00:00:48.420> we<00:00:48.750> use<00:00:49.129> moisturizer

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
same way we use moisturizer

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.050 
same way we use moisturizer
once<00:00:51.560> that<00:00:51.770> dries<00:00:52.100> you<00:00:52.520> can<00:00:52.640> start<00:00:52.850> with<00:00:52.940> your

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
once that dries you can start with your

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.430 
once that dries you can start with your
first<00:00:53.210> coat

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
first coat

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.500 
first coat
I<00:00:55.530> mean<00:00:56.070> she's<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> really<00:00:56.760> small<00:00:56.969> makeup<00:00:57.300> brush

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
I mean she's a really small makeup brush

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.360 
I mean she's a really small makeup brush
and<00:00:57.840> applied<00:00:58.230> really<00:00:58.530> thin<00:00:58.710> codes<00:00:59.039> over<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
and applied really thin codes over the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.620 
and applied really thin codes over the
time

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
time

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.290 
time
after<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.290> few<00:01:01.440> minutes<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:02.010> letting<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.340> try

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
after a few minutes of letting in try

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.179 
after a few minutes of letting in try
we<00:01:04.420> blended<00:01:04.870> it<00:01:04.960> into<00:01:05.230> the<00:01:05.320> skin

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
we blended it into the skin

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:08.679 
we blended it into the skin
and<00:01:07.490> then<00:01:07.789> you<00:01:07.909> can<00:01:08.030> start<00:01:08.240> with<00:01:08.329> your<00:01:08.420> next

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
and then you can start with your next

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:10.959 
and then you can start with your next
layer<00:01:08.869> you<00:01:09.649> can<00:01:10.009> see<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.280> tattoos<00:01:10.609> already

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:10.969 
layer you can see the tattoos already

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:12.309 
layer you can see the tattoos already
kind<00:01:11.149> of<00:01:11.240> covered<00:01:11.509> up<00:01:11.600> but<00:01:11.749> you<00:01:11.840> can<00:01:11.960> still<00:01:12.140> see

00:01:12.309 --> 00:01:12.319 
kind of covered up but you can still see

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.639 
kind of covered up but you can still see
it

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
it

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:14.709 
it
the<00:01:12.890> next<00:01:13.130> layer<00:01:13.280> layer<00:01:13.609> covers<00:01:13.969> a<00:01:13.999> lot<00:01:14.329> better

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
the next layer layer covers a lot better

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:18.819 
the next layer layer covers a lot better
so<00:01:15.880> as<00:01:16.880> you're<00:01:17.750> applying<00:01:17.929> that<00:01:18.200> layer<00:01:18.409> just<00:01:18.649> be

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
so as you're applying that layer just be

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:20.199 
so as you're applying that layer just be
careful<00:01:19.159> not<00:01:19.280> to<00:01:19.340> pull<00:01:19.670> off<00:01:19.789> any<00:01:20.000> of<00:01:20.119> the

00:01:20.199 --> 00:01:20.209 
careful not to pull off any of the

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:21.819 
careful not to pull off any of the
existing<00:01:20.420> makeup<00:01:20.869> go<00:01:21.020> really<00:01:21.259> slow<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:21.649> again

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
existing makeup go really slow and again

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.279 
existing makeup go really slow and again
very<00:01:22.130> thin<00:01:22.310> coats<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.840> then<00:01:23.990> you'll<00:01:24.109> want<00:01:24.259> to

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
very thin coats and then you'll want to

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.219 
very thin coats and then you'll want to
blend<00:01:24.469> that<00:01:24.649> in<00:01:24.770> again

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
blend that in again

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.950 
blend that in again
and<00:01:26.380> then<00:01:26.500> for<00:01:26.649> us<00:01:26.710> we<00:01:26.890> did<00:01:27.070> three<00:01:27.250> coats<00:01:27.960> there

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
and then for us we did three coats there

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.730 
and then for us we did three coats there
were<00:01:29.049> a<00:01:29.110> little<00:01:29.469> bit<00:01:29.680> thick

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.940 

it's<00:01:33.130> taking<00:01:33.460> a<00:01:33.520> long<00:01:33.640> time<00:01:33.700> to<00:01:34.030> dry<00:01:34.180> but<00:01:35.110> it

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
it's taking a long time to dry but it

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.610 
it's taking a long time to dry but it
definitely<00:01:36.730> covered<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.120> tattoo<00:01:37.540> you<00:01:38.380> really

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
definitely covered the tattoo you really

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.710 
definitely covered the tattoo you really
can't<00:01:38.800> see<00:01:38.950> it<00:01:38.980> anymore

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.850 

so<00:01:42.380> now<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.980> undercover<00:01:43.430> is<00:01:43.760> dry

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
so now that the undercover is dry

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.760 
so now that the undercover is dry
we<00:01:45.340> can<00:01:45.490> apply<00:01:45.730> the

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.580 

that'll<00:01:52.070> actually<00:01:52.189> lighten<00:01:52.759> it<00:01:52.880> up<00:01:52.970> a<00:01:53.119> bit<00:01:53.659> so

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
that'll actually lighten it up a bit so

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.560 
that'll actually lighten it up a bit so
we<00:01:54.680> apply<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:54.950> alibi<00:01:55.369> powder<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:55.909> it's

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
we apply the alibi powder and it's

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.120 
we apply the alibi powder and it's
so<00:01:57.900> now<00:01:58.080> she's<00:01:58.350> gonna<00:01:58.470> go<00:01:58.710> over<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.979> with<00:01:59.100> some

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
so now she's gonna go over it with some

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.969 
so now she's gonna go over it with some
of<00:01:59.400> her<00:01:59.520> home<00:01:59.700> powder

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
of her home powder

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.459 
of her home powder
paler<00:02:02.789> we're<00:02:03.630> using<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.020> light<00:02:04.200> color<00:02:04.409> here

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
paler we're using the light color here

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.010 
paler we're using the light color here
again

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
again

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.710 
again
but<00:02:05.409> it's<00:02:05.650> it's<00:02:06.100> a<00:02:06.220> little<00:02:06.340> bit<00:02:06.460> red<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.420> the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
but it's it's a little bit red the the

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.969 
but it's it's a little bit red the the
shade<00:02:07.960> is<00:02:08.080> right<00:02:08.259> but<00:02:08.349> the<00:02:08.440> pigment<00:02:08.739> is<00:02:08.830> off

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
shade is right but the pigment is off

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.080 
shade is right but the pigment is off
you<00:02:09.130> can<00:02:09.160> see<00:02:09.369> it's<00:02:09.489> starting<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.789> lighten<00:02:10.000> up

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
you can see it's starting to lighten up

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.940 
you can see it's starting to lighten up
a<00:02:10.209> little<00:02:10.239> bit

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
a little bit

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.940 
a little bit
and<00:02:11.099> look<00:02:11.280> let's<00:02:11.430> read

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.740 

so<00:02:14.950> we<00:02:15.040> did<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.280> again<00:02:15.730> we<00:02:15.879> use<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.360> medium

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
so we did it again we use the medium

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.170 
so we did it again we use the medium
light<00:02:16.930> this<00:02:17.110> time<00:02:17.349> which<00:02:18.010> is<00:02:18.190> darker<00:02:18.790> but<00:02:19.060> it's

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
light this time which is darker but it's

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.229 
light this time which is darker but it's
it's<00:02:19.480> less<00:02:19.690> red<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.489> actually<00:02:21.819> blends<00:02:22.120> in

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
it's less red so it actually blends in

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.410 
it's less red so it actually blends in
with<00:02:22.299> her<00:02:22.420> skin<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.720> lot<00:02:22.900> better<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:24.370> this<00:02:25.269> only

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
with her skin a lot better and this only

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.030 
with her skin a lot better and this only
took<00:02:25.629> about<00:02:25.690> an<00:02:26.019> hour<00:02:26.049> and<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.230> half<00:02:26.409> to<00:02:26.799> dry

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
took about an hour and a half to dry

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.520 
took about an hour and a half to dry
because<00:02:27.819> we<00:02:28.150> use<00:02:28.299> much<00:02:28.659> thinner<00:02:28.930> coats<00:02:29.230> and

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
because we use much thinner coats and

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.100 
because we use much thinner coats and
like<00:02:30.069> I<00:02:30.160> said<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.580> covered<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:31.060> lot<00:02:31.209> better<00:02:31.420> with

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
like I said it covered a lot better with

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.170 
like I said it covered a lot better with
the<00:02:32.140> darker<00:02:32.470> color<00:02:32.580> okay<00:02:33.580> so<00:02:33.670> here<00:02:33.940> it<00:02:34.030> is<00:02:34.150> a

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
the darker color okay so here it is a

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.910 
the darker color okay so here it is a
few<00:02:34.450> hours<00:02:34.540> later<00:02:34.840> it's<00:02:35.200> been<00:02:35.349> about<00:02:35.530> four<00:02:35.799> or

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
few hours later it's been about four or

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.369 
few hours later it's been about four or
five<00:02:36.069> hours<00:02:36.459> since<00:02:36.730> we've<00:02:36.910> applied<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:37.379> we

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
five hours since we've applied it we

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:39.900 
five hours since we've applied it we
haven't<00:02:38.530> touched<00:02:38.709> it<00:02:38.860> up<00:02:38.980> at<00:02:39.099> all<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.459> as<00:02:39.790> you

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
haven't touched it up at all and as you

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.550 
haven't touched it up at all and as you
can<00:02:40.000> see<00:02:40.150> it's<00:02:40.299> still<00:02:40.720> covering<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.230> tattoo

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
can see it's still covering the tattoo

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.710 
can see it's still covering the tattoo
it<00:02:41.769> hasn't<00:02:42.040> rubbed<00:02:42.220> off<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:43.480> this<00:02:43.599> is

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
it hasn't rubbed off so this is

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.509 
it hasn't rubbed off so this is
definitely<00:02:43.840> get<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.230> through<00:02:44.379> an<00:02:44.440> event<00:02:44.680> if

definitely get you through an event if

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.039 
definitely get you through an event if
you<00:02:45.579> had<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.940> wear<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.120> for<00:02:46.299> a<00:02:46.329> really<00:02:46.480> long<00:02:46.599> day

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
you had to wear it for a really long day

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.650 
you had to wear it for a really long day
