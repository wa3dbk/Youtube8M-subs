00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
hoping is cliche a few times and all

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.370 
hoping is cliche a few times and all
just<00:01:41.790> absolutely<00:01:42.329> blitzing<00:01:42.899> him<00:01:43.049> with<00:01:43.170> pace

they can't get near him like people just
don't<00:01:45.750> want<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.170> because<00:01:46.530> he<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.189> just<00:01:47.220> so

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
don't want to do because he is just so

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.639 
don't want to do because he is just so
fast<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.119> what<00:01:48.270> helps<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:49.020> his

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
fast and what helps of that is his

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.770 
fast and what helps of that is his
really<00:01:50.130> low<00:01:50.399> sort<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.820> center<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.240> gravity<00:01:51.630> he

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
really low sort of center of gravity he

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.450 
really low sort of center of gravity he
turns<00:01:51.990> really<00:01:52.259> quickly<00:01:52.619> his<00:01:52.740> agility<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.280> good

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
turns really quickly his agility is good

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.190 
turns really quickly his agility is good
so<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.030> think<00:01:54.119> he's<00:01:54.329> going<00:01:54.479> one<00:01:54.750> way<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.930> then

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
so you think he's going one way and then

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.719 
so you think he's going one way and then
you<00:01:55.320> turn<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.100> can't<00:01:56.280> react<00:01:56.549> quick

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
you turn and you just can't react quick

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.060 
you turn and you just can't react quick
enough<00:01:57.000> like<00:01:57.479> just<00:01:57.509> cuz<00:01:57.960> he's<00:01:58.170> too<00:01:58.409> fast<00:01:58.740> for

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
enough like just cuz he's too fast for

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.069 
enough like just cuz he's too fast for
you<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.340> he<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.640> just<00:01:59.670> gonna<00:02:00.000> score<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.960> know
