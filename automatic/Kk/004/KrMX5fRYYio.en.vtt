 today he did I cut 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.330
 unimportant even that really times 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.679
 You can not look shit 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.540
 switch and that's what we want a whole 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.519
 located round and play 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.199
 we quicks because there is also why 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.210
 back to the war my liver pump 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.560
 we're playing prequels again 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.140
 nothing else came to my mind 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.100
 and that's why I'm going to see you now 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.260
 to write him in the comments 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.279
 what you want to see in the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.359
 next episode we write that 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.640
 Definitely in the comments 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.829
 and now would say that's mine 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.719
 Hairstyle still looks exactly the same as 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.000
 not so bad then again and all 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.379
 I hope something good about crate and 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.930
 the helmet of a box I'm fine so and so 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.449
 I do not want that without him of course 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.160
 As you can see in the skill round I am 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.809
 always extremely quiet because I have to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.030
 Just stop sometimes 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.640
 concentrate milk sugar that gives way 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.680
 set up so if someone says that 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.359
 Concentrated on I actually look 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.150
 rather five am not at the second 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.580
 has not even imagine so at the Sun 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.560
 that no I want to I want to 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.080
 because it hits better and then leads 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.670
 me and fishing I love the other day 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.619

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:25.560
 I'm not there I'm not me at all 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:27.060
 with the pdf a ha is supposed to be in hand 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.460
 but subscribed or something you behind 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.130
 translate something in the way I hope 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.590
 not good i have the diakonie 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.270
 said so and now I have yes and 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.939
 Now I can not put on loose shows 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.140
 and wait people what do I do the game 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.549
 to the 2 and what can not I 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.350
 hide that a bit of rain 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.090
 can and / or eat eat first eat 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.090
 and the colleague here is none 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.270
 if he should now we should have him 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.790
 she wants the colleagues as it wants 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.270
 with rock fall again so and that starting from 3 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.560
 and now still attract so and now 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.240
 looking here so we refer to everyone 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.010
 The arrows are all easy too 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.930
 Of course , so now let's see if 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.620
 we can win those dogs oh my 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.910
 God I'm a bit 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.740
 I must always have arrived 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.510
 this skill around when I am so I am 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.050
 adrenaline mode if I already have one 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.510
 a bit off the ground, that has something for 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.840
 armor what did the prince and I have 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.970
 lost 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.400
 either he is me now no spam 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.400
 Of course he will of course try 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.180
 what am I doing too? 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.980
 I will lose my headlessly godless 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:10.659
 I already have your partner in the bunch 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.659
 like 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.870
 this does not fly down this is 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.870
 a bit of a pity is wrong 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.180
 I would not have thought it now 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.430
 I really did not think so now though 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.130
 to see the place in this place says 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.790
 us then all enjoy without back up 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.070
 just as slowly back to the 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.420
 wonderful map that two and me 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.610
 really this fair is one of mine 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.710
 favorite maps but this spawn is 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.750
 Real shit continued here is easy 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.810
 only this box yes and then not 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.860
 more so now we have to be comfortable 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.690
 because he may have something from us 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.030
 Does he really really have people 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.100
 so that on the once and now 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.030
 is cut shredded people 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.030
 maybe not 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.980
 Zack zack so now 110 here is the 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:23.980
 even harder 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:28.520
 once, in any case, got fit 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:31.970
 this lady was not as good must 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.140
 but of course she has the angel 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.610
 used 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.540
 why am I not that way ? 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.980
 but at this point I still want 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.650
 Although people ask something 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.990
 power yes sometime or you have bock 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.910
 So that I kind of want more, the whole 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.500
 normal let's play makes a difference 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.850
 not so much of course 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.310
 I will be one or the other 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.330
 Funny 10 reinsch because I love 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.330
 that's a bit of my videos 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.760
 funnier to produce because I want to 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.700
 really that every one of my videos is for 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.760
 know entertaining is yes if it is then 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:08.000
 It is finally not sure if I am 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.600
 hope at least a and o 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.490
 now he always thinks behind me 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.479
 stand 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.479
 why went to the best song 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:24.940
 We only have that when says so and 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:29.160
 now we are well equipped now 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:32.650
 for the final of the match and discos first 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.390
 and in bright 100 is done and that 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.350
 best is what were I could yes 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.900
 think the helmet makes no difference 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.750
 How to be sure of the helmet or shoes 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.650
 I believe you help but know 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.650
 her too 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:51.670
 that means that everything started 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:55.510
 mannomann people what am I going to have something 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:57.810
 I would have said a pilot for this 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.810
 got 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.030
 Now I said no I have 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.660
 I still do that more often 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.140
 so have we got now 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.440
 won 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.190
 still a loks okay that seems to me good 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.600
 to be 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:16.240
 I still take the praise helen 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.010
 at least an earthy man, I believe 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.710
 at least if not then I would 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:23.920
 but now say again or was that 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:26.009
 opponent or that was an enemy ok 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:35.009
 I believe the king because 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:36.589
 well he does not look so bad 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:39.589
 I do not have city ​​right now 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:39.589
 released 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:50.650
 and now the server is calling for the now 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:52.990
 four weeks running like me the people like that 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.300
 really annoyed so right 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:58.030
 probably as their imagine I would 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.160
 say that's been it's one 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.830
 has a shorter video bit today 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.260
 say it's a bit later 22 22 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.550
 best time to record online video and 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.520
 I just wanted to be here 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:12.130
 ask again you really want more 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.920
 see such skill rounds made live 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:17.020
 then in any case that writes me in 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.390
 the pants or load do not become positive 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.160
 and lay in the end also do and what should 

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.300
 I still say write the comments 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.310
 what i will do next year if this 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.920
 skill should do rounds and higher so 

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.090
 it is not then but then 

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.220
 just a little something different 

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.500
 thinks cinemas else works 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.180
 but I have not done now and yes 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.460

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:41.940
 positive case I said but jolo 

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.940
