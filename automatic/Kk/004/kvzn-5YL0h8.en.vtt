 whatever you do if it's me 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.480
 let's go there with the veal 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.840

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:13.130

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.239
 important that you take the food and what 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.440
 first thing we have to do is go to 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.510
 the back where usually 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.850
 find the nutritional values ​​and 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.550
 pay attention for each pancake 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.580
 carbohydrate care 19 with 3 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.860
 are worth of which of the sugars very 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.789
 1.4 and the 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.949
 two with two and stands one with one is the 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.349

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.030
 of our training 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:49.139
 these are pancakes from a house 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.050
 supermarkets well known here in 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:54.870
 Spain and this will only be worth the tone is 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.219
 perfect little golden how rich what does it look 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.039
 has and how it smells 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:01.590
 I'm going to pay and we can both 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:05.159
 two vitroceramics and travel with 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:10.259
 veal tomato tomato fried natural 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:12.930
 look there this all not soon 150 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:15.210
 200 grams at least a little here already 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.490
 with the floor turned off because the heat 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.169
 that emanates from the flesh and from the process 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.159
 is going to heat it is not 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.529
 recommended that it be very hot 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:25.310
 because the food I got too hot did not 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:27.440
 like is perfect is already 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.130
 and now it's going to go directly to the 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.140
 first wheat pancake I remember very 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.540
 important that before serving 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.690
 pancakes you have to heat them in the 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:41.520
 microwave for about 10 20 seconds 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.800
 so let's go 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.620
 here the performance of our first 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.979
 tortilla 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.720
 perfect our wheat roll 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.850
 we have the first and now to 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.440
 then we go with the second and 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.680
 I remember that this is chicken breast 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.919
 with pepper and onion and this is going to 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:04.130
 accompany a handful of nuts the 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:06.680
 Basic nutrients to gain mass 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.419
 Very much needed muscle is the mixture 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.010
 perfect and it is a highly recommended dish 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.760
 that I'm consuming for a long time 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.760
 and finally 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:20.550
 pancake roll 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:24.090
 of turkey breast with pasteurized cheese 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:26.100
 0% fatty fat because you already have 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:29.730
 healthy fats come from part of 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.310
 the nuts also from the pancake and part 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:35.300
 of the veal 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:37.460
 so in this case protein accompanies 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.340
 always this kind of food I tell you 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.680
