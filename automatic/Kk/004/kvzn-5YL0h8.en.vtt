 you can find in www.cis.es and os 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.690
 I explain quickly why it is so 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.670

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.800
 dish if what we are looking for is a body 10 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.650
 because it is a low calorie oil

 rich in vitamins without fats reduces the 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.340
 cholesterol level reduces the 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.070
 possibility of thrombosis protects against

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.000
 intestinal benefits bone growth 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.770
 prevents the aging of 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.750
 tissues and also the organs in 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.970
 general its main ingredients are 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.680
 soybean extra virgin olive oil 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.019
 transgenic vitamin e and propellant gas 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.090
 and you will also have up to 200 portions 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.439
 which are very many right now 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.299
 then why are we going to start 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.879
 cooking and this fantastic dish for 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.739
 gain muscle mass are you going to see how 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.650
 I have done because we are going to throw the veal 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.019
 to be doing and also the chicken and 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.269
 Onion and pepper set very well 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.329
 It's that easy because thanks to this 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.840

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:51.650

 with that enough 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.940
 that's just ceramic that you 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.860
 I recommend because that will prevent 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.480
 whatever you do if it's me 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.480
 let's go there with the veal 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.840
 we are going to wait for it to last little 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:13.130
 to little when I take a brown spot 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:16.530
 will be ready and we can season it with 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.290
 pepper oregano any rib and 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.019
 now then the breast of 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.440
 chicken the pepper and I'm going to also 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.440
 we will be 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.030
 we will both have to wait for it to be 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.040
 hot we are going to lower a bit the 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.740
 fires I had the pans heating up 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.730
 at the beginning a time for the 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.280
 food nothing more 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.400
 talk is done we leave it at 5 during 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:45.030
 It's very important that you go for a while 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.980
 as you are watching with turns moving the 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.200
 food in this case the beef that already 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.080
 You have seen how it is acquiring a tone 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.350
 brown cited let's let it go 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.020
 making it build a little bit more 8 and 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.110
 it's also at level 8 and meanwhile 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.850
 that's very important of the pancakes 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.380
 see them you can find them in any 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.900
 site are wheat tortillas very 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.610
 recommendable because attention for each 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.560
 pancake as it comes here in the tab 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.990
 nutritional where you're going to do 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.900
 your purchases I always insist very 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.239
 important that you take the food and what 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.440
 first thing we have to do is go to 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.510
 the back where usually 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.850
 find the nutritional values â€‹â€‹and 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.550
 pay attention for each pancake 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.580
 carbohydrate care 19 with 3 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.860
 are worth of which of the sugars very 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.789
 1.4 and the 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.949
 two with two and stands one with one is the 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.349
 perfect ratio to get a 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.509
 body 10 on all that in phase of 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.610
 volume to gain muscle mass of two 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.689
 to three hours remember this dish before 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.030
 of our training 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:49.139
 these are pancakes from a house 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.050
 supermarkets well known here in 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:54.870
 Spain and this will only be worth the tone is 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.219
 perfect little golden how rich what does it look 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.039
 has and how it smells 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:01.590
 I'm going to pay and we can both 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:05.159
 two vitroceramics and travel with 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:10.259
 veal tomato tomato fried natural 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:12.930
 look there this all not soon 150 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:15.210
 200 grams at least a little here already 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.490
 with the floor turned off because the heat 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.169
 that emanates from the flesh and from the process 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.159
 is going to heat it is not 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.529
 recommended that it be very hot 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:25.310
 because the food I got too hot did not 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:27.440
 like is perfect is already 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.130
 and now it's going to go directly to the 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.140
 first wheat pancake I remember very 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.540
 important that before serving 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.690
 pancakes you have to heat them in the 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:41.520
 microwave for about 10 20 seconds 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.800
 so let's go 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.620
 here the performance of our first 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.979
 tortilla 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.720
 perfect our wheat roll 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.850
 we have the first and now to 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.440
 then we go with the second and 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.680
 I remember that this is chicken breast 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.919
 with pepper and onion and this is going to 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:04.130
 accompany a handful of nuts the 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:06.680
 Basic nutrients to gain mass 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.419
 Very much needed muscle is the mixture 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.010
 perfect and it is a highly recommended dish 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.760
 that I'm consuming for a long time 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.760
 and finally 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:20.550
 pancake roll 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:24.090
 of turkey breast with pasteurized cheese 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:26.100
 0% fatty fat because you already have 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:29.730
 healthy fats come from part of 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.310
 the nuts also from the pancake and part 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:35.300
 of the veal 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:37.460
 so in this case protein accompanies 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.340
 always this kind of food I tell you 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.680

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.410

 but mostly to gain muscle mass 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.330
 facing a volume phase or when 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.310
 you are fully in a volume phase 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.020

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.210
