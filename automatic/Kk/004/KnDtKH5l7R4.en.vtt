00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.490 

the<00:00:00.269> role<00:00:00.450> of<00:00:00.480> thirds<00:00:00.840> is<00:00:01.020> probably<00:00:01.350> the

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
the role of thirds is probably the

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.320 
the role of thirds is probably the
fundamental<00:00:02.159> building<00:00:02.340> block<00:00:02.760> of<00:00:02.790> all<00:00:03.030> of<00:00:03.210> the

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
fundamental building block of all of the

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.809 
fundamental building block of all of the
rules<00:00:03.510> of<00:00:03.720> composition<00:00:04.160> what<00:00:05.160> you<00:00:05.279> do<00:00:05.490> is<00:00:05.700> you

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
rules of composition what you do is you

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.210 
rules of composition what you do is you
draw<00:00:06.029> two<00:00:06.170> imaginary<00:00:07.170> vertical<00:00:07.379> lines<00:00:07.950> on

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
draw two imaginary vertical lines on

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.730 
draw two imaginary vertical lines on
your<00:00:08.280> image<00:00:08.940> equally<00:00:09.450> spaced<00:00:09.719> apart<00:00:10.080> that's

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
your image equally spaced apart that's

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.680 
your image equally spaced apart that's
dividing<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.280> into<00:00:11.519> one<00:00:11.700> two<00:00:11.940> three<00:00:12.210> sections

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
dividing it into one two three sections

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.379 
dividing it into one two three sections
two<00:00:13.590> more<00:00:13.830> horizontal<00:00:14.460> lines<00:00:14.670> equally<00:00:15.120> spaced

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
two more horizontal lines equally spaced

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.849 
two more horizontal lines equally spaced
apart<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.139> have<00:00:16.289> one<00:00:16.529> two<00:00:16.830> three

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
apart and you have one two three

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.000 
apart and you have one two three
sections<00:00:17.789> by<00:00:18.660> placing<00:00:19.140> points<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.590> interest

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
sections by placing points of interest

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.340 
sections by placing points of interest
or<00:00:20.189> your<00:00:20.340> subject<00:00:20.820> along<00:00:21.570> or<00:00:21.810> near<00:00:22.080> those

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
or your subject along or near those

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.290 
or your subject along or near those
lines<00:00:22.769> particularly<00:00:23.730> where<00:00:23.880> they<00:00:24.000> cross

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
lines particularly where they cross

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.480 
lines particularly where they cross
where<00:00:24.570> they<00:00:24.689> meet<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.680> will<00:00:25.830> get<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> much<00:00:26.279> more

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
where they meet you will get a much more

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.849 
where they meet you will get a much more
pleasing<00:00:26.760> composition<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:28.230> how<00:00:28.380> do<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:28.590> use

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
pleasing composition so how do we use

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.730 
pleasing composition so how do we use
this<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.279> reality<00:00:29.900> I've<00:00:30.900> got<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.140> windmill<00:00:31.470> over

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
this in reality I've got a windmill over

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.709 
this in reality I've got a windmill over
here<00:00:31.890> which<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.160> prepared<00:00:32.579> earlier<00:00:34.550> now<00:00:35.550> if<00:00:36.540> we

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
here which I prepared earlier now if we

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.110 
here which I prepared earlier now if we
put<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.050> windmill<00:00:37.500> smack<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.730> middle<00:00:38.910> of

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
put this windmill smack in the middle of

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.940 
put this windmill smack in the middle of
the<00:00:39.239> frame<00:00:39.510> yeah<00:00:40.290> it's<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.559> kind<00:00:40.800> of

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
the frame yeah it's a kind of

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.650 
the frame yeah it's a kind of
interesting<00:00:41.250> shot<00:00:41.790> because<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.300> windmill

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
interesting shot because it's a windmill

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.569 
interesting shot because it's a windmill
on<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.840> nice<00:00:43.050> day<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:43.829> let<00:00:43.950> me<00:00:44.010> just<00:00:44.219> step<00:00:44.370> out

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
on a nice day but let me just step out

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.630 
on a nice day but let me just step out
of<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.760> picture<00:00:45.770> just<00:00:46.770> contemplate<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.579> for

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
of the picture just contemplate that for

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.080 
of the picture just contemplate that for
a<00:00:47.879> moment<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:49.289> okay<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.640> pleasing

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
a moment it's okay but is it a pleasing

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.639 
a moment it's okay but is it a pleasing
composition<00:00:51.449> would<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.989> think<00:00:52.170> that's<00:00:52.410> great

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
composition would you think that's great

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.600 
composition would you think that's great
I<00:00:52.710> want<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.280> my<00:00:53.460> wall<00:00:54.320> possibly<00:00:55.320> not<00:00:55.610> so

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
I want that on my wall possibly not so

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.400 
I want that on my wall possibly not so
what<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:56.969> do<00:00:57.239> we<00:00:57.690> need<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.960> move<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
what do we do we need to move the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.049 
what do we do we need to move the
windmill<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> different<00:00:59.520> place<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.760> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
windmill to a different place in the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.430 
windmill to a different place in the
picture<00:01:00.390> now<00:01:00.480> obviously<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.840> can't<00:01:01.140> pick<00:01:01.320> up

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
picture now obviously I can't pick up

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.439 
picture now obviously I can't pick up
the<00:01:01.559> windmill<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.129> move<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:03.059> all<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.329> got

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the windmill and move it so all you got

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.179 
the windmill and move it so all you got
to<00:01:03.570> do<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.930> change<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.619> direction<00:01:04.739> your

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
to do is change the direction your

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.789 
to do is change the direction your
cameras<00:01:05.640> pointing<00:01:06.240> I've<00:01:07.170> got<00:01:07.380> an<00:01:07.439> imaginary

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
cameras pointing I've got an imaginary

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.260 
cameras pointing I've got an imaginary
rope<00:01:08.040> attached<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> front<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.119> video

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
rope attached to the front of the video

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.390 
rope attached to the front of the video
camera<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.110> I'm<00:01:10.439> going<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.590> pull<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.100> camera

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
camera and I'm going to pull the camera

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.120 
camera and I'm going to pull the camera
over<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:12.030> way<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.750> place<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.500> windmill<00:01:14.010> on

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
over this way to place the windmill on

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.070 
over this way to place the windmill on
the<00:01:14.220> vertical<00:01:14.970> third<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> left-hand<00:01:15.960> side

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
the vertical third on the left-hand side

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.490 
the vertical third on the left-hand side
so<00:01:16.710> let's<00:01:16.890> come<00:01:17.130> over<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.520> way<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> bit<00:01:18.500> there

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
so let's come over this way a bit there

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.200 
so let's come over this way a bit there
we<00:01:19.710> go<00:01:19.890> as<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.070> ease<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.490> over<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:20.939> looking

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
we go as we ease it over it's looking

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.960 
we go as we ease it over it's looking
better<00:01:21.390> already<00:01:22.250> right<00:01:23.250> now<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.610> got<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
better already right now we got the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.090 
better already right now we got the
windmill<00:01:24.360> sat<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.960> vertical<00:01:25.590> third<00:01:25.799> on

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
windmill sat on the vertical third on

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.130 
windmill sat on the vertical third on
the<00:01:26.220> left-hand<00:01:26.820> side<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.299> picture<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the left-hand side of the picture the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.560 
the left-hand side of the picture the
gap<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.430> left-hand<00:01:30.000> side<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.360> picture

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
gap on the left-hand side of the picture

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.039 
gap on the left-hand side of the picture
is<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.470> third<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.220> way<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.840> but<00:01:33.840> it's

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
is a third of the way in but it's

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.510 
is a third of the way in but it's
probably<00:01:34.290> sitting<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.770> little<00:01:34.950> bit<00:01:35.130> high<00:01:35.490> in

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
probably sitting a little bit high in

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.999 
probably sitting a little bit high in
the<00:01:35.909> frame<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.750> what<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.049> now<00:01:37.229> need<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.500> do<00:01:37.799> is

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
the frame so what we now need to do is

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.249 
the frame so what we now need to do is
to<00:01:38.400> make<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.700> windmill<00:01:39.090> go<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> bit<00:01:39.630> lower<00:01:39.900> and

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
to make the windmill go a bit lower and

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.469 
to make the windmill go a bit lower and
we<00:01:40.439> do<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.890> by<00:01:41.310> tilting<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> front<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
we do that by tilting the front of the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.800 
we do that by tilting the front of the
camera<00:01:42.720> up<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.710> bit<00:01:44.180> that's<00:01:45.180> also<00:01:45.600> going<00:01:45.750> to

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
camera up a bit that's also going to

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.429 
camera up a bit that's also going to
place<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.350> Bank<00:01:46.979> along<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.579> bottom<00:01:47.850> third

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
place that Bank along the bottom third

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.230 
place that Bank along the bottom third
so<00:01:49.439> your<00:01:49.619> windmill<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.189> sitting<00:01:50.520> nicely<00:01:50.790> in

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
so your windmill is sitting nicely in

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.870 
so your windmill is sitting nicely in
the<00:01:51.750> crook<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.560> vertical<00:01:53.070> third<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.729> a

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the crook of a vertical third and a

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.700 
the crook of a vertical third and a
horizontal<00:01:54.240> third<00:01:54.869> let<00:01:55.320> me<00:01:55.409> get<00:01:55.530> out<00:01:55.619> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
horizontal third let me get out the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.319 
horizontal third let me get out the
picture<00:01:56.040> again<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> look

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.209 

that<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.390> considerably<00:02:01.110> better<00:02:01.320> than<00:02:01.530> putting

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
that is considerably better than putting

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.530 
that is considerably better than putting
it<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.579> middle<00:02:02.700> let's<00:02:03.060> just<00:02:03.210> pop<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.509> back

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
it in the middle let's just pop it back

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.039 
it in the middle let's just pop it back
in<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.930> middle<00:02:04.020> again<00:02:05.600> so<00:02:06.600> we're<00:02:06.750> going<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.930> go

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
in the middle again so we're going to go

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.889 
in the middle again so we're going to go
down<00:02:07.489> and<00:02:08.489> we're<00:02:09.119> going<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.270> go<00:02:09.390> left

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
down and we're going to go left

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.020 
down and we're going to go left
with<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.739> camera<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.459> which<00:02:11.700> has<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
with the camera that is which has the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.910 
with the camera that is which has the
opposite<00:02:12.420> effect<00:02:12.750> on<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.989> subject

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
opposite effect on the subject

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.410 
opposite effect on the subject
it's<00:02:14.100> not<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.370> interesting<00:02:14.940> let's<00:02:15.150> go<00:02:15.240> back

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
it's not that interesting let's go back

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.360 
it's not that interesting let's go back
to<00:02:15.569> something<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.900> bit<00:02:15.930> nicer<00:02:16.530> back<00:02:17.010> onto<00:02:17.250> that

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
to something a bit nicer back onto that

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.340 
to something a bit nicer back onto that
rule<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.819> thirds<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:21.480> we're<00:02:21.660> doing<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:22.080> with

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
rule of thirds and we're doing this with

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.380 
rule of thirds and we're doing this with
the<00:02:22.530> video<00:02:22.800> camera<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.209> see

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
the video camera so that you can see

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.270 
the video camera so that you can see
it's<00:02:24.540> just<00:02:24.569> moving<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.500> camera<00:02:25.800> that's<00:02:26.069> all

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
it's just moving the camera that's all

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.809 
it's just moving the camera that's all
you<00:02:26.520> have<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.970> do<00:02:27.830> now<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:28.890> can<00:02:29.069> apply<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.459> to

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
you have to do now you can apply this to

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.670 
you have to do now you can apply this to
anything<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:30.540> doesn't<00:02:30.959> just<00:02:31.140> have<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.350> be<00:02:31.500> in

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
anything it doesn't just have to be in

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.860
