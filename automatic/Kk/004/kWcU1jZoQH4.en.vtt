00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
packaging so let's hose it this up and

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.270 
packaging so let's hose it this up and
set<00:02:07.159> this<00:02:07.280> aside

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
set this aside

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.850 
set this aside
here's<00:02:10.280> our<00:02:10.489> field<00:02:10.789> so<00:02:11.590> should<00:02:12.590> be<00:02:12.680> able<00:02:12.739> to

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
here's our field so should be able to

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.270 
here's our field so should be able to
take<00:02:13.069> this<00:02:13.340> off<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:15.560> should<00:02:15.860> be<00:02:16.010> a

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
take this off and that should be a

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.640 
take this off and that should be a
shield<00:02:16.730> force<00:02:18.670> set<00:02:19.670> aside<00:02:20.260> so<00:02:21.260> here's<00:02:21.470> the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
shield force set aside so here's the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.930 
shield force set aside so here's the
Nvidia<00:02:22.010> shield<00:02:22.510> it's<00:02:23.510> got<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:24.489> 5-inch<00:02:25.489> display

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
Nvidia shield it's got a 5-inch display

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.490 
Nvidia shield it's got a 5-inch display
something<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:26.660> envision<00:02:26.900> we<00:02:27.170> could<00:02:27.349> take<00:02:27.470> a

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
something to envision we could take a

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.229 
something to envision we could take a
look<00:02:27.620> at<00:02:27.709> that<00:02:27.860> but<00:02:28.069> pretty<00:02:28.640> much<00:02:28.700> it's<00:02:28.940> built

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
look at that but pretty much it's built

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.470 
look at that but pretty much it's built
like<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:30.160> controller<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.340> feels<00:02:31.670> actually<00:02:32.030> like

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
like a controller it feels actually like

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.199 
like a controller it feels actually like
an<00:02:32.599> Xbox<00:02:32.780> controller<00:02:33.280> with<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.550> portable

with<00:06:11.710> your<00:06:11.950> shield<00:06:12.250> and<00:06:12.550> you<00:06:12.610> can<00:06:12.729> actually

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
with your shield and you can actually

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.909 
with your shield and you can actually
play<00:06:13.090> it<00:06:13.300> over<00:06:13.599> Wi-Fi<00:06:13.780> so<00:06:14.590> you<00:06:14.650> don't<00:06:14.770> have<00:06:14.830> to

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
play it over Wi-Fi so you don't have to

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:16.350 
play it over Wi-Fi so you don't have to
be<00:06:15.039> in<00:06:15.099> front<00:06:15.310> of<00:06:15.370> your<00:06:15.460> PC<00:06:15.669> so<00:06:15.910> we'll<00:06:16.090> see<00:06:16.210> how

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
be in front of your PC so we'll see how

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.860 
be in front of your PC so we'll see how
all<00:06:16.660> that<00:06:16.840> works<00:06:17.139> and<00:06:17.760> it<00:06:18.760> goes<00:06:19.090> all<00:06:19.479> together

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
all that works and it goes all together

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.360 
all that works and it goes all together
but<00:06:20.169> we'll<00:06:20.530> head<00:06:20.650> back<00:06:20.680> to<00:06:20.800> the<00:06:20.979> home<00:06:21.130> screen

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
but we'll head back to the home screen

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.750 
but we'll head back to the home screen
so<00:06:21.880> it's<00:06:22.060> a<00:06:22.090> traditional<00:06:22.660> Android<00:06:23.020> feel<00:06:23.760> no

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
so it's a traditional Android feel no

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.060 
so it's a traditional Android feel no
word<00:06:24.970> on<00:06:25.150> capabilities<00:06:25.810> of<00:06:25.990> using<00:06:26.410> voice<00:06:26.889> I

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
word on capabilities of using voice I

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.610 
word on capabilities of using voice I
don't<00:06:27.250> think<00:06:27.370> it<00:06:27.430> has<00:06:27.580> that<00:06:27.820> but<00:06:28.510> feels<00:06:29.380> like<00:06:29.500> a

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
don't think it has that but feels like a

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.500 
don't think it has that but feels like a
controller<00:06:30.160> feels<00:06:30.550> like<00:06:30.760> a<00:06:30.940> gaming

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
controller feels like a gaming

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.750
