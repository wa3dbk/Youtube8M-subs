00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
shipped prototype 2 so I don't think

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.240 
shipped prototype 2 so I don't think
normal<00:02:11.989> prototype<00:02:12.440> will<00:02:12.590> be<00:02:12.620> done

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
normal prototype will be done

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.780 
normal prototype will be done
I<00:02:13.280> know<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:13.850> kind<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.570> sucks<00:02:14.930> but<00:02:15.549> maybe<00:02:16.549> in<00:02:16.760> the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
I know it kind of sucks but maybe in the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.100 
I know it kind of sucks but maybe in the
future<00:02:16.880> we'll<00:02:17.510> get<00:02:17.750> more<00:02:17.959> prototyping<00:02:18.549> but

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
future we'll get more prototyping but

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.150 
future we'll get more prototyping but
anyways<00:02:21.110> what<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.380> really<00:02:21.620> want<00:02:21.799> to<00:02:21.860> talk<00:02:22.040> about

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160
