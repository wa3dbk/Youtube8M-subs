00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
drag at first thing I thought they meant

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.220

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
tap what they called the puck and then

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.199 
tap what they called the puck and then
release<00:02:27.230> then<00:02:27.560> immediately<00:02:27.920> slide<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:29.000> puck

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
release then immediately slide the puck

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.720 
release then immediately slide the puck
to<00:02:29.239> get<00:02:29.690> an<00:02:29.810> effect<00:02:30.310> it's<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.430> very

to get an effect it's a very

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849

out<00:03:56.909> of<00:03:58.340> what's<00:03:59.340> on<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.579> screen<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:01.459> another

here<00:04:09.510> also<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:14.629> think<00:04:15.629> that<00:04:17.120> that<00:04:18.120> helps

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
here also I think that that helps

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.550 
here also I think that that helps

highlight what they want you to look at

highlight what they want you to look at

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
in what would otherwise be a very small

in what would otherwise be a very small

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
screen capture and then they also show

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.330 
screen capture and then they also show
magnified<00:04:30.419> changed<00:04:31.110> views<00:04:31.530> which<00:04:31.949> you<00:04:32.130> can

magnified changed views which you can

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:39.550 
magnified changed views which you can
see<00:04:32.699> an<00:04:32.970> example<00:04:33.120> of<00:04:33.919> here<00:04:35.570> so<00:04:36.740> in<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:38.190> app<00:04:38.520> the

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
see an example of here so in the app the

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.379 
see an example of here so in the app the
image<00:04:40.560> on<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:41.010> screen<00:04:41.190> will<00:04:41.550> change<00:04:41.909> and<00:04:42.180> they

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
image on the screen will change and they

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:49.149 
image on the screen will change and they
show<00:04:42.750> a<00:04:43.110> sequence<00:04:43.800> of<00:04:44.659> motion<00:04:45.659> for<00:04:45.960> that<00:04:45.990> I

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:49.159 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:53.360 

think<00:04:50.159> it<00:04:50.310> was<00:04:50.550> a<00:04:51.409> good<00:04:52.409> decision<00:04:52.889> to<00:04:53.099> use

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
think it was a good decision to use

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.680 
think it was a good decision to use
icons<00:04:54.060> as<00:04:54.479> the<00:04:55.289> object<00:04:56.159> noun<00:04:56.430> in<00:04:56.760> steps<00:04:57.210> rather

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
icons as the object noun in steps rather

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:03.820 
icons as the object noun in steps rather
than<00:04:58.139> the<00:04:58.349> icon<00:04:58.770> label<00:04:59.479> for<00:05:00.479> example<00:05:01.050> here<00:05:01.909> and

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
than the icon label for example here and

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.890 
than the icon label for example here and
here<00:05:04.830> and<00:05:04.979> they<00:05:05.159> they<00:05:06.000> do<00:05:06.060> that<00:05:06.449> throughout

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
here and they they do that throughout

here and they they do that throughout

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
enough breathing room and it works out

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:45.890 
enough breathing room and it works out
okay

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
okay

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.969 
okay

oh speaking of breathing room the

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
overall layout here uses quite a lot of

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:56.360 
overall layout here uses quite a lot of

could<00:06:01.680> have<00:06:01.889> been<00:06:02.509> exceptionally<00:06:03.509> dense<00:06:03.840> with

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639

could have been exceptionally dense with
text<00:06:05.639> and<00:06:07.190> subsequently<00:06:08.190> been<00:06:08.490> very<00:06:08.849> boring

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
text and subsequently been very boring

but<00:06:10.410> the<00:06:10.680> use<00:06:10.860> of<00:06:11.099> the<00:06:11.220> graphics<00:06:11.820> and<00:06:12.030> the

but the use of the graphics and the

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.870 
but the use of the graphics and the
layout<00:06:12.509> I<00:06:12.840> think<00:06:13.770> works<00:06:14.039> well<00:06:14.220> the<00:06:14.580> prose<00:06:14.849> is

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
layout I think works well the prose is

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.290 
layout I think works well the prose is
fairly<00:06:15.509> restrained<00:06:16.320> and<00:06:17.280> for<00:06:17.789> the<00:06:17.940> most<00:06:18.120> part

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
fairly restrained and for the most part

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.730 
fairly restrained and for the most part
the<00:06:18.840> images<00:06:19.320> can<00:06:19.889> tell<00:06:20.099> the<00:06:20.280> story<00:06:21.710> you<00:06:22.710> know

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
the images can tell the story you know

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.430 
the images can tell the story you know
all<00:06:23.010> this<00:06:23.280> being<00:06:23.699> said<00:06:24.389> about<00:06:24.720> what<00:06:24.990> I<00:06:25.020> like

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
all this being said about what I like

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.790

here<00:06:26.039> the<00:06:26.729> entire<00:06:27.030> manual<00:06:27.570> is<00:06:27.900> a<00:06:28.199> feature

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
here the entire manual is a feature

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.980 
here the entire manual is a feature
based<00:06:29.250> reference<00:06:29.940> rather<00:06:30.210> than<00:06:30.570> the<00:06:30.720> more

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
based reference rather than the more

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.070 
based reference rather than the more
progressive<00:06:31.260> user<00:06:32.010> centered<00:06:32.550> style<00:06:32.880> there<00:06:33.870> is

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
progressive user centered style there is

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.899 
progressive user centered style there is
no<00:06:34.320> task<00:06:34.620> orientation<00:06:35.370> and<00:06:35.729> that's

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:35.909 
no task orientation and that's

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:37.939 
no task orientation and that's
definitely<00:06:36.210> a<00:06:36.690> flaw<00:06:37.050> it<00:06:37.620> would<00:06:37.770> have<00:06:37.860> been

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:37.949 
definitely a flaw it would have been

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:40.010 
definitely a flaw it would have been
better<00:06:38.250> to<00:06:38.580> take<00:06:38.789> the<00:06:38.970> user<00:06:39.120> through<00:06:39.510> common

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
better to take the user through common

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.649 
better to take the user through common
scenarios<00:06:40.590> first<00:06:41.010> and<00:06:41.340> then<00:06:41.880> back<00:06:42.180> that<00:06:42.449> up

00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:42.659 
scenarios first and then back that up

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:49.249 
scenarios first and then back that up
with<00:06:42.840> the<00:06:42.990> reference<00:06:43.409> detail<00:06:47.780> well<00:06:48.780> I<00:06:49.020> hope

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 
with the reference detail well I hope

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:50.540 
with the reference detail well I hope
you're<00:06:49.440> able<00:06:49.650> to<00:06:49.680> get<00:06:49.889> some<00:06:50.220> useful

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
you're able to get some useful

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.550 
you're able to get some useful
information<00:06:51.060> out<00:06:51.539> of<00:06:51.599> that<00:06:51.780> and<00:06:52.199> good<00:06:52.530> luck

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
information out of that and good luck

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.180 
information out of that and good luck
with<00:06:52.860> all<00:06:52.979> your<00:06:53.039> projects<00:06:53.669> thank<00:06:54.030> you
