00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 very good to all welcome once 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.990
 more to the animal channel and today 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:12.059
 we will talk about little things 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.790
 which is the smallest vertebrate animal 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.119
 that exists on the surface of the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.160
 planet with vertebrate as we understand 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.020
 vertebrate animals of course 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.600
 there are smaller animals that I'm going 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.849
 to mention but they are already animals 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.550
 invertebrates we no longer go to the kingdom of 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.250
 the bacteria and we are no longer 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.040
 same on that level we are at the level 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.920
 of vertebrate animals what is the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.500
 smallest vertebrate animal that inhabits 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660
 on the surface of the planet 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.870
 some scientists claim that it is 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.700
 of a male monkfish find a male monkfish 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.680
 that he measured only 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:56.550
 0.6 millimeters 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.700
 that is practically nothing half of 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.800
 a centimeter is to say that the species in 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.720
 concrete because you have here you can see 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.330
 perfectly the image of what would be 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.229
 the male monkfish the species would be the 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.210
 photocall and Nux spinning ceps than good 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.290
 specifically the male monkfish that 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.229
 they found then they saw that it was coupled 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.290
 his life partner biting him in 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.790
 the side on the back or in the belly 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.610
 However, some scientists 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.920
 disagree that this monkfish the male monkfish 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.649
 be the smallest fish species 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.800
 simply because the female measures more 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:39.110
 seven times the male and is considered 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.110
 to the male as a kind of parasite 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:46.710
 on the other hand we find another living being 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:50.290
 another vertebrate animal that weighs only 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.620
 07 milligrams is less than a 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.380
 mosquito may in dimensions then 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.620
 do not be smaller but in weight from 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.340
 then that it is and it's about the 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:06.510
 singler and abrevie penguis a fish of the 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.060
 Great Barrier Reef 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.440
 the truth is that scientists 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.560
 scientists and any normal person 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.870
 will wonder why these 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.320
 vertebrate animals have evolved 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.820
 to become so and so small until the 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.330
 point to a point of view 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.240
 millimeter no, it's basically because 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.760
 a system of adaptation to the environment 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:33.120
 obviously in media where resources 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.310
 they are scarce it is much easier to be small 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.000
 because you have to eat fewer calories 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.740
 On the other hand let's say that you are less 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.960
 subjected to the great predators 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.770
 because a great predator will never go to 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.530
 look for a fish of 6 millimeters not or of 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.870
 nothing of a few does not even reach a 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.990
 gram of weight not the truth is that it 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.910
 it's about a very smart strategy 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.910
 that makes these living beings that these 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.850
 vertebrate animals are becoming more and more 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.980
 smaller it seems that this is going on 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.490
 increase and surely after about 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.900
 years there are new lists with animals 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.079
 even more 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.879
 at the moment these are the ones that enter 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.829
 in the list of vertebrate animals 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.829
 smallest in the world
