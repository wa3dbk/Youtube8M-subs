00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello boys and girls in this video 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.529
 just see how lisa and they are not created 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.110
 home made notice the blow to coconut and 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.719
 milk is really very simple that 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.809
 only an empty container is not needed 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.400
 you have the recycled cream and the recipe is 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.380
 simple mind what you have at home 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.109
 start by taking coconut flour 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.529
 that I am the one found on the market 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.840
 or give an area where you want 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.640
 start putting it and I do it a lot 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.450
 very thin trampling because the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.910
 take with this ability to 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.250
 turn into that we point towards 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.379
 I take the sugar of course recipe 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.620
 fast young infoboxes when it 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:49.739
 sugary and I get back inside 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:52.079
 ok now i take the salt which is a lot 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.160
 much study has a lot to many 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.680
 for the skin and I put it still produced 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.510
 while obviously it was all but 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.480
 you have to put this here big and not 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.780
 that until the one up to risk 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.790
 to disperse inside the milk e 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.650
 so getting wet redheads but what I do 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.360
 and get a glass because why 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.759
 we must go and cook in a bain-marie e 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.040
 prepare was not six fat I take 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.020
 shea butter these Provencal tails 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.360
 but to be able to safely use that 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.000
 that you find on roma- type sites hudson 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.409
 it's stuff to put in half a teaspoon and 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.570
 this way full full beautiful and this is 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.960
 the one that frees in rotation 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.940
 from our obese body what remains 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.590
 I put it on my hands because it's a lot 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.360
 moisturizing today I did not put 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.380
 perfect ok teaspoon now puts it back 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.270
 it's all OK 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.369
 as you also know an anti- wrinkle effect 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.160
 I take shea butter from them 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.450
 almonds killed this which look like jean and 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:00.330
 to be able to safely use that of 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:03.479
 of the Provencal infobox release recipe 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.670
 with all sizes, etc. 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.929
 etc. etc. that could 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.600
 glasses and now received because with 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.090
 too early and I put olive oil in it 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.010
 or other vegetable oil guys ho 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.170
 put the olive to show that 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.540
 good the same you can put it also 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.970
 quietly them of jojoba oil of 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.400
 castor or the most valuable as you wish 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.910
 this first having seen that it is pure 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.200
 this butter now definitely the min e 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.420
 what of the attachment to ours 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.070
 our scrub because otherwise 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.690
 let's put on the face 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.790
 I don't come out this is very hard butter 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.560
 because stored in the refrigerator 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.290
 however I put it or what time it is 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:59.370
 strange from a special bonus this is a 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:03:03.170
 butter special honey ok and cabbage comes out ok 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.750
 now i believe cocoa butter that is 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.690
 very normal from black novel taken and now 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.310
 I'm affectionate in a bain-marie 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.730
 in the meantime I taste a bar 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.220
 kinder that does not close with this is a 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.959
 double of the finger that I like of 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.709
 more because a bar instead on quota 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.540
 milk 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.200
 inside there is white chocolate and 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.290
 i also think about the coconut to having coconut ok it is 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.810
 melted everything in a bain-marie of 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.890
 like a baby pap with the queen issimo 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:38.000
 why he put cocoa butter 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:41.180
 shea butter before it becomes 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.670
 hard because together with us we do it 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:49.600
 we put inside the room where 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:54.370
 we have the dust zone we say ok 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.370
 as you can see we must cover everything 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.980
 till last drop 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.350
 and as I put it in he began to turn 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:12.440
 mix to disperse ours 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:16.820
 butter within this line with the 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:19.340
 powder continues to mix can 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.140
 moment when you commit the rest around 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.320
 lap ride will be very very difficult 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.390
 do this thing is possible with 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.310
 dimensions that I had given is everything is 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.870
 so you will be forced to go 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:35.090
 well this one here and adapted for those who have 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.169
 maybe three points if you have even in 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.260
 blackheads 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:42.860
 use cornstarch flour in starch 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.630
 corn a friend or with white 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.880
 the yellow one is the same as to do with 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.160
 coconut prepare for normal pearls in between 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:54.979
 you have oily or view a board the 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:58.030
 mizzas are less even a mess ok 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.860
 now another ingredient you need 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.590
 clean 9 kg spoons 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.870
 then a very very different thing than not 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.570
 I never do 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:12.080
 first I put the rest of the buso into it 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:14.030
 unfortunately a little thesis has been and is 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:21.130
 there were little puppies but then there are 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:26.540
 better because I got up ok 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:30.280
 however now we take milk 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:34.160
 I recommend any milk 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:38.050
 the important thing is that it is fresh but 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.050
 to rest milk of 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.710
 partially skimmed granarolo as 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:48.550
 you want it to be cold ok 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:52.600
 I mix all these pigments with milk 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:56.919
 dust and where are and he astori 6 a 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:06:00.760
 here he is and he started putting everything 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:02.590
 in the fridge for 10 minutes in the freezer 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.440
 refrigerator cell 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:08.800
 hello this is your club of course 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.039
 the zurich moment after a while yes 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.229
 will melt put it in yours 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:17.320
 people drawer I ca n't come back with 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:20.680
 hands because enough of that 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.449
 more or less a consistency and similar that 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.830
 they know about liquid release if 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.530
 you saw it 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.360
 and much much exfoliating this I 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:33.039
 I am about 23 years old 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:37.120
 no exaggerated during 2 3 months excuse me 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:39.250
 here you roped you put your body face 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.990
 it masses today in this way with 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:47.979
 circulatory movements if we put it 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:50.110
 on the islands instead like mind type ie 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:54.580
 book below state of the men I go 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:57.510
 there is type ignorance and they do not come back and goods 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:00.550
 I'm not even the camera ok 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:05.070
 however very multi- faceted by so many things 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.070
 hello guys
