00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
of the vehicle blasts which we did we

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.850 
of the vehicle blasts which we did we
used<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.270> use<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.600> droid<00:00:51.840> blasters<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:52.739> we

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
used to use the droid blasters but we

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.709 
used to use the droid blasters but we
found<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.250> they<00:00:53.430> were<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.149> created<00:00:54.600> a

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
found that they were that I created a

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.830 
found that they were that I created a
lot<00:00:54.930> dust<00:00:55.340> unnecessary<00:00:56.340> dust<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.300> they

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
didn't do the job as good as the app

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.830 
didn't do the job as good as the app
we've<00:01:00.090> lost<00:01:01.969> good<00:01:02.969> thing<00:01:03.180> about<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.539> aqua

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
we've lost good thing about the aqua

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.429 
we've lost good thing about the aqua

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
we used to obviously prep the wheel by

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.219 
we used to obviously prep the wheel by
hand<00:01:36.119> only<00:01:37.460> which<00:01:38.460> was<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> very<00:01:39.150> long<00:01:39.990> and
