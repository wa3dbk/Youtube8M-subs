episode<00:00:18.900> start<00:00:19.260> Sailor<00:00:19.710> Venus<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:20.250> standing

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
episode start Sailor Venus is standing

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.660 
episode start Sailor Venus is standing
there<00:00:20.880> she<00:00:21.180> still<00:00:21.449> has<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.750> sailor<00:00:22.320> V<00:00:22.670> shoulder

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
there she still has a sailor V shoulder

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.910

when<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.000> see<00:00:24.240> her<00:00:24.390> from<00:00:24.630> behind<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.619> guess

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
when you see her from behind so I guess

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.710 
when you see her from behind so I guess
they'll<00:00:26.160> fix<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.849> blu-ray<00:00:27.240> or<00:00:27.539> it

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
they'll fix that in the blu-ray or it

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.450 
they'll fix that in the blu-ray or it

though like the use of the ribbons is so

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.789 
though like the use of the ribbons is so
pretty<00:03:09.360> it's<00:03:09.569> like<00:03:09.629> Sailor<00:03:10.049> Moon<00:03:10.549> and

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799

malachite<00:03:13.799> is<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.010> little<00:03:14.370> overpowered<00:03:14.970> he's

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
malachite is a little overpowered he's

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.750 
malachite is a little overpowered he's
just<00:03:15.600> like<00:03:15.840> Boop<00:03:16.650> turned<00:03:17.160> off<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.430> power<00:03:17.459> in

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
just like Boop turned off the power in

Tokyo OOP sucka everybody's energy

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.090 
Tokyo OOP sucka everybody's energy
perhaps<00:03:21.209> this<00:03:21.870> is<00:03:22.019> because<00:03:22.319> queen<00:03:22.560> metalia<00:03:22.709> is

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
perhaps this is because queen metalia is

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.979 
perhaps this is because queen metalia is
stronger<00:03:23.579> therefore<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.180> Sheena<00:03:24.420> Tomei<00:03:24.930> be
