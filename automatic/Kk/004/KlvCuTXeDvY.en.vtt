a reason I remember it is just because

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.850

pk's before and he didn't have this
eddie<00:01:37.680> before<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.400> he's<00:01:38.579> leveled<00:01:39.060> up<00:01:39.119> if<00:01:39.270> you

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
eddie before so he's leveled up if you

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.899 
eddie before so he's leveled up if you
combat<00:01:39.659> levels<00:01:39.960> with<00:01:40.409> his<00:01:40.560> defense<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.340> i

both these bad boys at desires getting
83<00:03:24.419> range<00:03:24.659> there<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.139> see<00:03:26.099> if<00:03:26.190> they<00:03:26.310> can<00:03:26.430> do

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
83 range there and see if they can do

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.059

some<00:03:26.639> work<00:03:26.819> for<00:03:26.849> me<00:03:27.239> and<00:03:27.680> looks<00:03:28.680> like<00:03:28.919> we're

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
some work for me and looks like we're

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.080 
some work for me and looks like we're
getting<00:03:29.129> cover<00:03:29.459> it<00:03:29.579> up<00:03:29.669> with<00:03:29.699> the<00:03:29.879> crossbow

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
getting cover it up with the crossbow

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.960 
getting cover it up with the crossbow
and<00:03:30.709> hopefully<00:03:31.709> we<00:03:31.859> can<00:03:32.010> tank<00:03:32.250> these<00:03:32.430> hit<00:03:32.639> if

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970

and hopefully we can tank these hit if
not<00:03:33.209> we're<00:03:33.419> probably<00:03:33.720> going<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:33.989> die<00:03:34.370> but<00:03:35.370> I

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
not we're probably going to die but I

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.349 
not we're probably going to die but I
might<00:03:35.639> have<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.790> tell<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.090> up<00:03:36.150> from<00:03:36.269> this

until I feel like we've got a decent
chance<00:03:43.590> in<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:43.889> foot<00:03:44.099> and<00:03:44.659> if<00:03:45.659> he's<00:03:45.840> not

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:17.009 
a risk and so it's not always like I

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:18.439 
a risk and so it's not always like I
don't<00:04:17.549> always<00:04:17.759> remember<00:04:17.909> to<00:04:18.120> bring<00:04:18.299> it

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.590 
we shall move on to our next fight all
right<00:06:05.370> at<00:06:05.550> a<00:06:05.580> sheer<00:06:05.910> like<00:06:06.090> at<00:06:06.210> five<00:06:06.360> so<00:06:06.540> I'm

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
right at a sheer like at five so I'm

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.240 
right at a sheer like at five so I'm
going<00:06:06.720> to<00:06:06.750> fight<00:06:06.930> a<00:06:06.960> level<00:06:07.200> 82<00:06:07.440> and<00:06:07.860> they

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
going to fight a level 82 and they

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.790 
going to fight a level 82 and they
should<00:06:08.430> pure<00:06:08.640> with<00:06:08.760> a<00:06:08.850> whip<00:06:09.060> and<00:06:09.300> a<00:06:10.200> fire<00:06:10.560> cape

on
a<00:06:40.260> at<00:06:40.530> this<00:06:40.650> point<00:06:40.920> I<00:06:41.130> mean<00:06:41.820> there's<00:06:42.600> people<00:06:42.900> in

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
a at this point I mean there's people in

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.970 
a at this point I mean there's people in
the<00:06:43.020> world<00:06:43.200> that<00:06:43.260> have<00:06:43.410> it<00:06:43.500> worse<00:06:43.680> than<00:06:43.710> me

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:43.980 
the world that have it worse than me

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.400 
the world that have it worse than me
right<00:06:44.100> now<00:06:44.400> but<00:06:44.670> currently<00:06:45.450> I<00:06:45.720> don't<00:06:46.260> think<00:06:46.380> my

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.410 
right now but currently I don't think my

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.050 
right now but currently I don't think my
chances<00:06:46.500> of<00:06:46.890> survival<00:06:47.400> are<00:06:47.490> very<00:06:47.550> high<00:06:47.940> at

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
chances of survival are very high at

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.910 
chances of survival are very high at
this<00:06:48.150> point<00:06:48.450> but<00:06:48.990> if<00:06:49.170> we<00:06:49.260> can<00:06:49.410> bring<00:06:49.530> it<00:06:49.740> down

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:49.920 
this point but if we can bring it down

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.760 
this point but if we can bring it down
with<00:06:50.130> miyabi<00:06:50.690> and<00:06:51.690> eventually<00:06:52.350> finish<00:06:52.650> him

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
with miyabi and eventually finish him

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.620 
with miyabi and eventually finish him
off<00:06:52.890> with<00:06:53.130> the<00:06:53.340> GM<00:06:53.730> or<00:06:53.820> hopefully<00:06:54.420> even<00:06:54.480> do

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630 
off with the GM or hopefully even do

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.480 
off with the GM or hopefully even do
something<00:06:54.930> decent<00:06:55.080> but<00:06:55.770> can<00:06:56.160> we<00:06:56.190> pull<00:06:56.400> off

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.490 
something decent but can we pull off

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.590 
something decent but can we pull off
something<00:06:56.700> here<00:06:56.910> I<00:06:56.970> don't<00:06:57.150> know<00:06:57.270> if<00:06:57.330> again

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 
something here I don't know if again

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.840

the album all done some work in the
first<00:07:03.600> place<00:07:03.780> but<00:07:04.080> my<00:07:04.320> only<00:07:04.470> chance<00:07:04.710> is<00:07:04.890> a

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:04.920 
first place but my only chance is a

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.920 
first place but my only chance is a
massive<00:07:05.460> hit<00:07:05.610> from<00:07:06.090> the<00:07:06.150> OB<00:07:06.570> so<00:07:06.780> that's

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
massive hit from the OB so that's

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.270 
massive hit from the OB so that's
exactly<00:07:07.080> what<00:07:07.350> we're<00:07:07.530> going<00:07:07.680> to<00:07:07.770> be<00:07:07.800> going<00:07:07.980> for
