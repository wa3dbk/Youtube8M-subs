want it wanting the Rings to end up such
that<00:01:04.089> the<00:01:04.379> metal<00:01:05.379> rings<00:01:05.590> are<00:01:06.000> stacked<00:01:07.000> one<00:01:07.180> on

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
that the metal rings are stacked one on

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.609 
that the metal rings are stacked one on
top<00:01:07.360> of<00:01:07.540> each<00:01:07.720> other<00:01:07.869> in<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.200> same<00:01:08.350> pattern

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
top of each other in the same pattern

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:14.550 
top of each other in the same pattern
and<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:11.170> rubber<00:01:11.350> rings<00:01:12.210> are<00:01:13.210> also<00:01:13.560> stacked

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
and the rubber rings are also stacked

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.840 
and the rubber rings are also stacked
one<00:01:14.740> on<00:01:14.800> top<00:01:14.920> of<00:01:15.190> each<00:01:15.250> other<00:01:15.400> in<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.670> same

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
one on top of each other in the same

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.640 
one on top of each other in the same
pattern<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.390> of<00:01:16.990> course<00:01:17.170> we<00:01:17.290> can<00:01:17.410> only<00:01:17.440> do

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
pattern and of course we can only do

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.560 
pattern and of course we can only do
this<00:01:17.770> by<00:01:17.920> opening<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.400> metal<00:01:18.640> rings<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:21.570> we'll

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
this by opening the metal rings so we'll

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.180 
this by opening the metal rings so we'll
need<00:01:22.690> to<00:01:22.750> open<00:01:23.020> both<00:01:23.290> metal<00:01:23.680> rings<00:01:23.860> that<00:01:24.070> are

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
need to open both metal rings that are

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.870 
need to open both metal rings that are
closest<00:01:24.550> to<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.729> end<00:01:25.770> one<00:01:26.770> at<00:01:26.950> a<00:01:26.979> time<00:01:28.500> and

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
closest to the end one at a time and

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.910 
closest to the end one at a time and
just<00:01:30.880> put<00:01:31.090> it<00:01:31.180> through<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.539> one<00:01:31.810> rubber<00:01:32.590> ring

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
just put it through the one rubber ring

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.940 
just put it through the one rubber ring
that<00:01:33.670> it's<00:01:33.820> closest<00:01:34.330> to<00:01:34.420> in<00:01:34.869> such<00:01:35.440> a<00:01:35.470> way<00:01:35.740> that

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
that it's closest to in such a way that

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:44.190 
that it's closest to in such a way that
your<00:01:36.100> metal<00:01:36.340> ring<00:01:36.520> is<00:01:36.700> is<00:01:39.479> nicely<00:01:40.479> stacked<00:01:43.200> so

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
your metal ring is is nicely stacked so

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:52.950 
your metal ring is is nicely stacked so
we<00:01:44.289> have<00:01:44.410> the<00:01:44.560> first<00:01:44.800> ring

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:06.760 

and<00:01:53.580> then<00:01:54.580> you<00:01:54.760> flip<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.180> around

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:14.690 

and<00:02:07.189> do<00:02:07.729> that<00:02:07.880> second<00:02:08.300> ring

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.270 

and<00:02:15.270> now<00:02:15.540> you'll<00:02:15.750> be<00:02:15.780> able<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.050> just<00:02:16.230> slip<00:02:17.040> this

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
and now you'll be able to just slip this

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.800 
and now you'll be able to just slip this
on<00:02:18.290> maybe<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.380> little<00:02:19.680> tight<00:02:19.860> for<00:02:20.099> me

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
on maybe a little tight for me

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.270 
on maybe a little tight for me
nope<00:02:21.810> not<00:02:22.050> bad<00:02:22.260> once<00:02:22.500> it's<00:02:22.680> on<00:02:22.800> there<00:02:25.280> there

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
nope not bad once it's on there there

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.580 
nope not bad once it's on there there
you<00:02:26.459> go
