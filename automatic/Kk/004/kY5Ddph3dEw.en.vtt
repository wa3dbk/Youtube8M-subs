00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
they're surprisingly easy to breed well

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.620 
they're surprisingly easy to breed well
a<00:02:07.180> little<00:02:07.450> bit<00:02:07.540> of<00:02:07.630> food<00:02:09.240> introduce<00:02:10.240> the<00:02:10.450> mail

pretty<00:02:25.690> well<00:02:25.900> for<00:02:26.080> breeding<00:02:26.350> pretty<00:02:27.010> good<00:02:27.160> for

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
pretty well for breeding pretty good for

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.940 
pretty well for breeding pretty good for
breathing<00:02:27.670> so<00:02:27.880> get<00:02:28.120> him<00:02:28.300> scope<00:02:28.650> good<00:02:29.650> point

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
breathing so get him scope good point

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.770
