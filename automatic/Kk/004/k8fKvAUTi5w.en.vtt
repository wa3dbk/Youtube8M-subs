are these for capacitive touch buttons
gear<00:01:03.120> which<00:01:03.930> are<00:01:04.140> rather<00:01:04.260> finicky<00:01:04.680> to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
button which is a hidden miss and that's

button which is a hidden miss and that's
probably<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.780> main<00:01:09.810> gripe<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
probably the main gripe we have with the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.760 
probably the main gripe we have with the
LG<00:01:11.790> optimus<00:01:11.850> chicks<00:01:12.420> hardware<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.650> other

LG optimus chicks hardware the other

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.350 
LG optimus chicks hardware the other
thing<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.400> fairly<00:01:14.670> heavy<00:01:15.000> for<00:01:15.330> a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
thing is that it's fairly heavy for a

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.380 
thing is that it's fairly heavy for a
handset<00:01:15.780> entirely<00:01:16.200> made<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.439> plastic<00:01:16.920> but

that<00:01:18.390> makes<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.810> actually<00:01:19.229> feels<00:01:19.380> solid<00:01:19.860> it's

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
that makes it actually feels solid it's

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.090 
that makes it actually feels solid it's
easy<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.790> operate<00:01:20.820> with<00:01:21.270> one<00:01:21.420> hand<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.009> if<00:01:23.009> I

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
easy to operate with one hand and if I

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.380 
easy to operate with one hand and if I
were<00:01:23.220> shadowed<00:01:23.520> by<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.670> fact<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.119> it's

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
were shadowed by the fact that it's

it the interface on the Optimus chick
