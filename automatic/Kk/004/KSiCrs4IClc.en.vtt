because<00:00:41.239> it<00:00:42.020> does<00:00:42.290> require<00:00:42.560> a<00:00:42.680> little<00:00:42.980> bit<00:00:43.070> of

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
because it does require a little bit of

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.400 
because it does require a little bit of
practice<00:00:43.250> let's<00:00:43.850> do<00:00:43.970> it<00:00:44.149> this<00:00:44.840> is<00:00:45.020> really<00:00:45.230> easy

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
practice let's do it this is really easy

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.020 
practice let's do it this is really easy
to<00:00:45.500> do<00:00:45.710> if<00:00:45.860> your<00:00:45.980> hair<00:00:46.130> is<00:00:46.220> a<00:00:46.250> bit<00:00:46.399> textured<00:00:46.850> so

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
usually pretty good for this make my

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.970 
usually pretty good for this make my
tired<00:00:52.220> day<00:00:52.430> hair<00:00:52.930> Shh<00:00:53.930> or<00:00:54.500> put<00:00:54.680> some<00:00:54.800> hairspray

in it or like a bit of texturing spray
that<00:00:56.960> always<00:00:57.290> works<00:00:57.530> so<00:00:57.649> it's<00:00:57.890> not<00:00:57.980> too

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
that always works so it's not too

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.190 
that always works so it's not too
slippery<00:00:58.730> you<00:00:59.239> can<00:00:59.360> only<00:00:59.480> do<00:00:59.690> this<00:00:59.840> if<00:01:00.079> your

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
something this is an experiment every

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.330 
something this is an experiment every
time<00:01:08.450> I<00:01:08.570> do<00:01:08.630> it<00:01:08.840> so<00:01:09.110> we're<00:01:09.259> just<00:01:09.289> gonna<00:01:09.530> see<00:01:10.009> how

then go all the way around if you're

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.510 
then go all the way around if you're

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
sections at the front and pull them back

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.719 
sections at the front and pull them back
you<00:01:46.939> don't<00:01:47.119> want<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.330> end<00:01:47.659> up<00:01:47.869> making<00:01:48.259> your

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
you don't want to end up making your

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.640 
you don't want to end up making your
subject<00:01:49.729> look<00:01:49.909> like<00:01:50.119> a<00:01:50.150> dinosaur<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:51.049> make

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
subject look like a dinosaur so make

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.319 
subject look like a dinosaur so make
sure<00:01:51.680> you<00:01:51.890> push<00:01:52.100> those<00:01:52.250> down<00:01:52.310> so<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:52.880> one<00:01:53.030> that

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
sure you push those down so the one that

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:54.700 
sure you push those down so the one that
is<00:01:53.540> kind<00:01:53.750> of<00:01:53.869> going<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.140> go<00:01:54.229> over<00:01:54.560> it

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
is kind of going to go over it

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.960 
is kind of going to go over it
eventually<00:01:54.829> is<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.369> one<00:01:55.490> you<00:01:55.579> can<00:01:55.610> kind<00:01:55.909> of

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
eventually is the one you can kind of

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.749 
eventually is the one you can kind of
let<00:01:56.270> go<00:01:56.650> you<00:01:57.650> just<00:01:57.860> let<00:01:58.009> it<00:01:58.040> hang<00:01:58.280> here<00:01:58.549> and

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
let go you just let it hang here and

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.789 
let go you just let it hang here and
this<00:01:59.450> is<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.750> important<00:02:00.229> one<00:02:00.259> that<00:02:00.409> I'm<00:02:00.650> going

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
this is the important one that I'm going

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.620 
this is the important one that I'm going
to<00:02:00.860> have<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.040> add<00:02:01.159> hair<00:02:01.369> to<00:02:01.640> grab<00:02:02.180> a<00:02:02.210> bit<00:02:02.479> of

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
to have to add hair to grab a bit of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.469 
to have to add hair to grab a bit of
hair<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.670> then<00:02:04.670> just<00:02:04.939> use<00:02:05.090> all<00:02:05.240> my<00:02:05.329> other

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
hair and then just use all my other

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.060 
hair and then just use all my other
fingers<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:05.840> edit<00:02:06.229> so<00:02:06.409> like<00:02:06.560> this<00:02:06.710> is<00:02:06.829> now<00:02:06.950> all

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
fingers to edit so like this is now all

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.249 
fingers to edit so like this is now all
together<00:02:07.189> and<00:02:07.729> then<00:02:07.850> this<00:02:08.000> one<00:02:08.239> can<00:02:08.899> go<00:02:09.019> over

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
together and then this one can go over

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.949 
together and then this one can go over
the<00:02:09.380> top<00:02:09.560> which<00:02:10.519> is<00:02:10.700> looks<00:02:11.000> like<00:02:11.060> impossible

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959
