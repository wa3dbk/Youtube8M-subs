 here also revealed here the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.079
 manuals and is also one thing I 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.499
 I've hardly ever seen a cartridge 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.939
 Let's try manuals of his games, right? 

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:45.119
 reflected on warranty only from the 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:47.880
 game of the test was in the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.729
 right which is a magazine than when 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.450
 three I found the island and one that did not 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.119
 which extinguishes that it also looks only at 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.649
 Nintendo Power magazine advertising 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.719
 subscription of the magazine nÃ© 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.850
 and lastly that the game manual is only 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.439
 nice, well done, pretty illustrated 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.009
 But I did not think at the time that we did not 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.140
 seen today but it is in the hands of the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.690
 super nintendo cartridge 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.430
 looks just well illustrated interesting these 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.410
 manuals that he tells a lot 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.569
 the history of the game you play enough that 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.209

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.879
 this shows it also looks at the screens only 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.099
 of the game and explains in detail the 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:31.470
 function that each screen has each what 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.470
 each one of them only controls 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.989
 Look, it only explains well in detail. 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.150
 illustrated minor 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:41.110
 all positions on the characters 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.090

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.930

 the trees and power apps you get 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.299

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.860

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.720
 Well complete well illustrated manual thing 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.400

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.170
 and until we wanted to have this 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.849
 curiosity for you a boxing game 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.459
 practically zeroed out of super nintendo 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.100
 here I won from a channel friend and look 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.440
 only the super star wars 4 game that in 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.150
 true this game it contains a 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.650
 collection of the best moments 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.260
 all star wars movies right 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.400
 very interesting, but I also hope 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.470
