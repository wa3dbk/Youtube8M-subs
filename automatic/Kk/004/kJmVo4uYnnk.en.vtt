00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.479
 being animals was born in 2011 by people 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.790
 but they already had years of activity 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:11.070
 for animals behind then 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.139
 protest campaigns also a lot 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.260
 important to close laboratories 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.290
 breeding of laboratory animals 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.730
 etc. and specifically we were born 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.890
 with a project he has among his own 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.190
 that of investigations is peculiar 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.840
 in places of animal exploitation 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.250
 the direct saving of some of 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.750
 these with the ones we call for 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.629
 rescue liberation with uncovered face 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.429
 therefore an act of civil disobedience 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.350
 to an unjust law that considers the 

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:40.469
 animal goods and items to keep 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.910
 imprisoned disobedience lies in saying 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.879
 that an unjust law can also be 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.170
 go beyond when ethics and morality 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.030
 they say they do it 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.649
 these are the things we say 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.050
 stand out from most 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.089
 of groups of strings associations 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.879
 span activism in Italy for the rest 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.010
 we do flyer banquets and 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.929
 many initiatives including one 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.159
 national campaign called needs 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:04.409
 free to close all 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:07.500
 fur farms in 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.660
 Italy and be animals right at Milan 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.490
 presented his latest work by 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.280
 investigation 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.910
 we have just published a new one 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.560
 investigation that kept us 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.980
 committed for several months we have 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.040
 followed the horse trade from 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.660
 poland towards Italian slaughterhouses in 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.420
 particularly the slaughterhouses of Puglia that 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.000
 these are the most distant from Poland 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.340
 animals make incredible long journeys 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.280
 dozens and dozens of hours on trips 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.710
 exhausting to finish then in what 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.210
 we all know what the slaughter means 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.770
 to be 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.510
 end your life in a place of 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.750
 kind of this movie we have 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.260
 disseminated on a site called www travel 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.390
 without return point it is accompanied 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.950
 also to a petition requesting the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.960
 end of slaughter for this 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.390
 animal what we hope for is 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.700
 raise a social interest towards 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.440
 this topic is also discussed 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.110
 however, domestic horse consumption was not 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.630
 it is much smaller than other meats 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.090
 but I thought I could use it as a pivot 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.400
 to be able to start talking given the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.900
 sensitivity that ordinary people have 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.940
 towards the horse compared to others 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.980
 especially to be able to start talking about 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.140
 what is the slaughtering process of 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.640
 dismemberment of animal bodies for 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.760
 turn them into products then 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.100
 use it as a window to open 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.250
 a glimpse into a world of freedom 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.280
 for all species who wants to sign a 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.870
 favor of this campaign where you can do it 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.019
 as well as in dedicated events such as 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.050
 this but on the website www travel without 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.930
 return point it and in the future shortly 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.209
 also on the site www.simg.it there will be 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.890
 all references to sign and to 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.049
 follow us in the progress of this 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.280
 campaign that has just been launched e 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.280
 includes many other initiatives
