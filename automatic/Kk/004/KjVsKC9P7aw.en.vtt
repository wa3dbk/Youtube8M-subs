you know you can basically do the same

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.709 
you know you can basically do the same
techniques<00:01:19.079> vary<00:01:20.079> up<00:01:20.289> the<00:01:20.500> time<00:01:21.450> slowed<00:01:22.450> down

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
techniques vary up the time slowed down

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:29.680 
techniques vary up the time slowed down
a<00:01:22.750> little<00:01:22.990> bit<00:01:23.200> here<00:01:23.380> and<00:01:23.530> you<00:01:23.649> can
