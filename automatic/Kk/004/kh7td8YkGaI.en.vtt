will<00:03:16.629> merge<00:03:17.169> them<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:17.919> then<00:03:18.010> they<00:03:18.130> become<00:03:18.370> one

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
will merge them and then they become one

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:19.770 
will merge them and then they become one
unit<00:03:18.760> especially<00:03:19.120> when<00:03:19.450> you<00:03:19.510> move<00:03:19.660> them

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.199 
pieces selected you can double click to
rotate<00:03:25.840> which<00:03:26.380> is<00:03:26.530> nice<00:03:26.739> as<00:03:26.950> well<00:03:26.980> like<00:03:27.970> I<00:03:28.000> said

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
rotate which is nice as well like I said

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.670

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
very nice it did take me a bit to figure

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
out the DoubleTap to rotate because I

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.490 
out the DoubleTap to rotate because I
didn't<00:04:07.480> realize<00:04:07.690> there<00:04:07.870> is<00:04:07.900> a<00:04:07.959> setting<00:04:08.379> in<00:04:08.470> the

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
didn't realize there is a setting in the

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.839 
didn't realize there is a setting in the

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
main menu so if you're you know trying

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.759 
main menu so if you're you know trying
to<00:04:10.150> rotate<00:04:10.269> and<00:04:10.540> it's<00:04:10.629> not<00:04:10.810> working<00:04:10.989> there<00:04:11.620> is

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
to rotate and it's not working there is

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.140 
to rotate and it's not working there is
that<00:04:11.949> setting<00:04:12.340> on<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.519> main<00:04:12.639> menu<00:04:12.790> that<00:04:13.030> you

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
that setting on the main menu that you

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.080 
that setting on the main menu that you
have<00:04:13.269> to<00:04:13.389> turn<00:04:13.569> on<00:04:14.310> so<00:04:15.310> we'll<00:04:15.609> like<00:04:15.790> get<00:04:15.940> rid<00:04:16.060> of

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
have to turn on so we'll like get rid of

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.729 
have to turn on so we'll like get rid of
that<00:04:16.239> really<00:04:16.510> quick<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.289> other<00:04:17.410> thing<00:04:17.650> I

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
that really quick and the other thing I

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.170 
that really quick and the other thing I
really<00:04:17.979> liked<00:04:18.160> about<00:04:18.280> this<00:04:18.579> was<00:04:18.639> that<00:04:18.940> you<00:04:19.030> can

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.550 
really liked about this was that you can
hit<00:04:19.329> this<00:04:19.510> button<00:04:19.570> and<00:04:19.930> then<00:04:20.169> it<00:04:20.289> gives<00:04:20.440> you

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
hit this button and then it gives you

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.350 
hit this button and then it gives you
all<00:04:20.709> of<00:04:20.859> the<00:04:20.949> edge<00:04:21.099> pieces<00:04:21.519> if<00:04:21.880> you're<00:04:22.030> an<00:04:22.120> avid

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
all of the edge pieces if you're an avid

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.730 
all of the edge pieces if you're an avid
puzzler<00:04:22.750> you<00:04:22.900> know<00:04:23.020> that's<00:04:23.349> really<00:04:23.530> useful

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
puzzler you know that's really useful

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.200 
puzzler you know that's really useful
because<00:04:24.039> that's<00:04:24.280> usually<00:04:24.580> what<00:04:24.729> most<00:04:24.880> people

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
because that's usually what most people

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.400 
because that's usually what most people
do<00:04:25.300> anyway

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
do anyway

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.110 
do anyway
with<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.620> edges<00:04:26.860> and<00:04:27.010> then<00:04:27.100> move<00:04:27.250> inward<00:04:27.580> so

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
with the edges and then move inward so

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.210 
with the edges and then move inward so
it's<00:04:28.270> a<00:04:28.330> nice<00:04:28.480> touch<00:04:28.750> I<00:04:28.990> did<00:04:29.170> like<00:04:29.380> that<00:04:29.680> and

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
it's a nice touch I did like that and

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.030 
it's a nice touch I did like that and
also<00:04:30.610> you<00:04:30.820> can<00:04:31.090> not<00:04:31.810> search<00:04:32.170> but<00:04:32.470> at<00:04:32.650> any<00:04:32.830> point

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
also you can not search but at any point

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.140 
also you can not search but at any point
in<00:04:33.100> time<00:04:33.130> you<00:04:33.340> can<00:04:33.400> hit<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.640> magnifying<00:04:34.090> glass

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
in time you can hit the magnifying glass

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.970 
in time you can hit the magnifying glass
and<00:04:34.330> then<00:04:34.600> see<00:04:34.750> what<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:34.930> puzzle<00:04:35.110> is<00:04:35.440> supposed

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
and then see what the puzzle is supposed

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.680 
and then see what the puzzle is supposed
to<00:04:36.070> look<00:04:36.190> like<00:04:36.280> and<00:04:36.550> move<00:04:36.820> it<00:04:37.000> around<00:04:37.090> and

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
to look like and move it around and

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.210 
to look like and move it around and
close<00:04:38.500> it<00:04:38.680> if<00:04:38.770> you<00:04:38.830> like

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
close it if you like

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.300 
close it if you like
so<00:04:39.790> just<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.150> give<00:04:40.300> a<00:04:40.330> quick<00:04:40.570> wrap-up<00:04:41.020> here<00:04:41.350> at

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
so just to give a quick wrap-up here at
