00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
that point of view that championship

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.540 
that point of view that championship
isn't<00:00:52.260> really<00:00:52.440> much<00:00:52.559> more<00:00:53.010> than<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> proper

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
isn't really much more than a proper

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.459 
isn't really much more than a proper
this<00:00:53.730> point<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.719> Intercontinental

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
this point the Intercontinental

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.560 
this point the Intercontinental
Championship<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.489> still<00:00:56.820> no<00:00:56.969> better<00:00:57.210> that's

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
Championship is still no better that's

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.540 
Championship is still no better that's
obviously<00:00:57.899> held<00:00:58.109> by<00:00:58.230> Big<00:00:58.410> E<00:00:58.440> Langston<00:00:58.680> but

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
obviously held by Big E Langston but

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.490 
obviously held by Big E Langston but
still<00:00:59.940> that's<00:01:00.120> not<00:01:00.359> made<00:01:00.600> at<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.840> level<00:01:01.109> it

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
still that's not made at a level it

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.470 
still that's not made at a level it
should<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:02.039> or<00:01:02.219> could<00:01:02.250> be<00:01:02.640> at<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> dough

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
should be or could be at that the dough

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.929 
should be or could be at that the dough
to<00:01:03.539> me<00:01:03.780> put<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.199> chairmanship<00:01:04.589> correctly<00:01:05.159> so

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
to me put the chairmanship correctly so

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.670 
to me put the chairmanship correctly so
if<00:01:06.060> my<00:01:06.240> point<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.600> view<00:01:06.659> may<00:01:07.170> be<00:01:07.200> having<00:01:07.530> one

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
if my point of view may be having one

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.740 
if my point of view may be having one
secondary<00:01:08.040> championship<00:01:08.700> would<00:01:09.270> make<00:01:09.450> sense

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
secondary championship would make sense

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.090 
secondary championship would make sense
to<00:01:09.900> me<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.140> championship<00:01:10.710> see<00:01:10.950> more

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
important but on the other hand despite

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.230 
important but on the other hand despite

neva Chad knees shit meaning the whole

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.749 
neva Chad knees shit meaning the whole
at<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.720> point<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.979> can<00:01:17.070> always<00:01:17.400> be<00:01:17.549> turned

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
at this point that can always be turned

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.090 
at this point that can always be turned
around<00:01:17.970> with<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.330> improve<00:01:18.600> booking<00:01:19.049> not<00:01:19.710> only

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
around with a improve booking not only

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.800 
around with a improve booking not only
that<00:01:20.310> if<00:01:20.670> they're<00:01:20.820> going<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.150> reap<00:01:21.330> does<00:01:21.600> do

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
that if they're going to reap does do

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.030 
that if they're going to reap does do
this<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.350> gets<00:01:22.530> rid<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.830> one<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
this and gets rid of one of the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.010 
this and gets rid of one of the
championships<00:01:23.700> but<00:01:24.299> that's<00:01:24.450> gonna<00:01:24.810> leave

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
championships but that's gonna leave

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.230 
championships but that's gonna leave
less<00:01:25.439> opportunities<00:01:26.100> throught<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> guards

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
less opportunities throught the guards

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.480 
less opportunities throught the guards
and<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> roster<00:01:27.810> especially<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.799> guys<00:01:29.009> in

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
and the roster especially the guys in

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.399 
and the roster especially the guys in
the<00:01:29.700> middle<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:29.970> cards<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:31.290> would

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
the middle of the cards so that would

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.929 
the middle of the cards so that would
definitely<00:01:31.439> be<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.799> main<00:01:32.009> worry<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.490> would

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
definitely be the main worry I would

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.359 
definitely be the main worry I would
have<00:01:33.090> if<00:01:33.329> they<00:01:33.420> went<00:01:33.570> miss<00:01:33.750> route<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.070> can

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
have if they went miss route so I can

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.950 
have if they went miss route so I can
definitely<00:01:35.520> see<00:01:35.939> reasons<00:01:36.420> why<00:01:36.689> they

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
definitely see reasons why they

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.929 
definitely see reasons why they
shouldn't<00:01:37.860> need<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.040> publish<00:01:38.340> championships

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
shouldn't need to publish championships

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.450 
shouldn't need to publish championships

unify<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.890> actually<00:01:44.549> do<00:01:44.909> think<00:01:45.240> having<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
unify I actually do think having the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.149 
unify I actually do think having the
championships<00:01:46.170> around<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.649> same<00:01:46.829> time<00:01:46.979> is

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
championships around the same time is

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.910 
championships around the same time is
fine<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.270> one<00:01:48.479> does<00:01:48.659> go<00:01:48.840> through<00:01:49.110> but

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
fine but this one does go through but

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.380 
fine but this one does go through but
it's<00:01:50.070> gonna<00:01:50.189> take<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.549> singles<00:01:50.909> titles<00:01:51.240> down

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
it's gonna take the singles titles down

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.480 
it's gonna take the singles titles down
