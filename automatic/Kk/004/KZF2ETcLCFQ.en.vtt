when<00:03:07.540> there's<00:03:07.750> its<00:03:08.140> fourth<00:03:08.470> quarter<00:03:08.739> and

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
when there's its fourth quarter and

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.460 
when there's its fourth quarter and
there's<00:03:09.880> less<00:03:10.060> than<00:03:10.270> like<00:03:10.450> 24<00:03:10.989> seconds<00:03:11.350> on<00:03:11.440> the

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
there's less than like 24 seconds on the

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.580 
there's less than like 24 seconds on the
clock<00:03:11.560> go<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:12.880> save<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:13.900> think<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.380> only

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
clock go and save it I think the only

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.810 
clock go and save it I think the only
way<00:03:14.860> you<00:03:14.920> can<00:03:15.220> quit<00:03:15.610> and<00:03:15.790> save<00:03:16.090> is<00:03:16.450> if<00:03:16.660> you<00:03:17.820> are

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
way you can quit and save is if you are

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.970 
way you can quit and save is if you are
like<00:03:19.360> ready<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.720> inbound<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.350> ball<00:03:20.560> I<00:03:20.620> don't

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
like ready to inbound the ball I don't

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.160 
like ready to inbound the ball I don't
think<00:03:21.220> you<00:03:21.310> can<00:03:21.489> do<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.700> when<00:03:22.060> you're<00:03:22.300> when

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
think you can do it when you're when

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.930 
think you can do it when you're when
you're<00:03:23.290> just<00:03:23.530> like<00:03:23.739> dribbling<00:03:24.160> down<00:03:24.550> court

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
you're just like dribbling down court

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.020 
you're just like dribbling down court
and<00:03:25.120> possibly<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:27.160> pause<00:03:27.340> menu<00:03:27.580> so<00:03:27.880> make<00:03:28.000> sure

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
and possibly the pause menu so make sure

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.610 
and possibly the pause menu so make sure
you<00:03:28.209> call<00:03:28.390> a<00:03:28.450> timeout<00:03:28.870> or<00:03:28.930> something<00:03:29.080> so<00:03:29.590> that

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
you call a timeout or something so that

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.170 
you call a timeout or something so that
they're<00:03:29.920> ready<00:03:30.100> to<00:03:30.160> inbound<00:03:30.520> the<00:03:30.670> ball<00:03:30.880> and

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
they're ready to inbound the ball and

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.060 
they're ready to inbound the ball and
then<00:03:31.870> what<00:03:32.350> you're<00:03:32.470> going<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.650> do<00:03:32.770> is<00:03:32.950> you're

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
then what you're going to do is you're

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.010 
then what you're going to do is you're
going<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.250> go<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.430> quit<00:03:33.820> and<00:03:33.970> then<00:03:34.330> save<00:03:34.840> and

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
going to go to quit and then save and

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.460 
going to go to quit and then save and
quit<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:35.730> so<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:36.790> have<00:03:36.910> it<00:03:37.300> ready<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:38.050> load<00:03:38.440> up

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
quit and so you have it ready to load up

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.550 
quit and so you have it ready to load up
here<00:03:39.010> on<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.250> fourth<00:03:39.520> quarter<00:03:39.790> every<00:03:40.420> time<00:03:40.660> so

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
here on the fourth quarter every time so

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.870 
here on the fourth quarter every time so
you're<00:03:41.770> going<00:03:41.860> to<00:03:41.920> go<00:03:42.040> into<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.400> game<00:03:42.580> and

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
you're going to go into the game and

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.610 
you're going to go into the game and
they're<00:03:43.450> going<00:03:43.540> to<00:03:43.600> play<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:43.930> out<00:03:44.080> they

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
they're going to play it out they

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.680 
they're going to play it out they
usually<00:03:44.770> going<00:03:45.100> to<00:03:45.160> give<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.400> Carmelo<00:03:45.880> but

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
usually going to give it to Carmelo but

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.210 
usually going to give it to Carmelo but
hopefully<00:03:47.080> they<00:03:47.230> don't<00:03:47.380> score<00:03:47.709> three<00:03:48.040> that

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
hopefully they don't score three that

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.370 
hopefully they don't score three that
doesn't<00:03:48.610> something<00:03:48.820> here<00:03:49.120> he<00:03:49.209> goes<00:03:49.390> up<00:03:50.049> he's

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
doesn't something here he goes up he's

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.990 
doesn't something here he goes up he's
going<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.680> three<00:03:50.980> so<00:03:51.250> it's<00:03:51.430> going<00:03:51.549> to<00:03:51.640> go

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
going to three so it's going to go

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.610 
going to three so it's going to go

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.020 
stuck with this was there was three
points<00:04:11.260> left<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:12.010> my<00:04:12.250> team<00:04:12.490> had<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:12.820> ball

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
points left and my team had the ball

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.300 
points left and my team had the ball
last<00:04:13.390> and<00:04:13.780> we<00:04:13.900> always<00:04:14.110> end<00:04:14.470> up<00:04:14.590> scoring<00:04:14.980> a

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
last and we always end up scoring a

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.699 
last and we always end up scoring a
three-pointer<00:04:15.940> going<00:04:16.299> to<00:04:16.390> overtime<00:04:16.870> so<00:04:17.560> what

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
three-pointer going to overtime so what

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.130 
three-pointer going to overtime so what
I<00:04:17.739> do<00:04:18.000> instead<00:04:19.000> of<00:04:19.030> that<00:04:19.269> I<00:04:19.329> just<00:04:19.690> quit<00:04:20.019> and

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
I do instead of that I just quit and

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.070 
I do instead of that I just quit and
quit<00:04:23.140> not<00:04:23.470> safe<00:04:23.800> just<00:04:24.280> quit<00:04:24.550> because<00:04:25.240> no

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
quit not safe just quit because no

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.320 
quit not safe just quit because no
matter<00:04:26.290> what<00:04:26.410> whether<00:04:27.220> you<00:04:27.400> win<00:04:27.640> or<00:04:27.669> lose<00:04:27.880> the

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
matter what whether you win or lose the

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.650 
matter what whether you win or lose the
game<00:04:29.040> every<00:04:30.040> time<00:04:30.250> you're<00:04:30.580> going<00:04:30.669> to<00:04:30.760> get<00:04:30.880> 600

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
game every time you're going to get 600

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.290 
game every time you're going to get 600
vc<00:04:32.500> for<00:04:32.890> completing<00:04:33.430> the<00:04:33.490> game<00:04:33.520> i'm<00:04:33.910> assuming

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
vc for completing the game i'm assuming

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.070 
vc for completing the game i'm assuming
because<00:04:34.690> it's<00:04:35.970> 12-minute<00:04:36.970> quarters<00:04:37.000> I<00:04:37.720> think

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
because it's 12-minute quarters I think

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.540 
because it's 12-minute quarters I think
that's<00:04:38.260> why<00:04:38.530> they're<00:04:38.830> rewarding<00:04:39.400> you<00:04:39.520> for
