00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:14.400
 I made poke pepper steak for cooking that would fit in full bra bloody berry. 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.400
 Ingredients 2 pieces pork shoulder loin thick cut 2 pieces (400 g) new onion 1 piece green asparagus 6 mini tomatoes 6 pieces garlic 2 pieces lemon 2/6 pieces salt 1 tsp 2 pieces of meat 1 piece of raspberry black pepper suitable amount olive oil 2 tablespoons Suntory brandy VO 2 tablespoons 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.400
 Cut the new onions in half and heat in a microwave (500 w) for 4 minutes. 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:50.400
 Peel the green asparagus leaving a third of the ears and cut it into bite-sized pieces. Garlic is crushed with the belly of the kitchen knife. 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:05.400
 Pork shoulder loin cuts at the edge of meat, between red meat and fat, at the end of the kitchen knife. The front and back, both sides, to prevent shrinkage by cutting. 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:26.400
 Just before baking, sprinkle salt and plenty of black pepper. 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:44.400
 Put olive oil and garlic in a frying pan and fry it slowly and transfer the aroma to the oil. At first it is medium heat, and when the temperature rises, it is a flame. 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:59.400
 Bring to a high heat and bake the pork. I will burn the eyes firmly while turning the oil. 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:33.400
 If it burns, turn it back and burn it on the other side. 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:50.400
 Turn off the stove if the other side gets burned (do not let the fire go). Pour Suntory Brandy VO and add vegetables. 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:10.400
 After putting the vegetables, cover and bake over low heat for 3 to 5 minutes. On the way, I will return the vegetables once or twice. 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:40.400
 After 3 minutes, put out the fire and take out the vegetables, and let the pork rest in a frying pan for 5 minutes. 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:59.400
 It is easy to eat pork, cut it and serve it with vegetables and lemon. 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.400
 The powerful and spicy pork steak was delicious in full bra, bloody and berry.
