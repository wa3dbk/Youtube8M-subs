00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
that will take 15 to 20 minutes depends

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.240 
that will take 15 to 20 minutes depends
on<00:04:08.540> how<00:04:08.720> many<00:04:08.780> photos<00:04:09.200> you<00:04:09.500> have<00:04:09.680> on<00:04:09.860> it

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
on how many photos you have on it

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.820 
on how many photos you have on it
this<00:04:10.880> could<00:04:11.090> take<00:04:11.210> upwards<00:04:11.450> of<00:04:11.840> 15<00:04:12.320> or<00:04:12.470> 20

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
this could take upwards of 15 or 20

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:19.580 
this could take upwards of 15 or 20
minutes

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.210 

so<00:04:20.160> now<00:04:20.310> you<00:04:20.370> see<00:04:20.730> that<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.150> did<00:04:22.049> say<00:04:22.350> encoding

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
so now you see that it did say encoding

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
so now you see that it did say encoding

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
takes 15 20 30 minutes but if you make

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.480 
takes 15 20 30 minutes but if you make
another<00:04:52.720> copy<00:04:52.930> right<00:04:53.200> now<00:04:53.380> it<00:04:53.710> will<00:04:53.890> pop<00:04:54.340> out

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.070 
you could make half a dozen copies in
the<00:04:59.140> time<00:04:59.380> that<00:04:59.560> it<00:04:59.650> takes<00:05:00.220> to<00:05:00.400> make<00:05:00.490> one<00:05:01.080> so

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
the time that it takes to make one so
