 hello friends welcome in this video my 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.759
 name is the elect and I had to be 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.550
 teaching how to solve this 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.790
 typical problem of when to be 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.960
 sharing your internet in the wifi zone 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.840
 laptop 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.730
 I will be showing in the typical role 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.099
 which tells us that mobile data 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.919
 mno are not available or not valid 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.839
 over first what we 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:28.169
 we must keep in mind is that 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:30.749
 we must be root users once 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.879
 being a root user, we're going to have to 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.739
 install apps together that I'm going 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.260

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.809

 the module eject and which one time 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.149
 installed we have to give you root access 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.780
 and go to the framework section 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.550
 we click on install update and 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.079
 we must be restarting our 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.280
 device 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.409
 once we restart our device 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.929

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:03.859

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.060
