00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.609
 here are ticks 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.460
 Here is such a package for us 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:25.260
 Bamboo in this you rolls we have two 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:31.080
 millimeter full clamp what is written 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:37.110
 that divorces two milliliters per 1 liter 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:39.960
 water contains no contents of the ampoule 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.300
 dilute in two liters of water with a large 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.170
 numbers per 1 liter of water we will be with 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:52.170
 you are divorced but 2 liters of water take 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:54.649
 our q q trampu opened two-liter 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.649
 a bottle 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:13.759
 pour out all the flour flour we 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:18.500
 bag back will need to tie here 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:27.439
 and all in kulechek and throw that all the same 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:29.560
 it says here that it is toxic therefore measures 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.770
 precautions still need 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:37.399
 follow 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:40.690
 so we poured a bottle that you can be like 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:48.380
 This is essentially any 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:51.890
 so different steps i take spray me 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:57.399
 right there is just some water and we bring 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.399

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.840
 throw out 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.480
 therefore it is not desirable after all 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.160
 use some bowls like this 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.070
 here is a simple eggplant which is not a pity 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.800

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:00.820
 with this prepared solution 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.040
 you can shed plants that is straight 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.970
 that's how you stand in the pot 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:10.590
