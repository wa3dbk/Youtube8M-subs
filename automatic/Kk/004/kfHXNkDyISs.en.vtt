00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
became more active he was able to get

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.780 
became more active he was able to get
free<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.299> lane<00:01:33.710> and<00:01:34.710> then<00:01:34.770> he<00:01:35.100> didn't<00:01:35.400> get<00:01:35.549> many

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
free in lane and then he didn't get many

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.490 
free in lane and then he didn't get many
looks<00:01:36.119> but<00:01:36.420> he<00:01:36.509> made<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> most<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> looks

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
looks but he made the most of the looks

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.710 
looks but he made the most of the looks
he<00:01:37.560> made<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> perimeter<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:38.759> once<00:01:39.450> he<00:01:39.540> got

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
he made on the perimeter so once he got

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.810 
he made on the perimeter so once he got
it<00:01:39.869> going<00:01:40.110> we<00:01:40.350> we<00:01:40.860> tried<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.220> go<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.369> him<00:01:41.700> but

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
it going we we tried to go to him but

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.639 
it going we we tried to go to him but
more<00:01:42.000> importantly<00:01:42.390> his<00:01:42.509> teammates<00:01:42.990> we're

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
more importantly his teammates we're

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.289 
more importantly his teammates we're
looking<00:01:43.950> for<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.490> think<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.030> know<00:01:45.119> we've<00:01:45.270> been

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
looking for I think you know we've been

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.830 
looking for I think you know we've been
playing<00:01:45.630> together<00:01:45.780> for<00:01:46.020> about

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
playing together for about

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.569 
playing together for about
so<00:01:47.109> I<00:01:47.320> think<00:01:47.409> our<00:01:47.710> chemistry<00:01:47.859> is<00:01:48.159> definitely

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
so I think our chemistry is definitely

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.569 
so I think our chemistry is definitely
improved<00:01:48.969> over<00:01:49.600> that<00:01:49.750> amount<00:01:50.020> of<00:01:50.140> time<00:01:50.579> and

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
improved over that amount of time and

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:52.800 
improved over that amount of time and
