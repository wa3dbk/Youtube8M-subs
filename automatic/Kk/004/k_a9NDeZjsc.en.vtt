00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.170
 welcome to the absolute women me 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.380
 it's ruth and me that's good to our 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.770
 goal is to have hair at 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.439
 natural healthy and that pushes the 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.410
 as soon as possible then for this 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.560
 do we start by getting rid of 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.450
 all harmful products and utensils 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.270
 for our hair 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:43.970
 so for products here we go 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:49.580
 ridding born be the anti fat 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:55.950
 itching care after shampoo 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:01:01.910
 shampoos baths satin not 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:09.930
 satin the young feed on 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:14.280
 Vitamin A Vitamin A which freezes the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:21.630
 so-called creams with products 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:27.000
 brilliantine milk plants still a 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.220
 times the care after shampooing that's it 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.070
 it's already for the products 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.970
 get rid of the end of the video 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.080
 will list all the ingredients 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.490
 that we do not want to find in our 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.450
 products is the reason why 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:50.220
 we threw our products afterwards 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:51.030
 for utensils then we have them 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.030
 elastic 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.549
 we have plenty of elastics 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.860
 that's very bad hair 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:05.250
 cling in trash we get 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.560
 rid of hair clips 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.860
 cling in and after they 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.860
 snapped 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.730
 curlers the same principle that the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.750
 pliers 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.310
 yes it makes very pretty cars 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:28.020
 but that's not ideal 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.670
 there are small teeth in which 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.590
 hair clings hair 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.660
 also hangs in there and then the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:41.520
 his rage so that we balance trash a 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.310
 another form of curlers to dance and 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.650
 small holes the hair not cling 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.000
 here the hair does not hang in 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.790
 the elastic hair can 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.430
 hang on snatch all the work 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.980
 done and put in the trash 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:01.470
 so we put curlers in the trash 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.540
 certainly is once again these 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.730
 have teeth the hair clings 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.110
 in and pulls 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.300
 that's wrong so trash bins 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.940
 this one too to iliad teeth is 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.010
 certain however so better 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:22.290
 to choose that does not tear my hair 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:24.060
 in small brush in which one 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.690
 can see that hair has 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.540
 hung the combs to small in in 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.600
 which hair again 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.250
 will hang on and could pour evening 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.170
 that many of us love 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.150
 so all that is to be done 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.000
 uses heat that will make 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.239
 your hair smooth or curly pretty 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.130
 english loops ca out of the question 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.130
 out of the question we throw 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.610
 those who go gold then you say my 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.409
 hair is so thick I need 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.569
 something better for the trouble 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.549
 so you have these little things that 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.930
 are brushes so already all we 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.970
 do not want to tear you away 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.329
 hair and at the same time it puts 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.110
 heat so double pain for your 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.569
 hair hair 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.489
 finally again it will cancel all 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.350
 your efforts you just washed the 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.380
 hair to put very good products 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.609
 and then you do that at the time of 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.830
 do nothing in your dreams of the cad 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.740
 live because that's going to make you 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.419
 fall the games so trash cans get 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.419
 also rid of all our 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.419
 cotton towels in all the one that 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.910
 we used for our hair 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.900
 I made a champions after with full 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.199
 good products 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.910
 if I come to mop my hair with the 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.669
 towel 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.430
 I'm ruining all the efforts I've made 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:51.310
 so do not wash my hair 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.970
 because all the water that I could put 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.110
 in my hair 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.830
 the profits that jenny will go away 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:03.010
 in the towel 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:07.830
 so I judge her then we get rid 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.830
 of all note of cotton pillow 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.039
 the reason is the same as for the 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.880
 towel 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:18.190
 so I put my oils for the evening at 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.770
 daily and I just put all my 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:24.010
 products all the hydration that has in 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.539
 my hair in the head what is 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.789
 interest 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:33.940
 yeah there is none so we 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:37.270
 get rid of the cotton head so here 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:41.229
 we did a great cleaning and there we 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:44.229
 can start from scratch with products 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:47.199
 and utensils a lot we adapt 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:50.409

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.360

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:21.000
