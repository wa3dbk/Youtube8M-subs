on the max trains yes we do and so what
do<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.250> pick<00:03:35.400> this<00:03:35.550> area<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:36.000> do<00:03:36.120> your

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
do you pick this area to do your

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.530 
do you pick this area to do your
training<00:03:36.690> or<00:03:36.900> one<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.440> trains<00:03:37.740> are<00:03:38.240> put<00:03:39.240> so

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
training or one the trains are put so

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.140 
training or one the trains are put so
they're<00:03:39.810> not<00:03:39.900> going<00:03:40.140> anywhere<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.890> that's<00:03:41.550> a

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
they're not going anywhere and that's a

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.580 
they're not going anywhere and that's a
good<00:03:42.330> place<00:03:42.570> it's<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:43.020> controlled<00:03:43.470> environment

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
good place it's a controlled environment

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.310 
good place it's a controlled environment
where<00:03:44.280> we<00:03:44.460> can<00:03:44.670> utilize<00:03:45.210> this<00:03:45.690> area<00:03:46.080> and

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
where we can utilize this area and

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.660 
where we can utilize this area and
that's<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.620> best<00:03:46.800> place<00:03:46.980> for<00:03:47.220> us<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.340> do<00:03:47.550> the

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
that's the best place for us to do the

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.590 
that's the best place for us to do the
train<00:03:49.130> so<00:03:50.130> typically<00:03:50.790> how<00:03:51.000> long<00:03:51.180> is<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:51.450> dog

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
train so typically how long is the dog

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.790 
train so typically how long is the dog
like<00:03:51.840> this<00:03:51.990> going<00:03:52.110> to<00:03:52.200> be<00:03:52.290> in<00:03:52.410> service<00:03:52.590> with

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
like this going to be in service with

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.100 
like this going to be in service with
the<00:03:53.010> well<00:03:53.670> typically<00:03:54.120> as<00:03:54.600> long<00:03:54.870> as<00:03:54.990> they're

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
the well typically as long as they're

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.560 
the well typically as long as they're
passing<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.860> yearly<00:03:56.240> certifications<00:03:57.240> and
