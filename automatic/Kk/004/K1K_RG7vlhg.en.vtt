00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.800 

life's<00:00:25.880> like<00:00:26.090> eight<00:00:26.750> years<00:00:26.810> ago<00:00:27.230> and<00:00:28.660> the<00:00:29.660> only

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
life's like eight years ago and the only

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.420 
life's like eight years ago and the only
I<00:00:29.990> was<00:00:30.110> able<00:00:30.230> to<00:00:30.380> get<00:00:30.560> it<00:00:30.710> down<00:00:30.920> really<00:00:31.220> and

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
I was able to get it down really and

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.950 
I was able to get it down really and
flight<00:00:31.730> successful<00:00:32.450> it<00:00:32.540> was<00:00:32.690> somebody

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
flight successful it was somebody

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.200 
flight successful it was somebody
holding<00:00:33.410> a<00:00:33.500> spotlight<00:00:34.010> on<00:00:34.070> it<00:00:34.400> so<00:00:35.030> that's

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
holding a spotlight on it so that's

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.150 
holding a spotlight on it so that's
where<00:00:35.450> I<00:00:35.480> got<00:00:35.720> the<00:00:35.900> idea<00:00:35.960> to<00:00:36.350> light<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.920> plane

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
where I got the idea to light the plane

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.190 
where I got the idea to light the plane
up<00:00:37.370> like<00:00:37.670> a<00:00:37.700> spotlight<00:00:38.120> rather<00:00:38.600> than<00:00:38.810> putting

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
up like a spotlight rather than putting

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.910 
up like a spotlight rather than putting
navigation<00:00:40.100> lights<00:00:40.340> on<00:00:40.580> it<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:42.500> idea<00:00:42.650> was

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
navigation lights on it and the idea was

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.830 
navigation lights on it and the idea was
there<00:00:43.309> I<00:00:43.580> just<00:00:43.610> never<00:00:43.970> had<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:44.270> ambition<00:00:44.540> to

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
there I just never had the ambition to

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.620 
there I just never had the ambition to
do<00:00:45.140> it<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:45.730> last<00:00:46.730> year<00:00:46.940> when<00:00:47.210> they<00:00:47.300> announced

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
do it and last year when they announced

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.120 
do it and last year when they announced
it<00:00:47.780> was<00:00:47.930> going<00:00:48.080> to<00:00:48.140> be<00:00:48.290> night<00:00:48.470> flying<00:00:48.800> I

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
it was going to be night flying I

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:58.120 
it was going to be night flying I
decided<00:00:49.910> to<00:00:50.150> do<00:00:50.300> it<00:00:50.420> for<00:00:50.570> this<00:00:50.690> year<00:00:52.030> I<00:00:57.040> have<00:00:58.040> a

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
decided to do it for this year I have a

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.550 
decided to do it for this year I have a
light<00:00:58.340> system<00:00:58.850> that<00:00:59.120> basically<00:00:59.270> bolts<00:01:00.110> on<00:01:00.290> to

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
light system that basically bolts on to

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.160 
light system that basically bolts on to
the<00:01:00.650> wing<00:01:00.830> tip<00:01:01.100> and<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.460> stab<00:01:01.730> tips<00:01:02.120> with<00:01:02.810> six

LEDs on each wing tip three on top three
on<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.070> bottom<00:01:07.869> basically<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:08.990> center<00:01:09.200> one

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
on the bottom basically the center one

points at the center of the wing the two
back<00:01:11.960> one's<00:01:12.259> pointed<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.890> back<00:01:13.100> bottom<00:01:14.000> of

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
back one's pointed the back bottom of

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.850 
back one's pointed the back bottom of
the<00:01:14.300> few<00:01:14.479> slides<00:01:14.720> top<00:01:14.990> of<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:15.229> vertical<00:01:15.650> fin

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
the few slides top of the vertical fin

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.160 
the few slides top of the vertical fin
in<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.190> front<00:01:16.460> of<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:16.670> nose<00:01:16.880> those<00:01:17.840> were<00:01:18.020> the

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
in the front of the nose those were the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.440 
in the front of the nose those were the
original<00:01:18.560> lights<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.369> original<00:01:19.790> idea<00:01:20.149> to

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
original lights the original idea to

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.660 
original lights the original idea to
light<00:01:20.630> up<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.840> plane<00:01:21.229> and<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:22.130> ones<00:01:22.460> on<00:01:22.640> the

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
light up the plane and the ones on the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.330 
light up the plane and the ones on the
stab<00:01:23.030> were<00:01:23.300> added<00:01:23.720> to<00:01:24.200> even<00:01:24.560> it<00:01:24.680> out<00:01:24.860> the

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
stab were added to even it out the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.090 
stab were added to even it out the
lights<00:01:25.580> weren't<00:01:25.820> finished<00:01:26.180> until<00:01:27.100> the

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
lights weren't finished until the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.820 
lights weren't finished until the
beginning<00:01:28.220> of<00:01:28.550> May<00:01:28.790> and<00:01:29.060> they<00:01:29.720> were<00:01:29.990> to<00:01:30.530> test

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
beginning of May and they were to test

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.980 
beginning of May and they were to test
flights<00:01:31.130> before<00:01:31.399> Joe<00:01:31.850> Nall<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.330> I<00:01:32.420> was<00:01:32.750> flown

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
flights before Joe Nall and I was flown

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.910 
flights before Joe Nall and I was flown
at<00:01:33.020> jonell<00:01:33.590> three<00:01:33.979> times<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:34.850> a<00:01:35.810> few<00:01:36.470> times<00:01:36.710> in

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
at jonell three times and a few times in

00:01:36.920 --> 00:02:06.430 
at jonell three times and a few times in
practice<00:01:37.399> before<00:01:37.970> last<00:01:38.390> night

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.859 

the<00:02:07.370> immediate<00:02:08.000> difference<00:02:08.119> we<00:02:08.390> find<00:02:08.600> a<00:02:08.690> nine

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
the immediate difference we find a nine

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.010 
the immediate difference we find a nine
days<00:02:09.130> death<00:02:10.130> perception<00:02:10.760> by<00:02:11.120> far<00:02:11.390> seeing<00:02:11.900> how

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
days death perception by far seeing how

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.860 
days death perception by far seeing how
far<00:02:12.050> out<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.500> airplane<00:02:12.770> is<00:02:12.980> from<00:02:13.250> yourself

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
far out the airplane is from yourself

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.110 
far out the airplane is from yourself
you<00:02:14.870> just<00:02:15.200> pretty<00:02:15.530> much<00:02:15.680> go<00:02:15.890> by<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.820> points<00:02:17.090> of

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
you just pretty much go by the points of

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.000 
you just pretty much go by the points of
light<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:17.390> have<00:02:17.420> on<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.690> plane<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.230> if

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
light you have on the plane and if

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.710 
light you have on the plane and if
you're<00:02:19.160> lucky<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.580> can<00:02:19.640> get<00:02:20.240> get<00:02:20.480> them<00:02:20.600> so

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
you're lucky you can get get them so

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.240 
you're lucky you can get get them so
they<00:02:20.810> light<00:02:21.020> up<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.290> airplane<00:02:21.560> as<00:02:21.800> well<00:02:22.040> that

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
they light up the airplane as well that

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.880 
they light up the airplane as well that
helps<00:02:22.430> out<00:02:22.700> quite<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:22.910> bit<00:02:23.740> yeah<00:02:24.740> this

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
helps out quite a bit yeah this

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.440 
helps out quite a bit yeah this
nighttime<00:02:25.160> competition<00:02:25.970> was<00:02:26.120> actually

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
nighttime competition was actually

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.730 
nighttime competition was actually
initiated<00:02:26.840> around<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.560> Joe<00:02:27.710> Nall

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
initiated around the the Joe Nall

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.740 
initiated around the the Joe Nall
timeframe<00:02:28.460> and<00:02:28.760> came<00:02:29.420> up<00:02:29.510> with<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.690> idea

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
timeframe and came up with the idea

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.600 
timeframe and came up with the idea
using<00:02:30.170> one<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.560> brand<00:02:30.740> new<00:02:30.920> magic<00:02:31.400> and

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
using one of the brand new magic and

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.570 
using one of the brand new magic and
chew<00:02:31.910> toys<00:02:32.150> for<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.260> you<00:02:33.920> can<00:02:34.040> see<00:02:34.160> it's<00:02:34.430> just

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
chew toys for that you can see it's just

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.120 
chew toys for that you can see it's just
narf<00:02:34.850> so<00:02:35.300> we<00:02:35.840> were<00:02:35.960> able<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.260> they<00:02:36.770> wasn't<00:02:37.040> put

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
narf so we were able to they wasn't put

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.610 
narf so we were able to they wasn't put
together<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.520> course<00:02:37.640> so<00:02:37.910> we<00:02:38.360> had<00:02:38.560> ample<00:02:39.560> time

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
together of course so we had ample time

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.980 
together of course so we had ample time
to<00:02:39.850> string<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:40.910> lights<00:02:40.940> up<00:02:41.300> get<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.630> all<00:02:41.750> wired

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
to string the lights up get it all wired

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.560 
to string the lights up get it all wired
and<00:02:42.320> all<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:42.860> stuff<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:44.060> we<00:02:44.210> actually<00:02:44.450> had

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
and all that stuff and we actually had

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
going with that which actually think

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.300 
going with that which actually think
worked<00:03:20.209> out<00:03:20.330> really<00:03:20.510> well<00:03:20.630> we<00:03:21.620> had<00:03:21.770> the<00:03:22.040> the

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
crowd really going into it we had the

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.600 
crowd really going into it we had the
music<00:03:23.780> blaring<00:03:23.959> there's<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:24.650> lot<00:03:24.800> of<00:03:24.830> fun<00:03:25.130> we

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
music blaring there's a lot of fun we

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.690 
music blaring there's a lot of fun we
got<00:03:25.760> a<00:03:25.790> nice<00:03:26.660> good<00:03:27.140> fly<00:03:27.980> right<00:03:28.340> through<00:03:28.370> the

got a nice good fly right through the
middle<00:03:28.850> of<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.150> fireworks<00:03:29.570> column<00:03:30.260> I<00:03:30.470> think

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
middle of the fireworks column I think

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.120 
middle of the fireworks column I think
the<00:03:32.780> downside<00:03:33.230> for<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.680> pilot<00:03:34.010> in<00:03:34.100> the

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
the downside for the pilot in the

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.030 
the downside for the pilot in the
situation<00:03:34.760> I'm<00:03:35.630> completely<00:03:36.230> concentrated<00:03:36.560> on

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
situation I'm completely concentrated on

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.190 
situation I'm completely concentrated on
the<00:03:37.130> airplane<00:03:37.489> so<00:03:37.640> I<00:03:37.730> have<00:03:37.880> no<00:03:38.269> idea<00:03:38.540> what<00:03:39.080> it

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200
