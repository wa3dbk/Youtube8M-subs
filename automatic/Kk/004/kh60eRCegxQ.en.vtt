lab<00:00:18.689> now<00:00:19.560> what<00:00:19.860> we're<00:00:20.010> going<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.279> do<00:00:20.550> is

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
lab now what we're going to do is

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.839 
lab now what we're going to do is
actually<00:00:21.180> run<00:00:21.810> an<00:00:22.110> iron<00:00:22.380> test<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.580> think

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849 
actually run an iron test and I think

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.370 
actually run an iron test and I think
you're<00:00:23.970> gonna<00:00:24.060> find<00:00:24.360> that<00:00:24.509> this<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.900> really

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
you're gonna find that this is a really

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.830 
you're gonna find that this is a really
easy<00:00:25.619> thing<00:00:25.770> to<00:00:26.040> do<00:00:26.509> what<00:00:27.509> we're<00:00:27.630> going<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.779> use

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840

really recommend these these transfer

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.419 
really recommend these these transfer
pipettes<00:00:58.019> makes<00:00:58.499> it<00:00:58.679> super<00:00:59.070> easy

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
pipettes makes it super easy

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.149 
pipettes makes it super easy
so<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.300> first<00:01:00.569> cuvee<00:01:01.319> you're<00:01:01.589> just<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:02.069> to

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
so the first cuvee you're just going to

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.930 
so the first cuvee you're just going to
leave<00:01:02.550> exactly<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:04.050> is<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:05.129> second<00:01:05.760> one

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
leave exactly like it is the second one

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.280 
leave exactly like it is the second one
you're<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.510> want<00:01:06.690> to<00:01:06.750> open<00:01:06.960> up<00:01:07.229> your

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
you're going to want to open up your

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.920 
you're going to want to open up your
reagents<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.760> frankly<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.600> most

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
reagents and this frankly is the most

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.540 
reagents and this frankly is the most
difficult<00:01:10.290> part<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> whole<00:01:11.250> dang<00:01:11.520> thing

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
difficult part of the whole dang thing

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.240 
difficult part of the whole dang thing
is<00:01:12.120> that<00:01:12.900> you've<00:01:13.020> got<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.380> get<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.770> powder

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
is that you've got to get this powder

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.760 
is that you've got to get this powder
out<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.180> reagent<00:01:16.940> envelope<00:01:18.229> into<00:01:19.229> your

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
out of the reagent envelope into your

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.700 
out of the reagent envelope into your
vial<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:21.030> make<00:01:21.240> sure<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.719> all<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> powder

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
vial so make sure that all of the powder

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.550 
vial so make sure that all of the powder
is<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.040> there<00:01:23.520> we<00:01:24.450> find<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.899> just<00:01:25.049> making<00:01:25.500> a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
is in there we find that just making a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.420 
is in there we find that just making a
little<00:01:25.740> corner<00:01:26.570> works<00:01:27.570> out<00:01:27.780> well<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.469> then<00:01:29.250> go

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
little corner works out well and then go

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.069 
little corner works out well and then go
in<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:30.119> make<00:01:30.329> sure<00:01:30.509> there's<00:01:30.840> nothing

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
in and just make sure there's nothing

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.120 
in and just make sure there's nothing
stuck<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.159> corners<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.829> get<00:01:34.829> all<00:01:35.070> that

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
stuck in the corners and get all that

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.690 
stuck in the corners and get all that
powder<00:01:36.030> into<00:01:36.930> your<00:01:37.049> test<00:01:37.289> tube<00:01:37.530> okay<00:01:37.979> once

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
powder into your test tube okay once

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.510 
powder into your test tube okay once
it's<00:01:38.850> there<00:01:38.969> put<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.600> cap<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:41.310> want

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
it's there put the cap on and you want

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.499 
it's there put the cap on and you want
to<00:01:41.610> shake<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:41.969> gently<00:01:42.719> for<00:01:43.289> about<00:01:43.320> two<00:01:44.130> minutes

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
to shake it gently for about two minutes

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.830 
to shake it gently for about two minutes
so<00:01:45.509> we're<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.289> gonna<00:01:46.560> whisk<00:01:46.950> ahead<00:01:47.430> with<00:01:47.840> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
so we're just gonna whisk ahead with the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.380 
so we're just gonna whisk ahead with the
magic<00:01:49.289> of<00:01:49.500> video<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.460> I'll<00:01:50.520> see<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.119> two

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
magic of video and I'll see you in two

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.910 
magic of video and I'll see you in two
minutes<00:01:52.520> okay<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:53.700> now<00:01:54.000> I've<00:01:54.270> got<00:01:54.479> my<00:01:54.810> two

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
minutes okay so now I've got my two

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.789 
minutes okay so now I've got my two
cuvees<00:01:56.210> one<00:01:57.210> with<00:01:57.570> just<00:01:58.020> system<00:01:58.350> water<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
cuvees one with just system water the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.770 
cuvees one with just system water the
other<00:01:58.829> one<00:01:59.130> with<00:01:59.310> system<00:01:59.670> water<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
other one with system water and the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.789 
other one with system water and the
reagent

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
reagent

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.419 
reagent
I'm<00:02:02.340> gonna<00:02:02.520> take<00:02:02.850> my<00:02:03.179> checker<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:04.219> hit<00:02:05.219> that

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
I'm gonna take my checker and hit that

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.029 
I'm gonna take my checker and hit that
black<00:02:05.700> button<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.420> front<00:02:06.770> first<00:02:07.770> thing

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
black button on the front first thing

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.450 
black button on the front first thing
that<00:02:08.190> happens<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.820> it<00:02:08.970> asks<00:02:09.630> for<00:02:09.720> c1<00:02:10.460> cuvee

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
that happens is it asks for c1 cuvee

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.390 
that happens is it asks for c1 cuvee
number<00:02:11.850> one<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.140> one<00:02:13.320> with<00:02:13.560> just<00:02:14.040> the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
number one this is the one with just the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
number one this is the one with just the
system<00:02:14.850> water

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
system water

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.750

we're<00:02:15.780> basically<00:02:16.190> calibrating<00:02:17.190> using<00:02:17.580> that

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
we're basically calibrating using that

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.740 
we're basically calibrating using that
so<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.690> put<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:19.050> in<00:02:19.230> hit<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.160> button<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.750> takes

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
so I put that in hit the button it takes

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.940 
so I put that in hit the button it takes
a<00:02:21.990> look<00:02:22.140> at<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.770> then<00:02:23.069> it<00:02:23.190> asks<00:02:23.370> for<00:02:23.670> c2

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
a look at it and then it asks for c2

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.580 
a look at it and then it asks for c2
take<00:02:25.950> one<00:02:26.250> out<00:02:26.430> put<00:02:26.849> two<00:02:27.659> in

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
take one out put two in

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.580 
take one out put two in
close<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.370> up<00:02:29.760> press<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.450> button<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.020> it's

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
close it up press the button and it's

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.080 
close it up press the button and it's
going<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.770> think<00:02:32.100> about<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.520> again

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
going to think about it again

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.160 
going to think about it again
and<00:02:33.620> then<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.950> comes<00:02:35.220> back<00:02:35.490> with<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:36.120> number<00:02:36.360> now

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
and then it comes back with a number now

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.530 
and then it comes back with a number now
this<00:02:37.440> came<00:02:37.680> back<00:02:37.920> with<00:02:38.360> 0.67

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
this came back with 0.67

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.690 
this came back with 0.67
yikes<00:02:40.020> that<00:02:40.709> tells<00:02:41.010> me<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.310> we<00:02:41.580> are

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
yikes that tells me that we are

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.690 
yikes that tells me that we are
definitely<00:02:42.000> iron<00:02:42.720> deficient<00:02:43.470> in<00:02:43.740> here<00:02:44.160> we

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
definitely iron deficient in here we

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.070 
definitely iron deficient in here we
should<00:02:44.940> have<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.450> 2.0<00:02:46.410> or<00:02:46.739> higher<00:02:47.510> so<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.540> need<00:02:48.900> to

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
should have a 2.0 or higher so I need to

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.620 
should have a 2.0 or higher so I need to
be<00:02:49.200> adding<00:02:49.650> some<00:02:49.950> of<00:02:50.100> our<00:02:50.220> aqua<00:02:50.700> iron<00:02:50.940> into

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
be adding some of our aqua iron into

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.090 
be adding some of our aqua iron into
these<00:02:51.810> systems<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:54.030> iron<00:02:54.540> checker<00:02:55.100> super

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
these systems so the iron checker super

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.729 
these systems so the iron checker super
useful<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:57.060> can<00:02:57.209> find<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.690> on<00:02:57.810> our<00:02:57.989> site<00:02:58.319> under

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
useful you can find it on our site under

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.699 
useful you can find it on our site under
run<00:02:59.340> your<00:02:59.610> system<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.420> then<00:03:00.959> testing

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
run your system and then testing

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.390 
run your system and then testing
supplies<00:03:02.209> thanks<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:03.330> much
