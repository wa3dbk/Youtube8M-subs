00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.250 
for a spinach and strawberry smoothie
but<00:04:19.859> my<00:04:20.070> strawberries<00:04:20.730> actually<00:04:21.359> had<00:04:21.600> mold<00:04:22.049> on

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
but my strawberries actually had mold on

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.770 
but my strawberries actually had mold on
them<00:04:22.440> so<00:04:22.740> I'm<00:04:22.890> using<00:04:23.130> a<00:04:23.490> mixed<00:04:24.090> berry<00:04:24.360> pack

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
them so I'm using a mixed berry pack

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.260 
them so I'm using a mixed berry pack
instead<00:04:25.530> so<00:04:26.220> I'm<00:04:26.280> just<00:04:26.460> blending<00:04:26.880> this<00:04:27.000> all

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
instead so I'm just blending this all

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:34.720 
instead so I'm just blending this all
together<00:04:27.419> and<00:04:27.870> putting<00:04:28.470> it<00:04:28.590> into<00:04:28.890> a<00:04:29.460> mason<00:04:30.300> jar

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.760 

then<00:04:35.730> I<00:04:35.820> like<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.180> go<00:04:36.300> back<00:04:36.690> into<00:04:36.930> my<00:04:37.080> room<00:04:37.500> and
