I get for you video tasting I think a
video<00:00:04.319> taping<00:00:05.569> well<00:00:07.519> this<00:00:08.519> is<00:00:08.820> very<00:00:10.130> close<00:00:11.130> now

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
video taping well this is very close now

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.160 
video taping well this is very close now
to<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.179> final<00:00:13.099> robotics<00:00:14.599> solution<00:00:15.599> using<00:00:15.990> the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
to the final robotics solution using the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.939 
to the final robotics solution using the
t-mobile<00:00:16.740> g1<00:00:17.840> you'll<00:00:18.840> notice<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.740> is

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
t-mobile g1 you'll notice it is

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.679 
t-mobile g1 you'll notice it is
completely<00:00:20.400> self<00:00:20.789> powered<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.170> running

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
completely self powered it is running

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.830 
completely self powered it is running
off<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:25.289> phone<00:00:25.890> I'm<00:00:26.310> doing<00:00:26.939> live<00:00:27.180> broadcast

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
off the phone I'm doing live broadcast

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.310 
off the phone I'm doing live broadcast
of<00:00:28.109> qik<00:00:29.539> he's<00:00:30.539> videotaping<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:32.420> and<00:00:33.420> then

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
of qik he's videotaping it and then

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.340 
of qik he's videotaping it and then
pulling<00:00:34.800> out<00:00:34.920> video<00:00:35.219> tape<00:00:35.460> here<00:00:35.700> now<00:00:36.020> okay<00:00:37.020> we

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
pulling out video tape here now okay we

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.209 
pulling out video tape here now okay we
can<00:00:37.559> focus<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.670> happy<00:00:39.090> little<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:41.040> have

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
can focus on the happy little is I have

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.319 
can focus on the happy little is I have
a<00:00:41.250> Python<00:00:42.239> program<00:00:42.870> that's<00:00:43.260> just<00:00:43.500> enough<00:00:44.329> 100

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
a Python program that's just enough 100

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.069 
a Python program that's just enough 100
loop<00:00:45.590> where<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:48.920> sending<00:00:49.920> F<00:00:50.460> X<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.300> B<00:00:51.480> you'll

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
loop where it's sending F X and B you'll

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.340 
loop where it's sending F X and B you'll
notice<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.860> will<00:00:53.129> stop<00:00:54.140> then<00:00:55.140> go

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
notice that this will stop then go

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.860 
notice that this will stop then go
forward<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.039> then<00:00:56.160> go<00:00:56.340> backward<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.210> takes<00:00:57.480> 20

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
forward and then go backward it takes 20

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.900 
forward and then go backward it takes 20
seconds<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.940> ya<00:01:00.840> see<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.140> stopped

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
seconds to do so so ya see it stopped

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:11.870 
seconds to do so so ya see it stopped
now<00:01:03.170> it's<00:01:04.170> going<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> go<00:01:04.619> forward<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:11.430> now<00:01:11.640> it's

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
now it's going to go forward so now it's

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.380 
now it's going to go forward so now it's
going<00:01:12.119> right<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.619> see<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.820> then<00:01:15.210> you'll

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
going right you can see and then you'll

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.990 
going right you can see and then you'll
see<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.840> reverses<00:01:16.799> direction<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.610> about

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
see that it reverses direction and about

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.630 
see that it reverses direction and about
10<00:01:18.299> seconds

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
10 seconds

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.710 
10 seconds
okay<00:01:21.640> this<00:01:22.150> reverse<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:24.430> then<00:01:25.240> if<00:01:25.360> you<00:01:25.450> notice

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
okay this reverse so then if you notice

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:33.060 
okay this reverse so then if you notice
the<00:01:25.870> phone<00:01:26.110> here<00:01:26.440> it<00:01:26.590> is<00:01:26.710> running<00:01:26.950> qik<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:32.070> all

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
the phone here it is running qik and all

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.719 
the phone here it is running qik and all
I<00:01:33.130> need<00:01:33.460> to<00:01:33.490> do<00:01:33.760> now<00:01:34.000> is<00:01:34.390> I<00:01:34.780> need<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.550> hook<00:01:36.550> up

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
I need to do now is I need to hook up

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.390 
I need to do now is I need to hook up
another<00:01:36.910> motor<00:01:37.479> which<00:01:37.840> I<00:01:38.020> have<00:01:38.290> I<00:01:38.680> need<00:01:39.310> to

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
another motor which I have I need to

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.730 
another motor which I have I need to
attach<00:01:39.729> them<00:01:40.000> to<00:01:40.119> both<00:01:40.330> sides<00:01:40.660> mount<00:01:41.500> the

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
attach them to both sides mount the

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.810 
attach them to both sides mount the
phone<00:01:42.040> and<00:01:42.570> then<00:01:43.570> make<00:01:44.350> a<00:01:44.380> socket<00:01:44.979> program<00:01:45.520> and

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
phone and then make a socket program and

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.940 
phone and then make a socket program and
I'll<00:01:45.940> be<00:01:46.180> having<00:01:46.450> a<00:01:46.900> remote<00:01:47.440> control

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
I'll be having a remote control

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:58.980 
I'll be having a remote control
telepresence<00:01:48.520> robot<00:01:57.479> well<00:01:58.479> that's<00:01:58.750> it
