00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.809
 hi guys segel and today we 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.870
 find myself for my first video on 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:18.380
 gta 5 and it's a glitch video that 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:21.710
 is to bring in a vehicle 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.100
 finally a vehicle of cops 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.820
 a fire engine an ambulance 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.320
 gign thing 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.680
 finally I will put everything in the 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.280
 description in his garage so then 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:39.079
 to do this you call 911 in 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.690
 your contacts that they are there are the 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.129
 relief so you want him to call they 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.660
 will you answer you choose 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.149
 that she vehicle 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.640
 I have to have the cops normally 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:52.730
 want to escape and then you come 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.770
 here in front of your apartment in front of 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.629
 any garage that works you 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.640
 you stick to the garage and you go down 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.440
 so you get back his glitch normally 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.840
 there is a small part coming in 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.729
 in the garage the pledge does not open 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.299
 and you will go into your 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.000
 apartment 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.000
 that's when you're here you come out 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.730
 once before the 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.730
 no you go in front of the garage 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.299
 and then you have to look at it 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.469
 aim back because if you 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:34.110
 approach you will go into our 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:36.369
 garage so you were looking back hop 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.049
 and when you're next to the door 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.049
 you make very long 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.400
 so it did not work 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.039
 then what 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.270
 r so normally you're going back 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:04.539
 in your vehicle and he will you 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:06.969
 ask to replace a vehicle up 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.959
 so you aim back at us 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.230
 approach the door 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:13.870
 hop to enter here I managed 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.069
 so full garage you have to replace 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.480
 a vehicle to be able to park the 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.480
 current vehicle does ok 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.540
 once it's done you go 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.040
 arrive 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.959

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.689
 you replace your car 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.579
 so this garage has to be full 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:35.909
 otherwise it will not work so you 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:40.670
