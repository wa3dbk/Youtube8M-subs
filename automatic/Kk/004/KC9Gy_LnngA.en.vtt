 six of the injured were transferred

 in very serious condition 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.450

 terrible tragedy 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.380
 20 year old 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:04.260
 and 20 people followed to take 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.260
 conscience if you still did not leave 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.229
 we must be aware of all young people 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.430
 They were waiting after a drop 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.390
 which makes it perhaps difficult 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.390
 to be able to see 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.780
 but a work of awareness of not 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.730
 stop not waiting in any route to the 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.970

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.240
 next service station because 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.240
 these things happen 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.630
 you have to take a lot of precaution about 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.150
 all in a lot of people who are 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.280
 returning others that have not yet 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.240
 they were but you have to take a lot 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.240
 awareness at the wheel
