00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.809
 and the synchronization and connection 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.030
 automatic emergency generators 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.490
 to a common bar is possible from the 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.560
 technical point of view as it is also 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.510
 feasible its implementation from the 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.310
 economic point of view 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.420
 let's start from the base that we know 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.840
 perfectly the conditions 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.760
 elementals of the operation and 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.460
 parallelism conditions 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.970
 such as there must be equality of 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.170
 voltage must exist equal 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:43.739
 there must be equality in the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.330
 in the in the sequence of the phases of what 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.850
 earlier you can also say that for 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.220
 buy a generator unit the rest 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.620
 of the system must even be met 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.200
 all these conditions including the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.150
 equal power of the equipment 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.210
 which would be 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.370
 an ideal condition the beginning in 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.110
 present of this condition corresponds to 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.930
 the operating policy of each system 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.430
 control center and the center 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.950
 distribution 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.930
 however in the most elementary sense 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.690
 it can be said that if the generators 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.090
 are equal the charges are distributed in 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.730
 equal parts if instead the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.520
 generators have the powers 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.040
 different active and reactive power 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.800
 of the cargo are distributed in 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.630
 proportional to the power for each 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.759
 generator 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.369
 when two units are placed in 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.119
 parallel circulating currents appear 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:44.550
 these streams do not do a job 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:47.410
 useful but circulate between generators 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.570
 determining the total amperage and 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.890
 subtracting from the toll it is making to 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.890
 the load we can calculate 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.400
 the circulating currents are caused 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.890
 due to voltage differences between 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.530
 units in parallel that's why we should 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.310
 be careful in that the streets of the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.500
 speed of the governors be equal 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.709
 it is very important to understand two facts 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.690
 basic about the distribution of 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.340
 charges between securities operating in 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.470
 parallel 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.390
 first the power supply in the 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.670
 now and therefore to the load is function 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.770
 the motor 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.599
 the adjustments in the speed of the 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.550
 governor determine the amount of 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.730
 power delivered by the engine and 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.409
 kilowatts supplied by 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.940
 if we increase the speed of the 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.950
 engine governor controls in 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.860
 general will now assume more kilowatts of 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.110
 load if on the contrary we decrease the 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.720
 generator speed this too 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.720
 will decrease your ability to take charge
