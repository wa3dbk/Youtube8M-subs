00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389 
things now for the bad the software has

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.449 
things now for the bad the software has
many<00:02:41.780> floors<00:02:42.049> sometimes<00:02:42.799> it'll<00:02:42.950> randomly

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
stuff like that happens probably will be

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.509 
stuff like that happens probably will be
able<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:47.989> be<00:02:48.319> fixed<00:02:48.650> with<00:02:48.799> a<00:02:48.829> software<00:02:49.310> patch

another<00:02:50.090> thing<00:02:50.269> that<00:02:50.299> bothers<00:02:50.630> me<00:02:50.630> is<00:02:50.810> if<00:02:51.139> you

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
another thing that bothers me is if you

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.840 
another thing that bothers me is if you
set<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.560> color<00:02:51.769> to<00:02:51.980> white<00:02:52.160> you're<00:02:52.519> able<00:02:52.639> to

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
set the color to white you're able to

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.819 
set the color to white you're able to
see<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.209> red<00:02:53.510> green<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:53.840> blue<00:02:54.019> in<00:02:54.440> between

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
see the red green and blue in between

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.199 
see the red green and blue in between
some<00:02:55.010> of<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.160> keys<00:02:55.310> it's<00:02:55.760> not<00:02:55.850> too<00:02:56.030> bad

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
some of the keys it's not too bad

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.309 
some of the keys it's not too bad
especially<00:02:56.750> if<00:02:56.810> you're<00:02:56.930> not<00:02:57.019> going<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.230> be

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
especially if you're not going to be

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.500 
especially if you're not going to be
using<00:02:57.500> light<00:02:57.829> but<00:02:58.160> it's<00:02:58.519> a<00:02:58.670> minor<00:02:59.150> flaw<00:02:59.480> that

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
using light but it's a minor flaw that

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.569 
using light but it's a minor flaw that
it<00:02:59.780> has<00:03:00.019> another<00:03:00.560> thing<00:03:00.859> that<00:03:01.040> disappointed

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
it has another thing that disappointed

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.940 
it has another thing that disappointed
me<00:03:01.730> was<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.389> logo<00:03:02.690> change<00:03:03.019> that<00:03:03.350> course<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:03.769> did

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
me was the logo change that course I did

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.559 
me was the logo change that course I did
I<00:03:04.100> think<00:03:04.489> if<00:03:04.670> they<00:03:04.880> just<00:03:05.030> stuck<00:03:05.239> with<00:03:05.269> their

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
I think if they just stuck with their

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.059 
I think if they just stuck with their
original<00:03:05.660> logo<00:03:06.200> I<00:03:06.560> reckon<00:03:06.829> it<00:03:06.889> would<00:03:06.980> have

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
original logo I reckon it would have

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.379 
original logo I reckon it would have
been<00:03:07.130> better<00:03:07.190> but<00:03:07.609> you<00:03:07.819> can<00:03:08.030> find<00:03:08.269> the

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
been better but you can find the

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.750 
been better but you can find the
keyboard<00:03:08.780> with<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.319> original<00:03:09.470> logo<00:03:09.859> in<00:03:10.250> some

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
keyboard with the original logo in some

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.550 
keyboard with the original logo in some
countries<00:03:11.150> I<00:03:11.299> had<00:03:11.510> no<00:03:11.690> luck<00:03:11.930> in<00:03:11.959> Australia

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
countries I had no luck in Australia

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.710 
countries I had no luck in Australia
pretty<00:03:12.980> sure<00:03:13.099> in<00:03:13.190> America<00:03:13.639> and<00:03:13.849> UK<00:03:14.269> I<00:03:14.299> believe

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
pretty sure in America and UK I believe

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.120 
pretty sure in America and UK I believe
they<00:03:14.870> have<00:03:15.019> them<00:03:15.170> there<00:03:15.349> are<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:15.650> few<00:03:15.950> other

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
they have them there are a few other

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.370 
they have them there are a few other
options<00:03:16.310> like<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:17.180> razer<00:03:17.510> blackwidow<00:03:17.780> chroma

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
options like the razer blackwidow chroma

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.860 
options like the razer blackwidow chroma
and<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.950> logitech<00:03:19.400> g9<00:03:19.819> 10<00:03:20.090> but<00:03:20.480> they're<00:03:20.780> all

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
and the logitech g9 10 but they're all

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.599 
and the logitech g9 10 but they're all
different<00:03:21.079> it<00:03:21.560> all<00:03:21.769> comes<00:03:21.920> down<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.160> personal

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
different it all comes down to personal

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.490 
different it all comes down to personal
preference<00:03:23.000> I<00:03:23.359> think<00:03:23.720> also<00:03:23.900> did<00:03:24.230> a<00:03:24.260> really

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
preference I think also did a really

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.960 
preference I think also did a really
good<00:03:24.650> job<00:03:24.709> with<00:03:24.889> the<00:03:25.100> keyboard<00:03:25.310> certainly<00:03:25.850> one

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
good job with the keyboard certainly one

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.909 
good job with the keyboard certainly one
of<00:03:26.000> most<00:03:26.180> anticipated<00:03:26.509> keyboards<00:03:27.470> ever<00:03:27.650> made

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:27.919 
of most anticipated keyboards ever made

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.920 
of most anticipated keyboards ever made
and<00:03:28.160> it's<00:03:28.669> for<00:03:28.850> a<00:03:28.880> good<00:03:29.000> reason

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
and it's for a good reason

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.599 
and it's for a good reason
it's<00:03:30.170> built<00:03:30.349> like<00:03:30.409> a<00:03:30.500> tank<00:03:30.620> doesn't<00:03:31.280> feel<00:03:31.519> like
