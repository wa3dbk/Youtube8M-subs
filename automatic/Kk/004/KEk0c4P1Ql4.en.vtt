00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
 if there is a big shock, the fire brigade needs a lot of water as with 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.250
 this exercise on a tank with lpg 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.850
 part of that water comes from the pipeline network of vitesse das 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.899
 tap water that lasts and I use it at home 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:18.199
 vitesse wants to provide healthy drinking water and to achieve that, the 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.140
 Pipes become thinner so that the water flows harder the meters lower on it 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.619
 square 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.449
 to get a bit higher in the middle in that way 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.390
 what aunt good comes from the water quality 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.910
 the fire brigade has gladly led this, I can quickly get a lot of water through 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.350
 this is also stated in this report 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.950
 nevertheless, the security region of utrecht says that the church has nothing to worry about 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.890
 course participants and teachers are keen on both aspects 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.210
 You can tell I just had drinking water 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.360
 the torque for sufficient extinguishing water 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.350
 and pointer to yes we think in terms of measurements from our point of view 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.790
 unless you then ultimately the citizen has an interest in both 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.230
 and good drinking water 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.590
 and if safety is at stake the case of fire safety is there 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.220
 contain insufficient 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.760
 dieter pÃ¶tsch prepared by administrative law expert outlines a whole 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.770
 different picture 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.680
 they are devastating about how vitesse the fire department communicate with each other there 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.880
 stands among others 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.020
 there was not always a cooperative attitude on the part 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.170
 of vitesse 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.829
 there is insufficient knowledge among fire brigades and vitesse of each other's work 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.910
 there is too little empathy for the interests of the other 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.100
 the question then is whether there are new pipelines 2 in our region 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.700
 the small pipes are used 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.550
 the department always looks for that 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.790
 simultaneously to the prison that is left 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.350
 the alderman 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.680
 peck that 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.920
 It is not that we also just say all these things with children 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.840
 that is our pursuit of smaller ones 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.740
 and sooner or later we will send Paris to 50 9 and then your head will come off 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.970
 heels ahead 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.049
 in front of the camera, the security region says that there is enough fire extinguisher everywhere 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.619
 but they don't write anything else in their own annual reports 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.410
 more often proceeded to reduce the ten-year meters of the pipelines with 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.720
 as a result, problems for the water supply of fire extinguishing water 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.009
 and then the communication and cooperation between the two 

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.879
 Yes 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.289
 well, as far as I'm concerned, these collaborations have been good 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:28.309
 of which in 2012 their third album from much more often even more 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:30.950
 the lord of vitesse 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.269
 and the security region of utrecht agree with each other there is no problem 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:35.980
 strange because 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.039
 this very substantial report 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.979
 sketch another image there are problems 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:42.699
 do we have to worry 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.629
 well for a small fire in the home or so the fire department really does 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.029
 enough water 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:51.059
 very large fires a special circumstances says the report would it 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:53.509
 It can happen that the fire brigade has too little water
