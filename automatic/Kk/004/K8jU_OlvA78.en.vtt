00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
see here in the patch so far we do

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.200 
see here in the patch so far we do
actually<00:01:42.990> pull<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.320> David<00:01:43.860> via<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.850> then<00:01:45.090> this

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
actually pull a David via and then this

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.330 
actually pull a David via and then this
next<00:01:45.480> pack<00:01:45.630> we<00:01:45.750> could<00:01:45.900> pull<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.980> a<00:01:47.100> rottie

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
next pack we could pull a it's a rottie

and<00:01:47.580> I<00:01:47.610> don't<00:01:47.790> actually<00:01:48.000> know<00:01:48.090> how<00:01:48.270> much<00:01:48.480> David

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.390 
and I don't actually know how much David
Villa's<00:01:48.960> going<00:01:49.260> for<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.710> think<00:01:50.130> he's<00:01:50.250> probably

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
Villa's going for I think he's probably

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.700 
Villa's going for I think he's probably
gonna<00:01:50.610> go<00:01:50.790> around<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.360> 35<00:01:51.840> k<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.170> 40k

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
gonna go around for like 35 k to 40k

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.350 
gonna go around for like 35 k to 40k
somewhere<00:01:53.400> around<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.670> mark<00:01:53.909> that's<00:01:54.060> all<00:01:54.300> I

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
somewhere around that mark that's all I

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.210 
somewhere around that mark that's all I
can<00:01:54.420> imagine<00:01:54.690> but<00:01:55.560> we<00:01:55.620> do<00:01:55.710> actually<00:01:55.800> get<00:01:56.070> quite

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
can imagine but we do actually get quite

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.680 
can imagine but we do actually get quite
a<00:01:56.340> few<00:01:56.400> decent<00:01:56.610> players<00:01:56.940> you<00:01:57.180> know<00:01:57.300> we<00:01:57.420> get<00:01:57.570> to

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
a few decent players you know we get to

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.080 
a few decent players you know we get to
needle<00:01:58.020> her<00:01:58.050> as<00:01:58.320> well<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.430> surprise<00:02:00.060> surprise

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
needle her as well and surprise surprise

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.300 
needle her as well and surprise surprise
we<00:02:00.630> do<00:02:00.720> actually<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.020> an<00:02:01.110> in-form<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.830> one<00:02:02.280> of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
we do actually get an in-form in one of

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.770 
we do actually get an in-form in one of
these<00:02:02.430> packs<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:02.970> keep<00:02:03.210> your<00:02:03.300> eyes<00:02:03.450> peeled<00:02:03.720> for

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
these packs so keep your eyes peeled for

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.110 
these packs so keep your eyes peeled for
that<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.200> think<00:02:04.950> he<00:02:05.040> does<00:02:05.190> go<00:02:05.340> for<00:02:05.520> around<00:02:05.610> 30<00:02:05.970> to

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
that I think he does go for around 30 to

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.050 
that I think he does go for around 30 to
40<00:02:06.390> k<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:06.600> pretty<00:02:07.380> impressive<00:02:07.740> stuff<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.759> it's

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
40 k so pretty impressive stuff and it's

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.729 
40 k so pretty impressive stuff and it's
going<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.239> obviously<00:02:09.450> allow<00:02:09.780> me<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.050> use<00:02:10.200> them

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
going to obviously allow me to use them

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.350 
going to obviously allow me to use them
coins<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.400> like<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> squid<00:02:12.090> build<00:02:12.269> or

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
coins it in like a squid build or

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.240 
coins it in like a squid build or
something<00:02:12.629> but<00:02:12.870> actually<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.920> know<00:02:14.010> once

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
something but actually you know once

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.910 
something but actually you know once
you've<00:02:14.430> actually<00:02:14.550> seen<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:16.530> player<00:02:16.769> that

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920

bit<00:02:38.099> i<00:02:38.129> can<00:02:38.310> imagine<00:02:38.459> good<00:02:38.700> death<00:02:38.879> you<00:02:39.000> going

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
bit i can imagine good death you going

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.539 
bit i can imagine good death you going
for<00:02:39.330> about<00:02:39.390> three<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.810> 4k<00:02:40.190> will<00:02:41.190> she<00:02:41.340> obviously

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
for about three to 4k will she obviously

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.550 
for about three to 4k will she obviously
go<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.760> about<00:02:41.970> 1<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.299> 2<00:02:42.360> k<00:02:42.569> so<00:02:42.629> not<00:02:43.019> amazing<00:02:43.530> but

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
go to about 1 to 2 k so not amazing but

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.380
