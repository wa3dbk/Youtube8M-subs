00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.580
 and opened the market still open but us 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.230
 we have the word of the president who 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.830
 remains here some fans can stay 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.299
 quiet 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.420
 yes yes yes yes they told us the presidence 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.550
 a couple of times I am not too 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.759
 quiet 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.500
 hopefully also to stay you would never have 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.109
 thought of your arrival in parma that 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.509
 you would have conquered all the fans 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.829
 so also above all with yours 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.980
 performance but has established a 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.640
 feeling maybe that goes beyond 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.659
 also thought 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.310
 I think that people beyond say 

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:41.960
 performance 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.900
 I don't know with us Argentines and 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.450
 South Americans has a different relationship 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.200
 special 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.750
 I think this also counts 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.910
 this parma is becoming useless 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.640
 deny the name of cassano raised a little 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.450
 this as you are living 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.320
 this this moment not for not having 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:11.420
 antonio with us very important I think 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:16.340
 than those of the strongest players 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:22.160
 that there are in this year that are the 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:26.030
 last years in series and we hope to in 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.610
 form and with the desire to do good by the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.880
 your name has circulated in association with 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.070
 that of big clubs so maybe for 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.960
 you talk about a year like that of 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.300
 definitive consecration does not have either 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.740
 sense there is gabriel palette is already a top 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.570
 player 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:48.040
 no I don't think that yet 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:52.670
 so much to improve to learn too 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.650
 I always have always said that every 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.910
 match and every workout for sure 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.440
 a little bit yes if 10 to learn this 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.930
 the dream remains for some this year 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.310
 more goal is Safe quell last year 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:10.220
 I only did one and two years ago 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.550
 had done still had done three or 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.280
 four misses to 5 we hope to improve 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.780
 at this stage and then there is a gap e 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.300
 pallet that in the year of the centenary 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.390
 could also become dad we talk 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.390
 to the conditional 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:31.940
 yes yes we say in two months time it arrives 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:36.200
 these are the daughters we wanted to give 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:39.470
 we are very happy a few years ago 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.410
 happy Sabastio both faith you have 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.340

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.340
