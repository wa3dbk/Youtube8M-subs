to see through things this kind of
radiation<00:02:01.619> isn't<00:02:02.550> x-ray<00:02:03.239> it's<00:02:03.599> a<00:02:03.690> much<00:02:03.869> lower

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
radiation isn't x-ray it's a much lower

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
you and there is right there terahertz

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.360 
you and there is right there terahertz
it's<00:02:15.690> just<00:02:15.989> above<00:02:16.290> microwave<00:02:16.650> radiation

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370

radar and radio sending something out is

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.400 
radar and radio sending something out is
like<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.760> flesh<00:02:21.150> ball<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:21.900> have<00:02:22.260> in

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
like the the flesh ball that you have in

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.320 
like the the flesh ball that you have in
the<00:02:22.470> camera<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.459> what<00:02:23.670> happens<00:02:24.030> when<00:02:24.120> you

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
the camera this is what happens when you

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.470 
the camera this is what happens when you
flash<00:02:24.660> terahertz<00:02:25.230> into<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.099> wallet<00:02:26.700> take<00:02:27.360> an

flash terahertz into a wallet take an
ordinary<00:02:27.720> envelope<00:02:28.500> add<00:02:28.739> terahertz<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.700> you

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
ordinary envelope add terahertz and you

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.760 
ordinary envelope add terahertz and you
see<00:02:30.120> what's<00:02:30.330> inside<00:02:30.540> Winston's<00:02:31.440> if<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.680> have

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
see what's inside Winston's if you have

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.040 
see what's inside Winston's if you have
a<00:02:31.800> piece<00:02:32.069> of<00:02:32.099> chocolate<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:33.390> if<00:02:33.840> there<00:02:34.020> are

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
a piece of chocolate and if there are

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.050 
a piece of chocolate and if there are
hidden<00:02:34.410> objects<00:02:35.040> in<00:02:35.160> there<00:02:35.370> like<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.730> piece<00:02:36.030> of

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
hidden objects in there like a piece of

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.790 
hidden objects in there like a piece of
blade<00:02:36.420> or<00:02:36.629> something<00:02:36.989> like<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.140> I'd<00:02:37.500> want<00:02:37.560> to

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
blade or something like that I'd want to

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.340 
blade or something like that I'd want to
go<00:02:37.890> into<00:02:38.069> like<00:02:38.280> all<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.550> scientific

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
go into like all the scientific

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.630 
go into like all the scientific
buildings<00:02:39.710> and<00:02:39.980> see<00:02:40.160> what<00:02:40.280> they're<00:02:40.430> working

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
buildings and see what they're working

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.880 
buildings and see what they're working
on<00:02:40.910> in<00:02:41.240> CIA<00:02:41.600> headquarters<00:02:41.990> yeah<00:02:42.560> yeah

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
on in CIA headquarters yeah yeah

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.350 
on in CIA headquarters yeah yeah
definitely<00:02:43.400> what<00:02:43.550> are<00:02:43.700> they<00:02:43.790> building<00:02:43.940> in

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
definitely what are they building in

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.130 
definitely what are they building in
there's<00:02:44.600> crazy<00:02:45.170> ideas<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:46.010> superpowers<00:02:47.140> but

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
there's crazy ideas and superpowers but

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.960 
there's crazy ideas and superpowers but
you<00:02:48.380> know<00:02:48.470> eventually<00:02:48.620> those<00:02:49.370> are<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.670> kind

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
you know eventually those are the kind

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.970 
you know eventually those are the kind
of<00:02:50.090> imaginations<00:02:50.960> that<00:02:51.230> sucs<00:02:51.530> sort<00:02:51.800> of<00:02:51.860> got

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
of imaginations that sucs sort of got

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.010 
of imaginations that sucs sort of got
buried<00:02:52.370> in<00:02:52.490> to<00:02:52.700> me<00:02:52.790> dr.<00:02:53.210> o<00:02:53.240> says<00:02:53.600> you<00:02:53.750> can<00:02:53.900> use

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
buried in to me dr. o says you can use

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.750 
buried in to me dr. o says you can use
the<00:02:54.200> Superman<00:02:54.680> vision<00:02:55.070> in<00:02:55.190> your<00:02:55.280> phone<00:02:55.520> to

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
the Superman vision in your phone to

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.940 
the Superman vision in your phone to
detect<00:02:56.120> counterfeit<00:02:56.630> cash<00:02:56.930> cracks<00:02:57.710> and

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
detect counterfeit cash cracks and

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.600 
detect counterfeit cash cracks and
artwork<00:02:58.460> or<00:02:58.760> just<00:02:59.210> maybe<00:02:59.600> scan<00:03:00.470> yourself<00:03:00.950> for

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
artwork or just maybe scan yourself for

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.120 
artwork or just maybe scan yourself for
detection<00:03:02.000> of<00:03:02.180> things<00:03:02.720> like<00:03:02.900> skin<00:03:03.350> cancer<00:03:03.830> but

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
detection of things like skin cancer but

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.950 
detection of things like skin cancer but
since<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.460> have<00:03:04.490> to<00:03:04.670> be<00:03:04.790> very<00:03:04.820> close<00:03:05.660> to<00:03:05.930> the

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
since you have to be very close to the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.990 
since you have to be very close to the
object<00:03:06.170> you're<00:03:06.680> scanning<00:03:07.130> see<00:03:07.580> what<00:03:07.700> we<00:03:07.790> got

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
object you're scanning see what we got

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.260 
object you're scanning see what we got
here<00:03:08.270> oh<00:03:08.710> it's<00:03:09.710> unlikely<00:03:10.460> you'll<00:03:10.880> be<00:03:11.000> able<00:03:11.120> to

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
here oh it's unlikely you'll be able to

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.240 
here oh it's unlikely you'll be able to
see<00:03:11.540> through<00:03:11.750> clothes<00:03:12.200> well<00:03:12.590> you<00:03:12.860> know<00:03:12.980> you

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
see through clothes well you know you

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.460 
see through clothes well you know you
are<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.400> person<00:03:13.940> has<00:03:14.270> to<00:03:14.450> be<00:03:14.570> pretty<00:03:15.230> well

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
are the person has to be pretty well
