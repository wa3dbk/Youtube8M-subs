so<00:00:12.080> this<00:00:12.260> is<00:00:12.290> entree<00:00:12.920> which<00:00:13.400> was<00:00:14.139> arranged<00:00:15.139> for

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
so this is entree which was arranged for

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.029 
so this is entree which was arranged for
the<00:00:15.559> hearts

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
the hearts

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.759 
the hearts
ordered<00:00:16.369> by<00:00:16.519> leopold<00:00:17.329> mozart<00:00:17.539> let's<00:00:18.079> Wolfgang

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:18.769 
ordered by leopold mozart let's Wolfgang

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.720 
ordered by leopold mozart let's Wolfgang
Amadeus<00:00:19.220> Mozart's<00:00:19.820> dead<00:00:20.060> and<00:00:21.099> entree<00:00:22.099> means

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
Amadeus Mozart's dead and entree means

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.169 
Amadeus Mozart's dead and entree means
that<00:00:23.269> this<00:00:23.390> is<00:00:23.570> a<00:00:23.599> formal<00:00:24.410> and<00:00:24.679> dignified<00:00:25.179> sort

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:26.179 
that this is a formal and dignified sort

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.229 
that this is a formal and dignified sort
of<00:00:26.239> dance<00:00:26.480> if<00:00:26.840> you<00:00:26.869> can<00:00:27.109> imagine<00:00:27.230> a<00:00:28.119> group<00:00:29.119> of

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:29.239 
of dance if you can imagine a group of

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:30.939 
of dance if you can imagine a group of
dancers<00:00:29.419> coming<00:00:29.869> in<00:00:30.079> and<00:00:30.230> sort<00:00:30.349> of<00:00:30.469> processing

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
dancers coming in and sort of processing

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.600 
dancers coming in and sort of processing
around<00:00:31.989> so<00:00:32.989> it's<00:00:33.260> quite<00:00:33.860> a<00:00:33.890> sort<00:00:34.190> of<00:00:34.220> formal

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
around so it's quite a sort of formal

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.810 
around so it's quite a sort of formal
feel<00:00:35.089> to<00:00:35.360> it<00:00:36.129> because<00:00:37.129> this<00:00:37.250> was<00:00:37.430> written<00:00:37.610> for

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
feel to it because this was written for

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.759 
feel to it because this was written for
the<00:00:37.909> harpsichord<00:00:38.239> I<00:00:38.720> would<00:00:39.290> like<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.589> suggest

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
the harpsichord I would like to suggest

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:41.740 
the harpsichord I would like to suggest
that<00:00:40.070> you<00:00:40.190> think<00:00:40.250> about<00:00:40.550> making<00:00:41.120> your<00:00:41.360> tone

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
that you think about making your tone

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.829 
that you think about making your tone
fairly<00:00:42.260> bright<00:00:42.559> and<00:00:43.129> incisive<00:00:43.629> for<00:00:44.629> a<00:00:44.690> piece

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:44.839 
fairly bright and incisive for a piece

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.560 
fairly bright and incisive for a piece
like<00:00:44.960> this<00:00:45.320> so<00:00:46.190> if<00:00:46.579> you<00:00:46.790> bring<00:00:46.969> your<00:00:47.120> hand<00:00:47.329> down

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
like this so if you bring your hand down

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.170 
like this so if you bring your hand down
off<00:00:48.199> the<00:00:48.619> rosette<00:00:49.009> a<00:00:49.189> little<00:00:49.489> bit<00:00:49.640> so<00:00:50.059> you're

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
off the rosette a little bit so you're

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:58.420 
off the rosette a little bit so you're
getting<00:00:50.269> a<00:00:50.479> sound<00:00:50.689> like<00:00:50.900> this<00:00:57.220> see<00:00:58.220> that's

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
getting a sound like this see that's

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.789 
getting a sound like this see that's
really<00:00:58.640> quite<00:00:58.759> bright<00:00:59.210> and<00:00:59.540> if<00:01:00.199> I<00:01:00.290> contrast

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:00.799 
really quite bright and if I contrast

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:07.630 
really quite bright and if I contrast
that<00:01:01.009> with<00:01:05.530> so<00:01:06.530> we're<00:01:06.950> looking<00:01:07.189> for<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.369> first

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
that with so we're looking for the first

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.200 
that with so we're looking for the first
one<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:07.939> bright<00:01:08.150> sound<00:01:08.920> dynamics<00:01:09.920> I<00:01:10.340> draw

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
one the bright sound dynamics I draw

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.060 
one the bright sound dynamics I draw
your<00:01:11.360> attention<00:01:11.390> to<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:12.049> box<00:01:12.290> at<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:12.860> top<00:01:12.890> of

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
your attention to the box at the top of

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.429 
your attention to the box at the top of
the<00:01:13.340> page<00:01:13.520> that<00:01:13.850> talks<00:01:14.030> about<00:01:14.299> adding<00:01:15.259> your

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
the page that talks about adding your

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.050 
the page that talks about adding your
own<00:01:15.470> dynamics<00:01:16.220> so<00:01:16.729> there's<00:01:16.850> a<00:01:16.880> really

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
own dynamics so there's a really

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.300 
own dynamics so there's a really
important<00:01:17.630> thing<00:01:17.869> because<00:01:18.079> a<00:01:18.439> lot<00:01:19.100> of<00:01:19.130> the

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
important thing because a lot of the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.440 
important thing because a lot of the
music<00:01:19.490> you'll<00:01:19.820> that<00:01:20.030> you'll<00:01:20.150> come<00:01:20.300> across

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
music you'll that you'll come across

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.330 
music you'll that you'll come across
especially<00:01:21.140> from<00:01:21.320> this<00:01:21.470> kind<00:01:21.650> of<00:01:21.800> time<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:22.310> a

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
especially from this kind of time and a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.149 
especially from this kind of time and a
little<00:01:22.460> bit<00:01:22.700> later<00:01:23.170> hasn't<00:01:24.170> got<00:01:24.350> any<00:01:24.560> dynamics

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
little bit later hasn't got any dynamics

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:26.980 
little bit later hasn't got any dynamics
written<00:01:25.490> on<00:01:25.640> and<00:01:25.909> this<00:01:26.000> doesn't<00:01:26.420> mean<00:01:26.600> that

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
written on and this doesn't mean that

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.340 
written on and this doesn't mean that
you're<00:01:27.530> not<00:01:27.560> expected<00:01:28.310> to<00:01:28.640> do<00:01:28.790> some<00:01:29.060> now<00:01:29.750> with

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
you're not expected to do some now with

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.440 
you're not expected to do some now with
the<00:01:30.440> recording<00:01:30.830> I've<00:01:31.010> made<00:01:31.310> obviously<00:01:32.120> I've

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
the recording I've made obviously I've

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.930 
the recording I've made obviously I've
had<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:32.930> decide<00:01:33.229> on<00:01:33.290> some<00:01:33.830> dynamics<00:01:34.790> but

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
had to decide on some dynamics but

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.149 
had to decide on some dynamics but
that's<00:01:35.120> only<00:01:35.299> one<00:01:35.630> possible<00:01:36.350> way<00:01:36.409> of<00:01:36.590> doing<00:01:37.040> it

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
that's only one possible way of doing it

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.140 
that's only one possible way of doing it
and<00:01:37.570> so<00:01:38.570> I<00:01:38.840> encourage<00:01:39.049> you<00:01:39.409> to<00:01:39.850> have<00:01:40.850> your<00:01:40.970> own

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
and so I encourage you to have your own

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.410 
and so I encourage you to have your own
ideas<00:01:42.130> I'd<00:01:43.130> suggest<00:01:43.549> that<00:01:43.700> you<00:01:44.060> keep<00:01:44.270> the

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
ideas I'd suggest that you keep the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.920 
ideas I'd suggest that you keep the
dynamics<00:01:44.900> fairly<00:01:45.350> simple<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:46.390> I'd<00:01:47.390> suggest

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
dynamics fairly simple and I'd suggest

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.710 
dynamics fairly simple and I'd suggest
that<00:01:48.260> you<00:01:48.560> keep<00:01:48.979> your<00:01:49.040> changes<00:01:49.880> of<00:01:50.030> dynamics

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
that you keep your changes of dynamics

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.500 
that you keep your changes of dynamics
to<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.860> ends<00:01:52.220> of<00:01:52.310> phrases<00:01:52.369> for<00:01:53.060> example<00:01:53.450> the

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
to the ends of phrases for example the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.350 
to the ends of phrases for example the
ends<00:01:53.750> of<00:01:53.840> four<00:01:54.080> bar<00:01:54.350> phrases<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.030> ends<00:01:56.270> of

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
ends of four bar phrases and the ends of

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.660 
ends of four bar phrases and the ends of
the<00:01:56.450> repeated<00:01:56.900> sections<00:01:57.440> and<00:01:58.070> don't<00:01:58.580> do

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
the repeated sections and don't do

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.460 
the repeated sections and don't do
anything<00:01:58.729> too<00:01:59.119> extreme<00:01:59.570> just<00:02:00.080> keep<00:02:00.229> it<00:02:00.350> nice

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
anything too extreme just keep it nice

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.340 
anything too extreme just keep it nice
and<00:02:00.710> simple<00:02:01.060> you'll<00:02:02.060> notice<00:02:02.450> that<00:02:02.720> there's

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
and simple you'll notice that there's

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.740 
and simple you'll notice that there's
some<00:02:03.500> articulation<00:02:03.970> written<00:02:04.970> in<00:02:05.060> with<00:02:05.450> some

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
some articulation written in with some

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.520 
some articulation written in with some
staccato<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:07.100> slurs<00:02:08.080> example<00:02:09.080> in<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.229> second

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
staccato and slurs example in the second

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.670 
staccato and slurs example in the second
bar<00:02:10.480> make<00:02:11.480> sure<00:02:11.510> you're<00:02:11.870> doing<00:02:11.959> those<00:02:12.290> because

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
bar make sure you're doing those because

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.570 
bar make sure you're doing those because
those<00:02:12.830> are<00:02:13.040> really<00:02:13.310> part<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:13.909> the<00:02:13.970> piece<00:02:14.239> and

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
those are really part of the piece and

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.589 
those are really part of the piece and
remember<00:02:16.580> that<00:02:16.700> when<00:02:16.879> you're<00:02:17.000> doing<00:02:17.299> a<00:02:17.390> piece

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
remember that when you're doing a piece

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.070 
remember that when you're doing a piece
like<00:02:17.810> this<00:02:18.049> for<00:02:18.409> an<00:02:18.530> exam<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.730> only<00:02:19.909> do<00:02:20.810> a

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
like this for an exam you only do a

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.440 
like this for an exam you only do a
