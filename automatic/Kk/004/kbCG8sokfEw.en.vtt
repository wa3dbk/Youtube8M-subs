00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
there I mean it really helps from an

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.380 
there I mean it really helps from an
actor's<00:03:29.380> point<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.680> view<00:03:29.800> to<00:03:29.950> imagine<00:03:30.459> it<00:03:30.610> and

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
actor's point of view to imagine it and

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.910 
actor's point of view to imagine it and
I<00:03:31.510> thought<00:03:31.900> that<00:03:32.140> was<00:03:32.319> great<00:03:32.530> but<00:03:32.650> we<00:03:32.769> did<00:03:32.890> a

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
I thought that was great but we did a

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.220 
I thought that was great but we did a
lot<00:03:33.069> of<00:03:33.099> shooting<00:03:33.340> on<00:03:33.790> location<00:03:33.849> in<00:03:34.750> Morocco

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.610 
the effects and all the stuff that's
done<00:03:52.810> on<00:03:52.959> green-screen

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
done on green-screen

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.949 
done on green-screen
I<00:03:54.370> mean<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:54.880> does<00:03:55.060> change<00:03:55.330> a<00:03:55.510> lot<00:03:55.630> from<00:03:55.780> when

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
I mean it does change a lot from when

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.150 
I mean it does change a lot from when
you're<00:03:56.080> filming<00:03:56.290> it<00:03:56.410> when<00:03:56.650> you<00:03:56.709> actually<00:03:57.010> see

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
you're filming it when you actually see

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.880

it<00:03:57.220> on<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.400> screen<00:03:57.549> massively<00:03:58.769> through<00:03:59.769> the

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
it on the screen massively through the

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.500 
it on the screen massively through the
editing<00:04:00.250> but<00:04:00.430> some<00:04:00.610> more<00:04:00.700> depth<00:04:00.970> isn't<00:04:01.390> there

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
editing but some more depth isn't there
