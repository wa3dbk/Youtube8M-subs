00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:14.759
 a day that started so quietly for simano skil eventually one 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.039
 annoying end 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.949
 piet rooijakkers went down hard during the team time trial and had to 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.060
 stop fighting 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.849
 team leader merijn zeeman explains how things are going with harvesters 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.999
 doctors say his situation is stable 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:30.999
 so but it does mean an outdoorsman 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:34.809
 but good goes not so well with him 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.800
 The doctor Edwin Achterberg has now fallen with him fifteen 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.290
 arrived 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.620
 furthermore they are still investigating and there they are 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.870
 a lot of pain 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.750
 so I also met a short while but 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.440
 all will be 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.960
 painkillers issued and so on 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.270
 he was no more than that 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.990
 really approachable and he then immediately went for further research 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.590
 it was dangerous the team time trial 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.120
 from 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.950
 yes well look there this is what you get presented eu 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.790
 And well that it must do with it 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.930
 yes we can blame anyone 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.560
 but well it should also just look at ourselves what we have wrong 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.650
 done for the 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.030
 Dutch can do work 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.220
 but we were better able to prepare that turn to the right and also scored very well 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.110
 dangerous and 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.110
 what happens exactly 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.290
 yes we had that climate we row very narrow job down with all 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.520
 those turns 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.450
 and 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.070
 FC Twente It is a game that his man is going to pay with his foot out 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.890
 he no longer kept the bend 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.210
 years it is the four men behind and 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.900
 that kite already standing 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.900
 because what does it do with the moral of the team? 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.920
 yes that's just by 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.840
 do you know 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.380
 it's really a team between years if one person drops out before one 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.640
 debutant in the tour it is terrible for pieter that he prepared 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.859
 is there 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:14.719
 Everyone is just depressed and everyone thinks that his fault is one 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.069
 yes, we now have to deal with this, morgan himself once continued 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:23.089
 the hall of the cebs are just as good about speaking and 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.839
 viewer one should be nobody 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:30.839
 should not blame each other should now ensure that the 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:33.759
 that access works in the morning
