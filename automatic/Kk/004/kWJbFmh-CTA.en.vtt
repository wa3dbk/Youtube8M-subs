00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.740 
you do on a pom pom and you're going to
slit<00:00:37.770> them<00:00:37.890> down<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.190> middle<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.760> then

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
slit them down the middle and then

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.389 
slit them down the middle and then
they're<00:00:39.899> gonna<00:00:40.050> become<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.469> first<00:00:40.800> stitch<00:00:41.129> so

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
they're gonna become a first stitch so

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.950 
they're gonna become a first stitch so
