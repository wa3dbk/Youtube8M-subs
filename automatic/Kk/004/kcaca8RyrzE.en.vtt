00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
handy during this fight I did have to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.999 
handy during this fight I did have to
use<00:01:21.090> conversion<00:01:22.080> just<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.680> keep<00:01:22.830> myself

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
use conversion just to keep myself

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.490 
use conversion just to keep myself
topped<00:01:23.520> up<00:01:23.700> as<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.030> did<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.360> as<00:01:24.570> unholy<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:25.320> I

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
topped up as I did this as unholy but I

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.870 
topped up as I did this as unholy but I
think<00:01:25.830> even<00:01:26.040> if<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.250> didn't<00:01:26.460> have<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.759> I

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
think even if I didn't have it I

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.090 
think even if I didn't have it I
probably<00:01:27.180> wasn't<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.320> danger<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.860> dying

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
probably wasn't in danger of dying

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.640 
probably wasn't in danger of dying
