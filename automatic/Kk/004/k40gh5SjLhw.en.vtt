we're<00:00:02.159> doing<00:00:02.460> a<00:00:02.490> demonstration<00:00:02.730> of<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.870> SPL

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
we're doing a demonstration of the SPL

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.470 
we're doing a demonstration of the SPL
Pro<00:00:05.480> module<00:00:06.589> which<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:07.620> an<00:00:08.040> in-app<00:00:08.429> purchase

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
Pro module which is an in-app purchase

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.379 
Pro module which is an in-app purchase
available<00:00:09.480> in<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.870> audio<00:00:10.230> tools<00:00:10.530> app<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.389> we

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
available in the audio tools app and we

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.789 
available in the audio tools app and we
are<00:00:12.480> actually<00:00:12.660> running<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.380> on<00:00:13.679> the

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
are actually running this on the

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.650 
are actually running this on the
simulator<00:00:14.340> on<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.670> Mac<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:15.120> that<00:00:15.150> we<00:00:15.330> can<00:00:15.480> do<00:00:15.630> a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
simulator on the Mac so that we can do a

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.090 
simulator on the Mac so that we can do a
nice<00:00:15.900> video<00:00:16.460> all<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.520> functionality<00:00:18.510> and

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
nice video all the functionality and

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.740 
nice video all the functionality and
features<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.400> operation<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.029> just<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.510> same

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
features and operation is just the same

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.310 
features and operation is just the same
in<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.170> app<00:00:22.400> so<00:00:23.400> here<00:00:23.670> we<00:00:23.789> have<00:00:23.970> SPL<00:00:24.510> Pro<00:00:24.930> and

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
in the app so here we have SPL Pro and

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.320 
in the app so here we have SPL Pro and
the<00:00:26.070> first<00:00:26.310> thing<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:26.519> want<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.820> take<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> look

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
the first thing we want to take a look

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.019 
the first thing we want to take a look
at<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:28.130> some<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.220> your<00:00:29.279> options<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:29.880> have

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
at is some of your options you have

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.870 
at is some of your options you have
available<00:00:30.060> on<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.720> set<00:00:30.960> up<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.710> let's<00:00:31.740> tap<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
available on the set up so let's tap the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.590 
available on the set up so let's tap the
wrench<00:00:33.210> icon<00:00:33.450> here<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.820> that<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.120> going<00:00:36.480> to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
wrench icon here and that is going to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.100 
wrench icon here and that is going to
bring<00:00:36.840> up<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.590> SPL<00:00:38.219> setup<00:00:38.700> screen<00:00:39.090> which<00:00:40.079> has

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
bring up the SPL setup screen which has

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.280 
bring up the SPL setup screen which has
only<00:00:40.950> options<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:42.149> what<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.719> front<00:00:42.930> panel

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
only options for what the front panel

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.660 
only options for what the front panel
would<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.500> like<00:00:43.710> aluminum<00:00:44.719> plain<00:00:46.670> which

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
would you like aluminum plain which

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.029 
would you like aluminum plain which
looks<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.500> or<00:00:49.820> dark<00:00:50.820> metal<00:00:51.860> and<00:00:52.860> we

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
looks like that or dark metal and we

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.850 
looks like that or dark metal and we
find<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.489> lot<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.760> our<00:00:54.000> users<00:00:54.480> appreciate

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
find that a lot of our users appreciate

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.200 
find that a lot of our users appreciate
dark<00:00:55.860> metal<00:00:56.129> especially<00:00:56.879> when<00:00:57.059> they're

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
dark metal especially when they're

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.869 
dark metal especially when they're
running<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.840> app<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.370> live<00:00:59.609> sound

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
running this app in a live sound

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.389 
running this app in a live sound
situation<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.870> darkened<00:01:01.230> room<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:02.340> are

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
situation in a darkened room we are

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.210 
situation in a darkened room we are
going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.820> switch<00:01:03.090> back<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.750> aluminum<00:01:04.470> just

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
going to switch back to aluminum just

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.210 
going to switch back to aluminum just
because<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:06.090> will<00:01:06.330> demo<00:01:06.720> better<00:01:06.960> for<00:01:07.320> us<00:01:07.439> on

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
because it will demo better for us on

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.940 
because it will demo better for us on
the<00:01:08.369> video<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.229> first<00:01:10.409> thing<00:01:10.590> we<00:01:10.710> see<00:01:10.920> here

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
the video so the first thing we see here

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.859 
the video so the first thing we see here
is<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.490> basically<00:01:11.790> what<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.540> here<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.840> a

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
is that basically what we have here is a

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.950 
is that basically what we have here is a
digital<00:01:13.200> sound<00:01:13.740> pressure<00:01:14.130> level<00:01:14.580> meter<00:01:14.960> this

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
digital sound pressure level meter this

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.539 
digital sound pressure level meter this
meter<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.920> use<00:01:17.040> all<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.369> same

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
meter is going to use all the same

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.910 
meter is going to use all the same
calibrations<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.810> factors<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.259> all<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
calibrations and factors that all the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.920 
calibrations and factors that all the
other<00:01:20.040> apps<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.670> all<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.210> other<00:01:21.390> modules

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
other apps and all the other modules

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.420 
other apps and all the other modules
within<00:01:22.110> audio<00:01:22.560> tools<00:01:22.920> use<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:25.220> let's<00:01:26.220> take<00:01:26.400> a

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
within audio tools use and let's take a

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.819 
within audio tools use and let's take a
look<00:01:26.640> first<00:01:26.909> at<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.390> waiting's<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.290> if<00:01:28.439> we<00:01:28.560> tap

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
look first at the waiting's so if we tap

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.980 
look first at the waiting's so if we tap
the<00:01:29.100> button<00:01:29.430> up<00:01:29.579> here<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.240> get<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.420> picker<00:01:30.720> and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
the button up here we get a picker and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.609 
the button up here we get a picker and
we<00:01:31.079> can<00:01:31.290> go<00:01:31.799> from<00:01:32.040> unweighted<00:01:32.729> AC<00:01:33.000> or<00:01:33.869> even<00:01:34.439> any

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
we can go from unweighted AC or even any

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.429 
we can go from unweighted AC or even any
of<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> active<00:01:35.189> band<00:01:35.540> filters<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.900> these

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
of the active band filters and these

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.289 
of the active band filters and these
filters<00:01:37.860> are<00:01:38.009> all<00:01:38.220> ANSI<00:01:38.939> type<00:01:39.420> 1<00:01:40.170> or<00:01:40.470> better

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
filters are all ANSI type 1 or better

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.810 
filters are all ANSI type 1 or better
filters<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:43.110> are<00:01:43.170> available<00:01:43.670> when<00:01:44.670> you've

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
filters that are available when you've

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.730 
filters that are available when you've
settled<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> filter<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.899> want<00:01:46.170> go

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
settled on the filter that you want go

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.289 
settled on the filter that you want go
back<00:01:46.920> up<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> button<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.759> press<00:01:48.090> select

back up to the button and press select
and<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.200> filter<00:01:49.590> will<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:50.040> effect<00:01:50.780> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
and that filter will be in effect the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.480 
and that filter will be in effect the
input<00:01:52.200> level<00:01:52.530> meter<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.920> next<00:01:53.130> thing<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.280> we

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
input level meter the next thing that we

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.660 
input level meter the next thing that we
see<00:01:53.700> here<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.299> an<00:01:55.079> actual<00:01:55.320> hardware<00:01:56.040> input

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
see here is an actual hardware input

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.670 
see here is an actual hardware input
level<00:01:57.000> monitor<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.990> before<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
level monitor and that is before the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.440 
level monitor and that is before the
filter<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.759> if<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.600> are<00:02:00.780> clipping<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.680> meter

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
filter so if you are clipping that meter

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.420 
filter so if you are clipping that meter
you<00:02:03.450> are<00:02:03.600> running<00:02:03.990> out<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.229> dynamic<00:02:04.710> range<00:02:04.950> and

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
you are running out of dynamic range and

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.639 
you are running out of dynamic range and
at<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.700> minimum<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:06.780> distortion<00:02:07.530> that

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
at the minimum you have distortion that

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.320 
at the minimum you have distortion that

is altering the values that are
the<00:02:11.720> iPhone<00:02:12.170> mics<00:02:12.470> and<00:02:12.890> iPod<00:02:13.280> Touch<00:02:13.459> mics<00:02:13.790> all

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
the iPhone mics and iPod Touch mics all

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.940 
the iPhone mics and iPod Touch mics all
will<00:02:14.900> clip<00:02:15.260> before<00:02:15.470> 100db<00:02:16.810> peak<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:18.080> that<00:02:18.140> can

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
will clip before 100db peak and that can

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.699 
will clip before 100db peak and that can
be<00:02:19.069> as<00:02:19.159> little<00:02:19.370> as<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:20.000> know<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.269> mid<00:02:20.870> 80s<00:02:21.379> a

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
weighted so something to keep in mind

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.039 
weighted so something to keep in mind
down<00:02:25.220> here<00:02:25.549> we<00:02:25.700> have<00:02:25.909> a<00:02:25.940> bar<00:02:26.390> that<00:02:26.420> lets<00:02:26.930> us

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
down here we have a bar that lets us

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.970 
down here we have a bar that lets us
pick<00:02:27.409> between<00:02:28.310> ansi<00:02:28.970> decay<00:02:29.329> modes<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:30.709> again

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
pick between ansi decay modes and again

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.089 
pick between ansi decay modes and again
these<00:02:31.129> are<00:02:31.190> all<00:02:31.310> type<00:02:31.849> 1<00:02:32.120> or<00:02:32.269> type<00:02:32.420> 0<00:02:32.840> modes<00:02:33.230> so

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
these are all type 1 or type 0 modes so

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.089 
these are all type 1 or type 0 modes so
we<00:02:34.220> have<00:02:34.400> slow<00:02:35.170> which<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.590> numbers<00:02:36.950> won't

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
we have slow which the numbers won't

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.479 
we have slow which the numbers won't
change<00:02:37.430> very<00:02:37.730> fast<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:38.360> course<00:02:38.540> we<00:02:38.690> have<00:02:38.780> fast

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
change very fast of course we have fast

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.509 
change very fast of course we have fast
which<00:02:40.489> is<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.180> much<00:02:41.510> quicker<00:02:41.780> decay<00:02:42.340> we<00:02:43.340> have

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
which is a much quicker decay we have

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.569 
which is a much quicker decay we have
impulse<00:02:44.060> which<00:02:45.049> reacts<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.859> it's<00:02:46.370> kind<00:02:46.549> of

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
impulse which reacts to it's kind of

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.630 
impulse which reacts to it's kind of
like<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.790> form<00:02:47.120> of<00:02:47.239> peak<00:02:48.220> with<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.250> different

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
like a form of peak with a different

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.190 
like a form of peak with a different
decay<00:02:49.940> curve<00:02:50.239> and<00:02:50.450> then<00:02:50.540> we<00:02:50.569> have<00:02:50.780> an<00:02:50.900> actual

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
decay curve and then we have an actual

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.750 
decay curve and then we have an actual
peak<00:02:51.500> mode<00:02:51.769> which<00:02:52.069> is<00:02:52.220> really<00:02:52.730> just

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
peak mode which is really just

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.229 
peak mode which is really just
monitoring<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:54.230> peak<00:02:54.590> SPL<00:02:55.340> between<00:02:55.819> every

update<00:02:56.629> on<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.930> screen<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:58.090> we'll<00:02:59.090> get<00:02:59.209> into

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
update on the screen and we'll get into

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.660 
update on the screen and we'll get into
leq<00:02:59.989> in<00:03:00.170> just<00:03:00.409> a<00:03:00.500> second<00:03:00.859> as<00:03:00.920> another<00:03:01.159> mode<00:03:01.400> but

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
leq in just a second as another mode but

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.190 
leq in just a second as another mode but
while<00:03:01.849> we're<00:03:02.000> here<00:03:02.150> in<00:03:02.299> these<00:03:02.450> modes<00:03:02.780> let's<00:03:03.019> go

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
while we're here in these modes let's go

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.460 
while we're here in these modes let's go
back<00:03:03.379> to<00:03:03.650> slow<00:03:04.599> we've<00:03:05.599> got<00:03:05.810> a<00:03:05.840> field<00:03:06.170> down<00:03:06.409> here

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
back to slow we've got a field down here

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.240 
back to slow we've got a field down here
that<00:03:07.040> is<00:03:07.159> maximum<00:03:07.579> DB<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.480> we<00:03:09.409> can<00:03:09.590> clear<00:03:10.010> this

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
that is maximum DB and we can clear this

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.470 
that is maximum DB and we can clear this
and<00:03:11.260> then<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.440> will<00:03:12.470> count<00:03:12.920> up<00:03:13.159> and<00:03:13.430> change<00:03:14.090> as

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
and then it will count up and change as

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.150 
and then it will count up and change as
our<00:03:14.660> maximum<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:15.410> that's<00:03:15.590> kind<00:03:15.769> of<00:03:15.799> a<00:03:15.919> peak

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
our maximum so that's kind of a peak

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.490 
our maximum so that's kind of a peak
hold<00:03:16.400> basically<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.840> then<00:03:17.989> we<00:03:18.079> also<00:03:18.230> have<00:03:18.470> a

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
hold basically and then we also have a

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.819 
hold basically and then we also have a
relative<00:03:19.069> field<00:03:19.430> here<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:19.970> if<00:03:20.900> I<00:03:21.109> push<00:03:21.530> this

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
relative field here and if I push this

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.550 
relative field here and if I push this
while<00:03:22.370> I'm<00:03:22.639> talking<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.419> capture<00:03:23.959> a<00:03:23.989> value

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
while I'm talking and capture a value

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.860 
while I'm talking and capture a value
what<00:03:25.459> it's<00:03:25.579> gonna<00:03:25.730> do<00:03:26.000> is<00:03:26.209> it's<00:03:26.239> gonna<00:03:26.510> show

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
what it's gonna do is it's gonna show

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.839 
what it's gonna do is it's gonna show
you<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.410> net<00:03:27.650> plus<00:03:28.069> or<00:03:28.280> minus<00:03:28.700> that's

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
you the net plus or minus that's

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.000 
you the net plus or minus that's
currently<00:03:29.329> occurring<00:03:29.780> compared<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:30.889> this

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
currently occurring compared to this

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.619 
currently occurring compared to this
value<00:03:31.310> so<00:03:31.549> I'm<00:03:31.609> gonna<00:03:31.760> stop<00:03:31.970> talking<00:03:32.239> for<00:03:32.540> a

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
value so I'm gonna stop talking for a

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.150 
value so I'm gonna stop talking for a
second<00:03:34.030> and<00:03:35.030> we<00:03:35.180> see<00:03:35.359> it<00:03:35.450> goes<00:03:35.629> very<00:03:35.810> low<00:03:36.160> and

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
second and we see it goes very low and

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.740 
second and we see it goes very low and
if<00:03:37.280> I<00:03:37.400> talk<00:03:37.609> more<00:03:37.790> loudly<00:03:38.060> of<00:03:38.329> course<00:03:38.510> it'll<00:03:38.690> be

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
if I talk more loudly of course it'll be

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.430 
if I talk more loudly of course it'll be
higher<00:03:39.160> some<00:03:40.160> other<00:03:40.989> meters<00:03:41.989> have<00:03:42.199> called

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
higher some other meters have called

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.589 
higher some other meters have called
this<00:03:42.590> seat<00:03:42.889> to<00:03:43.099> seat<00:03:43.340> so<00:03:43.609> you<00:03:43.639> can<00:03:43.730> capture<00:03:44.090> an

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
this seat to seat so you can capture an

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.949 
this seat to seat so you can capture an
actual<00:03:45.470> value<00:03:46.430> at<00:03:46.879> a<00:03:46.940> certain<00:03:47.269> position<00:03:47.419> and

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
actual value at a certain position and

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.530 
actual value at a certain position and
then<00:03:48.470> move<00:03:48.680> from<00:03:49.129> seat<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.609> seat<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.150> see<00:03:50.389> how

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
then move from seat to seat and see how

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.759 
then move from seat to seat and see how
much<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:51.410> level<00:03:51.739> varies<00:03:52.310> as<00:03:52.549> you<00:03:52.790> move<00:03:53.739> so<00:03:54.739> now

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
much the level varies as you move so now

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.300 
much the level varies as you move so now
let's<00:03:55.280> look<00:03:55.340> at<00:03:55.549> L<00:03:55.699> EQ<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:56.480> L<00:03:56.690> EQ<00:03:57.139> for<00:03:58.040> those<00:03:58.160> of

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:58.069 
we have one other nice feature in SPL

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.570 
we have one other nice feature in SPL
Pro<00:04:58.460> as<00:04:59.120> a<00:04:59.180> full-featured<00:05:00.039> SPL<00:05:01.039> meter<00:05:01.069> and

that's<00:05:02.270> a<00:05:02.449> store<00:05:02.720> button<00:05:03.020> so<00:05:03.650> when<00:05:03.800> we<00:05:03.919> tap

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
that's a store button so when we tap

here<00:05:29.870> store<00:05:30.590> a<00:05:31.009> description<00:05:32.110> and<00:05:33.110> obviously<00:05:34.039> I

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
here store a description and obviously I

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:35.649 
here store a description and obviously I
can<00:05:34.219> type<00:05:34.400> a<00:05:34.490> lot<00:05:34.610> faster<00:05:35.090> in<00:05:35.150> a<00:05:35.210> simulator

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:38.920

than<00:05:35.930> on<00:05:36.050> the<00:05:36.139> phone<00:05:36.400> but<00:05:37.400> anyway<00:05:37.759> that<00:05:37.969> will

than on the phone but anyway that will

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.409 
than on the phone but anyway that will

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
store that in there as well and then you

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.870 
store that in there as well and then you
can<00:05:41.539> have<00:05:41.719> as<00:05:41.870> many<00:05:42.050> as<00:05:42.169> 10<00:05:42.590> reading<00:05:43.400> stored

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.209 
can have as many as 10 reading stored
but<00:05:44.300> you<00:05:44.449> can<00:05:44.599> go<00:05:44.750> back<00:05:44.930> and<00:05:45.139> check<00:05:45.380> at<00:05:45.860> any

but you can go back and check at any
time<00:05:46.460> and<00:05:46.699> of<00:05:46.759> course<00:05:46.789> the<00:05:47.000> storage<00:05:47.360> is

non-volatile<00:05:48.229> on<00:05:48.440> the<00:05:48.560> phone<00:05:49.570> so<00:05:50.570> there's<00:05:50.780> a
