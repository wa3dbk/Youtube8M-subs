think<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.580> word<00:02:50.790> alternate<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:52.200> more

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
think the word alternate is more

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.410 
think the word alternate is more

so<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.480> see<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:55.650> could<00:02:55.830> have<00:02:55.920> done<00:02:56.130> whatever

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
so you see you could have done whatever

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.030 
so you see you could have done whatever
you<00:02:56.610> liked<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.180> not<00:02:57.780> changed<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.320> thing<00:02:58.350> here

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
you liked and not changed a thing here

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.120 
you liked and not changed a thing here
who<00:02:59.790> do<00:02:59.850> you<00:02:59.940> think<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.269> are<00:03:00.560> captain<00:03:01.560> what

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
who do you think you are captain what

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.280 
who do you think you are captain what
gives<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.580> right<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.940> interfere<00:03:03.290> but

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
gives you the right to interfere but

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.210 
gives you the right to interfere but
there<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:04.620> no<00:03:04.799> interference<00:03:05.370> in<00:03:05.519> our<00:03:06.180> universe

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
there is no interference in our universe
