move<00:01:48.370> is<00:01:48.490> really<00:01:48.729> blurry<00:01:48.970> and<00:01:49.210> there's<00:01:49.390> a

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
move is really blurry and there's a

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.670 
move is really blurry and there's a
little<00:01:49.510> bit<00:01:49.660> of<00:01:49.720> a<00:01:49.780> blur<00:01:50.110> to<00:01:50.140> everything<00:01:52.320> but<00:01:53.320> I

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
little bit of a blur to everything but I

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.040 
little bit of a blur to everything but I
think<00:01:54.160> the<00:01:54.250> overall<00:01:54.550> effect<00:01:54.729> is<00:01:55.180> pretty

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
think the overall effect is pretty

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.400 
think the overall effect is pretty
freaking<00:01:56.500> amazing<00:01:56.770> I<00:01:57.900> mean<00:01:58.900> I<00:01:59.050> even<00:01:59.260> have<00:01:59.380> my

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
freaking amazing I mean I even have my

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:06.180 
freaking amazing I mean I even have my
own<00:01:59.560> shadow<00:02:03.990> but<00:02:04.990> um<00:02:05.229> yeah<00:02:05.649> I<00:02:05.830> have<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.070> look

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
own shadow but um yeah I have to look

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.940 
own shadow but um yeah I have to look
into<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.520> settings<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.869> everything<00:02:08.619> and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
into the settings and everything and

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.630 
into the settings and everything and
really<00:02:09.759> tweak<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.780> brightness<00:02:11.400> because<00:02:12.400> it

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
really tweak the brightness because it

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.990 
really tweak the brightness because it
is<00:02:12.730> just<00:02:12.910> way<00:02:13.300> too<00:02:13.360> bright<00:02:13.900> but<00:02:14.260> I<00:02:15.000> just

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
is just way too bright but I just

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.420 
is just way too bright but I just
figured<00:02:16.239> I'd<00:02:16.330> put<00:02:17.320> this<00:02:17.470> out<00:02:17.709> there<00:02:17.739> see<00:02:18.310> what

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
figured I'd put this out there see what

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.390 
figured I'd put this out there see what
people<00:02:18.730> thought<00:02:19.530> whether<00:02:20.530> i<00:02:20.650> should<00:02:20.709> continue

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
people thought whether i should continue

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.120 
people thought whether i should continue
with<00:02:21.550> this<00:02:21.700> for<00:02:22.120> my<00:02:22.300> other<00:02:22.540> series<00:02:22.989> which<00:02:23.920> I

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
with this for my other series which I

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.680 
with this for my other series which I
wasn't<00:02:24.400> going<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.640> record<00:02:24.940> just<00:02:25.180> yet<00:02:25.450> which<00:02:25.570> is

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
wasn't going to record just yet which is

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.690
