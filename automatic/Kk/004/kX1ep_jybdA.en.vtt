00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello friends welcome today i have 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.569
 times the german national team 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:11.550
 reconstructed in the popular setting 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.389
 4 1 2 1 2 and the faces should be you 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.240
 be known 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.860
 in the storm I set up podolski 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.110
 with 87 shot and 780 speed 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.240
 80 urge header but not so 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.350
 hammer but alone from the shot and from 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.900
 The speed has to be a few 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:32.320
 I'm good at the front and second 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.320
 set up with 80 84 header 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.470
 so lies as a second striker in the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.830
 Mittelfeld we have özil with 85 fit 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:47.460
 88 dribbling and schweinsteiger im 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:51.150
 defensive midfield still with 79 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.780
 defense 86 match 82 shot left 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.090
 page in form royce with 81 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.880
 speed 86 shot normally 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.400
 this is not his position but as in 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.580
 Form player he plays on the left 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.770
 midfield as well as thomas müller 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:12.500
 right midfielder than in form 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.600
 with 84 speed and 83 shot 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.060
 then we have on the left 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.940
 defender position smelter I have 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.740
 I chose Schmelzer because he was 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.149
 in my opinion the best 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.340
 preservation of value on the position 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.830
 There is still the panda as an alternative 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.630
 but I think smoker has already 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.360
 better values 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.330
 then we have badstuber as 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.080
 defender with 83 defense and 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.090
 80 head with solid defender and 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:47.160
 second, we have the mats hummels 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.470
 with 85 defense 84 header and up 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.140
 the right side, of course, philipp lame 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.240
 the best choice on the right 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.240
 defender position and the goalkeeper 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.619
 Manuel Neuer 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.990
 the values speak for themselves one of the 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.709
 Best goalkeeper in the game 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.580
 So if you have about 400,000 then 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:10.200
 can you rebuild the team and you 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.090
 I think you will 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.080
 certainly have fun with hockey friends 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.080
 That's it soon
