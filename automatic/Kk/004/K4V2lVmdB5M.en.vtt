00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
hearing see you head for budweiser so i

got those changed
kick<00:02:02.310> panels<00:02:02.930> so<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> interior<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.799> pretty

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
kick panels so the interior is pretty

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.109 
kick panels so the interior is pretty
well<00:02:05.700> done<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.090> guess<00:02:06.500> just<00:02:07.500> for<00:02:07.740> some<00:02:07.890> minor

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
well done I guess just for some minor

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.840 
well done I guess just for some minor
odds<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.420> ends<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.590> that's<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.890> big<00:02:11.069> change<00:02:11.340> for

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
odds and ends so that's a big change for

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.030 
odds and ends so that's a big change for
