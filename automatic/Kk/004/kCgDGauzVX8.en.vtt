00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
videos which I don't do i do Let's Plays

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.959 
videos which I don't do i do Let's Plays
so<00:01:56.640> i<00:01:57.000> think<00:01:57.570> i'm<00:01:58.140> pretty<00:01:58.619> much<00:01:58.740> good<00:01:59.219> they're

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
so i think i'm pretty much good they're

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.600 
so i think i'm pretty much good they're
a<00:02:00.000> little<00:02:00.149> weird<00:02:00.659> about<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.079> ending<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
a little weird about the ending of the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.600 
a little weird about the ending of the
story<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:04.380> might<00:02:04.590> have<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.920> do<00:02:05.100> something

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
story so we might have to do something

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.760 
story so we might have to do something
about<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.939> or<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.659> know<00:02:06.780> i<00:02:07.259> think<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.710> was

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
about that or you know i think it was
