00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.000 

there<00:02:22.200> now

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.089 

this<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.909> so<00:02:27.120> it's<00:02:27.269> really<00:02:27.450> one<00:02:27.720> lane<00:02:28.099> and

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
this is it so it's really one lane and

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.000

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
if another car comes you just have to

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.039 
if another car comes you just have to
find<00:02:32.220> little<00:02:32.579> places<00:02:32.819> along<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.299> road<00:02:33.629> here

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
find little places along the road here

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:44.490 
find little places along the road here
where<00:02:34.819> you<00:02:35.819> can<00:02:36.650> let<00:02:37.650> each<00:02:37.860> other<00:02:38.099> pass

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.990 

going<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.070> get<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.190> sense<00:02:45.490> for<00:02:45.640> some<00:02:45.820> of<00:02:45.940> the

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
going to get a sense for some of the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.060 
going to get a sense for some of the
homes<00:02:46.210> as<00:02:46.450> we<00:02:46.570> go<00:02:46.690> by<00:02:46.870> I'll<00:02:47.620> show<00:02:47.770> you<00:02:47.830> some<00:02:48.040> of

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
homes as we go by I'll show you some of

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.120 
homes as we go by I'll show you some of
the<00:02:48.220> more<00:02:48.490> nice<00:02:48.670> ones<00:02:48.970> speed<00:02:49.870> limits<00:02:50.140> 30<00:02:50.380> km/h

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
the more nice ones speed limits 30 km/h

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.110 
the more nice ones speed limits 30 km/h
which<00:02:51.580> is<00:02:51.730> really<00:02:52.060> really<00:02:52.360> slow<00:02:52.690> I<00:02:54.030> think<00:02:55.030> it's

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
which is really really slow I think it's

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.660 
which is really really slow I think it's
like<00:02:55.210> 18<00:02:55.690> miles<00:02:55.990> per<00:02:56.230> hour<00:02:56.410> there's<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:57.310> student

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
like 18 miles per hour there's a student

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.120 
like 18 miles per hour there's a student
