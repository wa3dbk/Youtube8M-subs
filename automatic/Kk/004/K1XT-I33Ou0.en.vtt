reviews com so what we would do we would

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.120 
reviews com so what we would do we would
put<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.270> URL<00:01:15.420> within<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.080> link<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.409> we

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
put that URL within the link and we

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.580 
put that URL within the link and we
would<00:01:17.340> make<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.729> anchor<00:01:18.119> text<00:01:18.600> for<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.320> page

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
out by panda or penguin you'd want to do

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.030 
out by panda or penguin you'd want to do
variation<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.530> variations<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.620> we<00:02:04.800> could

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
link to that link would be say just

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.450 
link to that link would be say just
Mercedes<00:02:09.210> by<00:02:09.600> itself<00:02:10.070> another<00:02:11.070> variation

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
Mercedes by itself another variation

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.480 
Mercedes by itself another variation
could<00:02:12.030> be<00:02:12.390> click<00:02:13.260> here<00:02:13.560> now<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:16.590> ratio<00:02:17.160> we

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
could be click here now the ratio we

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.280 
could be click here now the ratio we
want<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.820> get<00:02:17.970> for<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.209> actual<00:02:18.450> key<00:02:18.690> word<00:02:18.990> that

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
want to get for the actual key word that

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.980 
want to get for the actual key word that
we're<00:02:19.440> ranking<00:02:19.980> for<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:20.430> probably<00:02:21.060> I'd<00:02:21.959> say

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
we're ranking for is probably I'd say

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.780 
we're ranking for is probably I'd say
probably<00:02:22.470> four<00:02:22.680> months<00:02:23.190> ago<00:02:23.430> it'd<00:02:23.550> probably

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
probably four months ago it'd probably

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.530 
probably four months ago it'd probably
be<00:02:23.940> around<00:02:24.600> eight<00:02:25.410> twenty<00:02:25.830> percent<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.550> guess

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
be around eight twenty percent I guess

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.360 
be around eight twenty percent I guess
now<00:02:27.840> with<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.260> latest<00:02:28.500> update<00:02:29.160> you'd

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
now with the latest update you'd

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.790 
now with the latest update you'd
probably<00:02:29.820> want<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.510> have<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.959> bit<00:02:31.110> ly<00:02:31.350> sort

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
probably want to have it a bit ly sort

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.580 
probably want to have it a bit ly sort
of<00:02:31.890> around<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.310> five<00:02:32.580> percent<00:02:33.060> mark<00:02:33.590> so

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
of around the five percent mark so

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.160 
of around the five percent mark so
therefore<00:02:34.920> if<00:02:35.550> we're<00:02:36.030> going<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.510> make<00:02:36.690> five

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
therefore if we're going to make five

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.020 
therefore if we're going to make five
percent<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.740> ratio<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.250> anchor<00:02:38.580> text<00:02:38.820> five

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
percent of the ratio of anchor text five

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.060 
percent of the ratio of anchor text five
percent<00:02:39.420> we<00:02:39.540> need<00:02:39.780> many<00:02:40.200> variations<00:02:40.650> of

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.790 
going to use it's vital that we use
generic<00:03:59.940> keywords<00:04:00.450> like<00:04:00.660> click<00:04:00.990> here<00:04:01.350> or<00:04:01.380> find

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
generic keywords like click here or find

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.760 
generic keywords like click here or find
out<00:04:02.069> more<00:04:02.340> here<00:04:02.400> if<00:04:03.030> we<00:04:03.600> do<00:04:03.750> not<00:04:03.930> do<00:04:04.170> this<00:04:04.380> then

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
out more here if we do not do this then

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.339 
out more here if we do not do this then
it<00:04:05.010> looks<00:04:05.280> very<00:04:05.610> unnatural<00:04:05.819> and<00:04:06.480> also<00:04:06.900> we<00:04:07.110> want

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
it looks very unnatural and also we want

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.740 
it looks very unnatural and also we want
to<00:04:07.530> have<00:04:07.770> some<00:04:08.400> links<00:04:08.760> which<00:04:09.060> just<00:04:09.390> have<00:04:09.599> the

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
to have some links which just have the

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.800 
to have some links which just have the
URL<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.470> have<00:04:10.740> no<00:04:11.010> anchor<00:04:11.370> text<00:04:11.730> at<00:04:11.849> all<00:04:11.970> so

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
URL and have no anchor text at all so

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.260 
URL and have no anchor text at all so
that<00:04:13.230> could<00:04:13.380> pretty<00:04:13.680> much<00:04:13.890> be<00:04:14.340> just<00:04:14.730> done<00:04:15.090> by

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
that could pretty much be just done by

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.440 
that could pretty much be just done by
doing<00:04:15.569> at<00:04:15.690> a<00:04:15.840> ref<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.739> putting<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:18.030> anchor

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
doing at a ref and putting the anchor

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.440 
doing at a ref and putting the anchor
text<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:19.500> same<00:04:19.799> as<00:04:20.070> what<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.400> link<00:04:20.609> is<00:04:20.849> which

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
text the same as what the link is which

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.779 
text the same as what the link is which
is<00:04:21.479> pretty<00:04:21.840> simple<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.410> do<00:04:22.560> and<00:04:22.590> if<00:04:22.860> you<00:04:22.890> do<00:04:23.760> a

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
is pretty simple to do and if you do a

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.610 
is pretty simple to do and if you do a
quick<00:04:24.060> Google<00:04:24.450> search<00:04:24.479> you<00:04:24.930> can<00:04:25.110> get<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.410> code

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
quick Google search you can get the code

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.200 
quick Google search you can get the code
for<00:04:25.830> that<00:04:26.010> and<00:04:26.190> just<00:04:26.370> put<00:04:26.669> in<00:04:26.789> what

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
for that and just put in what

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.580 
for that and just put in what
information<00:04:28.050> you<00:04:28.140> want<00:04:28.320> to<00:04:28.380> put<00:04:28.470> in<00:04:28.560> there

information you want to put in there

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.560 
information you want to put in there
it's<00:04:29.160> a<00:04:29.280> lot<00:04:29.430> of<00:04:29.520> software<00:04:29.820> packages<00:04:30.360> out

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
it's a lot of software packages out

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.270 
it's a lot of software packages out
there<00:04:30.750> that<00:04:30.960> do<00:04:31.140> that<00:04:31.380> already<00:04:31.740> for<00:04:32.099> you

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
there that do that already for you

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.969 
there that do that already for you
already<00:04:33.169> anyway<00:04:34.169> I<00:04:34.200> think<00:04:34.320> I've<00:04:34.590> pretty<00:04:34.890> much

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
already anyway I think I've pretty much

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.159 
already anyway I think I've pretty much
covered<00:04:35.580> most<00:04:35.940> of<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.479> things<00:04:36.660> to<00:04:36.900> do<00:04:37.020> with

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
covered most of the things to do with

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.250 
covered most of the things to do with
anchor<00:04:37.470> text<00:04:37.860> so<00:04:38.460> it's<00:04:38.760> all<00:04:38.970> next<00:04:39.539> time<00:04:39.690> see

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
anchor text so it's all next time see

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.919 
anchor text so it's all next time see
you<00:04:40.349> later<00:04:40.530> bye
