00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello am a red today I come to 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.120
 tell them about a trend of makeup 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.480
 that is being used a lot and that 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.280

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.969
 it's a trend that has a lot 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.920
 time but that had not come off like that 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.699
 we had become so fashionable 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.470
 streaming is like an answer to the 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.439
 contour so marked so defined that it 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.300
 he was using a while back then 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.490
 the truth is that I like everything I 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.679
 I am a person that everything I like or that 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.750
 everything I turn around and adapted it to me 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.210
 with respect to the trends of 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.899
 coaching or I have corrections 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.030
 I had many years using it and 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.370
 had had to lower a little decrease 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.260
 a little bit the tone because I already have a skin 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.270
 mature of a dry skin 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.100
 I have a percent and blair and I can not 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.350
 make me very heavy corrections and I 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.230
 I like light makeup was when I saw 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.300
 then a video of two Venezuelans that 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.510
 opposite of me they have skin 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.420

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.760

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.890

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.590

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.110

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.180

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.149
 way to apply it as mature skin 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:29.270

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:32.929
 I hope you like it and can enjoy it 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.280
 My skin is already hydrated and I used my 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:37.969

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.829

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:46.000
 brought a friend from the USA I do not know if I already 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:48.740
 they're marketing you're a bit pink 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.850
 and when he applied it to my face, 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:58.760
 as well as as paler lighter and 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:01.430
 it looks like it's bright so I like it 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.920
 because it clears my face is darker 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.470

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.760
 It clarifies a lot and leaves the skin very 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.460
 satin let dry the first the 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.380

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:26.030

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.879

 years has optical diffusers so 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.730

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.959

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.390
 of a lot of wrinkles I am a bit anti 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.640
 compact powder and anti dust loose in 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.879
 very little amount just for this 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.879
 reason 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.270
 and the residue of peace guess I'm 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.460
 using to deepen the look 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.840
 the shadow for the rally eyebrows are 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.209
 Fabulous plus they are mates 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.989
 I'm going to use this shadow on mate this is 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.860
 vanilla color 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.870
 this is the matte revlon collection 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.050
 you can simply make the points of 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.880
 light that stand out in my face 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.880
 the squirrel the nose 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.720
 the cluster this would be for an effect 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.720
 more natural 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:46.450
 sternocleidomastoid steele if they want 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:50.349
 stand out Moscow because this is wants 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.909
 a little more natural the arch is needed 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.329
 superciliar that is the one below 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.329
 Eyebrows 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:05.319
 if we want much more natural and not so 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.819
 recharged now I will use this 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.819
 quite bright of this this average of 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.010
 watch the mineral finishing powder is a 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.780
 compact powder with minerals and goes to 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.959
 reflect enough light is going to notice 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.959
 the difference 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.200
 to be in the form of s 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.340
 in the nose just do first here 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.590
 and then on the tip 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.590
 so that no lift 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.750
 arrives 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.750
 You can use a little bit that your forehead 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.380
 Requirements 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:08.099
 if it is so exploited clear 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.800
 never 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:25.300
 how it looks 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.020
 many good eyes you can 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.150
 dose the 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.470
 some apprentice we put a girl that the 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.520
 name of the principle that also 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:39.560
 Venezuelan is that they pulverized when 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.970
 wants the color to stand out even more so 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.729
 that I'm going to leave the dead of them 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.940
 down here for you to visit and once 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:51.199
 that the moisture dissipates then they can 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:54.560
 touch up and place even more lighting if 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:56.820
 they want to be much more luminous 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.990
 but after 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.990
 to exaggerate a bit
