00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.369
 the whole good guy I'm a fan of her dare I'm a game design 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.600
 in the design of a board game to the teacher the programming if a game 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.009
 electronic way of knowing more about the profession of who comes out 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:26.389
 good I like games wore very good with 20 years to commit a first 

00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:28.550
 game was invited by close 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.300
 It's a board game 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.649
 for children 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.079
 and that's when I saw it was officially announced throughout the games 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:36.790
 from there onwards 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.930
 I confess to abandoning your career. 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.040
 What I thought I could not 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.010
 at the time the game is such a little thing 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.480
 so I think that journalism works 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.150
 No one expects to ride a horse and earn a living. 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.780
 It's kind of like I'm 29 years old gave a will to do again 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.060
 this kind of game again and then I started working with board games 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.230
 in 2004 the game was very great joy it was selected it came out winner of 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.480
 international competition is the competition of game creators like the attacker's 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.240
 pairs win the game 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.820
 won the contest 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.190
 then sold in 2008 with the jury's statement 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.409
 for example when I was 20 years old 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.969
 but at the time was planted disbelief paulo bovespa were already made of 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.729
 football was ten years from the chest of oblivion public prosecutors in 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.180
 France, for example, but we have also faced something very 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.210
 I want something common a part of me that claims to have been defeated. 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:35.500
 athlete 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.610
 he had a reaction very very much to believe me from there 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.790
 starts working not only for the trays but also for games 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.460
 electronics in these areas then in 2008 the game was to have created the so-called 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.320
 is the actor who was made the greenpeace that he won a bronze lion in 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.500
 cannes 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.550
 is an important step in the advertising area and this also opens with this 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.350
 the doors to make also electronic games my work 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.980
 specifically as a designer 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.910
 he is focused on creating 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.070
 the game that I do not know how to miss programming 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.970
 I'm not a designer either, you have to do the beautiful things. 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.099
 skills 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.249
 create mechanics that are fun mechanics and this I can do 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:18.340
 thrive 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.770
 board games 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.209
 electronic account 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.699
 cards game 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:27.479
 what matters is you are working with the right audience you choose 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.169
 What to invent even mechanics that you 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:34.340
 can be perceived as an artist with and without 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.890
 when we make a game for runners process the agreement we 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.750
 we play the game because it comes out of our head you play one game for another 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.710
 international competition can make a game to try to sell to some 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.049
 company that this is the game he gets freer 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.540
 there is another type of model that is when the customer arrives for you to speak 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.999
 Look, I want a specific game. 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:55.999
 a xyz o csa multiply 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:57.579
 this process 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.669
 in one of them the evidence is when you have to create 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:04.539
 on the subject in the restrictions of the merger the box that one can think of at all 

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:05.019
 that 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.859
 so have games that you do the main discussion probe hard to 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.629
 do because you have a lot of restrictions 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.730
 but they look more beautiful even if you can represent portugal 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:18.369
 within those given circumstances 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:20.839
 today we are not being a good minimized 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:24.609
 you have to have wings some things first you have to have access to 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.859
 certain electronic games 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.129
 in those days I recommend that you go after me 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.450
 platforms are little more independentista for example games of the 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.969
 nintendo ds 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:38.689
 in general mostly more independent companies because I did cost less 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:39.689
 capable 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:41.909
 with the dish costs little 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.369
 o pps 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:47.269
 up to this Friday or paris game thing and denounces games that you have 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.599
 today on the internet 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.379
 In many interesting games these flash games only a few that are 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.799
 pure html what does it matter if you realize 70 dwellings of originality 

00:03:57.619 --> 00:04:00.779
 that's where you'll get uses of people are thinking differently 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:04.959
 in terms of other references I think that the European board games 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.549
 although the Germans are fundamental 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.989
 and finally to be important also try to read something 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.649
 for example portuguese for me 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:15.389
 the classic called as 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:16.559
 London 

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:18.269
 puyol did not know 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.379
 who was the first major provider 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:24.339
 go to understand the game of a different dimension is the own says not only 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.870
 culture makes the game stayed warm games make culture 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.669
 and nowadays 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.669
 I'm production so fast I'm so fast. 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.340
 in the United States to present the same false 18 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:43.509
 they were on the agenda 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.509
 on behalf of third party 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.580
 professional designer makes work in the area of ​​creation and development 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.320
 or even in the commercial area, what difference does the judge have in the day-to-day 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.320
 other options you come with here bruna real 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.069
 jorge fossati 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.210
