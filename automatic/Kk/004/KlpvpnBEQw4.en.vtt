00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
know this is true not from experience

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.600

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
going in braces is going to be awful and

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.310 
going in braces is going to be awful and
painful<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.510> it's<00:00:51.510> gonna<00:00:51.690> make<00:00:51.989> your<00:00:52.110> life

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
miserable as a trumpet player but I get

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.299 
miserable as a trumpet player but I get
around<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.960> by<00:00:55.170> telling<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.620> student<00:00:55.980> this

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
around that by telling the student this

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.849 
around that by telling the student this
is<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> great<00:00:56.879> opportunity<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:58.020> work<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.440> things

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
is a great opportunity to work on things

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.860 
is a great opportunity to work on things
other<00:00:59.309> than<00:00:59.489> say<00:00:59.910> upper<00:01:00.270> register<00:01:00.719> and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
other than say upper register and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.200 
other than say upper register and
endurance<00:01:01.199> at<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.500> point<00:01:01.820> but<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.030> great

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
endurance at this point but it's a great

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.520 
endurance at this point but it's a great
chance<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.870> work<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.229> technique<00:01:06.080> jazz<00:01:07.080> playing

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
chance to work on technique jazz playing

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.580 
chance to work on technique jazz playing
and<00:01:08.090> it<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.299> also<00:01:09.479> be<00:01:09.659> helpful<00:01:09.780> for<00:01:10.350> range

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
and it can also be helpful for range

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.020 
and it can also be helpful for range
because<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.159> order<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.400> get<00:01:11.549> range<00:01:11.820> when

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
because in order to get range when

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.550 
because in order to get range when
you're<00:01:12.119> wearing<00:01:12.270> braces<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.840> really<00:01:13.140> should

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
you're wearing braces you really should

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.050 
you're wearing braces you really should
be<00:01:13.710> playing<00:01:13.950> correctly<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.580> maybe

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
be playing correctly and maybe

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.560 
be playing correctly and maybe
using<00:01:15.450> less<00:01:15.600> pressure<00:01:15.930> than<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.619> had<00:01:17.280> before

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
using less pressure than you had before

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.380 
using less pressure than you had before
so<00:01:18.570> those<00:01:19.110> are<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> positive<00:01:19.830> signs<00:01:20.040> of

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
so those are the positive signs of

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.460 
so those are the positive signs of
things<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.750> talk<00:01:21.990> about<00:01:22.020> when

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
things that you can talk about when

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.870 
things that you can talk about when
using<00:01:22.650> braces<00:01:22.950> because<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.460> could<00:01:23.580> be<00:01:23.700> pretty

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
using braces because it could be pretty

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.300 
using braces because it could be pretty
depressing<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:25.530> want<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.979> student<00:01:26.280> to

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
depressing and you want the student to

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.190 
depressing and you want the student to
focus<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.790> what's<00:01:27.030> possible<00:01:27.780> not<00:01:27.990> what's

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
focus on what's possible not what's

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.340 
focus on what's possible not what's
impossible<00:01:29.119> so<00:01:30.119> today<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.720> was<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> different

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
impossible so today it was a different

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.899 
impossible so today it was a different
situation<00:01:31.860> because<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.250> student<00:01:32.520> came<00:01:32.700> in

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
situation because the student came in

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.840 
situation because the student came in
and<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.750> student<00:01:34.110> had<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.220> had<00:01:35.369> his<00:01:35.490> braces

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
and the student had just had his braces

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.219 
and the student had just had his braces
off<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.060> he<00:01:36.390> thought<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.720> was<00:01:36.810> gonna<00:01:36.990> be

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
off and he thought it was gonna be

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.219 
off and he thought it was gonna be
smooth<00:01:37.680> sailing<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.090> told<00:01:39.720> him<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.049> said

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
smooth sailing and so I told him I said

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.499 
smooth sailing and so I told him I said
I<00:01:40.259> know<00:01:40.380> how<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.799> must<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.250> says<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
I know how it must be says you get the

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.149 
I know how it must be says you get the
braces<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.439> think<00:01:43.680> oh<00:01:43.770> ho<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.100> is

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
braces on and you think oh ho this is

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.889 
braces on and you think oh ho this is
not<00:01:44.460> gonna<00:01:44.610> be<00:01:44.700> easy<00:01:44.939> but<00:01:45.119> then<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.420> get<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
not gonna be easy but then you get the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.749 
not gonna be easy but then you get the
morphing<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:46.439> like<00:01:46.530> whoopee<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.640> gonna

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
morphing it's like whoopee this is gonna

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.969 
morphing it's like whoopee this is gonna
be<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.210> great<00:01:48.509> it's<00:01:48.810> gonna<00:01:48.899> be<00:01:49.110> wonderful<00:01:49.350> and

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
be so great it's gonna be wonderful and

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.310 
be so great it's gonna be wonderful and
then<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.549> play<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.360> trumpet<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.140> not

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
then you play the trumpet and it's not

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.929 
then you play the trumpet and it's not
because<00:01:52.829> it's<00:01:53.040> different<00:01:53.310> than<00:01:53.610> what<00:01:53.759> you've

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
because it's different than what you've

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.310 
because it's different than what you've
been<00:01:54.270> used<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.869> last<00:01:54.990> three<00:01:55.290> years

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
been used to for the last three years

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.270 
been used to for the last three years
but<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.840> positive<00:01:57.840> thing<00:01:57.869> too<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.680> think<00:01:58.920> to

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
but the positive thing too so I think to

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.580 
but the positive thing too so I think to
having<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.700> braces<00:01:59.850> off<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.930> now<00:02:01.530> you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
having the braces off is that now you

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.730 
having the braces off is that now you
can<00:02:02.130> make<00:02:02.850> good<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.570> steady<00:02:03.869> progress<00:02:04.229> on

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
can make good and steady progress on

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.660 
can make good and steady progress on
those<00:02:04.890> things<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.490> weren't

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
those things that you weren't

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.459 
those things that you weren't
necessarily<00:02:05.850> able<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.719> do<00:02:06.840> when<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.140> did<00:02:07.320> have

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
necessarily able to do when you did have

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.290 
necessarily able to do when you did have
the<00:02:07.590> braces<00:02:07.950> on<00:02:08.129> more<00:02:08.759> specifically

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
the braces on more specifically

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.839 
the braces on more specifically
endurance<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.319> upper<00:02:10.530> register<00:02:10.979> but<00:02:11.640> getting

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
endurance and upper register but getting

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.580 
endurance and upper register but getting
back<00:02:12.090> into<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.629> is<00:02:12.750> similar<00:02:13.080> to

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
back into it is similar to

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.290 
back into it is similar to
getting<00:02:14.370> back<00:02:14.489> into<00:02:14.670> playing<00:02:14.910> without<00:02:15.180> the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
getting back into playing without the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.229 
getting back into playing without the
braces<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.840> similar<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.349> lots<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:17.239> experiences

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
braces is similar to lots of experiences

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.020 
braces is similar to lots of experiences
I<00:02:18.569> have<00:02:18.840> as<00:02:19.080> students<00:02:19.709> ask<00:02:19.980> me<00:02:20.190> what's<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.849> good

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
I have as students ask me what's a good

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.640 
I have as students ask me what's a good
warm-up<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.630> so<00:02:21.750> I'd<00:02:21.870> like<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.080> mix<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.590> up

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
warm-up and so I'd like to mix that up

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.160 
warm-up and so I'd like to mix that up
and<00:02:22.980> get<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.520> students<00:02:24.050> thinking<00:02:25.050> about

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
and get the students thinking about

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.900 
and get the students thinking about
being<00:02:25.530> creative<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.370> not<00:02:26.459> only<00:02:26.610> in<00:02:26.790> their

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
being creative and not only in their

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.490 
being creative and not only in their
warm-ups<00:02:27.330> but<00:02:27.599> in<00:02:27.720> their<00:02:27.840> musical<00:02:28.200> approach

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
warm-ups but in their musical approach

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.080 
warm-ups but in their musical approach
to<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.890> warmups

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
to the warmups

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.640 
to the warmups
one<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.480> my<00:02:30.569> favorite<00:02:30.930> things<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.200> do<00:02:31.380> the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
one of my favorite things to do the

Walter<00:02:31.950> wide<00:02:32.130> long<00:02:32.400> tones<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:32.880> don't<00:02:33.030> know<00:02:33.090> if<00:02:33.180> I

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
Walter wide long tones I don't know if I

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.750 
Walter wide long tones I don't know if I
talked<00:02:33.510> about<00:02:33.599> this<00:02:33.870> before<00:02:34.400> but<00:02:35.400> if<00:02:35.519> I<00:02:35.610> can

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
talked about this before but if I can

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.120 
talked about this before but if I can
find<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.269> on<00:02:36.660> my<00:02:36.810> computer<00:02:36.870> I'll<00:02:37.739> play<00:02:38.099> a

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
find this on my computer I'll play a

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.900 
find this on my computer I'll play a
little<00:02:38.430> bit<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:39.380> this<00:02:40.380> Walter<00:02:40.860> White<00:02:41.099> and<00:02:41.459> I

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
think it's just the best thing it's

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.110 
think it's just the best thing it's
really<00:02:43.920> fun<00:02:44.190> for<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.569> students<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.950> let<00:02:47.790> me

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
really fun for the students and let me

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.980 
really fun for the students and let me
see<00:02:48.269> if<00:02:48.360> they<00:02:48.450> can<00:02:48.600> get<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:48.840> going

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
see if they can get this going

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.350 
see if they can get this going
so<00:02:51.990> you<00:02:52.050> should<00:02:52.380> be<00:02:52.470> able<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.680> hear<00:02:52.860> this<00:02:53.360> and

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
so you should be able to hear this and

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
so you should be able to hear this and
what's<00:02:54.570> so<00:02:54.690> great<00:02:54.720> about<00:02:54.930> this

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
what's so great about this

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.010 
what's so great about this
as<00:02:57.860> you<00:02:58.070> can<00:02:58.250> just<00:02:58.400> you<00:02:58.970> play<00:02:59.810> what's

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
as you can just you play what's

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:24.320 
as you can just you play what's
comfortable

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.210 

so<00:03:25.330> it's<00:03:25.780> nothing<00:03:26.230> fancy<00:03:26.740> but<00:03:26.770> that's<00:03:27.040> one

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
so it's nothing fancy but that's one

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.100 
so it's nothing fancy but that's one
thing<00:03:27.400> I<00:03:27.490> really<00:03:27.520> like<00:03:27.940> about<00:03:27.970> it<00:03:28.270> turn<00:03:28.960> this

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
thing I really like about it turn this

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.640 
thing I really like about it turn this
off<00:03:29.320> now<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:31.660> that's<00:03:31.840> a<00:03:32.020> Walter<00:03:32.440> White<00:03:32.680> and

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
off now and that's a Walter White and

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.570 
off now and that's a Walter White and
after<00:03:35.650> you've<00:03:35.830> done<00:03:35.890> something<00:03:36.400> like<00:03:36.460> that

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
after you've done something like that

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.620 
after you've done something like that
you<00:03:36.910> can<00:03:37.090> go<00:03:37.240> to<00:03:38.370> something<00:03:39.370> that's<00:03:39.630> written

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
you can go to something that's written

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.770 
you can go to something that's written
