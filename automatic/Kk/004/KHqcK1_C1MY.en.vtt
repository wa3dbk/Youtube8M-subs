few things to consider here drop a

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.140 
few things to consider here drop a
tuning<00:03:12.230> is<00:03:12.290> pretty<00:03:12.560> low<00:03:12.799> your<00:03:13.640> tuning<00:03:14.000> is

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
tuning is pretty low your tuning is

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.900 
tuning is pretty low your tuning is
gonna<00:03:14.330> want<00:03:14.540> to<00:03:14.630> kind<00:03:15.319> of<00:03:15.380> slip<00:03:15.620> around<00:03:15.910> you

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
gonna want to kind of slip around you

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.190 
gonna want to kind of slip around you
know<00:03:17.030> when<00:03:17.360> you<00:03:17.450> tune<00:03:17.600> that<00:03:17.750> low<00:03:17.930> you<00:03:17.959> don't

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
know when you tune that low you don't

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.600 
know when you tune that low you don't
have<00:03:18.350> any<00:03:18.620> whines<00:03:18.860> around<00:03:19.190> your<00:03:19.310> tuning

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
have any whines around your tuning

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.140 
have any whines around your tuning
tuning<00:03:20.360> keys<00:03:20.660> so<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:22.340> could<00:03:22.489> very<00:03:22.730> easily<00:03:22.820> go

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
tuning keys so it could very easily go

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.190 
tuning keys so it could very easily go
out<00:03:23.209> of<00:03:23.390> tune<00:03:23.480> as<00:03:23.720> you're<00:03:23.840> playing<00:03:24.019> it

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
out of tune as you're playing it

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.720 
out of tune as you're playing it
especially<00:03:24.769> if<00:03:24.859> it's<00:03:24.980> not<00:03:25.100> accustomed<00:03:25.640> to

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
especially if it's not accustomed to

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.949 
especially if it's not accustomed to
that<00:03:25.880> cut<00:03:26.209> type<00:03:26.480> of<00:03:26.660> tuning<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:28.220> uh<00:03:28.250> I<00:03:28.959> think

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
that cut type of tuning and uh I think

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.150 
that cut type of tuning and uh I think
I'm<00:03:30.170> just<00:03:30.230> gonna<00:03:30.350> leave<00:03:30.560> this<00:03:30.680> go<00:03:30.920> a<00:03:30.950> little
