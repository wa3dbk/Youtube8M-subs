v85<00:00:35.489> everything<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.210> fully<00:00:36.540> compatible<00:00:36.899> and

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
v85 everything is fully compatible and

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.610 
v85 everything is fully compatible and
we<00:00:38.160> also<00:00:38.340> have<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> unique<00:00:39.480> DC<00:00:39.960> brushless<00:00:40.230> fuel

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
we also have a unique DC brushless fuel

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.459 
we also have a unique DC brushless fuel
system<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.730> corporates<00:00:42.660> electronics<00:00:43.320> that

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
system that corporates electronics that

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.500 
system that corporates electronics that
actually<00:00:43.770> commutator<00:00:44.280> motor<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.239> we<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.480> a

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
actually commutator motor so we have a

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.139 
actually commutator motor so we have a
much<00:00:45.840> more<00:00:46.260> powerful<00:00:46.500> smaller<00:00:47.100> package<00:00:47.910> and

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
much more powerful smaller package and

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.389 
much more powerful smaller package and
we<00:00:48.600> can<00:00:48.750> speed<00:00:49.020> control<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.250> can

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
we can speed control it so that it can

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.950 
we can speed control it so that it can
be<00:00:50.610> used<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> street<00:00:51.420> for<00:00:51.570> high<00:00:51.719> flow

be used on the street for high flow

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.200 
be used on the street for high flow
applications<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.250> speak<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.969> wouldn't

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
applications that you speak you wouldn't

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.180 
applications that you speak you wouldn't
be<00:00:54.270> able<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.480> do<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.809> without<00:00:55.230> having<00:00:55.590> lots<00:00:56.039> of

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
be able to do it without having lots of

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.520 
be able to do it without having lots of
components<00:00:56.520> together<00:00:57.079> well<00:00:58.079> speaking<00:00:58.410> of

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
components together well speaking of

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.410 
components together well speaking of
different<00:00:59.219> types<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.609> fuels<00:00:59.820> obviously

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
different types of fuels obviously

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.880 
different types of fuels obviously
there's<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.690> lot<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.050> options<00:01:01.199> out<00:01:01.530> there<00:01:01.739> for

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
there's a lot of options out there for

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.100 
there's a lot of options out there for
consumers<00:01:02.039> now<00:01:02.550> what<00:01:03.359> makes<00:01:03.570> your<00:01:03.690> products

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
consumers now what makes your products

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.530 
consumers now what makes your products
compatible<00:01:04.680> with<00:01:04.830> those<00:01:04.979> fuels<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.880> lot<00:01:06.450> of

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
compatible with those fuels a lot of

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.060 
compatible with those fuels a lot of
times<00:01:06.689> we<00:01:06.960> since<00:01:07.530> we<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> brushless

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
times we since we have a brushless

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.950 
times we since we have a brushless
system<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.880> won't<00:01:09.090> react<00:01:09.420> with<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.689> fuel

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
system it won't react with the fuel

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.929 
system it won't react with the fuel
inside<00:01:10.170> there<00:01:10.619> also<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.310> use<00:01:11.460> all<00:01:11.640> floor

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
inside there also we use all floor

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.020 
inside there also we use all floor
silicone<00:01:12.510> seals<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.950> different<00:01:14.159> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
silicone seals and and different a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.969 
silicone seals and and different a
little<00:01:15.659> bit<00:01:15.780> more<00:01:15.930> expensive<00:01:16.409> components

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
little bit more expensive components

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.700 
little bit more expensive components
inside<00:01:17.280> there<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:19.229> prevent<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
inside there that that that prevent the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.920 
inside there that that that prevent the
reactions<00:01:20.450> perfect<00:01:21.450> well<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.630> see<00:01:21.900> that

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
reactions perfect well I see that

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.480 
reactions perfect well I see that
there's<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> lot<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.380> different<00:01:22.710> colors<00:01:23.130> in

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
there's a lot of different colors in

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.010 
there's a lot of different colors in
your<00:01:23.850> booth<00:01:24.030> as<00:01:24.240> well<00:01:24.420> what<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.930> you

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
your booth as well what is it that you

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.840 
your booth as well what is it that you
guys<00:01:25.140> do<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.799> make<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.100> more<00:01:26.340> what

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
guys do to this to make it more what

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.149 
guys do to this to make it more what
appearance<00:01:27.600> friendly<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.290> vehicle<00:01:28.619> yeah

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
appearance friendly in the vehicle yeah

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.310 
appearance friendly in the vehicle yeah
quite<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.729> bit<00:01:29.820> because<00:01:30.270> we<00:01:30.450> have<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.750> demand<00:01:31.110> for

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
quite a bit because we have a demand for

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.350 
quite a bit because we have a demand for
people<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.829> put<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.400> their<00:01:32.549> show<00:01:32.759> cars<00:01:33.030> and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
people to put in on their show cars and

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.990 
people to put in on their show cars and
so<00:01:34.110> they<00:01:34.380> have<00:01:34.530> different<00:01:35.130> color<00:01:35.310> options<00:01:35.549> we

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
so they have different color options we

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.670 
so they have different color options we
also<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.420> different<00:01:36.750> pressure<00:01:36.990> options<00:01:37.530> we

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
also have different pressure options we

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.010 
also have different pressure options we
try<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> tailor<00:01:38.400> our<00:01:38.640> stuff<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.420> user

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
try to tailor our stuff to the user

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.560 
try to tailor our stuff to the user
awesome<00:01:40.860> well<00:01:41.040> speaking<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.090> new<00:01:42.329> and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
awesome well speaking of new and

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.749 
awesome well speaking of new and
improved<00:01:42.990> what<00:01:43.649> do<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:43.950> new<00:01:44.130> coming<00:01:44.670> up

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
improved what do you have new coming up

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.690 
improved what do you have new coming up
in<00:01:44.880> 2011<00:01:45.720> we<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.350> demand<00:01:47.100> base<00:01:47.369> fuel

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
in 2011 we have a demand base fuel

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.940 
in 2011 we have a demand base fuel
system<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.299> automatically<00:01:48.990> handles<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
system that automatically handles the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.039 
system that automatically handles the
speed<00:01:50.220> control<00:01:50.579> based<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> patented<00:01:51.630> return

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
speed control based on a patented return

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.530 
speed control based on a patented return
return<00:01:52.740> system<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.880> automatically

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
return system that automatically

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.660 
return system that automatically
controls<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.259> fuel<00:01:55.829> system<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.579> can

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
controls the fuel system so it can

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.190 
controls the fuel system so it can
reduce<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.000> speeds<00:01:57.420> down<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.930> have<00:01:57.960> low

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
reduce the speeds down so you have low

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.440 
reduce the speeds down so you have low
current<00:01:58.560> draw<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.219> street<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.759> then<00:02:00.299> we

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
current draw for the street and then we

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.510

mostly it is race related it's we have

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.339 
mostly it is race related it's we have
high<00:02:14.879> flow<00:02:15.120> systems<00:02:15.569> that<00:02:15.720> will<00:02:15.840> handle<00:02:15.989> up<00:02:16.230> to

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
high flow systems that will handle up to

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.470 
high flow systems that will handle up to
1,800<00:02:16.920> horsepower<00:02:17.040> off<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.580> single<00:02:18.060> pump<00:02:18.239> that

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
1,800 horsepower off a single pump that

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.500 
1,800 horsepower off a single pump that
weighs<00:02:18.629> about<00:02:18.660> two<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.319> half<00:02:19.500> pounds<00:02:19.980> and

that's our main thing all right so we've
got<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.590> regulator's<00:02:26.310> covered<00:02:26.879> but<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.450> guys

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
got the regulator's covered but you guys

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.330 
got the regulator's covered but you guys
do<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.780> lot<00:02:27.959> more<00:02:27.989> than<00:02:28.379> that<00:02:28.530> what<00:02:28.830> else<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.160> new
