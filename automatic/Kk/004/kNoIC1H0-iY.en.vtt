00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
you can take from it the idea of the

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.580 
you can take from it the idea of the
technique<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:36.940> the<00:00:37.940> gags<00:00:38.480> uses<00:00:38.930> and<00:00:39.320> maybe

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
technique and the gags uses and maybe

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.750 
technique and the gags uses and maybe
expand<00:00:40.100> on<00:00:40.220> it<00:00:40.309> and<00:00:40.430> use<00:00:40.550> it<00:00:40.580> in<00:00:40.730> different

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
expand on it and use it in different

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.210 
expand on it and use it in different
ways<00:00:41.180> so<00:00:42.110> somewhere<00:00:42.650> in<00:00:42.739> the<00:00:42.830> middle<00:00:42.890> of<00:00:43.129> the

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
ways so somewhere in the middle of the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.780 
ways so somewhere in the middle of the
song<00:00:43.750> around<00:00:44.750> 140<00:00:45.440> somewhere<00:00:46.339> around<00:00:46.430> there

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
song around 140 somewhere around there

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.270 
song around 140 somewhere around there
this<00:00:47.299> whole<00:00:47.479> song<00:00:47.750> breaks<00:00:48.019> down<00:00:48.290> it<00:00:48.949> cuts<00:00:49.159> to

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
this whole song breaks down it cuts to

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.670 
this whole song breaks down it cuts to
just<00:00:49.460> acoustic<00:00:49.909> guitar<00:00:50.239> and<00:00:50.360> vocals<00:00:50.809> and<00:00:51.019> then

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
just acoustic guitar and vocals and then

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.820 
just acoustic guitar and vocals and then
and<00:00:52.010> then<00:00:52.940> that<00:00:52.970> just<00:00:53.180> fades<00:00:53.720> down<00:00:54.229> to<00:00:54.470> nothing

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
and then that just fades down to nothing

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.490 
and then that just fades down to nothing
and<00:00:55.549> out<00:00:55.729> of<00:00:55.909> nowhere<00:00:56.089> god<00:00:56.750> plays<00:00:57.019> this<00:00:57.199> feel

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
and out of nowhere god plays this feel

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.710 
and out of nowhere god plays this feel
to<00:00:57.949> bring<00:00:58.159> them<00:00:58.280> use<00:00:58.430> it<00:00:58.549> back<00:00:58.670> in<00:00:58.909> so<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.420> feel

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
to bring them use it back in so the feel

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:08.670 
to bring them use it back in so the feel
sounds<00:01:00.049> like<00:01:00.170> this<00:01:03.519> so<00:01:04.519> I'll<00:01:04.580> play<00:01:04.760> that<00:01:04.909> again

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.410 

so<00:01:09.680> it's<00:01:09.799> very<00:01:09.979> short<00:01:10.340> it's<00:01:10.670> not<00:01:10.760> a<00:01:10.880> lot<00:01:11.060> to<00:01:11.270> it

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
so it's very short it's not a lot to it

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.930 
so it's very short it's not a lot to it
but<00:01:11.590> it's<00:01:12.590> sprayed<00:01:12.860> tasteful<00:01:13.280> fill<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:13.760> just

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
but it's sprayed tasteful fill and just

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.180 
but it's sprayed tasteful fill and just
worked<00:01:14.180> brilliantly<00:01:14.450> so<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.470> song<00:01:15.890> itself

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
worked brilliantly so the song itself

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.550 
worked brilliantly so the song itself
Eve<00:01:16.400> actually<00:01:16.700> swung<00:01:16.990> but<00:01:17.990> a<00:01:18.020> fill<00:01:18.260> winner<00:01:18.440> can

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
Eve actually swung but a fill winner can

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.970 
Eve actually swung but a fill winner can

twist turned on its head somehow to make

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.080 
twist turned on its head somehow to make
it<00:01:38.659> interesting<00:01:39.020> afresh<00:01:39.530> so<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.700> rudiment

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
it interesting afresh so the rudiment

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.370 
it interesting afresh so the rudiment
involved<00:01:41.510> here<00:01:41.720> is<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.930> double<00:01:42.080> straight

roll and he's playing that between the
snare<00:01:46.909> and<00:01:46.940> the<00:01:47.120> hi-hat<00:01:47.330> so<00:01:47.630> right<00:01:47.810> hand<00:01:47.960> on

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
on the bass drum and explain Lisa's

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.660 
on the bass drum and explain Lisa's
sixteenth<00:02:10.050> notes<00:02:10.319> now<00:02:10.709> there<00:02:10.860> ain't<00:02:11.100> notes<00:02:11.459> we

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
sixteenth notes now there ain't notes we

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.070 
sixteenth notes now there ain't notes we
need<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.910> look<00:02:12.030> at<00:02:12.180> here<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:12.510> I'm<00:02:12.600> just<00:02:12.630> fix<00:02:12.990> it

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
need to look at here so I'm just fix it

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.680 
need to look at here so I'm just fix it
on<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.290> first<00:02:13.530> state<00:02:13.800> nose<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:15.390> then<00:02:15.569> he

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
on the first state nose and then he

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.870 
on the first state nose and then he
starts<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.110> double<00:02:16.380> stroke<00:02:16.590> roll<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.700> e

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
starts to double stroke roll on the e

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.620 
starts to double stroke roll on the e
because<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.810> one<00:02:18.990> is<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.230> bass<00:02:19.380> drum<00:02:20.540> so<00:02:21.540> the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
because the one is the bass drum so the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.180 
because the one is the bass drum so the
first<00:02:21.870> double<00:02:22.260> no<00:02:22.380> he's<00:02:22.530> gonna<00:02:22.709> start<00:02:22.980> on<00:02:23.100> the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
first double no he's gonna start on the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.340 
first double no he's gonna start on the
snare<00:02:23.400> drum<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:24.390> with<00:02:24.630> our<00:02:24.750> left<00:02:24.930> hand<00:02:25.140> and

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
snare drum and with our left hand and

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.309 
snare drum and with our left hand and
and<00:02:26.160> then<00:02:26.340> we<00:02:26.489> pay<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:27.239> two<00:02:27.630> left<00:02:27.810> hands<00:02:28.050> on<00:02:28.260> the

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
and then we pay to two left hands on the

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.590 
and then we pay to two left hands on the
snare<00:02:28.530> two<00:02:29.190> right<00:02:29.430> hands<00:02:29.700> on<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.880> hat<00:02:30.060> two

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
snare two right hands on the hat two

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.420 
snare two right hands on the hat two
left<00:02:30.810> hands<00:02:31.050> on<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.319> snare<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.160> double

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
left hands on the snare so the double

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.660 
left hands on the snare so the double
stroke<00:02:32.670> roll<00:02:32.700> aspect<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.569> sounds<00:02:33.810> like<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.050> one

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.890 

he's<00:02:38.670> basically<00:02:38.910> just<00:02:39.060> inverted<00:02:39.720> those

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
he's basically just inverted those

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.420 
he's basically just inverted those
doubles<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:40.440> rather<00:02:40.590> than<00:02:40.709> starting<00:02:41.100> on<00:02:41.310> the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
doubles so rather than starting on the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.000 
doubles so rather than starting on the
beat<00:02:41.580> there<00:02:42.120> they're<00:02:42.480> off<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.750> beat<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.739> so

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
beat there they're off the beat and so

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.620 
beat there they're off the beat and so
with<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.280> first<00:02:44.519> bass<00:02:44.790> drum<00:02:45.060> we<00:02:45.209> sound<00:02:45.480> like

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
with that first bass drum we sound like

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:53.930 
with that first bass drum we sound like
this<00:02:45.930> when<00:02:51.860> we're<00:02:52.860> playing<00:02:53.010> those<00:02:53.640> snare

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
this when we're playing those snare

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.660 
this when we're playing those snare
drums<00:02:54.180> our<00:02:54.360> left<00:02:54.540> hands<00:02:54.930> as<00:02:55.260> ghost<00:02:55.530> notes<00:02:55.800> and

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
drums our left hands as ghost notes and

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.130 
drums our left hands as ghost notes and
then<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.060> finish<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.480> same<00:02:57.690> thing<00:02:57.870> phrase

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
then you finish the same thing phrase

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:11.509 
then you finish the same thing phrase
with<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.620> bass<00:02:58.830> drum<00:02:59.069> on<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.250> end<00:03:10.250> so<00:03:11.250> that's

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
with a bass drum on the end so that's

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.860 
with a bass drum on the end so that's
that's<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.090> phrase<00:03:12.299> that's<00:03:12.570> too<00:03:12.660> kind<00:03:12.780> of

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
that's the phrase that's too kind of

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.710 
that's the phrase that's too kind of
magical<00:03:13.320> bit<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:14.070> then<00:03:14.340> at<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.120> end<00:03:15.150> it's

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
magical bit and then at the end it's

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.600 
magical bit and then at the end it's
just<00:03:15.930> simply<00:03:16.230> two<00:03:16.410> quarter<00:03:16.860> notes<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.430> first

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
just simply two quarter notes the first

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.090 
just simply two quarter notes the first
one<00:03:17.850> we've<00:03:18.000> run<00:03:18.120> on<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.269> right<00:03:18.450> hand<00:03:18.690> over

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
one we've run on the right hand over

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.100 
one we've run on the right hand over
play<00:03:20.100> an<00:03:20.160> accented<00:03:20.820> snare<00:03:21.150> then<00:03:21.750> again<00:03:21.989> with

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
play an accented snare then again with

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.819 
play an accented snare then again with
the<00:03:22.200> right<00:03:22.350> hand<00:03:22.590> an<00:03:23.070> open<00:03:23.489> hi-hat<00:03:24.709> so<00:03:25.709> the

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
the right hand an open hi-hat so the

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.190 
the right hand an open hi-hat so the
last<00:03:26.010> bit<00:03:26.370> we've<00:03:26.670> gone<00:03:26.820> one<00:03:27.209> E<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.900> two<00:03:27.930> E

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
last bit we've gone one E and a two E

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:37.009 
last bit we've gone one E and a two E
and<00:03:28.380> if<00:03:30.440> to<00:03:31.440> play<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.650> whole<00:03:31.739> phrase<00:03:32.070> I<00:03:36.019> play

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
and if to play the whole phrase I play

00:03:37.019 --> 00:04:20.479 
and if to play the whole phrase I play
that<00:03:37.109> very<00:03:37.380> slowly

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.490 

to<00:04:21.489> hear<00:04:21.669> how<00:04:21.849> God<00:04:22.060> actually<00:04:22.930> executes<00:04:23.470> that

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
to hear how God actually executes that

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.770 
to hear how God actually executes that
with<00:04:24.190> that<00:04:24.310> finesse<00:04:24.699> you<00:04:25.000> know<00:04:25.570> there's

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
with that finesse you know there's

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.620 
with that finesse you know there's
really<00:04:26.020> tasteful<00:04:26.590> grace<00:04:26.740> notes<00:04:27.389> but<00:04:28.389> it's<00:04:28.539> a

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
really tasteful grace notes but it's a

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.200 
really tasteful grace notes but it's a
really<00:04:28.900> effective<00:04:29.110> feel<00:04:29.620> and<00:04:29.889> then<00:04:30.460> I'm<00:04:31.090> just

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
really effective feel and then I'm just

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.180 
really effective feel and then I'm just
gonna<00:04:31.360> play<00:04:31.630> out<00:04:31.720> with<00:04:31.900> them<00:04:32.110> some<00:04:33.099> other

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
gonna play out with them some other

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.040 
gonna play out with them some other
ideas<00:04:33.639> how<00:04:33.849> you<00:04:33.880> could<00:04:34.240> possibly<00:04:34.360> expand<00:04:34.930> on

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
ideas how you could possibly expand on

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.779 
ideas how you could possibly expand on
that<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.349> actually<00:04:35.710> create<00:04:36.070> a<00:04:36.099> groove<00:04:36.400> from<00:04:36.639> it

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
that to actually create a groove from it

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.230 
that to actually create a groove from it
so<00:04:37.449> you<00:04:37.780> know<00:04:37.870> perhaps<00:04:38.289> to<00:04:38.530> feel<00:04:38.740> very<00:04:39.729> slowly

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
so you know perhaps to feel very slowly

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.969 
so you know perhaps to feel very slowly
get<00:04:40.449> it<00:04:40.539> all<00:04:40.599> nice<00:04:40.750> and<00:04:40.810> even<00:04:41.020> and<00:04:41.440> then<00:04:41.770> see

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
get it all nice and even and then see

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.520 
get it all nice and even and then see
where<00:04:42.130> you<00:04:42.190> can<00:04:42.340> take
