 more than me well many congratulations 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.600
 Tell us a little how you prepare 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.220
 to achieve all this obviously we know 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.230
 which is a different discipline that 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.950
 many times it is not known which ones are 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.750
 these 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.300
 let's say tools that you handle for 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.430
 to be able to be how you are looking at the 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.640
 nutrition plays a super role 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.590
 important throughout the part of the 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.430
 Obviously our preparation 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.030
 training has to be very strong 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.620
 but the food is basic we 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.510
 every day we have to go checking 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.480
 exactly what do we eat that 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.030
 how our body is reacting to 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.240
 certain foods and to cut the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.700
 the carbohydrates or until you get to zero 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.030
 When the competition reaches 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.490
 basically vegetable proteins 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.990
 complex carbohydrate proteins and 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.990
 few simple carbohydrates 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.600
 and you learned to feed in this way 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.829
 since childhood was something that you were 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.049
 knowing as I went and you are growing 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.030
 how did you manage to have a 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.060
 feeding in this way look look 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.220
 that I took this I started to take 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.679
 courses because I wanted to look good 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.990
 I only started taking courses of 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.360
 nutrition of training techniques to 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.619
 the 16 years 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.619
 simply because I wanted to 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.000
 what was the process that you did that 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.490
 you managed to get to this championship 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.420
 good look 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.420
 and I started competing 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.260
 in gym-level events after 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.600
 national level in rookie categories 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.569
 after I went to classifieds 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.970
 the largest category in Mexico 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:27.090
 win the mÃ © xico mexico in 2009 win 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.510
 after the national championship in the 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.569
 2011 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.360
 He is runner-up in the American North but 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.269
 this year I take the national championship 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.640
 I prepared with everything and to the maximum the 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.280
 mission possible in toronto being in a 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.079
 country not so well known maybe out of 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.520
 your house outside of your family that was what 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.260
 more difficult 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:54.079
 look the hardest 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.130
 is to be alone in precisely one country 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:59.310
 where 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.190
 they see the Mexicans as they see us as 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.670
 something inferior and I want to say it like that of 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:09.810
 front because in fact because people do not 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.240
 competitors from the USA and Canada do not 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.319
 they believed that I was Mexican and so I 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:19.090
 they said with certain 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:21.720
 at the derogatory level but good 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.010
 with a winning mentality for that 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.680
 I do not care 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.370
 I did not care and I went to what I was 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.780
 is to win and that's all it is and that 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.280
 continues for you and that continues for waldo 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.129
 which is where your mind is 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.489
 approximately good look I have you 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:43.040
 several projects or many projects to 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:46.340
 competitive level well I want 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.140

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.200
