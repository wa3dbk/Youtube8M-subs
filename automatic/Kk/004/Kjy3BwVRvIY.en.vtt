00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.669
 everyone here commenting and I'm lame 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.519
 new video this time I bring you a 

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:09.860
 unboxing of the new card grace that 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.530
 I have taken and one is about the 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:17.779
 gigabyte as you see there it will look good 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:21.890
 equal geforce gtx 650 a pretty good 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.119
 graphic cost me 120 euros was 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.050
 complete in the dependent that I've 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.269
 decided to buy melo the bad thing is that at 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.949
 have to buy very this graph gives 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.129
 account the meditating limitation of 400 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.540
 watts or 21 sacks does not fit then 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.790
 I have to buy a new one too 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.270
 power supply so that the 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.890
 support the graph and also that the 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.370
 other components that something have to 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.670
 put up with 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:52.140
 is a graph your gigabyte and geforce gtx 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.300
 150 2 gb gddr5 and well let's proceed 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.350
 to open this 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.350
 who has here 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.579
 what union code of a thing to live 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.830
 of the world of warcraft 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.290
 and if not then I'll leave it here below and what 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.680
 first, come here, he will take it here 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.950
 as we note a disc for 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.160
 install it and to do the overclock that 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.590
 is for you to increase the graphic power 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:30.100
 here a cable cited the connection 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.130
 and here we have the graphics card I do not know 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.789
 very well that we say so you can not 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.789
 apply with one hand 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.200
 and if not then cut thread and managed to 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.430
 all right 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.020
 well here we have the source 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.880
 480 power as I say the graph 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.000
 you need 400 I said to buy one of 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.400
 480 has cost me about 15 more payments or 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.920
 least you will understand it if a few and 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:59.090
 you can open them to the purchase more or less 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.620
 has been about 136 euros if I do not count 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.120
 plus 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.120
 pain and suffering 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:12.040
 this has no mystery is guilty of the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:17.140
 current let's take 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.239
 and you do not have to be a teacher to 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.010
 know how to put this and here good 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.370
 power of the connector that carries the 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.310
 normal and then the cables that go to the 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.200
 motherboard and the components so 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.170
 well as I say I'm going to talk a second 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.019
 'grand to be able to explain it can not 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.280
 open it up as well as such a good hand here 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.459
 you can see the thanks as it is for 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.459
 inside 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.829
 I think it looks good so 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.970
 Refrigerate the graphics and do not break 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.659
 this is the connection that has to be 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:56.409
 a pc and express for 16 d I think it's 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:58.120
 2.0 3.0 follows the 3.0 and mine 2.0 of the 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.650
 base silver so I will not be able to go to 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.200
 maximum maximum maximum we paste the 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.340
 difference is remarkable 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.139
 well here we have the connections that 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.599
 has what I am this the vga of all 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:12.790
 life and I say does not also have hdmi that 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:16.319
 but I will not be able to use it hdmi up 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.319
 I did not buy a monitor
