00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello all how good the video 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:08.370
 Today is going to deal with exfoliating creams 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:12.340
 or cleansing gels for our face 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.889
 ok I'll start with this cream that is 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.490
 what I normally used was worth seeing 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.350
 the reflection that does not stop me from garnier 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.480
 OK 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.310
 it's a 13 in 1 here it says you can 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.120
 use as a cleanser as an exfoliant 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.040
 or as a mask is worth here if you read the 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.100
 instructions your powers that you can 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.990
 do the cleaning daily I 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.610
 saying a little obviously we have to 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.540
 have our face well clean well 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.310
 make-up remover 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.320
 and well, we can use it as 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.600
 cleaner face a little bit wet from 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.300
 massage for two minutes and rinse 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.040
 as an exfoliating massage every day 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.600
 making circular movements and 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.970
 insist on the front nose chin 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.770
 that on our zone tec is the area 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.770
 more oily where we accumulate oral 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.320
 in the granites and rinse with water or 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.700
 as a mask durÃ¡n 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.980
 for two or three times a week 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.900
 doing the same but letting act 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.560
 for three minutes it's worth leaving it with 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.079
 a mask 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.810
 and good the effect that this cream has 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:15.810
 I like it a lot, I usually use it 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.530
 not every day and neither two or three 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.970
 times a week sometimes once or twice 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.399
 twice very rarely the truth once 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.729
 per week and I'm going to leave them as 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.580
 mask and I left it longer than 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.170
 that says here first I do the massage 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.909
 then he left it for about five or 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.710
 seven minutes and when I'm going to 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.840
 remove me dzeko a bit and I'm going to 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.810
 massage a little bit not too much and 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.850
 I clarify, and the effect that it has on me 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.539
 like that leaves your skin as well as 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.610
 that a little bit bright and leaves you well 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.369
 clean and above all very cool and now 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.349
 I'm going to talk about another cream that more 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.869
 that nothing wanted to give you my opinion during 

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:58.789
 my trip to Malta because one day we were 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:02.310
 walking around the capital my partner and I 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:05.039
 and a boy approached us and told us if 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.049
 we wanted to try the cream such and this and 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.990
 so I did not tell him I did not tell him 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.690
 ok I said ok ok but 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.640
 my intention to buy it and well then 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.790
 did the test in this area here of the 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.950
 clean arm well with soap then 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.070
 he took a little bit of the cream worth of 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.830
 this exfoliating cream massage me or 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.610
 during nothing a few seconds then the 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.370
 clean with a cloth and miso as the test 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.100
 I played and played here and the truth is that 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.670
 you feel very soft, you noticed the skin more 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.860
 clean and all this and we have done well 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.920
 cooking convention and what good then 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.530
 I'm going to buy it, then the jolla 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.740
 I did not believe much cream and first I'll go 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.330
 to say the pack they come are three creams 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.550
 that is the one that most used I do not know if it 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.030
 see there in the light that I already have super 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.260
 I've already spent it here 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.420
 and well good the exfoliating cream 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.940
 comes a foot cream and comes a 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.790
 hand cream is worth the hand cream 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.880
 I have also used quite a lot 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.520
 because I had when you put it on, you're not 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.610
 at the moment of skin as it becomes soft 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.830
 how it looks good to you and I like it 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.810
 how is the foot cream I have not 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.670
 used a lot sincerely for not 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.980
 I mean, I used it one or two 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.750
 times and of course so you can not see either 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.660
 the result you can not see if it really 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.580
 this hydrates or not because I have the 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.080
 very dry feet and use a cream 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.180
 pharmacy then this has not 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.760
 used a lot but they are already 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.730
 using already I will tell you how it goes but good 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.410
 my point is about this cream is worth 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.540
 line of cream is called premier 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:50.050
 and then here it says that it has components 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.900
 of the dead evil and who is 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.820
 that has aromatic oils and all the 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.380
 thing is not so because it is in French and 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:01.840
 in English and good comes in 75 ml to see 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.060
 if you can see it 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.300
 and good what I should say about this cream 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.260
 is that it has worked for me more 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.060
 that the gandia cream and the drinking boy 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.479
 He told us that we had to use it 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.600
 Well, I had to use it twice 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.310
 the week for a month after that 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.419
 spend the first month you can use it 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.639
 once a week 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.560
 I'm going to be a month and a half 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.490
 I have already used it every time 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.550
 week and then to the second week of 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.790
 use it or the four applications 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.430
 I started noticing the results I do not know 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.700
 if I 'll be seen soon a little bit like that myself 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.040
 had I do not know why maybe good 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.569
 always health as we eat and everything 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.270
 this influences not even if we are seen 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:52.309
 I had many pimples out many 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.409
 granites apart also from the nerves 

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:56.059
 we get many pimples and skins 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:58.459
 changing a lot is making me 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:05:02.689
 a little more fat especially the area 

00:04:58.459 --> 00:05:04.639
 you and did not start using it and if I saw 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:06.740
 the results and how they started 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.860
 go the little spots the granites were going 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.899
 disappearing and good the action that 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.389
 it has a little bit the cream is that it's going 

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:16.369
 cleaning and those granites that you sometimes 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.429
 you do not see that you have like accumulated grease 

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:21.919
 you see like ones that are not called but 

00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:23.539
 you do not look thin like that on the outside red or the 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.089
 black dot but you feel like a 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:28.279
 puff because the action of the cream is 

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:30.080
 that that you have left grasita 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:32.930
 excess in your face is taking it out 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.089
 gradually you the will to serve until 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.449
 same is left in a little black dot or in a 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:40.939
 little granite then you and me that 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.979
 every two weeks every month you have to 

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:46.099
 do your facial cleaning your extraction 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:47.809
 of your granites and then you're staying 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:51.220
 the skin much better me since I 've 

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:54.170
 I used this cream has liked 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.780
 now if you mark that I had many 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.670
 red marquitas and that's what you 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.730
 I wanted to tell from this believe me the only thing 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.290
 I do not like it more than anything because 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.670
 now my skin is changing as I already 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.430
 I said it's making me a little bit more 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:10.310
 fat from what was before what I did not 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:14.240
 it's like that the oils that I have have 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:17.060
 fear or doubt and air but how are you 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.550
 passing the time that I do myself 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.470
 I lose a little bit more greasy because 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.300
 has enough oil was not you go 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.400
 to use you have to beat the good 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.800
 first so that all the 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.980
 oils then with the with the components 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.480
 that you have and then use it and well that 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.100
 is the only thing that bothers me that 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.480
 I do not know if it's going to make me skin anymore 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:40.970
 fat of what is being done to me if 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.880
 you seek to cleanse our face 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:46.010
 daily to have fresh skin that 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.870
 do not have many marquitas that you have 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:51.420
 little black dots but 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.280
 not that exaggerated that you have many 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.080
 blackheads of the nose and that always 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.380
 you have to be has been 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.430
 scans and extractions on your skin 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.740
 Well this is the cream that you can 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.290
 use this daily to have 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.000
 our clean face is very well worth 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.310
 but for the girls that like me now 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.340
 I am already very happy with how they are doing 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.890
 stopping my face that you have dots 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.010
 blacks and granites and excess fat in 

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:20.040
 your face is cream is very good 

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:22.200
