00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.699
 will find for a new video 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:21.779
 then not to show some hiding 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:25.890
 more tempted some hiding and and 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.869
 how to get out of the terminal map then 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.750
 it was all and it's easy it's 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.090
 really easy so he's hiding is already 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.000
 is full but he's hiding and not going 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.579
 get in there I'll show out 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.829
 take out hiding places 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:46.850
 so I will show you then then 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.829
 so a new video as you see 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.690
 on terminal so then already raw 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.800
 boards go back on the orange thing 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.969
 must have marathon and unlimited sprint 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.559
 you can and pop 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.010
 and there you are on the wings of 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:08.310
 the Le Havre plane is hiding hours 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:16.500
 well hidden after a cache and say there 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:22.850
 then there is the here to camp 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.850
 here to camp goes next 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:30.330
 then the and that's all for here here 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.200
 that's all I want to show others 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.330
 andro you put gore and this time 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.540
 that's where we run 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.479
 and here you are interested here and you 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:48.570
 are here after camping here 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:51.840
 then the next to resa 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.660
 we even pop and then now I 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.110
 will show you how to get out of the 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.380
 map 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.910
 then mounted on two trucks 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.979
 take a small pistol arm then 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:08.340
 gloves you stuff to act missed i was 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.740
 almost in this video it's really 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.540
 good because we can kill the enemies 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.910
 but they can kill you too in 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.080
 case here I am going but it does not prevent 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.700
 not that you're still out of there 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.260
 even that's even if you kill the advances 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.160
 a little bit and garonne is out 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:27.300
 of the hammock so the press because the 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.800
 wheel allies there was proof that we are 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.690
 got damask out because when we go out of 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.269
 the map we go through everything and street 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.610
 but we can not go because 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.780
 here we can not advance these blocks and 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:44.040
 mulching and so the law here we can not 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.260
 to have no but that was all for this 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.230
 video after we can not stand out 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.900
 here I go again one last time 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.310
 to show that it works all the time 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.910
 after I will show you how to get out 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.739
 of the Afghan mab and karachi 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.860
 but karachi will not be right now 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.110
 because I lack levels created 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.080
 really is actually for a good climb going 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.680
 look at each other for the dangers 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.680
 I want to do that 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.470
 if we ran again but it's not going 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.900
 go and there if you do that it was 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.310
 alas you resort to it during you 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.310
 are finally present this is the look and 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:29.440
 lavaur run like that so look on 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.569
 start again here and there I'm out of 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:44.519
 amap and after two rounds if you do 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:47.519
 that I returned to shit on the other hand 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.519
 castres 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.300
 by cons if you do that thus 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.350
 video did not last long it was for 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.530
 show you how to get out of 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:06.640
 the building which figured by cons if 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.050
 you do that it will not work that you 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.690
 do not have that you moult if you have 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.550
 other thing betting if you have not 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.530
 fed up at on for example you have for 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.780
 lighten or I do not know when else end 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:21.220
 thing it will not work because yeah 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.990
 have to run so after there are ten more 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.410
 places to get out of this map but 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.730
 seriously you guys are forced to 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.420
 understood us also we could not 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.700
 get out of the harbor 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.700
 so here I am out amap that's it 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:40.930
 so that's what 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.170
 thank you for watching this video so 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.080
 I tell you more so we know we have 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:50.680
 looked at you and show how to get out 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:54.780
 of the map ends then I say to the 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.780
