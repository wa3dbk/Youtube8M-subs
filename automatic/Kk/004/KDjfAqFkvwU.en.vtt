00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
too warm during the grinding process and

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.470 
too warm during the grinding process and
then<00:02:43.709> they<00:02:43.859> fat<00:02:44.219> out<00:02:44.459> we're<00:02:44.819> greased<00:02:45.180> out

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
then they fat out we're greased out

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
and then that will loosen up the bind on

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.319 
and then that will loosen up the bind on
it<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.769> now<00:02:50.040> once<00:02:50.340> again<00:02:50.519> you<00:02:50.730> won't<00:02:51.030> have<00:02:51.299> a
