 do choose percent lines 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.470
 turn 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.400
 there in principle be to this m 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.320

 I 4 can be considered to do 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.450
 a frame here around this product from 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.350
 dough need with him naturally need 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.290
 take 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.680
 retinue 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.960
 process both products to make it 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.140
 it was beautiful so we make children 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.380
 way to choose 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.380
 correct color with shade 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.510
 click on the box with the words 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.600
 funds 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.060
 Russia post use in work 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.950
 so the police stopped the moment 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.600
 tight circle 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.390
 but let's say I want to do something 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.690
 I don't know that 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.750
 Well type ruza small such something year 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.180
 Christina least I choose this 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.250
 plan 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.470
 light click anywhere picture 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.210
 minnow computer will he identified with 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.520
 Russian tradition if I need a little bit 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.760
 easier 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.520
 and according to him at least a little bit well-established 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.080
 screams a day 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.080
 here ethnos and palette jammal vinegar 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.220
 but all this is all doing it wrong here 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.310
 can 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.340
 you can not touch anything and everything is decided 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:13.649
 Kokoy installed as we need 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:15.469
 percentage standard 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:16.389
 and quite 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:18.429
 people and if it turns us right away 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:20.989
 russia and out frames in order 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.359
 to frame plan is simple and primitive 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.059
 let's say 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:26.429
 Yes, I did it 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:29.519
 promote is not quite interesting when teddy 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.529
 one monotone color and 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:34.009
 never nato 

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:36.099
 P 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.610
 simply 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.910
 it will be cloudy so many more 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.010
 cream color so try 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.999
 make another point 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:46.119
 one more point we do this way 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:48.349
 a minute that along with that field criteria 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.749
 mashkova played leading level 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:51.629
 and now 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.189
 on the same criticism sponsor cross 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:56.819
 limit we take very close 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.459
 commission in 204 consider myself admissible to 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.459
 cross such a point 

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:06.069
 somewhere 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.649
 so the track and it turns out that I 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.489
 in the future they went many catheter glasses 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.580
 now 4 5 5 5 thousand starting point 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.870
 don't rock a little i'm worried 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.639
 rows 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.339
 stroke 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:22.239
 and now eating we rush pixels a 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.459
 made let's say it is there 25 pixels of attempt 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.349
 what prepared 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.749
 again pressing the button kaur 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:32.879
 and the first about what would be such a 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.309
 a little book and 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:36.489
 Colour 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.529
 main growth 4 4 to 1 May in birds 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.119
 here is an honor 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:45.079
 everything turns thick fleet 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.349
 sections as follows 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.539
 strictly 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:52.909
 here he just take the same color 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.909
 only we choose it a little bit lighter 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.119
 our little rusi 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:02.119
 and we have the top field covered 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:06.749
 poor color 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.129
 further he 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.939
 I think it's okay 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:14.729
 process if something was not pleasant to you 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:16.949
 don't do it like that 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.900
 living out of food 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.169
 you have canceled the previous step in 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.360
 the rating is most clearly five more 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.229
 pounds per share 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.849
 so we have canceled the garden as not 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.909
 excluded supervised not undermined 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:34.759
 but the matter is on the 5 right click of the lines here's how 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:37.759
 we do 25 we do 15 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.680
 or is it the same time general secretary also mom 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.669
 brush 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.069
 here this habit more gently turned out 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:46.300
 acids, I suggest you 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.340
 play around with these features here 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.659
 achieve a lot even if you 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:55.129
 will not incur now Photoshop but 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:58.129
 using this kind 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.360
 lessons you can learn at least yourself 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.020
 basic things 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.469
 nothing better invited 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:06.589
 percent 

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:07.569
 in September 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:10.569
 in increase kris kristi 3 cents than 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:14.039
 basically know 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:15.939
 but there is a candidate 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:18.379
 bricks that know you need 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:21.779
 will be if you have any suggestion 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:24.159
 comments if you have this request i 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:26.539
 I can take off my hands 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:29.029
 and this figure is how to do 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:31.900
 0 this or that thing that interests you 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.690
 in particular, for attention gets in 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.099
 bagged talker 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.080
 I hope that you really liked him yellow 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.389
 fluffy 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:39.430
 the process has stopped
