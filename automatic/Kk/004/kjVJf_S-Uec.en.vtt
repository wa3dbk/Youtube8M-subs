00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.899 
made a lot new law not finished yet our
side<00:01:10.450> structure<00:01:11.050> is<00:01:11.170> finished<00:01:11.530> but<00:01:12.159> I<00:01:12.400> think

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
side structure is finished but I think

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.749

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
they need to do some interior works so

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.310
