type<00:02:00.070> attacks<00:02:00.460> so<00:02:01.149> that<00:02:01.450> just<00:02:01.660> gives<00:02:01.990> them

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
type attacks so that just gives them

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.050 
type attacks so that just gives them
more<00:02:02.590> of<00:02:02.680> an<00:02:02.770> opportunity<00:02:03.040> to<00:02:03.490> take<00:02:03.729> out<00:02:03.910> the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
more of an opportunity to take out the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.330 
more of an opportunity to take out the
grass<00:02:04.300> types

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
grass types

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.559 
grass types

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
and that is it for Erica so I see that

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.949 
and that is it for Erica so I see that
was<00:02:10.750> an<00:02:11.050> extremely<00:02:11.650> quick<00:02:12.069> battle<00:02:12.580> so<00:02:12.910> if<00:02:13.810> you

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
was an extremely quick battle so if you
