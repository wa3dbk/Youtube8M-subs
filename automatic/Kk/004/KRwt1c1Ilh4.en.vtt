00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
screens you can see we can equalize on

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.540 
screens you can see we can equalize on
the<00:02:51.080> bottom<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.560> think<00:02:51.830> as<00:02:51.950> well<00:02:52.160> as<00:02:52.310> whenever

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
the bottom I think as well as whenever

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.940 
the bottom I think as well as whenever
we<00:02:52.700> do<00:02:52.850> this<00:02:53.060> shaking<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.740> controller<00:02:54.740> will

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
we do this shaking the controller will

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.780 
we do this shaking the controller will
also<00:02:55.280> show<00:02:55.490> that<00:02:55.520> equaliser<00:02:57.550> that's<00:02:58.550> just<00:02:58.730> a

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
also show that equaliser that's just a

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.160 
also show that equaliser that's just a
way<00:02:58.910> of<00:02:59.060> letting<00:02:59.180> people<00:02:59.390> know<00:02:59.540> man<00:02:59.840> you're

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
way of letting people know man you're

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
way of letting people know man you're
doing<00:03:00.380> a<00:03:00.440> good<00:03:00.530> job<00:03:00.590> I<00:03:00.740> like<00:03:00.950> what<00:03:01.070> you're

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.870 

so<00:03:06.620> I'm<00:03:06.890> gonna<00:03:07.040> turn<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.280> music<00:03:07.370> up<00:03:07.610> here<00:03:07.790> so

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
so I'm gonna turn the music up here so

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.190 
so I'm gonna turn the music up here so
you<00:03:07.940> can<00:03:07.970> listen<00:03:08.210> this<00:03:08.390> for<00:03:08.540> a<00:03:08.600> little<00:03:08.780> bit<00:03:08.900> and

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
you can listen this for a little bit and

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:43.670 
you can listen this for a little bit and
then

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.020 

so<00:03:44.680> he<00:03:44.769> might<00:03:44.950> not<00:03:45.040> be<00:03:45.189> the<00:03:45.310> best<00:03:45.430> example<00:03:45.670> of

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
so he might not be the best example of

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.750 
so he might not be the best example of
somebody<00:03:46.359> like<00:03:47.040> don't<00:03:48.040> know<00:03:48.189> crazy<00:03:48.459> or

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
somebody like don't know crazy or

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.800 
somebody like don't know crazy or
anything<00:03:48.939> but<00:03:49.180> you<00:03:49.269> can<00:03:49.389> see<00:03:49.599> what<00:03:49.719> you're

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
anything but you can see what you're

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.059 
anything but you can see what you're
kind<00:03:50.019> of<00:03:50.079> doing<00:03:50.319> he's<00:03:50.499> whenever<00:03:50.920> you<00:03:50.980> hear

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
kind of doing he's whenever you hear

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.500 
kind of doing he's whenever you hear
like<00:03:51.280> that<00:03:51.459> one<00:03:51.670> shot<00:03:51.909> noise<00:03:52.120> it's<00:03:52.359> him

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
like that one shot noise it's him

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.319 
like that one shot noise it's him
actually<00:03:53.400> using<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.489> move<00:03:54.700> in<00:03:54.999> a<00:03:55.030> direction

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
actually using the move in a direction

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.099 
actually using the move in a direction
so<00:03:56.639> you<00:03:57.639> can<00:03:57.790> follow<00:03:57.969> a<00:03:58.120> person<00:03:58.540> even<00:03:58.750> in<00:03:58.989> the

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
so you can follow a person even in the

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:04.289 
so you can follow a person even in the
demo<00:03:59.409> and<00:04:02.280> you<00:04:03.280> can<00:04:03.400> use<00:04:03.549> everything<00:04:03.879> except

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
demo and you can use everything except

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.449 
demo and you can use everything except
for<00:04:04.389> the<00:04:04.829> visualizers<00:04:05.829> to<00:04:06.040> listen<00:04:06.280> to<00:04:06.340> your

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
for the visualizers to listen to your

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.449 
for the visualizers to listen to your
own<00:04:06.549> music<00:04:06.639> and<00:04:07.359> the<00:04:08.139> ability<00:04:08.439> to<00:04:08.469> perform<00:04:08.650> but

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
own music and the ability to perform but

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:10.770 
own music and the ability to perform but
you<00:04:09.519> can<00:04:09.669> tune<00:04:09.849> in<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.060> anybody<00:04:10.419> playing<00:04:10.599> the

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
you can tune in to anybody playing the

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.140 
you can tune in to anybody playing the
game<00:04:10.900> using<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.319> demo<00:04:11.909> so<00:04:12.909> I<00:04:12.969> hope<00:04:13.120> that

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
game using the demo so I hope that

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.759 
game using the demo so I hope that
alleviates<00:04:13.840> a<00:04:13.870> little<00:04:14.019> bit<00:04:14.109> of<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.260> confusion

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
alleviates a little bit of the confusion

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.759 
alleviates a little bit of the confusion
that's<00:04:14.859> going<00:04:15.159> on<00:04:15.250> right<00:04:15.459> now<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.870> they're

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
that's going on right now and they're

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.409
