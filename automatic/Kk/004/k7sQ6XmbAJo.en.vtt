00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.360
Somewhere above the Mediterranee....

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.600
Do you want our Italian special?

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.280
No, thank you, I get itches from that.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.040
The vegetable's food perhaps?

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.920
No, I'll get acid from that.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.480
I recommend the warmly dish from us. It's really tasty.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.920
Because you're so insisting.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.400
"Bon appetit!"

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.360
Oh, good you're here, agent Fox.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.880
Ah, Monkey Penny. Just like at home in front of the tv.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.960
Right. Yesterday our agents discovered the industries and offices of the cowoperative 'dairy for milkother'. 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.800
There was no chick and no drop of milk to confess.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.560
Soon the whole milk supply has gone, completely gone!

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.400
Dry cornflakes. The idea itself is not to digest.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.480
Yes, that's right. This is our only cow.. uh... clue...

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.720
Feta cheese. And the most bad one.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.960
Researchers took the photo from the office of 'Vincent V. Vaarskalf van Hoorn III'.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.040
President of the cow-operative 'Dairy for milkother'.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:35.480
Yes. We think he could tell us more about the dairy crisis. The only photo we have of him, is located in your meshed potatos.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.840
Your most important task is to find mr. Van Hoorn.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.960
That one should soon be found.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.120
The samples we took from the office of Van Hoorn, seem to come from the Greek island Ascidophilos.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:57.480
The airplane is flying over the island really soon. The Mobile Command Center is available at the island and you'll meet me and prof. Quack there.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.480
The entrance code is in the cookie. Any questions?

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.160
No, I'm on my way.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.280
Fine. Close message.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.840
SPY Fox in 'Dry Cereal!' - DEMO - Subtitles by HumongousWalkthrough

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.800
Oops. My parachute is in my other jacket. Maybe I've got something on my gadgets.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.400
Which pen shall I choose?

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.920
I don't need some pling-pling now.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.120
Ever wanted to try this.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.320
Hmm..., so this is the sleepy Greek island Ascidophilos.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.760
I think I'm pretty early, nothing's open yet.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.880
So I've got an appointment with Monkey Penny at the Mobile Command Center.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:27.040
Five-five-five-six-two-two-zero. I'm glad Monkey Penny gave me this code.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.760
Hello, this is the Mobile Command Center from SPY Corps.
-Hey, Penny! I've got your number!

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.160
This is a really personal conversation.
-Spy Fox! Thanks for your invade.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:01.800
Uh, hello Penny!
-It is Monkey Penny. And what do you think of the Mobile Command Center?

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:11.200
You've done a good job. Hiding the center in a buried ship was a great idea. Nobody would see it ever!

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.360
It was one of the ideas from Professor Quack.
-Where is Quack?

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.800
Oh, he comes later. Then he'll fill the gadget machine. But he just left some things I had to give to you.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.960
Fine, because an agent without gadgets is as a book without donkey ears.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:34.160
Very appropriate. Watch, please. This is Greek money. They are drachmes. Maybe you'll have to buy things on the island.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.800
And this is a...
-A tooth brush. It'll work after the airplane food.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:53.480
No, don't put in your mouth. It's a laser tooth brush. I'll let you see how it works.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:01.840
You get the laser tooth brush. Use some laser tooth paste and you'll burn through the thickest metal.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:09.920
Hmm, I thought brushing was AGAINST holes. Do we have any idea where mr. Van Hoorn is?

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.600
We don't have real proves, but perhaps you could take a look at the feta industry on this island.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:23.680
Oh, the feta industry... I already thought I smelled something dirty.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:58.880
Wow.. ususally I'll just make a karate move to get through metal doors, but I can't use that here.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.240
With the laser tooth brush I'll get through impenetrable metal.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:46.560
That's what you call a big chunk. No doubt about it, that must be mr. Van Hoorn. And he's hanging above a piranha boiler. How will I get him away from there?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:58.360
Hmm, you can change the temperature of the piranha boiler from here. Strange device for a feta industry.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.200
That was the button for making the boiler colder.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.720
It's working. The piranhas are swimming slower.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:19.040
Yes. Frozen fish. They won't get out of there. And now mr. Van Hoorn.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.800
Will Spy Fox save mr. Van Hoorn?

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.000
What's down earlier? 400 kilos of feathers or 400 kilos of beef?

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:45.600
Will mr. Van Hoorn get through the ice? Will the piranhas eat mr. Van Hoorn in a few seconds? Why would I tell this?

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:54.360
Reveal all the answers and more in Spy Fox: Dry Cereal!
