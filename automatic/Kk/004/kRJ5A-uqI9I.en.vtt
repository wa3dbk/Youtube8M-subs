that it up and fold it in half and just
give<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> good<00:00:48.719> crease<00:00:49.050> where<00:00:49.640> your<00:00:50.640> nail

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
give it a good crease where your nail

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.500

open that that up right now what you

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.270 
open that that up right now what you
need<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.719> do<00:00:54.960> like<00:00:55.230> an<00:00:55.410> aeroplane<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.160> it's

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
need to do like an aeroplane but it's

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.010 
need to do like an aeroplane but it's
not<00:00:56.399> an<00:00:56.550> aerial<00:00:56.850> 3<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.210> course<00:00:57.449> get<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
not an aerial 3 and of course get the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.889 
not an aerial 3 and of course get the
corner<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.770> fold<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.190> down<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.030> middle

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
corner and fold it down to that middle

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.520 
corner and fold it down to that middle
bit<00:01:01.170> there<00:01:01.730> so<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.910> should<00:01:03.149> be<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:06.530> so

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
bit there so it should be like that so

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.760 
bit there so it should be like that so
it's<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:07.950> then<00:01:08.960> get<00:01:09.960> another<00:01:10.110> corner

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
it's like that then get another corner

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.910 
it's like that then get another corner
and<00:01:11.250> fold<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.700> down<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.810> that

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.980 

once<00:01:17.790> you've<00:01:17.970> done<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.210> should<00:01:18.689> be<00:01:18.810> like

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
once you've done that should be like

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:28.429 
once you've done that should be like
that<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.950> then<00:01:20.990> fold<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.380> half<00:01:26.570> then<00:01:27.570> get

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
that so then fold it in half then get

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.149 
that so then fold it in half then get
this<00:01:28.740> crease<00:01:29.580> here<00:01:30.000> which<00:01:30.540> there<00:01:30.899> is<00:01:31.649> there

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
this crease here which there is there

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.289 
this crease here which there is there
like<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:33.259> right<00:01:34.259> there<00:01:34.320> get<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.399> push<00:01:36.060> it

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
like that right there get that push it

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.460 
like that right there get that push it
right<00:01:36.570> there<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:40.229> push

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
right there so it's like that and push

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.330 
right there so it's like that and push
it<00:01:40.649> in<00:01:41.060> like<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.509> fold<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.140> back<00:01:45.170> now

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
it in like that and fold this back now

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.450 
it in like that and fold this back now
it<00:01:47.340> should<00:01:47.610> be<00:01:47.929> like<00:01:48.929> that<00:01:49.319> make<00:01:49.830> eight<00:01:50.069> of

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
it should be like that make eight of

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.300 
it should be like that make eight of
those<00:01:51.140> right<00:01:52.140> now<00:01:52.200> I'm<00:01:52.679> going<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.069> show<00:01:53.250> you

in<00:02:49.320> fact<00:02:49.590> it's<00:02:49.860> around<00:02:50.130> get<00:02:50.940> another<00:02:51.300> one<00:02:52.700> and

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
in fact it's around get another one and

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.350 
in fact it's around get another one and
do<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.350> same<00:02:55.710> and<00:02:56.550> now<00:02:56.790> i'm<00:02:56.850> just<00:02:57.030> going<00:02:57.330> to

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
do the same and now i'm just going to

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:05.870 
do the same and now i'm just going to
speed<00:02:57.720> up<00:03:02.480> keep<00:03:03.480> on<00:03:03.660> doing<00:03:03.960> that<00:03:04.100> to<00:03:05.100> you<00:03:05.670> have

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
speed up keep on doing that to you have

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.820 
speed up keep on doing that to you have
got<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.330> your<00:03:06.480> seventh<00:03:06.870> one<00:03:07.110> because<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.650> last

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
got to your seventh one because the last

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:29.020 
got to your seventh one because the last
one<00:03:08.130> is<00:03:08.250> different<00:03:11.060> just<00:03:12.060> by<00:03:12.270> a<00:03:12.300> bit<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:12.750> the

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:52.540 

like<00:03:29.690> that

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.980 

so<00:03:53.150> now<00:03:53.360> once<00:03:54.140> you<00:03:54.440> have<00:03:54.650> got<00:03:54.860> one<00:03:55.100> left<00:03:55.990> make

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
so now once you have got one left make

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.110 
so now once you have got one left make
it<00:03:57.230> one<00:03:57.560> must<00:03:57.890> put<00:03:58.640> it<00:03:58.820> in<00:03:59.060> like<00:04:00.050> so<00:04:00.790> fold<00:04:01.790> these

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
it one must put it in like so fold these

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.800 
it one must put it in like so fold these
two<00:04:02.540> down<00:04:03.340> this<00:04:04.340> one's<00:04:04.610> just<00:04:04.760> a<00:04:05.150> teeny<00:04:05.450> weeny

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
two down this one's just a teeny weeny

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.330 
two down this one's just a teeny weeny
bit<00:04:06.500> different<00:04:07.160> like<00:04:08.060> that<00:04:09.010> so<00:04:10.010> when<00:04:10.160> it's

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
bit different like that so when it's

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.240 
bit different like that so when it's
like<00:04:10.520> that<00:04:10.760> get<00:04:11.450> this<00:04:11.660> fold<00:04:12.290> it<00:04:12.530> back<00:04:12.740> then<00:04:13.070> put

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
like that get this fold it back then put

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.590 
like that get this fold it back then put
that<00:04:13.280> in<00:04:13.520> like<00:04:13.850> that<00:04:14.120> so<00:04:15.050> then<00:04:15.860> get<00:04:16.310> that<00:04:16.600> and

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
that in like that so then get that and

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.150 
that in like that so then get that and
fold<00:04:17.980> youssef<00:04:18.980> like<00:04:19.190> that<00:04:20.290> these<00:04:21.290> are<00:04:21.650> hanging

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
fold youssef like that these are hanging

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.260 
fold youssef like that these are hanging
out<00:04:22.370> so<00:04:23.020> open<00:04:24.020> that<00:04:24.050> flat<00:04:24.470> bit<00:04:24.710> just<00:04:24.890> a<00:04:25.040> bit<00:04:25.270> the

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
out so open that flat bit just a bit the

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.740 
out so open that flat bit just a bit the
pocket<00:04:26.690> and<00:04:27.200> fold<00:04:27.470> it<00:04:27.680> inside<00:04:27.920> and<00:04:28.570> do<00:04:29.570> the

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
pocket and fold it inside and do the
