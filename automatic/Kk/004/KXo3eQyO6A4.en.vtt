feels really good so so what can you
agree<00:00:27.740> with<00:00:27.920> this<00:00:28.010> will<00:00:28.189> be<00:00:28.279> really<00:00:28.490> brief

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
agree with this will be really brief

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.870 
agree with this will be really brief
here<00:00:29.090> so<00:00:29.449> if<00:00:30.109> step<00:00:30.500> one<00:00:30.769> is<00:00:30.980> sift<00:00:31.699> through

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
here so if step one is sift through

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.340 
here so if step one is sift through
contrast<00:00:32.420> know<00:00:32.720> what<00:00:32.870> I<00:00:32.900> don't<00:00:33.110> want<00:00:33.230> to<00:00:33.290> know

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
contrast know what I don't want to know

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.100 
contrast know what I don't want to know
what<00:00:33.470> I<00:00:33.500> do<00:00:33.590> want<00:00:33.950> and<00:00:34.160> step<00:00:34.970> two<00:00:35.180> is<00:00:35.420> source

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
what I do want and step two is source

in<00:00:38.240> the<00:00:38.360> strong<00:00:38.630> vibration<00:00:39.290> that<00:00:39.680> I<00:00:39.740> could

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
in the strong vibration that I could

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.650 
in the strong vibration that I could
find<00:00:40.280> if<00:00:40.520> I<00:00:40.610> would<00:00:40.760> get<00:00:40.910> in<00:00:41.060> the<00:00:41.090> vicinity<00:00:41.420> of

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
find if I would get in the vicinity of

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.320 
find if I would get in the vicinity of
it<00:00:41.930> and<00:00:42.140> step<00:00:42.920> three<00:00:43.190> is<00:00:43.220> I<00:00:43.610> found<00:00:44.000> a<00:00:44.150> way<00:00:44.180> to

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
it and step three is I found a way to

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.810 
it and step three is I found a way to
get<00:00:44.540> in<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:44.780> vicinity<00:00:45.050> of<00:00:45.290> it<00:00:45.530> so<00:00:45.800> what<00:00:46.520> I<00:00:46.550> ask

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
get in the vicinity of it so what I ask

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.020 
get in the vicinity of it so what I ask
for<00:00:47.210> is<00:00:47.420> now<00:00:47.930> flowing<00:00:48.740> into<00:00:48.980> my<00:00:49.160> experience<00:00:49.760> so

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
for is now flowing into my experience so

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.290 
for is now flowing into my experience so
I'm<00:00:50.210> living<00:00:50.810> in<00:00:51.230> a<00:00:51.370> resonance<00:00:52.370> of<00:00:52.670> well-being

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
I'm living in a resonance of well-being

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.760 
I'm living in a resonance of well-being
so<00:00:54.260> I'm<00:00:54.610> chronically<00:00:55.810> happy<00:00:56.810> I'm<00:00:57.020> chronically

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
so I'm chronically happy I'm chronically

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.410 
so I'm chronically happy I'm chronically
eager<00:00:58.580> I'm<00:00:59.060> chronically<00:00:59.860> appreciative<00:01:00.860> I'm

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
eager I'm chronically appreciative I'm

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.509 
eager I'm chronically appreciative I'm
chronically<00:01:02.420> frisky<00:01:03.140> I<00:01:03.320> just<00:01:03.590> feel<00:01:03.860> really

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
chronically frisky I just feel really

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.180 
chronically frisky I just feel really
good<00:01:04.820> but<00:01:05.300> i<00:01:05.330> have<00:01:05.690> not<00:01:05.960> withdrawn<00:01:06.650> from<00:01:06.890> life

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
good but i have not withdrawn from life

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.510 
good but i have not withdrawn from life
so<00:01:07.910> i'm<00:01:08.030> out<00:01:08.180> in<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:08.960> real<00:01:09.170> world<00:01:09.520> feeling

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
so i'm out in the real world feeling

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.970 
so i'm out in the real world feeling
like<00:01:10.730> that<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.480> now<00:01:14.020> contrast<00:01:15.020> is<00:01:15.650> still

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
like that and now contrast is still

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.550 
like that and now contrast is still
surrounding<00:01:16.640> me<00:01:16.850> but<00:01:17.450> i'm<00:01:17.660> approaching<00:01:18.140> it

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
surrounding me but i'm approaching it

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.310 
surrounding me but i'm approaching it
from<00:01:18.590> an<00:01:18.920> alliance<00:01:19.280> state<00:01:19.760> of<00:01:20.030> point<00:01:20.990> of<00:01:21.140> view

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
from an alliance state of point of view

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.260 
from an alliance state of point of view
so<00:01:21.740> contrast<00:01:22.670> doesn't<00:01:23.150> sting<00:01:23.540> it<00:01:23.980> interests<00:01:24.980> a

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
so contrast doesn't sting it interests a

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.060 
so contrast doesn't sting it interests a
problem<00:01:26.270> doesn't<00:01:26.480> feel<00:01:26.750> like<00:01:26.930> a<00:01:27.080> problem<00:01:27.920> that

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
problem doesn't feel like a problem that

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.950 
problem doesn't feel like a problem that
defeats<00:01:28.400> me<00:01:28.610> it<00:01:28.700> feels<00:01:28.850> like<00:01:29.000> an<00:01:29.180> opportunity

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
defeats me it feels like an opportunity

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.980 
defeats me it feels like an opportunity
for<00:01:30.100> expansion<00:01:31.100> yes<00:01:31.490> that's<00:01:32.210> what<00:01:32.480> step<00:01:32.720> four

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
for expansion yes that's what step four

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.190 
for expansion yes that's what step four
is<00:01:33.020> it's<00:01:33.530> it's<00:01:34.360> consistently<00:01:35.360> feeling<00:01:35.960> good

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
is it's it's consistently feeling good

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:45.820 
is it's it's consistently feeling good
but<00:01:36.830> still<00:01:37.190> exploring<00:01:38.080> contrast<00:01:44.440> and<00:01:45.440> then<00:01:45.650> as

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
but still exploring contrast and then as

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.710 
but still exploring contrast and then as
our<00:01:45.950> friend<00:01:46.100> said<00:01:46.400> earlier<00:01:46.760> having<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.540> whole

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
our friend said earlier having a whole

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.380 
our friend said earlier having a whole
different<00:01:48.020> take<00:01:48.229> on<00:01:48.409> the<00:01:48.530> contrast<00:01:49.070> a<00:01:49.430> whole

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
different take on the contrast a whole

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.170 
different take on the contrast a whole
different<00:01:50.870> response<00:01:51.409> to<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:51.800> contrast<00:01:52.340> so

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
different response to the contrast so

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.630 
different response to the contrast so
instead<00:01:53.390> of<00:01:53.479> problem<00:01:53.960> it<00:01:54.080> feels<00:01:54.260> like<00:01:54.640> options

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
instead of problem it feels like options

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.330 
instead of problem it feels like options
or<00:01:55.850> it<00:01:55.940> feels<00:01:56.150> like<00:01:56.530> opportunity<00:01:57.530> instead<00:01:58.040> of

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
or it feels like opportunity instead of

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.250 
or it feels like opportunity instead of
an<00:01:58.430> unanswered<00:01:59.210> question<00:01:59.210> it<00:01:59.780> feels<00:01:59.990> like

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
an unanswered question it feels like

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.830 
an unanswered question it feels like
something<00:02:01.010> interesting<00:02:01.850> to<00:02:02.299> focus<00:02:02.720> upon

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
something interesting to focus upon

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.350 
something interesting to focus upon
until<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.680> momentum<00:02:04.190> carries<00:02:04.670> me<00:02:04.850> into<00:02:05.150> a<00:02:05.180> new

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
until the momentum carries me into a new

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.740 
until the momentum carries me into a new
place<00:02:05.600> yes<00:02:06.260> yes<00:02:06.560> yes<00:02:07.899> yes

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
season but she didn't discover it until

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.470 
season but she didn't discover it until
the<00:02:29.810> competition<00:02:30.810> was<00:02:31.440> really<00:02:32.480> exaggerated

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
the competition was really exaggerated

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.290 
the competition was really exaggerated

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
just just tiptoeing into the idea of it

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.460 
just just tiptoeing into the idea of it
and<00:02:48.709> they<00:02:49.709> got<00:02:50.550> really<00:02:51.300> good<00:02:51.480> premium<00:02:51.870> seats

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
importance sort of like the risk sort of

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.790 
importance sort of like the risk sort of
like<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:05.130> tension<00:03:05.550> of<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.090> game<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.800> she

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800

like the tension of the game and she
wanted<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.280> like<00:03:08.520> it<00:03:08.790> but<00:03:08.970> it<00:03:09.239> was<00:03:09.690> tense<00:03:10.140> and

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
wanted to like it but it was tense and

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.780 
wanted to like it but it was tense and
the<00:03:12.420> games<00:03:12.690> were<00:03:13.050> close<00:03:13.320> and<00:03:13.470> when<00:03:14.070> they<00:03:14.280> won

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
the games were close and when they won

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.199 
the games were close and when they won
the<00:03:15.180> crowd<00:03:15.720> was<00:03:16.140> happy<00:03:16.769> but<00:03:16.950> when<00:03:17.220> they<00:03:17.459> didn't

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
the crowd was happy but when they didn't

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.410 
and when they were losing the crowd was
less<00:03:25.650> happy<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.280> Esther<00:03:26.910> was<00:03:27.060> sort<00:03:27.330> of

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
less happy and Esther was sort of

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.240 
less happy and Esther was sort of
interested<00:03:28.320> in<00:03:28.470> feeling<00:03:29.040> this<00:03:29.340> very<00:03:30.299> pointed

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
interested in feeling this very pointed

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.530 
interested in feeling this very pointed
energy<00:03:32.450> around<00:03:33.769> this<00:03:34.769> sport<00:03:35.540> she's

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
energy around this sport she's

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.600 
energy around this sport she's
interested<00:03:37.110> in<00:03:37.200> everything<00:03:37.530> about<00:03:38.310> life

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
interested in everything about life

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.600 
interested in everything about life
these<00:03:39.150> days<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:40.170> vibrational<00:03:40.829> dynamics<00:03:41.400> of

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
these days the vibrational dynamics of

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.199 
these days the vibrational dynamics of
them<00:03:42.000> so<00:03:42.900> now<00:03:43.110> that<00:03:43.860> came<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.700> went<00:03:44.820> and<00:03:45.090> the

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
them so now that came and went and the

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.300 
them so now that came and went and the
Spurs<00:03:45.510> did<00:03:45.900> really<00:03:46.200> well<00:03:46.320> they<00:03:46.709> won<00:03:47.040> the

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
Spurs did really well they won the

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.880 
Spurs did really well they won the
Western<00:03:48.269> championship<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.200> then<00:03:49.410> did<00:03:49.680> not

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
Western championship and then did not

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.870 
Western championship and then did not
win<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.700> final<00:03:51.209> and<00:03:52.310> so<00:03:53.310> now<00:03:53.459> it's<00:03:53.640> the

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
win the final and so now it's the

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.729 
win the final and so now it's the
beginning<00:03:54.269> of<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.720> new<00:03:54.870> season<00:03:55.170> but<00:03:55.560> it<00:03:55.650> was

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
beginning of the new season but it was

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.390 
beginning of the new season but it was
the<00:03:55.890> preliminary<00:03:56.549> game<00:03:56.850> this<00:03:57.299> is<00:03:57.510> very

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
the preliminary game this is very

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.009 
the preliminary game this is very
high-minded<00:03:59.400> metaphysical<00:04:00.269> conversation<00:04:00.870> so

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
high-minded metaphysical conversation so

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.850 
high-minded metaphysical conversation so
this

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
this

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.589 
this
and<00:04:03.860> so<00:04:04.370> this<00:04:04.580> was<00:04:04.790> what<00:04:05.090> they<00:04:05.209> were<00:04:05.269> calling

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
and so this was what they were calling

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.050 
and so this was what they were calling
the<00:04:05.959> scrimmage<00:04:06.530> game<00:04:06.829> a<00:04:06.860> game<00:04:07.220> that<00:04:07.280> didn't

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
the scrimmage game a game that didn't

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.640 
the scrimmage game a game that didn't
count<00:04:08.269> toward<00:04:08.689> anything<00:04:09.230> but<00:04:09.409> it<00:04:09.470> was<00:04:09.560> the

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
count toward anything but it was the

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.190 
count toward anything but it was the
first<00:04:09.860> game<00:04:10.069> of<00:04:10.189> the<00:04:10.280> season<00:04:10.489> and<00:04:10.819> so<00:04:11.510> Esther

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
first game of the season and so Esther

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.560 
first game of the season and so Esther
and<00:04:12.349> her<00:04:12.620> delightful<00:04:13.280> family<00:04:13.819> went<00:04:14.209> and

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
and her delightful family went and

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.270 
and her delightful family went and
Esther<00:04:17.570> noticed<00:04:18.019> that<00:04:18.380> they<00:04:18.650> and<00:04:18.859> they<00:04:19.010> played

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
Esther noticed that they and they played

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.350 
Esther noticed that they and they played
a<00:04:19.489> Russian<00:04:20.060> team<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:23.240> Russian<00:04:23.630> team<00:04:23.810> was

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
a Russian team and the Russian team was

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.980 
a Russian team and the Russian team was
good<00:04:26.360> but<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.710> main<00:04:28.550> string<00:04:29.360> as<00:04:29.600> they<00:04:29.720> called

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
good but the main string as they called

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.770 
good but the main string as they called
it<00:04:30.110> was<00:04:30.289> not<00:04:30.470> playing<00:04:30.850> for<00:04:31.850> San<00:04:32.120> Antonio<00:04:32.600> and

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
it was not playing for San Antonio and

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.620 
it was not playing for San Antonio and
so<00:04:33.229> the<00:04:33.919> it<00:04:34.400> was<00:04:34.610> neck<00:04:34.820> and<00:04:34.850> neck<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.360> neck<00:04:35.479> and

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
so the it was neck and neck and neck and

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.330 
so the it was neck and neck and neck and
neck<00:04:35.750> and<00:04:35.900> neck<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:36.229> neck<00:04:36.320> but<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:37.310> thing

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
neck and neck and neck but the thing

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.100 
neck and neck and neck but the thing
that<00:04:37.580> Esther<00:04:38.000> noticed<00:04:38.360> most<00:04:38.510> about<00:04:38.810> it<00:04:38.990> was

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
that Esther noticed most about it was

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.700 
that Esther noticed most about it was
because<00:04:40.070> it<00:04:40.400> didn't<00:04:40.880> really<00:04:41.180> matter<00:04:41.710> because

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
because it didn't really matter because

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.820 
because it didn't really matter because
there<00:04:43.280> was<00:04:43.430> really<00:04:43.699> no<00:04:44.330> risk<00:04:44.900> because<00:04:45.620> there

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
there was really no risk because there

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.360 
there was really no risk because there
was<00:04:45.949> no<00:04:46.160> placement<00:04:46.970> that<00:04:47.570> was<00:04:47.870> being<00:04:48.590> decided

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
was no placement that was being decided

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.670 
was no placement that was being decided
as<00:04:49.490> a<00:04:49.520> result<00:04:49.940> of<00:04:50.090> it<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.630> audience<00:04:51.139> felt

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
as a result of it the audience felt

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.420 
as a result of it the audience felt
different<00:04:52.520> to<00:04:52.550> her<00:04:52.960> so<00:04:53.960> Esther<00:04:54.860> totally

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
different to her so Esther totally

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.820 
different to her so Esther totally
enjoyed<00:04:56.000> this<00:04:56.419> experience<00:04:56.630> even<00:04:57.440> though<00:04:57.770> it

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
enjoyed this experience even though it

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.890 
enjoyed this experience even though it
was<00:04:57.919> a<00:04:57.949> very<00:04:58.340> close<00:04:58.639> game<00:04:58.699> it<00:04:59.570> went<00:04:59.750> into

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
was a very close game it went into

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.170 
was a very close game it went into
overtime<00:05:00.020> it<00:05:00.770> was<00:05:00.979> amazing<00:05:01.699> people<00:05:02.030> were<00:05:02.120> on

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
overtime it was amazing people were on

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.480 
overtime it was amazing people were on
their<00:05:02.539> feet<00:05:02.570> but<00:05:03.020> there<00:05:03.470> were<00:05:03.560> the<00:05:03.740> angst<00:05:04.250> was

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
their feet but there were the angst was

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.779 
their feet but there were the angst was
not<00:05:04.760> there<00:05:05.060> and<00:05:05.389> so<00:05:06.289> Esther<00:05:06.740> came<00:05:06.979> away<00:05:07.250> from

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
not there and so Esther came away from

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.050 
not there and so Esther came away from
that<00:05:07.940> experience<00:05:08.930> already<00:05:09.440> to<00:05:10.280> explain<00:05:10.820> to

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
that experience already to explain to

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.550 
that experience already to explain to
anyone<00:05:11.300> who<00:05:11.570> would<00:05:11.750> listen<00:05:11.960> there<00:05:12.380> weren't

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
anyone who would listen there weren't

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.439 
anyone who would listen there weren't
that<00:05:12.620> many

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
that many

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.209 
that many
you<00:05:15.139> are<00:05:15.259> a<00:05:15.319> captive<00:05:15.590> audience<00:05:15.889> here<00:05:17.529> that<00:05:18.529> she

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:19.219 
you are a captive audience here that she

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.760 
you are a captive audience here that she
had<00:05:19.309> discovered<00:05:19.639> that<00:05:20.240> when<00:05:21.229> the<00:05:21.469> stakes

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
had discovered that when the stakes

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.529 
had discovered that when the stakes
don't<00:05:22.129> matter<00:05:22.400> when<00:05:22.669> it<00:05:22.699> just<00:05:22.969> doesn't<00:05:23.360> matter

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539 
don't matter when it just doesn't matter

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.989 
don't matter when it just doesn't matter
it<00:05:23.749> just<00:05:23.779> feels<00:05:24.289> better<00:05:24.759> that<00:05:25.759> was<00:05:25.879> the

00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:25.999 
it just feels better that was the

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:27.879 
it just feels better that was the
conclusion<00:05:26.120> she<00:05:26.870> came<00:05:27.050> to<00:05:27.259> and<00:05:27.379> we<00:05:27.469> said<00:05:27.710> as

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
conclusion she came to and we said as

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.999 
conclusion she came to and we said as
she<00:05:27.949> was<00:05:28.849> chewing<00:05:29.210> over<00:05:29.449> it<00:05:29.659> with<00:05:29.839> off<00:05:30.020> now

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.009 
she was chewing over it with off now

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.709 
she was chewing over it with off now

she<00:05:46.969> was<00:05:47.089> just<00:05:47.120> certain<00:05:47.779> that<00:05:47.930> all<00:05:48.169> these

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:48.529 
she was just certain that all these

she was just certain that all these
other<00:05:48.770> dynamics<00:05:49.370> were<00:05:49.550> the<00:05:49.669> reason<00:05:50.089> had

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:01.339 
than she's ever been before we are

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:03.959 
than she's ever been before we are
explaining<00:06:01.639> to<00:06:01.879> a<00:06:01.909> pilot<00:06:02.360> the<00:06:02.509> other<00:06:02.629> day<00:06:02.870> an

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:03.969 
explaining to a pilot the other day an

explaining to a pilot the other day an
analogy<00:06:04.969> that<00:06:04.999> was<00:06:05.419> very<00:06:05.629> understandable<00:06:06.529> to

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:06.649 
analogy that was very understandable to

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:09.730 
analogy that was very understandable to
him<00:06:06.889> that<00:06:07.279> as<00:06:07.729> he's<00:06:07.969> flying<00:06:08.300> his<00:06:08.659> big<00:06:08.930> airplane

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
him that as he's flying his big airplane

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.389 
him that as he's flying his big airplane
he<00:06:10.460> can<00:06:10.669> be<00:06:10.849> at<00:06:10.999> 20,000<00:06:11.930> feet<00:06:11.960> or<00:06:12.439> 30,000<00:06:13.249> feet

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:13.399 
he can be at 20,000 feet or 30,000 feet

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:16.600 
he can be at 20,000 feet or 30,000 feet
or<00:06:13.729> maybe<00:06:14.210> even<00:06:14.349> 40,000<00:06:15.349> feet<00:06:15.499> and<00:06:15.830> it's<00:06:16.520> the

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
or maybe even 40,000 feet and it's the

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.489 
or maybe even 40,000 feet and it's the
same<00:06:16.789> aircraft<00:06:17.089> doing<00:06:17.629> essentially<00:06:18.110> the<00:06:18.319> same

00:06:18.489 --> 00:06:18.499 
same aircraft doing essentially the same

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:21.939 
same aircraft doing essentially the same
thing<00:06:18.860> just<00:06:19.129> a<00:06:19.789> different<00:06:20.149> altitude<00:06:20.779> and<00:06:21.020> so

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:21.949 
thing just a different altitude and so

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:24.399 
thing just a different altitude and so
you're<00:06:22.520> moving<00:06:22.909> around<00:06:23.139> same<00:06:24.139> person

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:24.409 
you're moving around same person

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:27.850 
you're moving around same person
thinking<00:06:25.339> thoughts<00:06:26.229> having<00:06:27.229> essentially<00:06:27.620> the

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
thinking thoughts having essentially the

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.619 
thinking thoughts having essentially the
same<00:06:28.069> experience<00:06:28.879> as<00:06:28.999> you<00:06:29.149> move<00:06:29.330> through<00:06:29.360> life

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:29.629 
same experience as you move through life

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:32.350 
same experience as you move through life
in<00:06:30.080> some<00:06:30.649> ways<00:06:30.919> but<00:06:31.669> the<00:06:31.789> vibrational

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
in some ways but the vibrational

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.600 
in some ways but the vibrational
altitude<00:06:32.990> is<00:06:33.139> making<00:06:33.529> all<00:06:33.770> of<00:06:33.800> the<00:06:34.099> difference

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
altitude is making all of the difference

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.159 
altitude is making all of the difference
in<00:06:34.729> other<00:06:34.909> words<00:06:35.120> this<00:06:35.270> you<00:06:35.659> are<00:06:35.810> the<00:06:35.930> same

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.169 
in other words this you are the same

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:38.649 
in other words this you are the same
person<00:06:36.770> but<00:06:37.430> you<00:06:37.610> can<00:06:37.819> be<00:06:37.999> at<00:06:38.149> different

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:38.659 
person but you can be at different

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:40.420 
person but you can be at different
vibrational<00:06:39.229> frequencies<00:06:39.979> and<00:06:40.189> the

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
vibrational frequencies and the

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.980 
vibrational frequencies and the
experience<00:06:41.029> that<00:06:41.120> you<00:06:41.270> have<00:06:41.629> is

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
experience that you have is

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.070 
experience that you have is
magnificently<00:06:45.370> improved<00:06:46.659> the<00:06:47.659> higher<00:06:47.839> your

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
magnificently improved the higher your

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.739 
magnificently improved the higher your
frequency<00:06:48.680> yeah<00:06:49.399> and<00:06:49.729> the<00:06:50.240> greater<00:06:50.449> momentum

00:06:50.739 --> 00:06:50.749 
frequency yeah and the greater momentum

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:56.680 
frequency yeah and the greater momentum
you<00:06:50.990> have<00:06:51.550> that's<00:06:52.550> beautiful<00:06:53.060> so<00:06:53.959> now<00:06:54.529> what
