00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.990 
separately this is not unlike cooking a
custard<00:01:40.229> we're<00:01:41.100> living<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.460> exocomps

custard we're living the exocomps
temperature<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.540> then<00:01:42.659> they're<00:01:42.810> going<00:01:42.960> to

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
temperature and then they're going to

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.230

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
going to take that away from the heat

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.520 
going to take that away from the heat
because<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.649> started<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.630> simmer<00:01:51.630> nicely<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530
