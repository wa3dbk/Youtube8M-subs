00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.010
 hello before the use of fertilizers 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.960
 chemicals and how to nourish 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.880
 plants and return nutrients from 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.250
 soil was through the use of fertilizers 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.110
 organic this type of fertilizer is 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.029
 composed of animal waste and 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.680
 plants that promote the activity of 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.169
 the soil microorganisms was 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.419
 using it are widely used in the 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.220
 agroecology since it is known that the 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:33.200
 overuse of chemical fertilizers 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.200
 ends up impoverishing the floors 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.899
 the good is formed from directions of 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.850
 seabirds bats and seals in 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.829
 low humidity environments 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.899
 its high phosphorus content and contribution of 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.329
 Calcium and magnesium favors 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.269
 rooting the plant and improving the 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.860
 quality of flowers and fruits its color is 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.170
 reddish when it comes from deposits 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.000
 prehistoric and has one more color 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.000
 yellowish when it is more recent 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.180
 is applied on the substrate and 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.180
 incorporates with the help of a fork 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.270
 the peat is a spongy matter and 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.460
 fibrous resulting from decomposition 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.100
 of vegetables in high environments 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.140
 humidity and little oxygen when applied to 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.030
 the substrates allows to favor the 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.610
 root development improve the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.950
 structure and above all increases the 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.380
 moisture retention that's why it's 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.180
 fundamental its use in high species 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.180
 moisture requirement as crimes 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.410
 Y 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.750
 Ángela Figueroa writes us in our 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.570
 site because it has some apple trees and 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.310
 you want to know when can angelas 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.990
 apple trees like the rest of the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.509
 fruit trees that drop their leaves in the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.069
 Cold season of handcuffing late 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.590
 of the winter when they are in 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.630
 vegetative rest it is important that 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.630
 always avoid thumb before a lava 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.840
 the 1st of london is considered one of 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.730
 the best organic fertilizers in 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.190
 part product its high content of 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.570
 nutrients is a type of compost but 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.180
 that has been improved through 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.220
 digestive process of earthworms 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.130
 in addition to having a neutral ph can be 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.360
 applied in any type of plant 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.730
 silicon any doubt in this program 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.620
 you can see it again at a point cl and 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.460
 share it on social networks 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.460
 ok, they're fine
