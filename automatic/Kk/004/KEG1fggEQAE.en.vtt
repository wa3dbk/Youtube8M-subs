00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
she has and yeah it was a lot of fun I

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.950 
she has and yeah it was a lot of fun I
made<00:00:38.460> them<00:00:38.670> with<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.969> alligator<00:00:39.420> clips<00:00:39.750> on

made them with the alligator clips on

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.440 
made them with the alligator clips on
the<00:00:40.079> back<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.710> did<00:00:41.160> my<00:00:41.309> own<00:00:41.460> ribbon<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.000> them<00:00:42.210> and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
the back I did my own ribbon on them and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.190 
the back I did my own ribbon on them and
then<00:00:43.910> what<00:00:44.910> she<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.270> do<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.570> wear<00:00:45.809> him<00:00:45.960> alone

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
then what she can do is wear him alone

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.680 
then what she can do is wear him alone
although<00:00:46.649> she<00:00:46.980> doesn't<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.180> know<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.329> ton

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
although she doesn't have you know a ton

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.180 
although she doesn't have you know a ton
of<00:00:48.719> hair<00:00:49.050> yet<00:00:49.910> it's<00:00:50.910> still<00:00:51.300> pretty<00:00:51.510> fine<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.890> I

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
of hair yet it's still pretty fine and I

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.459 
of hair yet it's still pretty fine and I
don't<00:00:53.250> know<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.730> these<00:00:53.969> aren't<00:00:54.750> super<00:00:55.230> heavy

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
don't know that these aren't super heavy

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.080 
don't know that these aren't super heavy
but<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.739> think<00:00:56.039> they<00:00:56.129> probably<00:00:56.280> are<00:00:56.610> too<00:00:56.910> heavy

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
but I think they probably are too heavy

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.959 
but I think they probably are too heavy
to<00:00:57.360> stay<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.840> her<00:00:58.109> hair<00:00:58.379> unless<00:00:58.760> we<00:00:59.760> put<00:00:59.940> a

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
to stay in her hair unless we put a

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.630 
to stay in her hair unless we put a
ponytail<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.780> attached<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.160> at

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
ponytail and attached it to that but at

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.609

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
and I've watched she had another video

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.779 
and I've watched she had another video
out<00:05:54.240> on<00:05:54.270> how<00:05:54.660> she<00:05:54.720> records<00:05:55.530> and<00:05:55.800> so<00:05:56.370> I'm<00:05:56.460> a<00:05:56.490> long

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
out on how she records and so I'm a long

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.969 
out on how she records and so I'm a long
way<00:05:57.000> from<00:05:57.060> having<00:05:57.479> great<00:05:58.020> videos<00:05:58.530> at<00:05:58.800> this

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
way from having great videos at this

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.450 
way from having great videos at this
point<00:05:59.870> but<00:06:00.870> this<00:06:01.050> is<00:06:01.200> a<00:06:01.229> start<00:06:01.710> for<00:06:02.010> me<00:06:02.220> and

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
point but this is a start for me and

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.790 
point but this is a start for me and
it's<00:06:03.090> just<00:06:03.180> a<00:06:03.450> small<00:06:03.810> little<00:06:04.020> tripod<00:06:04.590> it's

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
it's just a small little tripod it's

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.850 
it's just a small little tripod it's
probably<00:06:05.340> six<00:06:05.669> inches<00:06:06.150> maybe<00:06:06.600> the<00:06:07.410> tripod

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
probably six inches maybe the tripod

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.610 
probably six inches maybe the tripod
legs<00:06:08.250> and<00:06:08.700> then<00:06:09.150> I<00:06:09.180> has<00:06:09.390> the<00:06:09.630> the<00:06:09.960> phone<00:06:10.169> holder

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
legs and then I has the the phone holder

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.360 
legs and then I has the the phone holder
up<00:06:10.740> on<00:06:10.950> top<00:06:11.160> and<00:06:12.590> I<00:06:13.590> really<00:06:13.979> bought<00:06:14.160> it<00:06:14.340> just

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
up on top and I really bought it just

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.540 
up on top and I really bought it just
for<00:06:14.610> the<00:06:14.820> holder<00:06:15.270> per<00:06:16.020> her<00:06:16.289> suggestion<00:06:17.250> and

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
for the holder per her suggestion and

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.060 
for the holder per her suggestion and
then<00:06:18.030> she<00:06:18.300> hooks<00:06:18.539> it<00:06:18.780> up<00:06:18.870> to<00:06:19.080> this<00:06:19.200> you<00:06:19.650> can<00:06:19.950> go
