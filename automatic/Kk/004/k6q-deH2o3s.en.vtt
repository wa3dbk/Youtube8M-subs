00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.249 
so to start with I'm gonna get my
economy<00:01:29.909> up<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.180> running<00:01:30.420> okay<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.049> I'm<00:01:31.140> gonna

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
economy up and running okay so I'm gonna

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.929 
economy up and running okay so I'm gonna
build<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.619> kitchen<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.640> my<00:01:32.909> guilty<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:34.950> that

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
build a kitchen in in my guilty and that

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.910 
build a kitchen in in my guilty and that
gives<00:01:36.450> me<00:01:36.540> an<00:01:36.780> emergen<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.650> your<00:01:37.770> kitchen

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
gives me an emergen is that your kitchen

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.770 
gives me an emergen is that your kitchen
so<00:01:38.640> that's<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.979> kitchens<00:01:41.240> produce<00:01:42.240> virgins

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
so that's that kitchens produce virgins

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.469 
so that's that kitchens produce virgins
so<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:46.560> way<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.860> game<00:01:47.040> works<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
so the the way the game works is the the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.480 
so the the way the game works is the the
city<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.810> divided<00:01:49.200> into<00:01:49.860> these<00:01:50.009> colored

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
city is divided into these colored

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.679 
city is divided into these colored
districts<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.799> each<00:01:52.799> district<00:01:53.509> Yukon

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
districts and each district Yukon

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.580 
districts and each district Yukon
each<00:01:55.380> district<00:01:56.960> each<00:01:57.960> district<00:01:58.469> has<00:01:58.500> a

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
each district each district has a

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.260 
each district each district has a
building<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.399> can<00:01:59.520> be<00:01:59.549> infiltrated

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
building in it that can be infiltrated

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.810 
building in it that can be infiltrated
and<00:02:00.899> when<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> building<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.469> infiltrated<00:02:02.100> you

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.569 
a very docile
okay<00:02:14.599> but<00:02:15.349> the<00:02:15.470> game<00:02:15.680> is<00:02:15.890> designed<00:02:16.099> to<00:02:16.489> be

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
okay but the game is designed to be

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.759 
okay but the game is designed to be
played<00:02:16.610> there's<00:02:17.569> a<00:02:17.629> single-player<00:02:18.049> campaign

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
played there's a single-player campaign

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.259 
played there's a single-player campaign
where<00:02:19.099> you<00:02:19.189> go<00:02:19.310> through<00:02:19.459> a<00:02:19.519> story<00:02:19.819> that<00:02:20.120> tells

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
where you go through a story that tells

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.259 
where you go through a story that tells
you<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:21.500> tale<00:02:21.709> of<00:02:22.329> runaway<00:02:23.329> urgent<00:02:23.750> girl<00:02:23.959> who

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
you the tale of runaway urgent girl who

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.839 
you the tale of runaway urgent girl who
makes<00:02:26.269> her<00:02:26.390> way<00:02:26.569> into<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.049> city<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:28.340> under

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
makes her way into the city and under

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.059 
makes her way into the city and under
the<00:02:28.970> auspices<00:02:29.269> of<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.659> master<00:02:30.019> thief<00:02:30.230> but<00:02:30.920> the

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
the auspices of the master thief but the

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.580 
the auspices of the master thief but the
game<00:02:31.189> is<00:02:31.340> also<00:02:31.549> designed<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.180> be<00:02:32.540> really<00:02:33.349> fast

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
game is also designed to be really fast

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.740 
game is also designed to be really fast
play<00:02:33.890> paced<00:02:34.340> asynchronous<00:02:34.970> multiplayer<00:02:35.090> okay

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
play paced asynchronous multiplayer okay

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.619 
play paced asynchronous multiplayer okay
so<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:36.680> idea<00:02:36.980> is<00:02:37.220> it's<00:02:37.549> it's<00:02:38.480> like

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
so the idea is it's it's like

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.920 
so the idea is it's it's like
civilization<00:02:39.230> material<00:02:39.739> Academy<00:02:40.239> you<00:02:41.239> have

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.539 

turns<00:02:44.930> that<00:02:45.170> take<00:02:45.319> about<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.680> minute<00:02:46.190> or<00:02:46.400> two

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
turns that take about a minute or two

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.080 
turns that take about a minute or two
and<00:02:46.940> a<00:02:47.120> total<00:02:47.720> game<00:02:47.870> takes<00:02:48.200> about<00:02:48.639> 30<00:02:49.639> turns<00:02:49.909> or

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
and a total game takes about 30 turns or

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.089 
and a total game takes about 30 turns or
so<00:02:50.269> so<00:02:50.599> the<00:02:51.170> idea<00:02:51.200> is<00:02:51.470> that<00:02:51.560> you<00:02:51.650> have<00:02:51.680> multiple

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
so so the idea is that you have multiple

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.800 
so so the idea is that you have multiple
games<00:02:52.310> running<00:02:52.579> simultaneously<00:02:52.819> and<00:02:53.659> you're

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
games running simultaneously and you're

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.839 
games running simultaneously and you're
you're<00:02:54.139> managing<00:02:54.409> a<00:02:54.590> bunch<00:02:54.799> of<00:02:54.920> guilds

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
you're managing a bunch of guilds

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.479 
you're managing a bunch of guilds
against<00:02:56.750> friends<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.620> enemies<00:02:57.920> all<00:02:58.250> over<00:02:58.400> the

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.170 
against friends and enemies all over the
world<00:02:58.670> okay<00:02:59.239> so<00:02:59.299> this<00:02:59.569> is<00:02:59.750> all<00:02:59.959> done<00:03:00.200> through

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180
