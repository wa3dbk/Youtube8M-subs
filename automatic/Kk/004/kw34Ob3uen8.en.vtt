 it's difficult 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.040
 it is an original creation that how we go from the musical 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.680
 the original creation so we can present

 mone extract of 10 h together we feel a little 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.539
 because precisely against 21 4 characters 

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:41.799

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.799

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:53.729
 throw it into the void you speak in a subject that touches near 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.259
 dismissal for those who do not know that I said I was 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:57.709

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:23.949
 this scenic presence 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:26.290
