00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.930
 good friends before I explain 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.000
 how to install whatsapp on the tablet 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.329
 by downloading the application and 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.669
 associate it with a mobile in which already 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:16.890
 was whatsapp already be 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.780
 installed if you had an account but 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.360
 now there is a much simpler method 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.490
 this year 2015 that serves not only for the 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.020
 tablet but also for the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.880
 Laptop the computer or other device 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.629
 you will see 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:36.170
 let's do it very easily in 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:38.149
 our mobile in which we have our 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.210
 whatsapp account now there is an option 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:44.930
 up on the right that puts whatsapp 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.300
 web well when we give it what it tells us 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.800
 is the step to be done go to web 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.409
 whatsapp point 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.230
 dotcom on the computer and scan the 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:57.470
 code that here we could 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.019
 scan and the associated 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.220
 when we go with our tablet by 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.930
 example to chrome 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.930
 let's go to dot dot whatsapp web 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.540
 we found a small problem and it is 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:16.530
 no qr code does not appear 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.870
 good much information but little else is 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.330
 as simple as giving all three 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:25.290
 little dots that are on the top right and 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.420
 give leave marked the option see how 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.869
 computer 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.530
 and now as if it were a computer 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.530
 you will see the code qr 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.970
 all right 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.000
 recommends us to connect to the wifi and 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.920
 we can choose the left mark this 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.390
 session started 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:55.180
 then that yes for safety the 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.280
 you want to deactivate or if by practice in 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.409
 a machine that you have confidence that does not 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.610
 touch nobody else because you leave it started 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.729
 well as you see we are going to scan the 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.729
 code 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.479
 Y 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.010
 now get 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.129
 as you see 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.770
 well 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.410
 we can send messages 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.780
 and they will appear both in our 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.780
 device like on the tablet 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.379
 connect our phone and synchronize 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.019
 the messages we can use it 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.840
 indistinctly from a 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.400
 device from the other one besides the 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.330
 information for example about the battery 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.400
 and others 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.790
 therefore it is a fantastic method and 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.640
 quick to use it on tablet or where 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.350
 be and also because with a keyboard we can 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.330
 work much better we only have 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.430
 to send many messages or if we have 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:03.920
 to copy things from one side to the other to 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.160
 posture for practical use then 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:12.690
 as you see it is a fantastic option 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:16.590
 They have enabled us to enjoy them 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:19.400
 we enjoy more possibilities so 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.819
 now we only have left after this 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.959
 give 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:28.389
 high subscribe to the channel only remains 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.969
 after this subscribe to the channel and 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:33.069
 go through dotcom bites project for 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:37.049
 see little tricks like that 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.049
 a greeting will be very useful
