00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
beaten path so if somebody said well

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.480 
beaten path so if somebody said well
there's<00:01:17.530> nothing<00:01:17.829> interesting<00:01:18.189> about<00:01:18.280> the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.740 
creation and there's a lot of that going
on<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.130> Latrell<00:02:11.549> and<00:02:11.730> all<00:02:11.880> kinds<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.480> fields

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
on the Latrell and all kinds of fields

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.080 
on the Latrell and all kinds of fields
more<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:13.769> than<00:02:13.980> most<00:02:14.250> places<00:02:14.519> in<00:02:14.880> North

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
more so than most places in North

and<00:02:16.939> what's<00:02:17.239> interesting<00:02:17.420> about<00:02:17.749> it<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.079> that

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
and what's interesting about it is that

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.929 
and what's interesting about it is that
there's<00:02:18.439> a<00:02:18.499> wide<00:02:18.769> variety<00:02:19.099> of<00:02:19.370> personalities

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939 
there's a wide variety of personalities

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.259 
there's a wide variety of personalities
very<00:02:21.129> strong<00:02:22.129> personalities<00:02:22.790> who<00:02:22.879> have<00:02:23.030> very

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
very strong personalities who have very

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.940 
very strong personalities who have very
clear<00:02:23.569> ideas<00:02:23.930> about<00:02:24.079> what<00:02:24.349> the<00:02:24.439> music<00:02:24.469> should

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
clear ideas about what the music should

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.489 
clear ideas about what the music should
be<00:02:25.129> so<00:02:25.969> there's<00:02:26.180> this<00:02:26.329> kind<00:02:26.689> of<00:02:26.870> critical<00:02:27.319> mass

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:27.499 
be so there's this kind of critical mass

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:30.459 
be so there's this kind of critical mass
of<00:02:28.069> ideas<00:02:28.700> bouncing<00:02:29.569> off<00:02:29.719> of<00:02:29.749> each<00:02:30.019> other<00:02:30.260> here

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:30.469 
of ideas bouncing off of each other here

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.289 
of ideas bouncing off of each other here
in<00:02:30.590> Montreal<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.129> that's<00:02:31.280> very<00:02:31.549> very<00:02:31.849> special
