00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:17.900
 from here the next half hour because I will take drunkenness the future 

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:21.099
 with the best stories, news and talks about the world of 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.789
 computers 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.460
 - one of the most famous fighting games 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.890
 the annotation of what happened in the making of pieces 96 and we have the 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.890
 confirmation of the bright and that is the rest 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.110
 now let's go 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.470
 behind the scenes of a game that will surely make 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.310
 sometimes eta 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.710
 the fans of football 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.490
 - previous of the meeting has been a great success and picasso that 96 and is 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.120
 guaranteed that yes gentlemen try something new the first different zones 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.859
 geographical information has been used 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.649
 Consultatio for those of the Peronist movement but designers team 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.030
 they did something else 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.739
 last year everything was drawn by hand 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.560
 hand-colored in a traditional fifa animation style this year 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.920
 We decided to give it a new look and it also says let's modernize the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.800
 process 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.400
 and we will achieve it if the footballers institute 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.690
 some are strong and well aware that they do what they can 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.010
 need activists talked about a lot of work compared to 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.460
 the drawings made by hand 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.440
 the programmers also wanted a change in the game tactics 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.909
 they needed a good shine appointment they went to someone who knew what 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.670
 he spoke 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.360
 I had with Canada in the finals of the 86 World Cup 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.230
 in Mexico as a player 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.640
 and now 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.690
 as a coach I have many ideas to improve the game 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.490
 and they really owe it to you more realistically 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.899
 and that's why he now fixes 96 that caused more about how prototype jump points 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.059
 not just a few players that can throw the ball away she 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.990
 tite 96 also has a well-known British football commentator I do not 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.179
 I'm the one who recorded all the right classes so when you do a great 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.259
 movement he is there to announce it 

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:14.259
 end say in the face to the door 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.219
 besides floor eight months 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.419
 speakers of the monsoon constitution were placed in the game to make it look like 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.709
 that in euskadi 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.709
 the object of aggression 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.040
 It has 32 x you can still enjoy some of these fabulous features but 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.580
 it seems that the owners of yesterday's mega theaters will lose this time 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.290
 is that the designers have gone too far we have not lost of 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.090
 view what it was originally when we made the first fifa that was made a 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.199
 game for fun 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:49.389
 I have never seen 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.549
 he had heard nothing about the attack on life from before 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.659
 yes I see myself I listen nervous 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.659
 that's why 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.719
 Special tuttosport of the week 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.929
 martínez and viable advertising expenses 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:10.110
 the appropriate actions 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.110
 also of course mortal kombat 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:22.199
 this did not reach a storm when it premiered in 1992 and was the first 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.559
 fighting game that digitized movements of real people that the 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:28.439
 rest made it more realistic than any other game of blows in the 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:29.729
 market 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.729
 choose not to 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:38.749
 probably come out closer to mortal kombat is stimulating but there 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:40.669
 a bigger difference the bloody 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:44.359
 even though this workshop is a relatively violent game involving 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.259
 hitting and killing your opponent is not at all as bad as deadly kombat 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:51.659
 deadly blood and courage were the order of the day 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:05.429
 some activities will be enough to turn the stomach stronger 

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:08.429
 more everyday hair 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.959
 in the first game the family friend of Nintendo did the right thing left the 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.689
 blood out of its version this could have kept the parents happy 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:20.919
 but nintendo soon realized that the majority of its players 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.610
 they wanted a lot of red liquid 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.349
 and as many players will mean more money they ended up with their values ​​and 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:30.259
 They included the environment or mortal Kombat 2 that premiered a year later 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:42.969
 everything that surrounded the second game went beyond mortal kombat one despite 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:46.900
 that the continuation would be equal to the first there were more characters many 

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:50.749
 new movements and is more knowledge of Munich because it does not 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.679
 everyone seeks to give their enemy a bloody death 

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:57.799
 in mortal kombat two they included some boobies where they change the opponent 

00:04:57.799 --> 00:05:01.129
 loser for a weeping child and friendships that allow you to give a 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:04.129
 gift to the loser now and he had access 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:07.939
 one 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.589
 the phenomenon of mortal kombat has brought a third game will debut very soon 

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:20.259
 and it seems that with the other two previous versions it's fair to say that 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:24.059
 in pool and civil the group looks fantastic and is an asset of 

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:27.529
 currency conversion all the characters 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:30.529
 while in the animalized annals if the conservative 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.909
 both plants 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:39.559
 merkel crespo to play even the same is already with eight people plus 

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:43.919
 you can play one of your children and it opened when you're playing that 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.919
 person opinion yes with a little mozart 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:55.479
 do not 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.259
 / now 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:05:59.599
 The file 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:02.580
 for above but 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.050
 is to stand out in other formats and this is the Palestinian version it looks very 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.689
 pressing for a 16-bit fight game and it will probably be played as well 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:14.689
 As it was told 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:24.719
 but as it will against a very early figure for children 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:28.269
 we have to watch both games before its political premiere in terms of 

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:30.569
 products 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:33.939
 tired of the premieres well now you can get a dose of nostalgia 

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:35.430
 in some class games
