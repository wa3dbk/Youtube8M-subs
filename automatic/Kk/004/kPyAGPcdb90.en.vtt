00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
initially don't want the dogs to do is I

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.540 
initially don't want the dogs to do is I
don't<00:02:34.060> want<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.750> dogs<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:35.110> be<00:02:35.350> overly<00:02:35.920> excited

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
don't want the dogs to be overly excited

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.259 
don't want the dogs to be overly excited
upon<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.600> sight<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.590> cat<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:39.790> I'm<00:02:39.940> going

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
upon the sight of the cat so I'm going

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.350 
upon the sight of the cat so I'm going
to<00:02:40.300> work<00:02:41.110> at<00:02:41.350> a<00:02:41.380> distance<00:02:41.940> I'm<00:02:42.940> not<00:02:43.150> going<00:02:43.299> to

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
to work at a distance I'm not going to

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.809 
to work at a distance I'm not going to
let<00:02:43.540> my<00:02:43.690> dogs<00:02:43.900> rush<00:02:44.200> right<00:02:44.470> up<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.010> crates

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
let my dogs rush right up to the crates

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.160 
let my dogs rush right up to the crates
because<00:02:46.239> that's<00:02:46.420> going<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.600> make<00:02:46.690> him<00:02:46.930> feel

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
because that's going to make him feel

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.820 
because that's going to make him feel
uncomfortable<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:49.600> I'll<00:02:49.750> just<00:02:49.959> let<00:02:50.200> them<00:02:50.470> see

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
uncomfortable and I'll just let them see

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.430 
uncomfortable and I'll just let them see
him<00:02:51.010> from<00:02:51.549> a<00:02:51.670> distance<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.420> then<00:02:52.690> as<00:02:52.900> they<00:02:53.140> are

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.759 
him from a distance and then as they are
calm<00:02:53.799> I'll<00:02:54.220> slowly<00:02:54.610> move<00:02:55.269> forward<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.350> let

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
calm I'll slowly move forward and let

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.390 
calm I'll slowly move forward and let
them<00:02:57.010> approach<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.390> crate<00:02:58.630> if<00:02:58.959> if<00:02:59.769> they're<00:03:00.220> or
