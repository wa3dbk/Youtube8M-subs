00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.459 

before<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.850> started<00:00:33.300> our<00:00:33.450> work<00:00:33.690> we<00:00:34.050> had<00:00:34.290> what

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
before we started our work we had what

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.870 
before we started our work we had what
other<00:00:34.620> schools<00:00:34.980> had<00:00:35.190> there<00:00:35.579> would<00:00:35.700> be<00:00:35.760> a

other schools had there would be a

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.670 
other schools had there would be a
teacher<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.660> classroom<00:00:36.899> they<00:00:37.380> would<00:00:37.469> teach

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
teacher in a classroom they would teach

teacher in a classroom they would teach
a<00:00:37.800> curriculum<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.030> student<00:00:39.420> needed

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
a curriculum and if a student needed

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.990 
a curriculum and if a student needed
extra<00:00:39.989> help<00:00:40.020> out<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.950> door<00:00:41.160> they<00:00:41.309> went<00:00:41.460> down

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
extra help out the door they went down

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.910 
extra help out the door they went down
the<00:00:42.210> hallway<00:00:42.390> they<00:00:42.690> went<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.079> somebody<00:00:43.739> else

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the hallway they went and somebody else

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.950 
the hallway they went and somebody else
pulled<00:00:44.550> out<00:00:44.700> all<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.059> tricks<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.660> they<00:00:45.780> knew

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
pulled out all the tricks that they knew

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.619 
pulled out all the tricks that they knew
and<00:00:46.260> tried<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.500> teach<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.980> child<00:00:47.210> so<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.480> us

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and tried to teach that child so for us

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.229 
and tried to teach that child so for us
it<00:00:48.960> was<00:00:49.020> really<00:00:49.200> flipping<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.370> whole<00:00:50.760> model

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
it was really flipping that whole model

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.450 
it was really flipping that whole model
upside<00:00:51.809> down<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.320> saying<00:00:52.620> these<00:00:53.129> are<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
upside down and saying these are the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.580 
upside down and saying these are the
resources<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.360> available<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:55.020> us<00:00:55.050> how<00:00:55.530> do

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
resources we have available to us how do

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.130 
resources we have available to us how do
we<00:00:55.739> get<00:00:55.920> everybody<00:00:56.309> working<00:00:56.670> together<00:00:57.140> to

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
we get everybody working together to

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.049 
we get everybody working together to
design<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.649> system<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.430> more<00:00:59.609> seamless

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
design a system that is more seamless

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.490 
design a system that is more seamless
for<00:01:00.300> students

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.470 

this<00:01:05.160> system<00:01:05.519> would<00:01:05.640> not<00:01:05.940> work<00:01:06.240> without

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.480 
this system would not work without

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.690 
this system would not work without
teacher<00:01:06.840> collaboration<00:01:07.100> every<00:01:08.100> decision<00:01:08.400> we

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
teacher collaboration every decision we

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.060 
teacher collaboration every decision we
make<00:01:08.730> we<00:01:09.210> have<00:01:09.480> to<00:01:09.660> make<00:01:09.960> as<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> team<00:01:10.410> we<00:01:10.950> can

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
make we have to make as a team we can

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.770 
make we have to make as a team we can
problem<00:01:11.430> solve<00:01:11.610> together<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.300> look<00:01:12.480> at<00:01:12.600> data

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
problem solve together and look at data

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.160 
problem solve together and look at data
together<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.710> make<00:01:14.460> decisions<00:01:15.060> about<00:01:15.270> what

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
together and make decisions about what

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.930 
together and make decisions about what
kids<00:01:16.470> need<00:01:16.770> if<00:01:17.370> we're<00:01:17.610> going<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.790> work

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
kids need if we're going to work

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.150 
kids need if we're going to work
collectively<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:19.110> ensure<00:01:19.440> the<00:01:19.620> success<00:01:20.040> of

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
collectively to ensure the success of

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.430 
collectively to ensure the success of
every<00:01:20.430> child<00:01:20.729> then<00:01:21.300> we<00:01:21.420> had<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.960> get<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
every child then we had to get on the

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.490 
every child then we had to get on the
same<00:01:22.650> page<00:01:22.710> about<00:01:23.010> what<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:23.970> were<00:01:24.150> teaching<00:01:24.500> so

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
same page about what we were teaching so

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.060 
same page about what we were teaching so
for<00:01:25.770> us<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.670> was<00:01:26.910> an<00:01:27.030> early<00:01:27.240> lesson<00:01:27.810> in

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
for us it was an early lesson in

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.100 
for us it was an early lesson in
identifying<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.310> core<00:01:29.760> curriculum<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.600> math

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
identifying a core curriculum in math

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.380 
identifying a core curriculum in math
and<00:01:31.440> reading<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:32.400> was<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.760> same<00:01:33.060> no<00:01:33.360> matter

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
and reading that was the same no matter

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.200 
and reading that was the same no matter
who<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.869> teacher<00:01:34.110> was<00:01:34.410> now<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.100> get<00:01:35.490> us<00:01:35.640> so

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
who the teacher was now to get us so

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.080 
who the teacher was now to get us so
every<00:01:36.810> single<00:01:37.110> student<00:01:37.320> will<00:01:37.560> receive

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
every single student will receive

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.700 
every single student will receive
universal<00:01:39.090> instruction<00:01:39.630> core<00:01:40.050> instruction

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
universal instruction core instruction

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.930 
universal instruction core instruction
also<00:01:40.979> known<00:01:41.490> as<00:01:41.670> Tier<00:01:42.119> one<00:01:43.280> some<00:01:44.280> kids<00:01:44.610> will

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
also known as Tier one some kids will

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.060 
also known as Tier one some kids will
need<00:01:45.320> supplemental<00:01:46.320> instruction<00:01:46.860> they'll

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
need supplemental instruction they'll

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.130 
need supplemental instruction they'll
need<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> little<00:01:47.460> bit<00:01:47.610> more<00:01:47.790> than<00:01:48.090> core<00:01:48.479> so

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
need a little bit more than core so

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.779 
need a little bit more than core so
you'll<00:01:49.350> hear<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.710> referred<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.340> as<00:01:50.490> -<00:01:50.670> you're

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
you'll hear that referred to as - you're

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.370 
you'll hear that referred to as - you're
-<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:52.430> then<00:01:53.430> some<00:01:53.910> kids<00:01:54.210> may<00:01:54.630> need<00:01:54.869> more

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
- and then some kids may need more

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.889 
- and then some kids may need more
intensive<00:01:56.070> intervention<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.750> you'll

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
intensive intervention and so you'll

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.650 
intensive intervention and so you'll
hear<00:01:58.080> that<00:01:58.320> referred<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.890> as<00:01:59.100> Tier<00:01:59.490> three<00:01:59.660> so

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
hear that referred to as Tier three so

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.330 
hear that referred to as Tier three so
what<00:02:00.960> does<00:02:01.050> it<00:02:01.170> tell<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.440> to<00:02:01.530> do<00:02:01.710> how<00:02:02.130> are<00:02:02.160> you

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
what does it tell you to do how are you

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.469 
what does it tell you to do how are you
going<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.580> figure<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.030> out

block<00:02:08.130> are<00:02:08.399> teaching<00:02:08.820> core<00:02:09.060> instruction<00:02:09.600> to

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
block are teaching core instruction to

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.680 
block are teaching core instruction to
their<00:02:09.989> core<00:02:10.320> 22<00:02:10.890> students<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.700> then<00:02:12.540> they

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
their core 22 students and then they

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.360 
their core 22 students and then they
would<00:02:12.840> move<00:02:12.989> into<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.320> time<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:14.100> we<00:02:14.220> call

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
would move into a time that we call

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.580 
would move into a time that we call
autonomous<00:02:15.000> time<00:02:15.269> where<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:16.049> students<00:02:16.470> will

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
autonomous time where the students will

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:25.570 
autonomous time where the students will
be<00:02:16.650> more<00:02:17.070> self-directed<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:18.060> their<00:02:18.209> learning

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.789 

so<00:02:26.580> some<00:02:27.150> teachers<00:02:27.540> may<00:02:27.780> pull<00:02:28.080> tier<00:02:28.380> two<00:02:28.650> at

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
so some teachers may pull tier two at

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.550 
so some teachers may pull tier two at
that<00:02:28.980> time<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:30.150> also<00:02:30.299> may<00:02:30.600> see<00:02:30.630> tier<00:02:31.049> 3<00:02:31.380> being

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
that time you also may see tier 3 being

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.400 
that time you also may see tier 3 being
pulled<00:02:31.890> at<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.160> time<00:02:32.430> in<00:02:32.820> a<00:02:33.239> very<00:02:33.450> small<00:02:34.079> room

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
pulled at that time in a very small room

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.970 
pulled at that time in a very small room
where<00:02:34.950> kids<00:02:35.519> can<00:02:35.730> really<00:02:35.970> focus<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.769> book

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
where kids can really focus so this book

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.479 
where kids can really focus so this book
is<00:02:38.280> about<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.730> Constitution<00:02:40.190> it's<00:02:41.190> pretty

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
is about the Constitution it's pretty

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.759 
is about the Constitution it's pretty
awesome<00:02:41.670> here<00:02:42.150> my<00:02:43.079> three<00:02:43.320> favorite<00:02:43.739> things

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
awesome here my three favorite things

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.979 
awesome here my three favorite things
are<00:02:44.250> math<00:02:44.790> writing<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:46.610> reading<00:02:47.610> it's<00:02:48.570> kind

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
are math writing and reading it's kind

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.350 
are math writing and reading it's kind
of<00:02:49.049> cool<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:49.560> if<00:02:49.799> you<00:02:49.890> don't<00:02:50.100> just<00:02:50.370> aren't<00:02:50.970> just

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
of cool so if you don't just aren't just

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.840 
of cool so if you don't just aren't just
with<00:02:51.540> one<00:02:52.170> teacher<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.250> get<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.610> kind<00:02:53.760> of

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
with one teacher and you get to kind of

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.180 
with one teacher and you get to kind of
move<00:02:54.030> rooms<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.810> with<00:02:54.930> teachers<00:02:55.200> when<00:02:55.799> you<00:02:55.950> go

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
move rooms and with teachers when you go

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.520 
move rooms and with teachers when you go
down<00:02:56.459> into<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:57.150> with<00:02:57.510> mr.<00:02:57.870> Kirby<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.350> your

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
down into the with mr. Kirby and your

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.710 
down into the with mr. Kirby and your
small<00:02:59.040> group<00:02:59.280> then<00:02:59.700> it<00:02:59.880> really<00:03:00.090> stretches

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
small group then it really stretches

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.690 
small group then it really stretches
your<00:03:01.079> brain<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.950> really<00:03:02.220> good<00:03:02.430> way<00:03:04.700> teachers

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
your brain in a really good way teachers

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.610 
your brain in a really good way teachers
organize<00:03:06.030> themselves<00:03:06.510> in<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.110> variety<00:03:07.260> of

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
organize themselves in a variety of

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.160 
organize themselves in a variety of
different<00:03:07.860> ways<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.220> it<00:03:08.670> depends<00:03:09.209> on<00:03:09.360> teacher

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
different ways and it depends on teacher

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.610 
different ways and it depends on teacher
strengths<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:11.060> student<00:03:12.060> needs

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
strengths and student needs

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.910 
strengths and student needs
away<00:03:14.909> we<00:03:15.909> may<00:03:16.120> need<00:03:16.330> a<00:03:16.390> specific<00:03:17.080> group<00:03:17.260> just

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
away we may need a specific group just

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.030 
away we may need a specific group just
on<00:03:18.159> predicting<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.360> you<00:03:20.319> don't<00:03:20.530> have<00:03:20.709> you

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
on predicting and you don't have you

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.830 
on predicting and you don't have you
don't<00:03:21.159> have<00:03:21.280> five<00:03:21.700> kids<00:03:22.030> who<00:03:22.209> need<00:03:22.360> predicting

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
don't have five kids who need predicting

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.470 
don't have five kids who need predicting
and<00:03:22.989> you're<00:03:23.200> 22<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:24.519> have<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.730> whole<00:03:25.060> bunch<00:03:25.090> of

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
and you're 22 you have a whole bunch of

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.270 
and you're 22 you have a whole bunch of
them<00:03:25.629> across<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.110> learning<00:03:26.379> community<00:03:26.769> so

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
them across the learning community so

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.910 
them across the learning community so
it's<00:03:28.180> really<00:03:28.510> important<00:03:29.049> that<00:03:29.080> the<00:03:29.260> tiers<00:03:29.620> are

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
it's really important that the tiers are

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.729 
it's really important that the tiers are
connected<00:03:30.700> your<00:03:31.329> core<00:03:31.599> instruction<00:03:32.230> could<00:03:32.590> be

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
connected your core instruction could be

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.309 
connected your core instruction could be
inferring<00:03:33.400> if<00:03:33.610> they're<00:03:34.480> receiving<00:03:34.870> tier<00:03:35.170> one

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
inferring if they're receiving tier one

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.680 
inferring if they're receiving tier one
with<00:03:35.500> me<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:35.860> tier<00:03:36.129> two<00:03:36.370> with<00:03:36.579> you<00:03:36.819> and<00:03:37.120> tier

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
with me and tier two with you and tier

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.610 
with me and tier two with you and tier
three<00:03:37.930> with<00:03:38.049> someone<00:03:38.319> else

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
three with someone else

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.000 
three with someone else
we<00:03:39.040> all<00:03:39.370> are<00:03:39.849> really<00:03:40.180> teaching<00:03:40.900> in<00:03:41.079> furry<00:03:41.530> we

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
we all are really teaching in furry we

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.229 
we all are really teaching in furry we
just<00:03:42.220> may<00:03:42.340> be<00:03:42.400> teaching<00:03:42.670> it<00:03:42.879> with<00:03:42.970> different

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
just may be teaching it with different

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.660 
just may be teaching it with different
materials<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:46.120> requires<00:03:46.569> a<00:03:46.720> lot<00:03:46.989> of<00:03:47.140> trust

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
materials that requires a lot of trust

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.670 
materials that requires a lot of trust
amongst<00:03:48.670> teachers<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.390> that<00:03:49.959> also<00:03:50.170> requires

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
amongst teachers and that also requires

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.970 
amongst teachers and that also requires
teachers<00:03:50.980> to<00:03:51.190> communicate<00:03:51.870> they<00:03:52.870> meet<00:03:53.620> every

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
teachers to communicate they meet every

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.039 
teachers to communicate they meet every
Wednesday<00:03:54.160> in<00:03:54.700> a<00:03:54.970> learning<00:03:55.329> community<00:03:55.359> and

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
Wednesday in a learning community and

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.140 
Wednesday in a learning community and
they<00:03:56.739> definitely<00:03:57.010> check<00:03:57.459> in<00:03:57.609> with<00:03:57.790> each<00:03:57.819> other

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
they definitely check in with each other

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.170 
they definitely check in with each other
about<00:03:58.420> instruction<00:03:59.280> they<00:04:00.280> have<00:04:00.609> it<00:04:00.790> almost

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
about instruction they have it almost

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.369 
about instruction they have it almost
all<00:04:01.329> of<00:04:01.359> it<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.569> packet<00:04:01.870> already<00:04:02.049> filled<00:04:02.230> out

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
all of it a packet already filled out

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:03.809 
all of it a packet already filled out
and<00:04:02.620> then<00:04:02.650> there's<00:04:02.920> some<00:04:03.129> groups<00:04:03.489> of<00:04:03.640> kids

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
and then there's some groups of kids

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.000 
and then there's some groups of kids
that<00:04:04.090> don't<00:04:04.329> have<00:04:04.840> anything<00:04:05.230> filled<00:04:05.650> out<00:04:05.799> we

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
that don't have anything filled out we

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.349 
that don't have anything filled out we
have<00:04:06.159> the<00:04:06.250> same<00:04:06.430> problems<00:04:06.760> with<00:04:06.879> when<00:04:07.150> they

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
have the same problems with when they

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:08.789 
have the same problems with when they
come<00:04:07.390> to<00:04:07.690> us<00:04:07.840> they<00:04:08.049> have<00:04:08.170> to<00:04:08.200> finish<00:04:08.560> up<00:04:08.680> the

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
come to us they have to finish up the

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.099 
come to us they have to finish up the
packet<00:04:09.159> so<00:04:09.310> if<00:04:09.400> we<00:04:09.519> if<00:04:09.760> we<00:04:09.940> try<00:04:10.569> to<00:04:10.599> stick<00:04:10.930> to

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
packet so if we if we try to stick to

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.649 
packet so if we if we try to stick to
what<00:04:11.349> that<00:04:11.500> core<00:04:11.950> part<00:04:12.250> is<00:04:12.489> in<00:04:12.790> it<00:04:12.940> and<00:04:13.150> then<00:04:13.299> we

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:13.659 
what that core part is in it and then we

represent of the time and then reading

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.310 
represent of the time and then reading
which<00:04:54.099> was<00:04:54.310> many<00:04:54.550> less<00:04:54.760> than<00:04:54.940> 45%<00:04:55.539> of<00:04:55.990> the<00:04:56.110> time

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.260 
which was many less than 45% of the time
and<00:04:56.650> then<00:04:56.889> 83%<00:04:57.490> of<00:04:57.729> the<00:04:57.789> time<00:04:57.820> and<00:04:58.120> then<00:04:58.210> you

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
and then 83% of the time and then you

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.820 
and then 83% of the time and then you
also<00:04:58.389> had<00:04:58.599> some<00:04:58.750> really<00:04:58.870> other<00:04:59.020> good<00:04:59.260> details

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
also had some really other good details

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.900 
also had some really other good details
maybe<00:05:00.370> her<00:05:00.849> goal<00:05:01.840> sheet

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
maybe her goal sheet

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.820 
maybe her goal sheet
it's<00:05:03.330> almost<00:05:03.570> like<00:05:03.750> twice<00:05:04.020> as<00:05:04.260> long<00:05:04.470> so<00:05:04.800> she

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
it's almost like twice as long so she

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.040 
it's almost like twice as long so she
has<00:05:05.160> more<00:05:05.490> space<00:05:05.820> like<00:05:06.090> on<00:05:06.300> Monday<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:06.900> right

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
has more space like on Monday and right

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.750 
has more space like on Monday and right
before<00:05:07.320> you<00:05:07.410> go<00:05:07.530> into<00:05:07.680> tier<00:05:07.920> 2<00:05:08.100> okay<00:05:08.430> like<00:05:08.610> what
