00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:05.460
 this fight is yes but please ask the Saarland calls the renounces the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.670
 St 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.179
 I'm 21 years old 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.739
 Percent come from Nordfriesland in Madrid Schland 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:15.029
 and studies since 2008 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.369
 either on the wall Togo brings international business in the degree program 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:19.810
 Intelligence BI 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.159
 what exactly are you doing there 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:27.259
 You can imagine that as a bwl study in Germany for that is 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.259
 to get to know the necessary structures 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.610
 Entrepreneur financial structures Kevin percent as it is more difficult component with 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.460
 while he spoke component English French 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.600
 for me and around 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.580
 But the degree is the School of Business on the Stray Sheep I'm in 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.750
 Germany could be written 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.260
 How did you come to the App on Snow Patrol for this degree program? 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.880
 decided 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.020
 Melcher 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.250
 very late started looking for a place to study and Habbo under 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.490
 Other mouse and get because I had a bit in tram 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.310
 Percent of foreign countries and percent of Germany universities also 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.100
 that they have the problem and in Holland 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.640
 Cologne I gave a backdrop wrote gave relatively quickly the 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.580
 positive answer and percent for Breda 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.660
 and Japan I decided then 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.660
 India where did you inform yourself about the study possibilities 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.780
 Velen first line up by nine percent 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.160
 Studies in Holland points marriage and 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.830
 percent 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.350
 Of course, the second Viva will have a look at everything on site 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.900
 and percent went relatively fast 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.510
 van der Veer and what I became then 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.510
 Applications to study directs percent 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.800
 I thought that's the case now 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.040
 five six applications 5 6 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.580
 positive answers 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.250
 and yes you are the barley and the friendliest percent I have 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.500
 me for the 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.070
 decided on 1 4 clock early 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.450
 now Beni demanded language skills acquired 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.790
 to Dr in the test through the gear will be completely in English 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.909
 that means percent is enough if you have English until graduation 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:10.869
 had percent 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.309
 if not then Ammann Getafe moor 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:17.309
 and I did not demand the cutting so that was no problem 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:21.619
 only better run here long moved how did you find a flat there 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:26.229
 I found that relatively quickly, which was very lucky 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.269
 before that one but that one stands in the Netherlands of those student 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.259
 very busy with housing search 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:35.259
 but percent that behind me relatively fast 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.769
 and how do you like it so well how is the student life place 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.780
 the percent gradient so far 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.959
 really good for the game of the "Hammer Group" larger 8120th 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.189
 Thousands of ten students 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.499
 And most of the week you can also out of school 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.159
 to do many activities 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.909
 what are you planning for the future? 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:03.579
 For the first time, I'm planning to spend a year in Breda and have many with AvW 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.459
 Hagen Universities where you might also get a double victory for 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.629
 Can obtain 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.929
 and that's my plan Nixon January 2011 percents 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:16.199
 to lead to the US or Britain are to double leadership 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.029
 and where do you see because of positive effect on negative 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:23.029
 RastÃ¤tter one also studying 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.579
 So first the positives clearly outweigh the percent 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.269
 You have to spend an awful lot in those including Fabian 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.269
 uncomfortable people killed Ben learned 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:39.089
 learned a lot also technically course PrÃ¶ll spoke to me scary 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:40.529
 learned a lot 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:43.529
 What 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:50.589
 that only happens to three four times a year 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:54.099
 And, of course, you're always behind new situations you look at 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.059
 It must be a bit difficult at the beginning to adapt 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:59.759
 but certainly not quite good 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.939
 See Wissing next door 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.939
 I would definitely still refuse the team 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.299
 If I continue to study all the beautiful study time and good luck for you 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:09.469
 the future
