00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
70s but let's talk about the size do you

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.259 
70s but let's talk about the size do you
think<00:03:26.530> this<00:03:26.769> spike<00:03:27.099> is<00:03:27.370> big<00:03:27.639> or<00:03:28.000> small<00:03:30.269> it

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
think this spike is big or small it

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.290 
think this spike is big or small it
seems<00:03:31.629> big<00:03:31.930> enough<00:03:32.430> isn't<00:03:33.430> it

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
seems big enough isn't it

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:42.910 
seems big enough isn't it
well<00:03:36.370> not<00:03:37.370> exactly<00:03:40.210> as<00:03:41.210> you<00:03:41.660> see<00:03:41.930> it's<00:03:42.590> much

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
well not exactly as you see it's much

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.900 
well not exactly as you see it's much
smaller<00:03:43.340> than<00:03:43.550> you<00:03:43.850> thing<00:03:45.580> and<00:03:46.580> this

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
smaller than you thing and this

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.720 
smaller than you thing and this
demonstrates<00:03:47.780> what<00:03:48.410> I<00:03:48.440> Stein<00:03:49.040> said<00:03:49.460> once
