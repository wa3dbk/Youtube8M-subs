00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
the storyline that much because it

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.040

that I mean you know in yes it's kind of
weird<00:06:10.450> that<00:06:10.510> Marvel's<00:06:10.990> doing<00:06:11.200> it<00:06:11.320> at<00:06:11.470> the<00:06:11.560> same

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
weird that Marvel's doing it at the same

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.410 
weird that Marvel's doing it at the same
time<00:06:11.800> as<00:06:12.190> DC's<00:06:12.520> doing<00:06:12.850> it<00:06:12.940> just<00:06:13.180> you<00:06:13.330> know

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:13.420 
time as DC's doing it just you know

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.960 
time as DC's doing it just you know
around<00:06:14.110> at<00:06:14.200> the<00:06:14.260> same<00:06:14.440> time<00:06:14.710> because<00:06:14.970> DC's

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
around at the same time because DC's

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.360 
around at the same time because DC's
doing<00:06:16.240> Batman<00:06:16.420> V<00:06:16.750> Superman<00:06:17.170> but<00:06:17.380> I<00:06:17.920> think<00:06:18.280> it's

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
doing Batman V Superman but I think it's

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.820 
doing Batman V Superman but I think it's
a<00:06:18.400> lot<00:06:18.490> of<00:06:18.610> fun<00:06:18.760> to<00:06:18.880> see<00:06:19.090> and<00:06:19.420> I<00:06:19.750> think<00:06:20.290> it<00:06:20.410> to<00:06:20.800> a

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
a lot of fun to see and I think it to a

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.590 
a lot of fun to see and I think it to a
degree<00:06:21.040> it<00:06:21.490> kind<00:06:21.760> of<00:06:21.880> makes<00:06:22.090> sense<00:06:22.270> where<00:06:22.570> you

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:22.600 
degree it kind of makes sense where you

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.000 
degree it kind of makes sense where you
could<00:06:22.810> have<00:06:22.960> heroes<00:06:23.410> that<00:06:23.710> could<00:06:23.830> be<00:06:23.920> on

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
could have heroes that could be on

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.130 
could have heroes that could be on
different<00:06:24.220> sides<00:06:24.580> of<00:06:24.850> issues<00:06:25.630> like<00:06:25.930> this

every<00:06:30.160> layer<00:06:30.340> of<00:06:30.520> government<00:06:30.670> he<00:06:31.150> would<00:06:31.360> not

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
every layer of government he would not

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.080 
every layer of government he would not
want<00:06:31.930> to<00:06:32.140> probably<00:06:33.040> go<00:06:33.370> along<00:06:33.640> with<00:06:33.790> that<00:06:33.880> so<00:06:34.060> I

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
want to probably go along with that so I

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.970 
want to probably go along with that so I
guess<00:06:34.360> it<00:06:34.480> does<00:06:34.630> make<00:06:34.780> sense<00:06:34.960> to<00:06:35.140> so<00:06:35.440> let<00:06:35.920> me

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
guess it does make sense to so let me

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.580 
guess it does make sense to so let me
know<00:06:36.100> you<00:06:36.220> guys<00:06:36.370> think<00:06:36.670> about<00:06:36.850> that

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
know you guys think about that

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.440 
know you guys think about that
idea<00:06:38.590> I<00:06:38.710> guess<00:06:39.100> or<00:06:39.340> that<00:06:39.670> storyline<00:06:40.180> for<00:06:40.330> them

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:40.450 
idea I guess or that storyline for them

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.180 
idea I guess or that storyline for them
to<00:06:40.570> base<00:06:40.720> the<00:06:40.900> movie<00:06:41.140> on<00:06:41.260> I<00:06:41.470> think<00:06:41.770> it's<00:06:42.010> great
