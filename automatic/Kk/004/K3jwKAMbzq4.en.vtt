it's<00:03:18.390> still<00:03:18.570> an<00:03:18.690> attack<00:03:18.930> but<00:03:19.080> it's<00:03:19.230> not

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
it's still an attack but it's not

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.110 
it's still an attack but it's not
reaching<00:03:19.650> its<00:03:19.770> full<00:03:19.920> power<00:03:20.100> Jace<00:03:20.820> tried

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
reaching its full power Jace tried

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.430 
reaching its full power Jace tried
punching<00:03:21.360> murder<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:21.959> knee<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:22.140> Berto

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
punching murder in the knee and Berto

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.020 
punching murder in the knee and Berto
just<00:03:22.650> punched<00:03:22.950> Jace<00:03:23.130> in<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.370> face<00:03:23.550> I<00:03:23.790> don't

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
just punched Jace in the face I don't

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.390 
just punched Jace in the face I don't
think<00:03:24.690> they're<00:03:24.870> right<00:03:25.080> um<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:26.010> seems<00:03:26.250> like<00:03:26.370> a

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
think they're right um it seems like a

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.860 
think they're right um it seems like a
little<00:03:26.670> off<00:03:26.790> at<00:03:26.970> scale<00:03:27.270> I<00:03:27.300> remember<00:03:27.660> brother

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
little off at scale I remember brother

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.270 
little off at scale I remember brother
being<00:03:28.080> taller<00:03:28.380> than<00:03:28.560> Jace<00:03:28.739> but<00:03:28.920> I<00:03:28.980> remember

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
being taller than Jace but I remember

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.680 
being taller than Jace but I remember
murder<00:03:29.459> being<00:03:29.640> this<00:03:29.850> much<00:03:29.910> bigger<00:03:30.330> than<00:03:30.480> Jason

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
murder being this much bigger than Jason

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.510 
murder being this much bigger than Jason
to<00:03:30.930> show<00:03:31.110> it<00:03:31.260> seems<00:03:31.500> like<00:03:31.680> Jace<00:03:32.010> comes<00:03:32.310> up<00:03:32.430> to

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
to show it seems like Jace comes up to

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.370 
to show it seems like Jace comes up to
like<00:03:32.700> urban<00:03:33.239> waste<00:03:33.570> I<00:03:33.780> might<00:03:33.959> be<00:03:34.050> wrong<00:03:34.200> on

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
like urban waste I might be wrong on

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.470 
like urban waste I might be wrong on
that<00:03:34.440> though<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:34.950> know<00:03:35.520> Jace<00:03:35.820> was<00:03:36.000> short<00:03:36.270> for

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
that though I know Jace was short for

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.470 
that though I know Jace was short for
