00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hi so in this video I'm going 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.109
 you talk about shadows actually just 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.990
 of the color of the shadow and and there too 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.010
 I 'm going to disassemble a bit of a myth 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.990
 so I told you about it right away 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.340
 just before so that was predictable I 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.540
 prepared a second video where we go 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.880
 to go much further precisely in 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.170
 this notion of shade and here you are 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.520
 will be able to have access to all 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.680
 from the video that is right in 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.539
 below where I will explain to you in 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.240
 done and I will show you especially 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.279
 with you are going to see painting 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.179
 precisely several ways to create 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.279
 shading 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.450
 at one point see everything in fact the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.680
 different kinds of shaded how 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.180
 to mitigate a shadow 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.649
 lots of things like that I tell you 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.579
 no more everything is in the second video 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.329
 so so in this video actually 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.399
 I would like to disassemble a myth in fact and 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.989
 to explain something to you is that 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.579
 do I just do not use 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.289
 black for my shadows 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.449
 I almost never use color 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.399
 black then you will tell me why 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.590
 why do not you ever say color 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.000
 black is a color it's something 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.440
 something that can darken the colors 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.850
 which makes it possible to make shadows 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.989
 so what is this 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.540
 story that do not use black 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.990
 the ankle in black then the debate 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.010
 is open 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.619
 is it done on purpose or not 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.360
 here I leave the debate so 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.590
 so here's the thing is that in 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.619
 I do not use black at all 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.000
 why simply because finally 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.619
 if you are used to using it 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.960
 you know it's a color that is 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.250
 very invasive here that if you put 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.950
 really a tip of black she's going 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.439
 really finally take it will eat 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.450
 in a way the canvas I find that 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.400
 it's a color that invades what and 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.049
 which is not pleasing to the eye in fact 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.400
 hot that there are very good ways 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.829
 better to make shadows that are 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.810
 much more subtle rather than outside I 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.159
 come when we make a shadow with 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.390
 black is getting finance it's something 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.430
 really basic what a shame 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.020
 basic ok you do you take your color you 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.670
 mixed it with black what I want 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.649
 to say it's for me it's too much 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.810
 degree and in addition as I told you there 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.799
 is this story of two 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.780
 of invasion of the black 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.740
 who eat a little the other colors 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.210
 who sees there and who dirty a little 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.500
 colors somehow that's it in 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.599
 it's the thing I think 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.290
 that it dirty the color is not at all 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.610
 subtle so there so me what I you 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.650
 advises if not give at all used 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.880
 black so what can you do to 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.310
 bad year I'll show you this is me 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.720
 baala in eight years i have my tube of 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.430
 black he's still there so he in 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.830
 stay a little bit and so here are eight 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.440
 years and I used that as loire 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.030
 so me what I advise you is 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.989
 still having a little black next to 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.590
 you because it can be very useful 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.830
 for example I'm painting 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.150
 a trans horse moment and while he 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.590
 there was place that was very clean 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.049
 deep who really had this color 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.510
 black so then that's clear that 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.120
 I used black in this kind of 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.920
 Here it is, we can use some 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.880
 from time to time but very rarely 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.160
 me what I really recommend 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.650
 it's to avoid using black except 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.850
 in extreme cases where really where 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.040
 really there it's clear they're going in 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.390
 use but for all that is good 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.069
 I advise you not at all designated 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.900
 elior then obviously after there are some 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.930
 colors here are colors 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.120
 different like like the brown like 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.890
 the saas and things I'm going to 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.790
 speak there are other colors also his 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.480
 leaves and things I'm going to talk about 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.190
 in the second video I ask you 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.299
 so that's things that I 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.690
 will you speak again in the second 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.850
 video 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.950
 and here we will really see together 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.769
 all that and how exactly 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.329
 created subtle nails that's not it 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.630
 to make a first degree shadow with 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.239
 black 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.650
 so how to fix that we see everything 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.420
 that in the second video I'm going to you 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.769
 show you will be able to access 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.640
 you will be able to download just 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:43.459
 after from this second video 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.870
 so help videos just where I 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.190
 think you're going to see paint I 'm going 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.510
 explain to you all that I tell you 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.530
 no more everything is in the second video 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.530
 See you soon
