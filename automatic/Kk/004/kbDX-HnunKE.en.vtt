you<00:00:18.480> can<00:00:18.660> see<00:00:18.869> here<00:00:19.170> I've<00:00:19.320> masked<00:00:19.619> off<00:00:19.859> the

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
you can see here I've masked off the

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.460 
you can see here I've masked off the
background<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.000> mural<00:00:21.390> with<00:00:21.630> application

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
background of the mural with application

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.740 
background of the mural with application
tape<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.010> I've<00:00:23.100> sketched<00:00:23.519> on<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.330> design

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
tape and I've sketched on the design

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.769 
tape and I've sketched on the design
using<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.289> chalk<00:00:25.590> pencil<00:00:26.390> you<00:00:27.390> can<00:00:27.510> get<00:00:27.660> these

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
using a chalk pencil you can get these

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.750 
using a chalk pencil you can get these
from<00:00:27.990> an<00:00:28.170> art<00:00:28.320> shop<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.949> sketch<00:00:29.310> as<00:00:29.490> much

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
from an art shop so sketch as much

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.930 
from an art shop so sketch as much
detail<00:00:30.269> as<00:00:30.449> possible<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:31.619> next<00:00:31.980> step<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.489> to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
detail as possible the next step is to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.120 
detail as possible the next step is to
get<00:00:33.090> white<00:00:33.510> i<00:00:33.809> thin<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.320> down<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.920> base

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
get white i thin it down it's a base

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.420 
get white i thin it down it's a base
coat<00:00:35.430> white<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.540> render<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.350> entire<00:00:37.500> mural

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
coat white and I render the entire mural

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.750 
coat white and I render the entire mural
so<00:00:38.879> using<00:00:39.510> basically<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.290> one<00:00:40.559> tone<00:00:40.950> to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
so using basically that one tone to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.360 
so using basically that one tone to
create<00:00:42.120> all<00:00:42.329> my<00:00:42.360> shapes<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.110> shadows<00:00:43.340> then<00:00:44.340> I

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
create all my shapes and shadows then I

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.000 
create all my shapes and shadows then I
mixed<00:00:44.789> up<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.270> yellow<00:00:45.840> for<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.350> eyes<00:00:46.530> which

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
mixed up the yellow for the eyes which

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.270 
mixed up the yellow for the eyes which
is<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.460> actual<00:00:47.850> cacio<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:50.039> freehand

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
is the actual cacio and I just freehand

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.610 
is the actual cacio and I just freehand
about<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.000> not<00:00:51.329> worrying<00:00:51.750> too<00:00:51.780> much<00:00:51.960> about<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
about in not worrying too much about the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.470 
about in not worrying too much about the
overspray<00:00:53.399> because<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:53.940> come<00:00:54.120> back<00:00:54.270> and

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
overspray because I can come back and

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.799 
overspray because I can come back and
clean<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:54.989> later<00:00:55.969> you<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.120> see<00:00:57.329> now<00:00:57.570> I've

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
clean that up later you can see now I've

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.380 
clean that up later you can see now I've
used<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.320> thinned<00:00:58.649> out<00:00:58.890> black<00:00:59.280> I'm<00:01:00.210> actually

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
used a thinned out black I'm actually

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.830 
used a thinned out black I'm actually
using<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:01.109> PPG<00:01:01.579> 740<00:01:02.579> which<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> brownie<00:01:03.390> sort

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
using a PPG 740 which is a brownie sort

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.990 
using a PPG 740 which is a brownie sort
of<00:01:03.930> black<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.890> I'm<00:01:04.979> using<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.970> create

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
of black and I'm using that to create

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.219 
of black and I'm using that to create
all<00:01:06.510> my<00:01:06.540> detail<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.979> shaping<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.119> beak<00:01:09.420> all

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
all my detail so shaping the beak all

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.740 
all my detail so shaping the beak all
the<00:01:10.470> feathers<00:01:10.950> basically<00:01:11.850> using<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the feathers basically using the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.719 
the feathers basically using the
textures<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.530> feathers<00:01:14.040> as<00:01:14.250> best<00:01:14.490> as<00:01:14.640> I

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
textures of the feathers as best as I

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.420 
textures of the feathers as best as I
can<00:01:14.970> free<00:01:15.299> hand<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:16.500> layering<00:01:16.860> up<00:01:17.220> on

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
can free hand and just layering up on

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.730 
can free hand and just layering up on
that<00:01:17.670> I've<00:01:18.150> switched<00:01:18.450> back<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.780> white<00:01:19.140> now<00:01:19.439> and

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
that I've switched back to white now and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.499 
that I've switched back to white now and
I've<00:01:19.830> done<00:01:20.040> my<00:01:20.189> highlights<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:20.939> top<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.360> all

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
I've done my highlights on top of all

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.530 
I've done my highlights on top of all
that<00:01:21.540> area<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:23.009> then<00:01:23.280> we'll<00:01:23.460> basically<00:01:24.270> come

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that area and then we'll basically come

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.810 
that area and then we'll basically come
back<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.080> clean<00:01:25.350> all<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.530> up<00:01:25.710> again<00:01:26.159> now

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
back in and clean all that up again now

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.580 
back in and clean all that up again now
you<00:01:26.880> can<00:01:27.150> see<00:01:27.330> there's<00:01:27.570> more<00:01:27.780> layering<00:01:28.110> that's

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
you can see there's more layering that's

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.530 
you can see there's more layering that's
happening<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.520> white<00:01:29.759> highlights<00:01:30.299> are<00:01:30.509> on

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
happening the white highlights are on

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.240 
happening the white highlights are on
there<00:01:30.930> however<00:01:31.350> I've<00:01:31.590> brought<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.040> black

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
there however I've brought the black

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.910 
there however I've brought the black
back<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.729> over<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> top<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.659> always<00:01:34.229> usually<00:01:34.530> do

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
back in over the top I always usually do

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.550 
back in over the top I always usually do
that<00:01:35.189> before<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.820> final<00:01:36.240> tone<00:01:36.509> just<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.170> crisp

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
that before the final tone just to crisp

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.859 
that before the final tone just to crisp
it<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:37.890> all<00:01:38.100> my<00:01:38.340> white<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.450> get<00:01:39.659> rid<00:01:39.689> of

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
it up all my white so that I get rid of

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.260 
it up all my white so that I get rid of
any<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.290> nasty<00:01:40.710> overspray<00:01:41.220> here<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.090> can

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
any of the nasty overspray here you can

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.389 
any of the nasty overspray here you can
see<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.630> finished<00:01:42.990> mural<00:01:43.409> all<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.890> details

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
see the finished mural all the details

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.580 
see the finished mural all the details
under<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.820> eyes<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.630> light<00:01:45.930> highlight<00:01:46.439> on

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
under the eyes the light highlight on

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.219 
under the eyes the light highlight on
the<00:01:46.710> eyes<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.509> basically<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.079> other

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the eyes and basically this is the other

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.670 
the eyes and basically this is the other
side<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.820> then<00:01:51.149> once<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.689> unmask<00:01:52.320> it

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
side so and then once you unmask it

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.130 
side so and then once you unmask it
because<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> charcoal<00:01:53.880> base<00:01:54.180> unmasked

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
because it's on a charcoal base unmasked

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.719 
because it's on a charcoal base unmasked
up<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.439> particular<00:01:55.829> design<00:01:56.399> because

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
up this particular design because

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.190 
up this particular design because
otherwise<00:01:57.000> you're<00:01:57.270> overspray<00:01:57.840> would<00:01:58.049> be

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
otherwise you're overspray would be

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.590 
otherwise you're overspray would be
terrible<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.460> can<00:01:59.610> see<00:01:59.790> how<00:01:59.969> crisp<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.450> is

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
terrible so you can see how crisp it is

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.800 
terrible so you can see how crisp it is
that<00:02:01.229> bottom<00:02:01.740> mask<00:02:02.040> edge<00:02:02.430> where<00:02:03.299> I'd<00:02:03.450> killed

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
that bottom mask edge where I'd killed

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.690 
that bottom mask edge where I'd killed
the<00:02:03.990> application<00:02:04.710> tape<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.310> can<00:02:05.430> basically

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
the application tape you can basically

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.719 
the application tape you can basically
come<00:02:06.299> back<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.750> fix<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.200> up<00:02:07.380> later<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:08.039> even

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
come back and fix that up later so even
