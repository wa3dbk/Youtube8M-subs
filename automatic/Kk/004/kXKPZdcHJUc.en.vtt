infrareds quart lamps six of them in
this<00:01:42.119> machine<00:01:42.329> okay<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.590> warms<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.159> air

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
this machine okay so it warms the air

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.270 
this machine okay so it warms the air
and<00:01:44.579> then<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.880> air<00:01:45.060> comes<00:01:45.390> out<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.899> front<00:01:46.280> st.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
and then the air comes out the front st.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.609 
and then the air comes out the front st.
it<00:01:47.520> from<00:01:47.729> Deer<00:01:47.970> foam<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.930> think<00:01:49.439> I'm

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
it from Deer foam so I do think I'm

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.160
