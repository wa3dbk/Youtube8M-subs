I figured I'll be learning how to
develop<00:00:38.690> apps<00:00:39.110> for<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:39.559> iPhone<00:00:40.280> and<00:00:40.460> all<00:00:40.579> but

valenta<00:01:20.240> lot<00:01:20.360> um<00:01:20.810> ok<00:01:21.380> I've<00:01:21.710> always<00:01:21.950> had<00:01:22.159> an

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
valenta lot um ok I've always had an

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.800 
valenta lot um ok I've always had an
interest<00:01:22.429> for<00:01:22.850> computer<00:01:23.330> and<00:01:23.360> things<00:01:23.659> like

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
interest for computer and things like

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.080 
interest for computer and things like
that<00:01:23.869> when<00:01:24.170> I<00:01:24.200> was<00:01:24.440> growing<00:01:24.710> up<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.280> I<00:01:25.580> just

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
that when I was growing up so I just

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.820 
that when I was growing up so I just
figured<00:01:26.240> I<00:01:26.390> might<00:01:26.600> as<00:01:26.659> well<00:01:26.750> just<00:01:27.050> do<00:01:27.380> a<00:01:27.409> degree

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
figured I might as well just do a degree

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.649 
figured I might as well just do a degree
in<00:01:27.890> that<00:01:28.159> so<00:01:28.789> I<00:01:28.819> did<00:01:29.000> my<00:01:29.119> first<00:01:29.300> degree<00:01:29.600> in

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
in that so I did my first degree in

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.389 
in that so I did my first degree in
mathematics<00:01:29.929> and<00:01:30.590> I<00:01:30.679> came<00:01:30.890> here<00:01:31.009> to<00:01:31.159> do<00:01:31.280> my

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
mathematics and I came here to do my

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.609 
mathematics and I came here to do my
masters<00:01:31.850> in<00:01:31.880> computing<00:01:32.360> science<00:01:32.899> and<00:01:33.110> that's

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
masters in computing science and that's

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.249 
masters in computing science and that's
where<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.250> interest<00:01:34.670> really<00:01:34.820> grew<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.600> from

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
where the interest really grew and from

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.020 
where the interest really grew and from
there<00:01:36.470> I've<00:01:36.590> just<00:01:36.799> been<00:01:36.979> taking<00:01:37.759> it<00:01:37.820> one<00:01:38.000> step

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
there I've just been taking it one step

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.670 
there I've just been taking it one step
at<00:01:38.420> a<00:01:38.509> time<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:38.960> learn<00:01:39.049> as<00:01:39.229> much<00:01:39.380> as<00:01:39.439> I<00:01:39.619> can

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
at a time to learn as much as I can

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.660 
at a time to learn as much as I can
before<00:01:40.009> I<00:01:40.189> go<00:01:40.340> back<00:01:42.070> ok<00:01:43.070> I've<00:01:43.220> got<00:01:43.250> like

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
before I go back ok I've got like

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.810 
before I go back ok I've got like
brothers<00:01:44.240> roll<00:01:44.540> into<00:01:44.990> IT<00:01:45.170> so<00:01:45.829> I<00:01:45.860> guess<00:01:46.340> its

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
brothers roll into IT so I guess its

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.520 
brothers roll into IT so I guess its
wing<00:01:47.000> up<00:01:47.119> elder<00:01:47.509> brother<00:01:47.780> things<00:01:48.140> that<00:01:48.350> just

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
women to get more involved in technology

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.480

that's<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.540> plan<00:02:43.780> that's<00:02:44.430> really<00:02:45.430> think<00:02:45.790> it

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
that's the plan that's really think it

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.690 
that's the plan that's really think it
is<00:02:46.150> i<00:02:46.360> just<00:02:46.390> think<00:02:47.130> mostly<00:02:48.130> males<00:02:48.519> don't

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
is i just think mostly males don't

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.370 
is i just think mostly males don't
really<00:02:48.970> come<00:02:49.209> out<00:02:49.239> as<00:02:49.569> much<00:02:49.750> as<00:02:49.810> they<00:02:49.959> shoot

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
really come out as much as they shoot

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.020 
really come out as much as they shoot
for<00:02:50.590> some<00:02:50.769> strange<00:02:51.160> reason<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.579> don't<00:02:51.640> know<00:02:51.910> why

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
for some strange reason I don't know why

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.660 
for some strange reason I don't know why
but<00:02:52.959> Charles<00:02:53.860> are<00:02:53.980> still<00:02:54.190> saying<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.640> that

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
but Charles are still saying it that

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.300 
but Charles are still saying it that
there<00:02:55.030> are<00:02:55.209> phenyl<00:02:55.690> developers<00:02:56.200> who<00:02:56.590> who<00:02:57.130> do

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
there are phenyl developers who who do

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.120 
there are phenyl developers who who do
apps<00:02:57.519> for<00:02:57.849> work<00:02:58.360> for<00:02:58.750> iphone<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.650> stuff<00:02:59.890> so

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
apps for work for iphone and stuff so

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.069 
apps for work for iphone and stuff so
they<00:03:00.310> are<00:03:00.430> there<00:03:00.760> but<00:03:01.329> they're<00:03:01.510> just<00:03:01.750> not<00:03:01.900> that

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
they are there but they're just not that

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.440 
they are there but they're just not that
many<00:03:02.349> so<00:03:03.250> hopefully<00:03:03.549> what<00:03:03.940> time<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.329> is

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
many so hopefully what time it is

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.030 
many so hopefully what time it is
something<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:04.900> will<00:03:05.170> grow<00:03:05.380> because<00:03:05.709> really

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
something that will grow because really

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.180 
something that will grow because really
the<00:03:06.340> apps<00:03:06.519> is<00:03:06.760> just<00:03:07.110> starting<00:03:08.110> as<00:03:08.230> well<00:03:08.500> so

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
the apps is just starting as well so

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.949 
the apps is just starting as well so
give<00:03:09.519> it<00:03:09.549> time<00:03:09.849> and<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.150> guess<00:03:10.329> more<00:03:10.569> female

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
give it time and I guess more female

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.259 
give it time and I guess more female
people<00:03:11.170> will<00:03:11.410> definitely<00:03:11.890> come<00:03:12.099> around<00:03:12.370> so

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
people will definitely come around so

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.210 
people will definitely come around so

hopefully and with things like this as

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.750 
hopefully and with things like this as
well<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:16.120> will<00:03:16.180> help<00:03:16.480> um<00:03:17.260> I<00:03:18.250> don't<00:03:18.489> know

of a development background they start
playing<00:05:14.610> with<00:05:14.820> the<00:05:14.880> code<00:05:15.150> and<00:05:15.300> they<00:05:15.390> get<00:05:15.540> their

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
playing with the code and they get their

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.630 
playing with the code and they get their
applications<00:05:16.230> on<00:05:16.380> the<00:05:16.500> screen<00:05:16.800> playing<00:05:17.520> with

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
it on their own i phone you know you

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:20.660 
it on their own i phone you know you
know<00:05:19.830> i<00:05:19.860> think<00:05:19.920> a<00:05:20.130> lot<00:05:20.160> of<00:05:20.280> them<00:05:20.430> would<00:05:20.550> just

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
know i think a lot of them would just

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.130 
know i think a lot of them would just
actually<00:05:20.760> start<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.180> see<00:05:21.360> this<00:05:21.480> is<00:05:21.660> a<00:05:21.900> pretty

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
actually start to see this is a pretty

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.930 
actually start to see this is a pretty
good<00:05:22.350> fun<00:05:22.560> and<00:05:22.800> you<00:05:23.430> know<00:05:23.460> that<00:05:24.320> it<00:05:25.320> does<00:05:25.530> use<00:05:25.740> a

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
good fun and you know that it does use a

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.280 
good fun and you know that it does use a
kind<00:05:26.940> of<00:05:27.000> like<00:05:27.150> niche<00:05:27.360> technologies<00:05:28.080> if<00:05:28.230> you

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
kind of like niche technologies if you

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.740 
kind of like niche technologies if you
like<00:05:28.950> so<00:05:29.760> a<00:05:29.790> lot<00:05:29.970> of<00:05:30.030> developers<00:05:30.420> we<00:05:30.570> getting
