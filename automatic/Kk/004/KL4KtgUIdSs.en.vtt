so<00:00:00.630> approximately<00:00:01.290> two<00:00:01.709> weeks<00:00:01.920> ago<00:00:02.190> these

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
so approximately two weeks ago these

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.349 
so approximately two weeks ago these
vines<00:00:03.000> were<00:00:03.330> cut<00:00:04.259> off<00:00:04.609> they<00:00:05.609> literally<00:00:05.970> cut

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
vines were cut off they literally cut

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.620 
vines were cut off they literally cut
off<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.810> tops<00:00:07.259> of<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.589> vines<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.630> disposed

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
off the tops of the vines and disposed

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.020 
off the tops of the vines and disposed
of<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.019> cord<00:00:10.290> ons<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.010> wood<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.700> and

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
of the cord ons and the wood and the and

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.499 
of the cord ons and the wood and the and
the<00:00:12.330> trimmings<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.320> everything<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.580> they

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
the trimmings and everything and they

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.720 
the trimmings and everything and they
basically<00:00:15.750> let<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.320> vine<00:00:16.650> just<00:00:16.680> kind<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.369> sit

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
basically let the vine just kind of sit

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.340 
basically let the vine just kind of sit
there<00:00:17.760> for<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.119> little<00:00:18.359> bit<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.779> as<00:00:19.970> the

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
there for a little bit and as the

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.070 
there for a little bit and as the
timeframe<00:00:22.350> goes<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:24.150> bark<00:00:24.539> starts<00:00:24.960> to

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
timeframe goes on the bark starts to

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.349 
timeframe goes on the bark starts to
slip<00:00:25.350> at<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.710> cambium<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.460> cambium<00:00:26.820> layer<00:00:27.090> it

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
slip at the cambium the cambium layer it

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.070 
slip at the cambium the cambium layer it
becomes<00:00:27.720> very<00:00:28.039> is<00:00:29.300> where<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.449> want<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.750> put<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
becomes very is where we want to put the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.440 
becomes very is where we want to put the
grout<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.710> it's<00:00:32.279> basically<00:00:32.820> just<00:00:33.000> putting<00:00:33.270> a

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
grout and it's basically just putting a

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.040 
grout and it's basically just putting a
bud<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:34.280> top<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.730> cambium<00:00:36.329> layers<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
bud on top of the cambium layers to the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.229 
bud on top of the cambium layers to the
cambian<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> new<00:00:38.040> bud<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.090> adhere

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
cambian and the new bud have to adhere

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.260 
cambian and the new bud have to adhere
to<00:00:39.540> each<00:00:39.719> other<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.379> callus<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.160> that's<00:00:41.940> where

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
to each other in callus and that's where

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.920 
to each other in callus and that's where
I'll<00:00:42.420> start

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
I'll start

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.869 
I'll start
we<00:00:43.260> know<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.620> spine<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.100> still<00:00:44.280> obviously

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
we know that spine is still obviously

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.430 
we know that spine is still obviously
alive<00:00:45.270> even<00:00:45.570> though<00:00:45.719> there's<00:00:45.989> no<00:00:46.110> fruit<00:00:46.379> no

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
alive even though there's no fruit no

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.250 
alive even though there's no fruit no
big<00:00:46.950> canopy<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.760> but<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.539> gives<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.930> chance

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
big canopy on it but that gives a chance

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.540 
big canopy on it but that gives a chance
for<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:50.629> to<00:00:51.629> heal<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.410> callus<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.190> to

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
for this to to heal to callus and to

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.729 
for this to to heal to callus and to
start<00:00:53.789> growing<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:55.050> these<00:00:55.230> were<00:00:55.440> probably

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
start growing so these were probably

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.040 
start growing so these were probably
just<00:00:55.920> grafted<00:00:56.610> within<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.090> last<00:00:57.270> week<00:00:57.690> and

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
just grafted within the last week and

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.290 
just grafted within the last week and
therefore<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:58.980> don't<00:00:59.160> see<00:00:59.399> any<00:00:59.609> green<00:01:00.000> growth

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
therefore we don't see any green growth

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.029 
therefore we don't see any green growth
yet<00:01:00.629> coming<00:01:00.989> out<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.469> little<00:01:01.739> window

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
yet coming out of that little window

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.640 
yet coming out of that little window
between<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.030> tape<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.510> generally<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> butter

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
between the tape and generally a butter

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.410 
between the tape and generally a butter
we'll<00:01:04.920> put<00:01:05.159> two<00:01:05.339> buds<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.880> kind<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.299> an

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
we'll put two buds on kind of an

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.859 
we'll put two buds on kind of an
insurance<00:01:06.930> policy<00:01:07.909> in<00:01:08.909> case<00:01:08.939> one<00:01:09.390> doesn't

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
insurance policy in case one doesn't

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.539 
insurance policy in case one doesn't
make<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.200> there's<00:01:10.409> always<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.890> second<00:01:11.250> chance

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
make it there's always the second chance

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.300 
make it there's always the second chance
for<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.450> second<00:01:12.810> one<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.049> come<00:01:13.229> through

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
for the the second one to come through

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.550 
for the the second one to come through
it<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> skill<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.479> not<00:01:15.720> just<00:01:15.990> anybody<00:01:16.409> can

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
it is a skill it's not just anybody can

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.550 
it is a skill it's not just anybody can
go<00:01:16.680> out<00:01:16.799> there<00:01:17.009> with<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> sharp<00:01:17.580> knife<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.560> just

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
go out there with a sharp knife and just

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.850 
go out there with a sharp knife and just
put<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> bud<00:01:20.250> under<00:01:20.580> there<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.180> call<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.229> good

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
put a bud under there and call it good

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.780 
put a bud under there and call it good
so<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:24.150> skilled<00:01:24.780> operator<00:01:25.080> with<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> good<00:01:26.400> sharp

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
so a skilled operator with a good sharp

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.580 
so a skilled operator with a good sharp
knife<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.420> mean<00:01:27.600> it'd<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.869> be<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.080> sharp

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
knife I mean it'd have to be a sharp

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.859 
knife I mean it'd have to be a sharp
knife<00:01:28.799> has<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.729> make<00:01:30.000> sure<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.180> bud<00:01:30.659> is

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
knife has to make sure that bud is

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.679 
knife has to make sure that bud is
exactly<00:01:31.470> flat<00:01:31.799> on<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> back<00:01:32.490> side<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.210> that

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
exactly flat on the back side so that

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.140 
exactly flat on the back side so that
the<00:01:34.020> camera<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.680> matching<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.189> cambium<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
the camera is matching the cambium and

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.910 
the camera is matching the cambium and
that's<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.570> key<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:37.079> successful<00:01:37.909> grafting<00:01:39.920> in

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
that's the key to successful grafting in

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.120 
that's the key to successful grafting in
the<00:01:41.790> flaps<00:01:42.689> actually<00:01:43.350> help<00:01:43.530> hold<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.920> bud

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the flaps actually help hold the bud

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.240 
the flaps actually help hold the bud
tight<00:01:44.490> as<00:01:44.670> well<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.750> cambium<00:01:46.740> layer<00:01:46.950> of

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
tight as well to the cambium layer of

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.870 
tight as well to the cambium layer of
the<00:01:48.380> on<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.560> trunk<00:01:49.860> there<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.399> then<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.759> can

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
the on the trunk there and then you can

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.270 
the on the trunk there and then you can
see<00:01:51.030> when<00:01:51.210> he<00:01:51.299> wraps<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.930> he's<00:01:52.100> wrapping<00:01:53.100> very

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
see when he wraps it he's wrapping very

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.490 
see when he wraps it he's wrapping very
tightly<00:01:53.610> try<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.060> minimize<00:01:54.570> all<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> airings

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
tightly try to minimize all the airings

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.679 
tightly try to minimize all the airings
that's<00:01:55.920> going<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.610> be<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:56.880> there<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.180> help<00:01:57.360> keep

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
that's going to be in there to help keep

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.249 
that's going to be in there to help keep
it<00:01:57.840> from<00:01:57.990> drying<00:01:58.170> out<00:01:59.420> he's<00:02:00.420> doing<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.810> chip<00:02:01.079> but

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
it from drying out he's doing a chip but

it from drying out he's doing a chip but
on<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:01.590> one<00:02:01.799> right<00:02:02.009> here<00:02:02.310> versus<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> tea<00:02:03.119> or

on this one right here versus a tea or
an<00:02:04.590> inverted<00:02:04.920> tea<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.640> he<00:02:05.969> has<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> reason<00:02:06.659> for

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
an inverted tea and he has a reason for

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.270 
an inverted tea and he has a reason for
that<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.200> probably<00:02:07.380> feels<00:02:07.740> it's<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.069> better

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
that it probably feels it's a better

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.150 
that it probably feels it's a better
chance<00:02:08.940> for<00:02:09.110> it's<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.319> take<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.890> there<00:02:11.039> and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
chance for it's a take in there and

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.500 
chance for it's a take in there and
that's<00:02:11.220> what<00:02:11.459> he<00:02:11.550> did<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.879> we<00:02:12.030> moved<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.360> little

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
that's what he did is we moved a little

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.710 
that's what he did is we moved a little
piece<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:13.020> wood<00:02:13.230> in<00:02:13.440> the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
piece of wood in the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.440 
piece of wood in the
doing<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:14.020> typical<00:02:15.010> chip<00:02:15.640> like<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.120> would<00:02:16.300> on<00:02:16.330> a

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
doing a typical chip like you would on a

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.070 
doing a typical chip like you would on a
rootstock

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
rootstock

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.810 
rootstock
but<00:02:17.410> again<00:02:17.680> just<00:02:17.710> long<00:02:18.040> as<00:02:18.190> cambium<00:02:18.700> is

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
but again just long as cambium is

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.330 
but again just long as cambium is
matching<00:02:19.240> cambium<00:02:19.750> that's<00:02:19.960> the<00:02:20.170> key<00:02:20.410> so

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
matching cambium that's the key so

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.460 
matching cambium that's the key so
they've<00:02:21.520> already<00:02:21.730> relieved<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.570> hydraulic

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
they've already relieved the hydraulic

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.840 
they've already relieved the hydraulic

would<00:02:31.060> be<00:02:31.120> too<00:02:31.420> much<00:02:31.690> on<00:02:32.080> this<00:02:32.410> open<00:02:32.710> wound<00:02:32.920> now

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
would be too much on this open wound now

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.700 
would be too much on this open wound now
and<00:02:33.280> push<00:02:33.460> up<00:02:33.640> but<00:02:33.850> out<00:02:34.060> theoretically<00:02:34.900> so

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
and push up but out theoretically so

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.700 
and push up but out theoretically so
they<00:02:36.100> come<00:02:36.670> in<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.880> pre-cut<00:02:37.390> these<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:38.560> that's

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
they come in to pre-cut these and that's

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.040 
they come in to pre-cut these and that's
what<00:02:38.920> this<00:02:39.070> bleeding<00:02:39.340> is<00:02:39.610> down<00:02:39.880> in<00:02:40.090> here<00:02:40.390> it's

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
what this bleeding is down in here it's

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.390 
what this bleeding is down in here it's
not<00:02:41.170> going<00:02:41.350> to<00:02:41.410> hurt<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.740> mine<00:02:41.950> it's<00:02:42.130> just<00:02:42.310> a

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
not going to hurt the mine it's just a

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.460 
not going to hurt the mine it's just a
very<00:02:42.610> shallow<00:02:43.080> cut<00:02:44.080> with<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:44.890> saw<00:02:46.110> here's<00:02:47.110> one

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
very shallow cut with a saw here's one

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.590 
very shallow cut with a saw here's one
that's<00:02:47.709> already<00:02:48.160> starting<00:02:48.820> to<00:02:48.850> push<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.300> little

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
that's already starting to push a little

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.690 
that's already starting to push a little
bit<00:02:51.090> again<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.420> put<00:02:53.320> a<00:02:53.380> little<00:02:53.590> nick<00:02:53.890> in<00:02:54.100> here<00:02:54.550> in

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
bit again I put a little nick in here in

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.500 
bit again I put a little nick in here in
the<00:02:54.820> trunk<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.740> relieve<00:02:56.740> some<00:02:57.040> of<00:02:57.190> the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
the trunk to relieve some of the

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.420 
the trunk to relieve some of the
hydraulic<00:02:58.510> pressure<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.440> this<00:03:00.070> one<00:03:00.250> is

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
hydraulic pressure and this one is

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.210 
hydraulic pressure and this one is
actually<00:03:00.760> starting<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.209> grow<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.950> think

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
actually starting to grow and I think

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.590 
actually starting to grow and I think
with<00:03:03.310> all<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.550> warm<00:03:03.790> weather<00:03:04.000> this<00:03:04.420> is

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
with all the warm weather this is

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.990 
with all the warm weather this is
probably<00:03:04.959> an<00:03:05.110> indicator<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:05.890> this<00:03:06.640> is<00:03:06.850> going

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
probably an indicator that this is going

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.670 
probably an indicator that this is going
to<00:03:07.120> take<00:03:07.630> off<00:03:07.810> pretty<00:03:08.050> quick

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
to take off pretty quick

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.680 
to take off pretty quick
and<00:03:09.310> at<00:03:09.550> some<00:03:09.760> point<00:03:09.790> then<00:03:10.240> the<00:03:10.360> crew<00:03:10.570> will

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
and at some point then the crew will

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.150 
and at some point then the crew will
come<00:03:10.840> through<00:03:11.020> and<00:03:11.260> start<00:03:11.500> taking<00:03:11.860> off<00:03:12.010> the

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
come through and start taking off the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.400 
come through and start taking off the
sucker<00:03:12.430> so<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.060> energy<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.840> effort<00:03:13.870> can

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
sucker so the energy and the effort can

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.690 
sucker so the energy and the effort can
go<00:03:14.590> into<00:03:15.240> into<00:03:16.240> that<00:03:16.270> new<00:03:16.630> bud<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:18.160> year<00:03:18.489> of

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
go into into that new bud the year of

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.759 
go into into that new bud the year of
grafting<00:03:19.330> is<00:03:19.510> really<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.019> loss<00:03:20.260> of<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.590> hundred

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
grafting is really the loss of a hundred

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.550 
grafting is really the loss of a hundred
percent<00:03:20.980> crop<00:03:21.550> plus<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.690> conversion<00:03:23.320> and

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
percent crop plus the conversion and

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.509 
percent crop plus the conversion and
then<00:03:24.280> after<00:03:24.640> that<00:03:24.820> it's<00:03:25.830> going<00:03:26.830> forward<00:03:27.370> with

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
then after that it's going forward with

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.370 
then after that it's going forward with
