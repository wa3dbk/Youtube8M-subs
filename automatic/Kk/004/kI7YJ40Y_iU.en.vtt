three games your speed jumping or
strength<00:02:15.849> meters<00:02:16.209> will<00:02:16.390> increase<00:02:16.720> slightly

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
strength meters will increase slightly

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.020

pet evolves and gets a little bigger and
when<00:02:28.360> it<00:02:28.480> does<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.900> levels<00:02:29.260> change<00:02:29.560> slightly

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
when it does the levels change slightly

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.820 
when it does the levels change slightly
and<00:02:30.310> I<00:02:30.549> do<00:02:30.610> mean<00:02:31.090> slightly<00:02:31.750> so<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.200> have<00:02:32.650> to

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.220 
and I do mean slightly so you have to
play<00:02:33.010> these<00:02:33.250> same<00:02:33.640> three<00:02:34.090> games<00:02:34.420> mind<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:35.080> the

broken rock throwing game like 30 or 40

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.640 
broken rock throwing game like 30 or 40
times<00:02:38.260> each<00:02:38.799> it's<00:02:39.280> just<00:02:39.970> painful<00:02:40.569> it's<00:02:40.780> o<00:02:41.200> so

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
times each it's just painful it's o so

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.110 
times each it's just painful it's o so
when<00:02:41.799> you<00:02:41.890> get<00:02:42.040> big<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.280> strong<00:02:42.430> enough<00:02:42.700> you

will fight the crunch line control

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.250 
will fight the crunch line control
thingy<00:02:45.010> now<00:02:45.459> he<00:02:45.519> chooses<00:02:46.120> one<00:02:46.450> random<00:02:46.930> battle

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
thingy now he chooses one random battle

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.440 
thingy now he chooses one random battle
of<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.530> three<00:02:47.769> categories<00:02:47.980> of<00:02:48.430> speed<00:02:48.910> jumping

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
of the three categories of speed jumping

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.180 
of the three categories of speed jumping
or<00:02:49.569> strength<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.410> hours<00:02:50.769> you<00:02:50.920> played

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
or strength so the hours you played

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.130 
or strength so the hours you played
building<00:02:51.609> up<00:02:51.730> those<00:02:51.940> three<00:02:52.269> stats<00:02:52.569> ends<00:02:52.989> in<00:02:53.079> a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
building up those three stats ends in a

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.599 
building up those three stats ends in a
1-minute<00:02:53.620> battle<00:02:53.950> where<00:02:54.099> you<00:02:54.190> don't<00:02:54.400> even

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
1-minute battle where you don't even

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.520 
1-minute battle where you don't even
need<00:02:54.940> two<00:02:55.209> of<00:02:55.359> the<00:02:55.450> stats<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:55.810> build<00:02:56.079> up<00:02:56.260> and

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
need two of the stats you build up and

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.580 
need two of the stats you build up and
that's<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.760> you<00:02:58.329> save<00:02:58.690> Captain<00:02:59.260> Crunch<00:02:59.440> cereal

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
that's it you save Captain Crunch cereal

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.160 
that's it you save Captain Crunch cereal
so<00:03:00.310> so<00:03:00.609> I<00:03:00.640> said<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.090> myself<00:03:01.239> what<00:03:01.840> was<00:03:02.019> the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
so so I said to myself what was the

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.920 
so so I said to myself what was the
point<00:03:02.440> of<00:03:02.620> this<00:03:02.769> so<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.250> look<00:03:03.489> back<00:03:03.700> at<00:03:04.000> 1999

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
point of this so I look back at 1999

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.050 
point of this so I look back at 1999
when<00:03:05.079> this<00:03:05.170> game<00:03:05.379> first<00:03:05.440> came<00:03:05.799> out<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.549> and

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
when this game first came out and and

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.860 
when this game first came out and and
you<00:03:07.090> probably<00:03:07.299> would<00:03:07.510> have<00:03:07.540> had<00:03:07.629> some

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
you probably would have had some

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.960 
you probably would have had some
five-year-old<00:03:08.739> kid<00:03:08.950> playing<00:03:09.250> this<00:03:09.430> so<00:03:09.790> look

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
five-year-old kid playing this so look

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.390 
five-year-old kid playing this so look
at<00:03:10.060> this<00:03:10.209> install<00:03:10.870> American<00:03:11.470> online<00:03:11.769> thing

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
at this install American online thing

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.400 
at this install American online thing
it's<00:03:12.910> right<00:03:13.359> in<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.599> menu<00:03:13.900> where<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.170> kid<00:03:14.379> is

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
it's right in the menu where the kid is

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.379 
it's right in the menu where the kid is
playing<00:03:14.829> so<00:03:15.099> I<00:03:15.129> think<00:03:15.250> it's<00:03:15.489> fair<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:15.940> say<00:03:16.060> some

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389
