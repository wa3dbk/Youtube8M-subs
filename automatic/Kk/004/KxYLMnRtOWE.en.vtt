00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
color is black and that means I can

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.549 
color is black and that means I can
paint<00:01:01.649> away<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.579> filtering<00:01:03.120> if<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.840> which

in the first place and we're not

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.130

other filters that Photoshop offers what

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.440 
other filters that Photoshop offers what
we're<00:02:16.380> really<00:02:16.500> doing<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.040> using<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.820> power<00:02:18.030> of

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
we're really doing is using the power of

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.620 
we're really doing is using the power of
those<00:02:18.750> filters<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.980> sharpen<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.820> image<00:02:21.150> so

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
those filters to sharpen the image so

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.910 
those filters to sharpen the image so
part<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:21.870> what's<00:02:22.080> going<00:02:22.200> on<00:02:22.470> under<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.890> hood

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.040 
part of what's going on under the hood
here<00:02:23.370> is<00:02:23.700> Photoshop<00:02:24.300> is<00:02:24.480> creating<00:02:24.900> those

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
here is Photoshop is creating those

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.190 
here is Photoshop is creating those
halos<00:02:25.500> by<00:02:26.340> blurring<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.240> image<00:02:27.570> and<00:02:27.780> it's

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
halos by blurring the image and it's

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.950 
halos by blurring the image and it's
doing<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:28.560> using<00:02:29.160> Gaussian<00:02:29.640> blur<00:02:29.850> we<00:02:30.600> could<00:02:30.810> be

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
doing so using Gaussian blur we could be

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.600 
doing so using Gaussian blur we could be
creating<00:02:31.110> those<00:02:31.470> halos<00:02:31.830> using<00:02:32.220> lens<00:02:32.430> blur

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
creating those halos using lens blur

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.880 
creating those halos using lens blur
instead<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.470> turns<00:02:34.470> out<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.680> be<00:02:34.860> a

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
instead and that turns out to be a

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.500 
instead and that turns out to be a
better<00:02:35.100> idea<00:02:35.640> when<00:02:35.910> you're<00:02:36.090> working

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
better idea when you're working

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.360 
better idea when you're working
specifically<00:02:37.200> with<00:02:37.320> digital<00:02:37.830> photographs

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370

specifically with digital photographs
Gaussian<00:02:39.090> blur<00:02:39.240> often<00:02:39.660> works<00:02:39.810> better<00:02:39.990> for

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
Gaussian blur often works better for

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.590 
Gaussian blur often works better for
scanned<00:02:40.560> photographs<00:02:41.130> or<00:02:41.370> artwork<00:02:42.270> that<00:02:42.480> has

digital<00:02:46.650> photo<00:02:47.070> it's<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.670> way<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:47.850> go<00:02:48.120> and

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
digital photo it's the way to go and

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.570 
digital photo it's the way to go and
notice<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.590> our<00:02:49.650> halos<00:02:50.310> are<00:02:50.459> gonna

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
notice that our halos are gonna

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.910 
notice that our halos are gonna
immediately<00:02:51.300> settle<00:02:51.720> down<00:02:51.959> did<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.560> see<00:02:52.739> how

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
immediately settle down did you see how

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.260 
immediately settle down did you see how
they<00:02:53.070> dissipated<00:02:53.550> a<00:02:53.730> little<00:02:53.910> bit<00:02:54.060> there

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
they dissipated a little bit there

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.570 
they dissipated a little bit there
they're<00:02:54.840> still<00:02:55.170> pretty<00:02:55.440> harsh<00:02:55.830> over<00:02:56.220> here<00:02:56.459> in

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
they're still pretty harsh over here in

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.580 
they're still pretty harsh over here in
the<00:02:56.670> feelers<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:57.690> let's<00:02:57.930> go<00:02:58.080> ahead<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.470> take

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
the feelers so let's go ahead and take

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.550 
the feelers so let's go ahead and take
that<00:02:58.620> radius<00:02:59.130> value<00:02:59.430> down<00:02:59.730> to<00:03:00.420> about<00:03:00.750> twice<00:03:01.230> as

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
that radius value down to about twice as

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.890 
that radius value down to about twice as
much<00:03:01.800> as<00:03:01.860> we<00:03:02.310> would<00:03:02.580> have<00:03:02.730> used<00:03:03.060> with<00:03:03.570> Gaussian

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
much as we would have used with Gaussian

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.590 
much as we would have used with Gaussian
blur<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:05.100> may<00:03:05.310> recall<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:05.790> was<00:03:05.970> 1.5

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.479 
blur and you may recall that was 1.5
pixels<00:03:07.080> so<00:03:07.290> I'm<00:03:07.380> gonna<00:03:07.560> take<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.950> radius<00:03:08.220> down

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
pixels so I'm gonna take the radius down

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.300 
pixels so I'm gonna take the radius down
to<00:03:08.880> 3<00:03:09.239> pixels<00:03:09.510> this<00:03:09.989> time<00:03:10.230> around<00:03:10.500> if<00:03:11.100> you're

that<00:03:13.320> could<00:03:13.530> be<00:03:13.620> useful<00:03:13.770> for<00:03:14.010> compensating

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
that could be useful for compensating

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.640 
that could be useful for compensating
