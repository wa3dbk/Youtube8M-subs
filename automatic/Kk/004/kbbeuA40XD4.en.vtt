00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.869 

I<00:00:00.089> think<00:00:00.599> in<00:00:00.989> the<00:00:01.079> first<00:00:01.319> round<00:00:01.560> on<00:00:01.890> us<00:00:02.550> in<00:00:02.790> the

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
I think in the first round on us in the

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.200 
I think in the first round on us in the
second<00:00:03.210> round<00:00:03.300> will<00:00:03.570> be<00:00:03.689> learned<00:00:03.870> is<00:00:05.089> doing<00:00:06.089> in

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
second round will be learned is doing in

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.430 
second round will be learned is doing in
pressure<00:00:06.450> situations<00:00:06.660> when<00:00:07.200> you're<00:00:07.230> faced

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
pressure situations when you're faced

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.879 
pressure situations when you're faced
with<00:00:07.470> my<00:00:07.680> adversity<00:00:07.980> mentioned<00:00:08.639> better<00:00:08.790> 10

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
with my adversity mentioned better 10

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.259 
with my adversity mentioned better 10
Houston<00:00:10.889> forced<00:00:11.219> us<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.370> get<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.090> another

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
Houston forced us to get to another

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.959 
Houston forced us to get to another
level<00:00:12.389> offensively<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.580> think<00:00:14.580> because<00:00:14.700> of

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
level offensively I think because of

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.650 
level offensively I think because of
that<00:00:15.120> we<00:00:15.839> see<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.199> capable<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.680> doing<00:00:17.660> now

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
that we see the capable of doing now

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.779 
that we see the capable of doing now
it's<00:00:18.900> time<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.170> go<00:00:19.320> from<00:00:19.560> maintain<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.609> level

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
it's time to go from maintain that level

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.609 
it's time to go from maintain that level
we<00:00:21.300> can<00:00:21.480> try<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.689> go<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.050> higher<00:00:22.260> level

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619
