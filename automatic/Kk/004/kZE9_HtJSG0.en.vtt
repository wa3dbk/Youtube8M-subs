00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.840
 jazz 

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.840
 so we will continue 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.480
 we will play in 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.830
 ban 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.830
 turns on is 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.600
 You're not tired 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.600
 on one of the columns 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.789
 medium and color 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.339
 can play 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.860
 the third column and black color is she 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:31.060
 logical 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.390
 all completely 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.390
 so 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.130
 bets 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.520
 so rate is generally bet 22 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.240
 dropped black from that zone which was 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.860
 is inserted 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.130
 we put in 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.760
 2 dollars 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.760
 will turn out 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.600
 there were 135 left 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.420
 give it to chambers 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.500
 in black 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.580
 title 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.580
 we chose one more 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.909
 dropped red bet was 2 dollars 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.350
 advantageously made water 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.610
 totals on 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.580
 but not less 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.810
 repeat push 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.320
 dropped out and red 5 zone and red and our 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.800
 column 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.800
 we won 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:40.049
 we won and Reds 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.049
 or 3 dollars for 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.120
 well here 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.920
 that is, two and 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.890
 rate was 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.690
 3 dollars 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.690
 repeat our installer 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.479
 and 55 dollars that is a net 3 dollars 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.790
 mummy 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.240
 we won three dollars 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.240
 delivery 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.920
 they have become a point 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.740
 still we won 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.190
 i clean 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.190
 Vasiliy 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.709
 the exhibition just collected a bid 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.060
 if it falls 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.630
 the black 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.020
 and not in zone 6 of our bet 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.840
 that is, if we bet on the average 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.030
 black with 1 of 3 columns 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.650
 we lost 2 dollars 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.360
 but is this some 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.360
 well we doubled became 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.180
 from 4 dollars 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.480
 played this bet on 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.489
 it means he is just repeating 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.489
 similarly just repeat 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.520
 here we won 6 dollars ie we 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.120
 would put 2 1 rate 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.769
 and 4 by 2 bets 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.769
 you played yourself 6 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:14.040
 so we bet again 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.040
 back to the dollar rate or 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.440
 the pain fell black is not in our zone 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.450
 rates we 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.490
 fight 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.880
 14 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.980
 we won 10 dollars minus 6 dollars 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.950
 which we spent on the pub looms in 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:35.080
 we ended up winning 4 to 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.150
 what are the advantages of this system 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.870
 now he will say a few words 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.930
 the system covers over 70 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.819
 don't remember exactly 71 72 percent of the tables 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.390
 but 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.620
 win 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.490
 great why because the stakes where 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.980
 intersects 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.440
 simple 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:02.810
 the rates where it intersects is red 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:06.020
 this is a win fuck red and on the column 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.819
 and black in this column is a win by 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.819
 Essentially only column 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:20.290
 all red are covered 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:26.890
 and only once two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:31.020
 figures it is sales but here and the term of course 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.020
 great but there is another nuance 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.950
 we are after a losing bet we are under 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:41.919
 letter to lunge any 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:45.849
 any number of our tables 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.840
 brings us double 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:49.190
 increase 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.670
 so 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.600
 we did for i 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.690
 dollar rates this 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.420
 sure about this system so everyone in 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:04.310
 this casino grand royal three sevens 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:06.160
 you can bet from 1 cent 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.940
 can make 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.580
 not standing there was a hundred thirty four 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.250
 five dollars you can wear you say 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.990
 say 10 dollars and bet from 1 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.700
 cent 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.700
 what are the advantages of this casino 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:27.940
 in that you can 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.689
 do skip moves ie play 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.920
 this is french roulette 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:34.770
 play no bet 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:38.600
 here we make our bets 14 and if we 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:40.610
 bet we would have had 3 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.539
 dollar 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.670
 but it is not so important and of course 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.660
 the benefits of this 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.910
 cosines 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.460
 the fact that the top bracket rates 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.990
 no, you can do it like this 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.900
 infinity 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:00.160
 how much to grow then your deposit 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.670
 other casinos are at least under 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.550
 go up 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.860
 you dollar a maximum of 10 cents to 5 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.939
 dollars 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:13.000
 accordingly if you double 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:14.980
 double doubles 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.689
 there are 5 dollars 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:21.390
 itâ€™s already just 2 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:22.390
 and correspondingly 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.139
 it will be you 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:28.110
 there is no more top bar here 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:31.370
 fight 2 and water and digest and end 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:34.530
 ends there is that number because 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:37.379
 so now I have a few more rules 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:41.280
 as for as as he did not say 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:42.550
 you have to win and earn money 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.240
 there we are 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:48.070
 literally a few minutes played and 135 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.350
 us dollars 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:56.220
 already one hundred fifty one dollar is 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.220
 how many is there 14 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:02.600
 16 dollars 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.409
 16 dollars we have already chosen it 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.009
 by percent 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:06.009
 more from 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.550
 On this 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.639
 and stop the spawn go out and go 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.639
 here 

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:18.260
 half an hour and evening now 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.620
 I do not recommend you to play 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.010
 weight without groaning because it's 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.539
 lures and 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:27.380
 casino 

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:30.440
 you will remain so to speak 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.150
 first few minutes 10 15 20 half an hour 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.090
 you will win 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.940
 then 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:38.510
 progress about and 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:40.760
 so i recommend 10 15 20 minutes 

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:43.540
 played won ten percent off 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.540
 deposits 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.480
 and go say so you can through you 

00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:50.310
 in half an hour you can in an hour 

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.870
 if fashion wins normally 

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.740
 study of 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:56.580
 Thanks for attention 

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.580
 look us further
