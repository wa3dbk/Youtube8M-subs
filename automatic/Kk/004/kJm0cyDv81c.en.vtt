00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.480
 m 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.429
 m 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.359
 well hello to one and all and 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:32.129

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.620
 are doing great and today we are 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.940
 found for the first test on gta 5 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.710
 then no it's not my crutches 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.180
 comments simply because he is 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.980
 sick but she should rather 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.260
 disgusting so it's me who their 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.290
 place a gta 5 and what is gta 5 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.839
 already beats it's a big project he's 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.360
 developed are four years old it's not bad 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.960
 of years and a whole project is worth 200 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.559
 millions of euros 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.689
 if the trucks sacred soap so this test 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.280
 will be done in three parts so I have 

00:00:57.689 --> 00:01:02.449
 started there for the first part 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.449
 that and ethical 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.250
 so we will start with the are not 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.130
 already to predict that meaning there are 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.500
 super hit is very good singer and 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.450
 especially it's very recent hits so 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.330
 there is dr dre at all easter of 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.060
 kendrick lamar brianna from britney spears 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.619
 and many other dubbing levels 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.630
 characters well the translation 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.830
 French English and very well very 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.810
 well done compared to the old gt1 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.340
 the graphics be it on xbox and 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.690
 playstation 3 I find they are 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.090
 exactly the same, that is to say that it is 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.530
 very very nice graphics and compared 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.990
 the usual livebox does not win in 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.610
 chart we can say that it's already a 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.010
 big progress gta 5 who 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.780
 and for me a better than gta iv everything 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.760
 simply because the graphics not 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.810
 like north in each game plus the game 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.330
 advance and more the graphics are 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.460
 nice against the textures puts the 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.590
 time to show up at some curl and 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.990
 especially the loading time is 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.520
 extremely slow compared to gta iv which 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.649
 we can get bored very quickly 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.690
 so the game does not put a lot but 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.520
 a lot of time to load level 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.740
 atmosphere of a ya a beautiful staging 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.610
 I take the example of gunfights where 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.640
 actions of civilians 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.959
 for example the characters are very 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.800
 interesting they can even become 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.880
 tying for gunfights down I can 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.820
 take the example of the gameplay of max 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:33.440
 pays about the same 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:36.830
 and especially that mas penalties also a 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.459
 little one derivative of gta pass to the party 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.459
 gameplay 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.319
 a famous gameplay the difficulty 20the ya 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.049
 smarter than the other GT1 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.590
 so that we have a better rendering of 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.969
 game they are pretty responsive but it's going 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.950
 it's not boots either 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:05.349
 extremely hard so we can still 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.579
 get by in the game and it's mostly 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.930
 with rain this mode is excellent 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.319
 running chase that I leave you the 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.180
 discover 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.909
 if you buy the game you really 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.879
 really huge huge race what 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.530
 at the level of the style of the game so this 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:20.230
 this time it's a huge map 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.389
 we have gold gta usually I know 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.150
 that I played city lille and has long 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:26.109
 on psp and most of the gta and that was 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.790
 2 different maps 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.780
 you had to unlock all the missions 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.139
 from the first territory to go to 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.540
 second 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.430
 it was pretty boring and bella no there 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.439
 it's a huge and dull and it's also 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.030
 it can be not bad for people 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:38.769
 who do not just want to 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.530
 do missions and who have just 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:45.310
 want to walk on the map 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:47.859
 well it's a gta like activity level on 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.379
 has a lot of activities so we had to 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:53.290
 either parachute darts years to 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.750
 the golf driving school in a booth 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.000
 shooting we have courses are to tennis 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.599
 of yoga triathlon so that's it 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.970
 it's still pretty huge 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.859
 we have what else shopping we can 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.010
 change obviously as in any 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.299
 the gt1 novelties I think we can 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.239
 to make tattoos 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.680
 it seems to me that in the gta iv that there 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.109
 was or not I do not know you me 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.430
 say in the comments we go to 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.030
 the hairdresser can go to the 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.190
 garage or garage do not know 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.930
 level of entertainment as in all 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.099
 the jt al dura same that it is a 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.979
 classic we have the box 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:33.220
 striptease and cinema so that's it 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.110
 it's always the same we have the 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.060
 opportunity to be social and to go out 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.440
 with friends so that's like it's like 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.139
 in four it started from the 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.370
 catÃ© it was a very good idea 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:46.419
 the emission in the life of the 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.860
 missions this after 70 missions and we have 25 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.629
 hours of play 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.710
 in the main adventurous so 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:53.069
 in other words I take the example of 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.280
 call of duty who at 5h say it's 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:57.159
 a lot 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.259
 we were talking about call of duty 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:00.400
 we do not have time to get bored 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:03.000
 so we move to the last part that 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.000
 creativity 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.710
 the scenario we have three different purposes 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.970
 do not make a lot of impact but we have 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.210
 the possibility of making choices 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.880
 that's great in a game you can 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.930
 switch on three characters and not 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.700
 in all the missions ie 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.400
 that missions an object to stay with 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.380
 a single character in the lah we can 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.020
 switch with three characters but that 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.880
 depends on missions we have missions 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.490
 rather varied but are too 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.740
 linear it's a shame and 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.300
 each character has a special ability this 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.480
 which makes that one can no longer attached a 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.280
 preview according to its capacity is that too I 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.680
 think it's fine 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.750
 the originality of the game is that it's a 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.790
 little a remake of san andreas but in 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.950
 bigger best graphics and 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.330
 especially in more interesting under x a 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.340
 ice time for me was one of 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:02.950
 best I was adjustments before the 5th 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:05.740
 May now after and here it is 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:09.190
 it's good to find an old game in 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.140
 more and more evolved what in short you 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.670
 would say that this game ben recommend it 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.060
 really everyone because this has 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:18.010
 look like a marvel 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.510
 I even think he will make an excellent 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.590
 tape on the new consoles 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.940
 even if it's true the game of the year 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.260
 that is our multiplayer and ben 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.360
 it will be open only in a fortnight 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.370
 unfortunately so that's the rockstar 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.660
 social club 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.720
 so she'll have to wait before 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:37.360
 to make crazy people online and on 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.430
 this bath I tell you to + wear well 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.950
 do not hesitate to like commented to you 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.950
 Subscribe and I tell you more this lease
