00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.530 

it<00:00:04.190> was<00:00:04.340> very<00:00:04.370> close<00:00:04.760> to<00:00:04.880> me<00:00:04.970> how<00:00:05.090> worried<00:00:05.420> were

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
it was very close to me how worried were

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.090 
it was very close to me how worried were
you<00:00:05.569> was<00:00:05.870> three<00:00:06.050> minutes<00:00:06.170> to<00:00:06.350> go<00:00:06.560> I<00:00:06.710> of<00:00:07.069> course

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.100 
you was three minutes to go I of course

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.490 
you was three minutes to go I of course
it's<00:00:07.460> not<00:00:07.490> say<00:00:07.759> enough<00:00:08.000> good<00:00:08.870> ideal<00:00:09.200> thing<00:00:09.440> to

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
it's not say enough good ideal thing to

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.870 
it's not say enough good ideal thing to
score<00:00:09.830> when<00:00:10.010> in<00:00:10.100> three<00:00:10.250> mins<00:00:10.430> left<00:00:10.639> but<00:00:10.850> I

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:10.880 
score when in three mins left but I

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.210 
score when in three mins left but I
think<00:00:11.090> we<00:00:11.180> both<00:00:11.530> especially<00:00:12.530> look<00:00:12.889> at<00:00:13.010> first

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:13.220 
think we both especially look at first

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.680 
think we both especially look at first
half<00:00:13.490> of<00:00:13.639> create<00:00:13.820> a<00:00:13.849> lot<00:00:14.000> of<00:00:14.120> chances<00:00:14.480> but

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
half of create a lot of chances but

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.019 
half of create a lot of chances but
really<00:00:14.960> well<00:00:15.110> so<00:00:15.470> we<00:00:16.250> definitely<00:00:16.430> deserve<00:00:16.670> to

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
really well so we definitely deserve to

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.180 
really well so we definitely deserve to
win<00:00:17.180> anyway<00:00:17.450> and<00:00:18.050> it<00:00:18.170> unlikely<00:00:18.529> source<00:00:18.980> for

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.190 
win anyway and it unlikely source for

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.529 
win anyway and it unlikely source for
their<00:00:19.310> goal<00:00:19.490> when<00:00:19.610> it<00:00:19.699> finally<00:00:19.940> came<00:00:20.270> we've

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
their goal when it finally came we've

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.970

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
especially scored and I heard a scraping

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.480 
especially scored and I heard a scraping
ok<00:00:27.230> and<00:00:27.680> the<00:00:27.770> least<00:00:27.920> it<00:00:28.039> gets<00:00:28.130> easier<00:00:28.460> the

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
ok and the least it gets easier the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.460 
ok and the least it gets easier the
weekend<00:00:28.970> but<00:00:29.420> the<00:00:29.630> Premiership<00:00:30.050> no<00:00:30.199> problem

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.950 
weekend but the Premiership no problem
scoring<00:00:30.560> against<00:00:30.920> physic<00:00:31.369> no<00:00:31.910> I<00:00:31.939> think<00:00:32.449> that

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
scoring against physic no I think that

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.810 
scoring against physic no I think that

in the context why is it so hard of what
is<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.909> difference<00:01:05.239> between<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:05.869> champion
