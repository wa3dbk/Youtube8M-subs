00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.669 

now<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.509> need<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.900> base<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.380> fingerboard

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
now I need the base of the fingerboard

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.550 
now I need the base of the fingerboard
to<00:00:14.099> have<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.490> same<00:00:14.820> funky<00:00:15.450> shape<00:00:15.690> as<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.320> top

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
to have the same funky shape as the top

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.980 
to have the same funky shape as the top
of<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.800> body<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.850> I'm<00:00:17.940> using<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.449> template

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
of the body so I'm using this template

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.519 
of the body so I'm using this template
to<00:00:19.439> copy<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:20.100> funky<00:00:20.550> shape<00:00:20.730> with<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> template

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
to copy that funky shape with a template

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:37.880 
to copy that funky shape with a template
copyrighted

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.850 

and<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.790> thought<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.240> said<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.660> mean<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.290> funky

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
and I thought you said I mean this funky

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.650 
and I thought you said I mean this funky
shape<00:00:41.010> okay<00:00:44.030> to<00:00:45.030> make<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.330> figure<00:00:45.540> about

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
shape okay to make the figure about

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.220 
shape okay to make the figure about
radius<00:00:46.050> I'm<00:00:46.290> using<00:00:46.560> this<00:00:46.800> thing<00:00:47.250> about<00:00:47.490> radius

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
radius I'm using this thing about radius

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.030 
radius I'm using this thing about radius
routing<00:00:49.230> thing<00:00:50.240> which<00:00:51.240> is<00:00:51.360> very<00:00:51.600> precise<00:00:52.040> so

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
routing thing which is very precise so

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.370 
routing thing which is very precise so
at<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.940> end<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.080> give<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
at the end I just have to give the

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.979 
at the end I just have to give the
fingerboard<00:00:55.650> a<00:00:55.980> very<00:00:56.309> light<00:00:56.550> sanding<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.809> it's

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
fingerboard a very light sanding so it's

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:07.789 
fingerboard a very light sanding so it's
smooth<00:00:58.290> and<00:00:58.950> it's<00:00:59.130> ready

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.340 

now<00:01:08.430> if<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.789> look<00:01:08.909> close<00:01:09.210> enough<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.539> will

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
now if you look close enough you will

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.959 
now if you look close enough you will
see<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> fingerboard<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.579> a<00:01:11.640> little

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:11.969 
see that the fingerboard is a little

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:14.179 
see that the fingerboard is a little
thicker<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.539> right<00:01:12.780> side<00:01:13.049> which<00:01:13.950> means

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
thicker on the right side which means

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.639 
thicker on the right side which means
the<00:01:14.609> base<00:01:14.820> streams<00:01:15.179> have<00:01:15.750> more<00:01:15.960> wood<00:01:16.170> under

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
the base streams have more wood under

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.609 
the base streams have more wood under
them<00:01:16.850> this<00:01:17.850> way<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.570> base<00:01:18.899> strings<00:01:19.200> can

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
them this way the base strings can

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.550 
them this way the base strings can
resonate<00:01:19.979> better<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.670> have<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.329> fuller<00:01:21.960> deeper

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
resonate better and have a fuller deeper

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.749 
resonate better and have a fuller deeper
sound<00:01:27.229> to<00:01:28.229> cut<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.530> slots<00:01:28.829> for<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.189> frets<00:01:29.459> I

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
sound to cut the slots for the frets I

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.419 
sound to cut the slots for the frets I
use<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.569> jig<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.170> cut<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.469> wood<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.920> several

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
use this jig to cut the wood in several

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.880 
use this jig to cut the wood in several
shallow<00:01:32.640> passes<00:01:33.149> to<00:01:33.899> avoid<00:01:34.289> breaking<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
shallow passes to avoid breaking the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:52.969 
shallow passes to avoid breaking the
tinier<00:01:35.340> out<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.670> it

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.249 

it's<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.700> slow<00:01:54.060> process<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.079> may<00:01:55.229> think

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
it's a slow process and you may think

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.580 
it's a slow process and you may think
why<00:01:56.130> not<00:01:56.159> using<00:01:56.729> salt<00:01:56.960> what<00:01:57.960> here's<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
why not using salt what here's the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.090 
why not using salt what here's the
reason

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
reason

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.520 
reason
now<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.119> don't<00:02:00.570> show<00:02:00.840> on<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.170> side<00:02:01.380> of

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
now the don't show on the side of

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.499 
now the don't show on the side of
the<00:02:01.649> fingerboard<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.850> looks<00:02:03.060> much<00:02:03.299> more

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
the fingerboard so it looks much more

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.139 
the fingerboard so it looks much more
elegant<00:02:05.869> and<00:02:07.250> since<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.610> signature

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
elegant and since this is a signature

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.570 
elegant and since this is a signature
base<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.840> has<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.500> have<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.679> signature<00:02:11.039> right

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
base it has to have a signature right

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.460 
base it has to have a signature right
so<00:02:12.360> I'm<00:02:12.450> shaping<00:02:12.750> this<00:02:13.019> piece<00:02:13.290> of

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
so I'm shaping this piece of

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.900 
so I'm shaping this piece of
mother-of-pearl<00:02:13.769> where<00:02:14.430> I'm<00:02:14.550> going<00:02:14.790> to

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
mother-of-pearl where I'm going to

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:44.460 
mother-of-pearl where I'm going to
engrave<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.510> signature

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.050 

yeah<00:02:45.470> I'm<00:02:45.590> covering<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.130> research<00:02:46.490> to<00:02:46.700> inlaid

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
yeah I'm covering the research to inlaid

00:02:47.060 --> 00:03:09.390 
yeah I'm covering the research to inlaid
my<00:02:47.330> friend

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.490 

and<00:03:10.400> then<00:03:10.640> I'm<00:03:10.970> refining<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.660> edges<00:03:12.050> using

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
and then I'm refining the edges using

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:21.720 
and then I'm refining the edges using
some<00:03:12.710> small<00:03:13.100> chisels<00:03:13.550> to<00:03:13.730> get<00:03:14.240> a<00:03:14.270> perfect<00:03:14.690> fit

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.700 

then<00:03:22.730> I<00:03:22.940> glue<00:03:23.210> the<00:03:23.330> mother-of-pearl<00:03:23.600> in<00:03:23.990> and<00:03:24.260> I

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
then I glue the mother-of-pearl in and I

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:32.950 
then I glue the mother-of-pearl in and I
file<00:03:24.950> it<00:03:25.100> flush<00:03:25.340> with<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.670> fingerboard<00:03:31.960> and

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:32.960 
file it flush with the fingerboard and

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:42.370 
file it flush with the fingerboard and
then<00:03:33.830> I<00:03:33.920> sand<00:03:34.160> it<00:03:34.220> smooth<00:03:34.550> and<00:03:41.050> now<00:03:42.050> I'm<00:03:42.200> using

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
then I sand it smooth and now I'm using

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.620 
then I sand it smooth and now I'm using
this<00:03:42.620> brains<00:03:42.980> of<00:03:43.130> a<00:03:43.250> signature<00:03:43.580> to<00:03:44.240> copy<00:03:44.480> the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
this brains of a signature to copy the

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.630 
this brains of a signature to copy the
lines<00:03:44.870> on<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.470> mother-of-pearl<00:03:45.710> with<00:03:46.250> a<00:03:46.280> very

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
lines on the mother-of-pearl with a very

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.910 
lines on the mother-of-pearl with a very
fine<00:03:46.880> pencil<00:03:49.960> and<00:03:50.960> then<00:03:51.050> I<00:03:51.170> scratch<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.770> line

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
fine pencil and then I scratch the line

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.360 
fine pencil and then I scratch the line
very<00:03:52.310> slightly<00:03:52.880> with<00:03:53.030> this<00:03:53.180> engraver<00:03:53.630> and

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
very slightly with this engraver and

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.060 
very slightly with this engraver and
when<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.400> have<00:03:55.700> that<00:03:55.910> line<00:03:56.180> established<00:03:56.390> I<00:03:57.070> make

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
when I have that line established I make

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.530 
when I have that line established I make
several<00:03:58.340> passes<00:03:58.640> to<00:03:59.030> make<00:03:59.210> a<00:03:59.240> groove<00:04:01.540> whenever

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
several passes to make a groove whenever

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.020 
several passes to make a groove whenever
I<00:04:02.600> hear<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:03.020> word<00:04:03.050> engraver<00:04:03.710> I<00:04:04.040> think<00:04:04.850> of<00:04:04.970> a

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
I hear the word engraver I think of a

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.690 
I hear the word engraver I think of a
guy<00:04:05.210> with<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.570> shovel<00:04:05.990> digging<00:04:06.500> a<00:04:06.590> hole<00:04:06.860> ready

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
guy with a shovel digging a hole ready

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:33.909 
guy with a shovel digging a hole ready
to<00:04:07.880> throw<00:04:08.060> a<00:04:08.120> body<00:04:09.070> but<00:04:10.070> hey<00:04:10.250> that's<00:04:10.730> me

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.029 

that's<00:04:34.520> a<00:04:34.759> very<00:04:35.030> complicated<00:04:35.449> signature<00:04:36.169> but

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
that's a very complicated signature but

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.330 
that's a very complicated signature but
at<00:04:37.639> least<00:04:37.819> he<00:04:38.060> didn't<00:04:38.360> write<00:04:38.569> his<00:04:38.719> full<00:04:39.020> name

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
at least he didn't write his full name

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.209 
at least he didn't write his full name
you<00:04:40.340> gotta<00:04:40.520> give<00:04:40.699> him<00:04:40.789> that<00:04:40.849> and<00:04:41.800> then<00:04:42.800> I<00:04:42.979> fill

00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:43.219 
you gotta give him that and then I fill

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:49.809 
you gotta give him that and then I fill
the<00:04:43.340> groups<00:04:43.580> with<00:04:43.879> black<00:04:44.150> epoxy<00:04:48.430> then<00:04:49.430> I<00:04:49.550> sand

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:49.819 
the groups with black epoxy then I sand

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.360 
the groups with black epoxy then I sand
it<00:04:49.969> to<00:04:50.900> remove<00:04:51.169> everything<00:04:51.560> except<00:04:52.129> what's

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
it to remove everything except what's

00:04:52.370 --> 00:05:00.100 
it to remove everything except what's
inside<00:04:52.699> the<00:04:52.819> group<00:04:58.270> and<00:04:59.270> here's<00:04:59.659> the<00:04:59.870> end

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
inside the group and here's the end

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.469 
inside the group and here's the end
result<00:05:00.259> and<00:05:00.710> I<00:05:01.430> have<00:05:01.759> to<00:05:01.909> say<00:05:02.090> that<00:05:02.330> I'm<00:05:02.449> very

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
result and I have to say that I'm very

happy<00:05:03.050> with<00:05:03.259> it<00:05:03.439> it<00:05:03.949> came<00:05:04.219> out<00:05:04.430> just<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.210> way<00:05:05.360> I

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
happy with it it came out just the way I

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:09.670 
happy with it it came out just the way I
wanted<00:05:05.840> and<00:05:06.319> I'm<00:05:07.159> proud<00:05:07.669> okay<00:05:08.419> I<00:05:08.629> am<00:05:09.409> allowed

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
wanted and I'm proud okay I am allowed

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.309 
wanted and I'm proud okay I am allowed
to<00:05:09.919> be<00:05:10.039> proud<00:05:10.279> once<00:05:10.550> in<00:05:10.669> a<00:05:10.699> while<00:05:10.849> right<00:05:14.319> since

to be proud once in a while right since

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:17.290 
to be proud once in a while right since
I'm<00:05:15.469> using<00:05:15.710> stainless<00:05:16.129> steel<00:05:16.520> frets<00:05:16.849> which

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
I'm using stainless steel frets which

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.119 
I'm using stainless steel frets which
are<00:05:17.479> too<00:05:17.750> hard<00:05:17.990> to<00:05:18.139> force<00:05:18.529> them<00:05:18.710> to<00:05:18.770> adapt<00:05:19.099> to

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:19.129 
are too hard to force them to adapt to

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.730 
are too hard to force them to adapt to
the<00:05:19.400> fingerboard<00:05:19.759> I<00:05:20.090> use<00:05:20.840> this<00:05:21.020> fret<00:05:21.319> bender

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
the fingerboard I use this fret bender

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.619 
the fingerboard I use this fret bender
to<00:05:21.979> give<00:05:22.159> them<00:05:22.340> the<00:05:22.520> exact<00:05:22.849> same<00:05:23.060> radius<00:05:23.539> as

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:23.629 
to give them the exact same radius as

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:33.460 
to give them the exact same radius as
the<00:05:23.779> fingerboard<00:05:24.139> before<00:05:25.099> I<00:05:25.129> install<00:05:25.370> them

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.040 

then<00:05:34.250> I<00:05:34.340> cut<00:05:34.550> each<00:05:34.790> phrase<00:05:35.120> slightly<00:05:35.780> longer

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
then I cut each phrase slightly longer

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:57.900 
then I cut each phrase slightly longer
than<00:05:36.230> what<00:05:36.530> I<00:05:36.560> need

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.630 

then<00:05:58.810> I<00:05:58.840> use<00:05:59.050> this<00:05:59.200> file<00:05:59.500> holder<00:05:59.830> to<00:06:00.250> file<00:06:00.460> the

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
then I use this file holder to file the

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:09.420 
then I use this file holder to file the
bevel<00:06:01.060> on<00:06:01.240> the<00:06:01.570> end<00:06:01.690> of<00:06:01.780> the<00:06:01.900> page<00:06:08.160> now<00:06:09.160> I<00:06:09.190> need

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
bevel on the end of the page now I need

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.130 
bevel on the end of the page now I need
to<00:06:09.550> eliminate<00:06:09.640> the<00:06:10.270> last<00:06:10.480> portion<00:06:10.750> of<00:06:10.960> the

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 
to eliminate the last portion of the

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.740 
to eliminate the last portion of the
tanks<00:06:11.560> from<00:06:11.860> under<00:06:12.160> the<00:06:12.280> threads<00:06:12.550> so<00:06:13.450> when<00:06:13.660> I

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
tanks from under the threads so when I

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.980 
tanks from under the threads so when I
install<00:06:14.080> them<00:06:14.310> the<00:06:15.310> top<00:06:16.180> part<00:06:16.510> of<00:06:16.660> the<00:06:16.780> phrase

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
install them the top part of the phrase

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.930 
install them the top part of the phrase
will<00:06:17.560> extend<00:06:18.040> beyond<00:06:18.460> this<00:06:18.610> lot<00:06:18.850> that<00:06:19.600> we<00:06:19.720> hide

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
will extend beyond this lot that we hide

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.030 
will extend beyond this lot that we hide
then<00:06:21.940> I<00:06:21.970> slightly<00:06:22.480> around<00:06:22.990> the<00:06:23.170> edges<00:06:23.530> for

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040 
then I slightly around the edges for

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.870 
then I slightly around the edges for
more<00:06:24.250> comfortable<00:06:24.880> few

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.310 

and<00:06:30.880> then<00:06:31.000> I<00:06:31.090> polish<00:06:31.390> them<00:06:31.570> until<00:06:32.110> they<00:06:32.260> are

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
and then I polish them until they are

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:44.170 
and then I polish them until they are
smooth<00:06:32.650> and<00:06:32.800> shiny

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.439 

and<00:06:45.919> finally<00:06:46.919> I'm<00:06:47.160> using<00:06:47.460> the<00:06:47.729> spread<00:06:48.120> prayers

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:48.449 
and finally I'm using the spread prayers

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:52.010 
and finally I'm using the spread prayers
these<00:06:49.229> primitive<00:06:49.889> and<00:06:50.190> noisy<00:06:50.639> footprints<00:06:51.270> to

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 
these primitive and noisy footprints to

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:58.189 
these primitive and noisy footprints to
force<00:06:52.379> each<00:06:52.800> fret<00:06:53.159> into<00:06:53.550> its<00:06:53.699> slot<00:06:56.960> this<00:06:57.960> call

00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 
force each fret into its slot this call

00:06:58.199 --> 00:06:59.719 
force each fret into its slot this call
has<00:06:58.500> the<00:06:58.620> specific<00:06:58.830> radius<00:06:59.340> for<00:06:59.610> this

00:06:59.719 --> 00:06:59.729 
has the specific radius for this

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:00.469 
has the specific radius for this
fingerboard

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 
fingerboard

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:02.390 
fingerboard
so<00:07:00.900> if<00:07:01.020> I'm<00:07:01.139> making<00:07:01.319> a<00:07:01.560> different<00:07:01.919> radius<00:07:02.220> I

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
so if I'm making a different radius I

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.580 
so if I'm making a different radius I
can<00:07:02.699> replace<00:07:03.030> the<00:07:03.180> call<00:07:03.389> and<00:07:03.810> use<00:07:04.139> the<00:07:04.289> correct

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:04.590 
can replace the call and use the correct

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.469 
can replace the call and use the correct
size<00:07:06.830> here<00:07:07.830> we<00:07:07.949> have<00:07:08.099> it<00:07:08.250> now<00:07:08.759> the<00:07:08.819> side<00:07:09.210> of<00:07:09.360> the

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 
size here we have it now the side of the

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:11.629 
size here we have it now the side of the
fingerboard<00:07:09.780> is<00:07:10.319> interrupted<00:07:10.919> only<00:07:11.069> by<00:07:11.460> the

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 
fingerboard is interrupted only by the

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:14.120 
fingerboard is interrupted only by the
mother-of-pearl<00:07:12.000> dots<00:07:13.039> installing<00:07:14.039> the

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.130 
mother-of-pearl dots installing the

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.189 
mother-of-pearl dots installing the
frets<00:07:14.370> this<00:07:14.639> way<00:07:14.819> is<00:07:15.090> certainly<00:07:15.720> much<00:07:16.139> more

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 
frets this way is certainly much more

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:17.899 
frets this way is certainly much more
labor-intensive<00:07:16.710> than<00:07:17.190> the<00:07:17.430> traditional

00:07:17.899 --> 00:07:17.909 
labor-intensive than the traditional

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:20.230 
labor-intensive than the traditional
method<00:07:18.060> but<00:07:18.930> I<00:07:18.960> think<00:07:19.199> it<00:07:19.289> looks<00:07:19.470> classy<00:07:19.710> and

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 
method but I think it looks classy and

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.820 
method but I think it looks classy and
also<00:07:21.240> the<00:07:21.360> frets<00:07:21.630> don't<00:07:22.080> extend<00:07:22.409> all<00:07:22.650> the<00:07:22.680> way

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:22.830 
also the frets don't extend all the way

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.770 
also the frets don't extend all the way
to<00:07:22.979> the<00:07:23.310> edge<00:07:23.430> of<00:07:23.550> the<00:07:23.669> fingerboard<00:07:24.000> which

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 
to the edge of the fingerboard which

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.899 
to the edge of the fingerboard which
means<00:07:25.050> more<00:07:25.500> comfort<00:07:25.979> for<00:07:26.069> the<00:07:26.400> left<00:07:26.610> hand

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:26.909 
means more comfort for the left hand

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:30.680 
means more comfort for the left hand
which<00:07:27.750> means<00:07:27.780> a<00:07:28.229> happier<00:07:29.009> bass<00:07:29.370> player<00:07:29.699> and<00:07:29.940> a

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:30.690 
which means a happier bass player and a

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.650 
which means a happier bass player and a
happier<00:07:31.080> bass<00:07:31.349> build
