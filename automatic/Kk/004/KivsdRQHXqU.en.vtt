 kind of triangle with a little bit of 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.120

 very easy the only one that yes you have to 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.340
 pay close attention is how you 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.770
 cook the rice because it is the base of 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.560
 to be 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.420
 and it's very rich and it's perfect for 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.790

 you know that my recipes are not necessary 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.770
 that you apply for a date of 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.990
 special 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.490

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.830
 to be Japanese with the rice that you have 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.990
 in your kitchen is fine we need to 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.970
 this transparent paper that sticks by 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.250
 all sides and that it serves to wrap and 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.009
 food we need seaweed 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.430
 Toasts are what they occupy to make 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.620
 the sushi 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.690
 to cut the seaweed you can occupy a 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.460
 exact or scissors for the filling of 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.740
 our origins can occupy what 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.480
 be I am going to occupy hash that is a 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.160
 mixture of meat with potato pea and 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.650
 carrot 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.570
 we need vegetable colorants 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.120
 and you can occupy what you can think of to 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.150
 decorate your plate and then cut it in 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.920
 figurines to make it look more flirtatious ok 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.650
 let's start by putting a cup of 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.570
 rice and water in a pot and you're going to wash 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.000
 well , you will stir the rice with 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.130
 your hands and you are going to empty the water and 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.610
 you're going to put more and you're going to do this until 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.650
 that the water no longer comes out white 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.050
 with the same rate that you occupy for 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.760
 put the rice you are going to put a cup and 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.470
 average water 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.650
 after you have put the water 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.420
 let's leave our rice covered 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.950
 approximately 30 minutes this is for 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.500
 that the rice is soaked and more 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.500
 soft at the time of cooking 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.790
 [Music] 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.860
 about 30 minutes later like this 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.920
 it's how you see the rice you're going to learn your 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.170
 stove with high fire and you're going to put everything 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.110
 Now you are going to remove the lid of the rice 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.700
 while we are not cooking ok we are going to 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.220
 wait until water starts to boil 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.130
 almost get out of the pot and you go to 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.810
 go down almost all the leather and we're going to 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.450
 cook for another 10 minutes 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.550
 approximately 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.470
 you will see how little by little they will go 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.379
 lowering the bubbles until you can 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.870
 see the rice again when you see that already 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:08.480
 there is nothing of water and nothing of fugitives 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.400
 it's time to turn off the stove 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.680
 we are going to put a kitchen towel 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.120
 over so that it absorbs completely 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.879
 all the moisture that still remains in the 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.470
 drag and that's how you had to have 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.019
 your rice was not there had to be 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.810
 stuck for nothing in the pot and if you 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.849
 hit is because something you did wrong we're going to 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.620
 pass the rice to another mold and we're going to 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.190
 put salt so that the rice is so 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.410
 tasteless 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.330
 let's divide the rice into four 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.340
 lots and we're going to paint three of 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.480
 different colors in this case is going to be 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.190
 green 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.190
 pink and yellow 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.660
 cut a piece of paper and have the 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.000
 rice hand its stuffing and a spaghetti 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.800
 let's put some green rice in 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.560
 the middle part of our plastic and 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.620
 then a little filling and over 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.090
 let's cover the filling with more rice 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.590
 now you are going to grab the corners of your 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.410
 paper and let's make a little ball 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.819
 an oval ball you just have to do 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.700
 pressure so that all the rice is 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.260
 compact and save the filling we are 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.360
 doing a frog and you're going to do other 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.190
 two little balls that are going to be his eyes and 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.420
 you will fit them with two pieces of 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.690
 Spaghetti 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.549
 just like that 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.190
 Now you are going to grab your algae and you are going to 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.340
 cut out a smile two little dots for 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.500
 the nose and two circles for the eyes 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.660
 but you 're going to make them a triangle like that 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.850
 as I did and only the children that 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.760
 press and they will adhere 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.550
 perfectly to the rice balls 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.830
 now let's put pink rice and let's 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.200
 put a teaspoon of filling and more 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.870
 pink rice on top and this time we're going to 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.139
 make a perfect ball is exactly 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:50.259
 the same just compact all the rice 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:52.060
 and so you must get your ball let 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.710
 to do a little bit then with the 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.050
 ham you're going to make your nose and 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.689
 ears and with the eagle you are going to cut 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.490
 two little dots for the eyes 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:02.499
 now let's put yellow rice a 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.930
 little filling and more yellow rice 

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:08.020
 and this time we're going to make a triangle 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.150
 because we are going to make chicks and 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.580
 you need a carrot cube and two 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.020
 ojitos made with life and only 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.830
 you have to press us just like the 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.990
 the rest 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.820
 and save the most beautiful by the end 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.410
 let's make a plan I'll leave you 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.800

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.370
 you are going to cut out the algae only 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.550
 you have to put on top and you have to 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.160
 cut according to the figure as you have 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.840
 all the trimmed pieces we are going to 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.150
 start making the figure of the panda with 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.310
 white rice and the filling we put very 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.500

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.660
 then again very little rice and 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.610
 let's make a tiny oval 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:53.880
 we're going to make a base 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.920
 flat and we're going to do a kind of 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.140
 It must be very small so that 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.000
 fit the tracks well and we're going to 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:05.680
 start to put the little arms 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.220

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.490
 dish accommodating all our 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.229
 animals and figurines that have 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.630
 that you could cut with ham and cheese 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:21.729
 with pickles with tomato 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.740
 accompany it with mayonnaise and katz or with 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:26.080

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.680
 you want them for lunch only 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.690
 wrap them in the same plastic for 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.270
 wrap them upside down and they'll 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.920
 last two to three days and ready 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.170
