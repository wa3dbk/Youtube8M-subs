00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
into long ranges though I would suggest

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.319 
into long ranges though I would suggest
getting<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.760> an<00:00:44.910> acog<00:00:45.360> or<00:00:45.719> m<00:00:46.680> 145<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.969> sort

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
getting like an acog or m 145 and sort

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.450 
getting like an acog or m 145 and sort
of<00:00:48.420> scholar<00:00:50.300> ok<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.469> accessory

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
Grenadier but I'm going with offensive

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.210 
Grenadier but I'm going with offensive
considering<00:03:45.480> that<00:03:45.989> Navy<00:03:46.290> SEALs<00:03:46.620> are<00:03:46.799> usually

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
considering that Navy SEALs are usually

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.370 
considering that Navy SEALs are usually
attackers<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.000> not<00:03:48.209> defenders<00:03:48.750> or<00:03:49.019> anything

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
attackers and not defenders or anything

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.979 
attackers and not defenders or anything
like<00:03:49.410> that<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:50.060> then<00:03:51.060> if<00:03:51.209> I<00:03:51.299> had<00:03:51.510> marpat

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
like that and then if I had marpat

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.750 
like that and then if I had marpat
desert<00:03:52.350> unlocked<00:03:52.769> then<00:03:53.130> I<00:03:53.280> would<00:03:53.459> probably

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
desert unlocked then I would probably

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.350 
desert unlocked then I would probably
use<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:55.110> replicate<00:03:55.650> a<00:03:55.680> 0<00:03:55.829> or<00:03:55.980> 1<00:03:56.400> camo<00:03:56.880> used

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
use that to replicate a 0 or 1 camo used

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.990 
use that to replicate a 0 or 1 camo used
by<00:03:57.570> Navy<00:03:57.780> SEALs<00:03:58.110> in<00:03:58.440> desert<00:03:58.799> situations<00:03:59.430> thank
