00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
okay I'll just go back in with our cover

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.949 
okay I'll just go back in with our cover

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.569 

okay<00:03:32.959> and<00:03:33.230> we're<00:03:33.409> adding<00:03:35.739> 2.5<00:03:36.739> litres<00:03:37.129> of<00:03:37.159> the

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
okay and we're adding 2.5 litres of the

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:43.210 
okay and we're adding 2.5 litres of the
40<00:03:38.120> synthetic<00:03:38.720> oil<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.870> add<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:42.769> a<00:03:42.859> little<00:03:43.069> bit

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
40 synthetic oil and add it a little bit

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.699 
40 synthetic oil and add it a little bit
slow<00:03:44.170> let's<00:03:45.170> make<00:03:45.440> sure<00:03:45.470> we<00:03:45.890> don't<00:03:47.680> come<00:03:48.680> out

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
slow let's make sure we don't come out

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.890 
slow let's make sure we don't come out
the<00:03:49.010> top<00:03:49.280> sometimes<00:03:50.030> when<00:03:50.420> you're<00:03:50.540> doing<00:03:50.750> it

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
the top sometimes when you're doing it

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.589 
the top sometimes when you're doing it
alone<00:03:51.079> you<00:03:51.139> set<00:03:51.530> your<00:03:52.150> funnel<00:03:53.150> in<00:03:53.299> and<00:03:53.510> it

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
alone you set your funnel in and it

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.670 
alone you set your funnel in and it
blocks<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:53.989> orifice<00:03:54.500> at<00:03:55.129> the<00:03:55.280> end<00:03:55.810> so<00:03:56.810> we're

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
blocks the orifice at the end so we're

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.440 
blocks the orifice at the end so we're
going<00:03:57.799> to<00:03:57.889> lift<00:03:58.040> it<00:03:58.190> up<00:03:58.310> a<00:03:58.430> little<00:03:58.519> bit<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:58.970> end

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
going to lift it up a little bit and end

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.789 
going to lift it up a little bit and end
up<00:03:59.599> not<00:03:59.629> making<00:03:59.989> a<00:04:00.200> mess<00:04:01.540> okay<00:04:02.540> so<00:04:02.599> as<00:04:02.989> we<00:04:03.230> ran

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
up not making a mess okay so as we ran

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.680 
up not making a mess okay so as we ran
that<00:04:04.010> for<00:04:04.250> four<00:04:04.459> minutes<00:04:04.639> with<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.060> 2.5

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
that for four minutes with the 2.5

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.440 
that for four minutes with the 2.5
liters<00:04:06.109> in<00:04:06.319> there<00:04:06.639> warming<00:04:07.639> up<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.090> engine

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
liters in there warming up the engine

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.520 
liters in there warming up the engine
getting<00:04:08.659> the<00:04:08.870> oil<00:04:09.280> cycling<00:04:10.280> through<00:04:10.489> it<00:04:11.530> we

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
getting the oil cycling through it we

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.170 
getting the oil cycling through it we
went<00:04:12.709> ahead<00:04:12.829> and<00:04:13.069> shut<00:04:13.220> it<00:04:13.340> down<00:04:13.489> and<00:04:13.760> I<00:04:13.849> added

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
went ahead and shut it down and I added

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.879 
went ahead and shut it down and I added
about<00:04:14.389> a<00:04:14.450> quarter<00:04:15.170> of<00:04:15.349> a<00:04:16.010> leader<00:04:17.410> at<00:04:18.410> a<00:04:18.470> time

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
about a quarter of a leader at a time

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.150 
about a quarter of a leader at a time
and<00:04:19.310> kept<00:04:19.549> checking<00:04:20.060> it<00:04:20.560> it's<00:04:21.560> real<00:04:21.799> easy<00:04:21.829> to

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
and kept checking it it's real easy to

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.270 
and kept checking it it's real easy to
overfill<00:04:22.729> I<00:04:23.000> found<00:04:23.419> that<00:04:23.570> I<00:04:23.630> added<00:04:23.930> about<00:04:24.380> 3/4

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
overfill I found that I added about 3/4

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.719 
overfill I found that I added about 3/4
of<00:04:25.310> a<00:04:25.550> liter<00:04:25.729> to<00:04:26.240> get<00:04:26.690> it<00:04:26.810> up<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:27.229> about<00:04:27.729> between

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
of a liter to get it up to about between

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.670 
of a liter to get it up to about between
half<00:04:29.030> and<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.419> max<00:04:29.660> line<00:04:29.990> on<00:04:30.199> the<00:04:30.320> dipstick

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
half and the max line on the dipstick

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.339 
half and the max line on the dipstick
and<00:04:31.580> that's<00:04:31.760> where<00:04:32.000> we're<00:04:32.150> at<00:04:32.270> right<00:04:32.300> now<00:04:32.510> as

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
and that's where we're at right now as

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.110 
and that's where we're at right now as
you<00:04:33.590> run<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:33.919> engine<00:04:34.220> walk<00:04:34.460> around<00:04:34.789> the<00:04:34.910> bike

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
you run the engine walk around the bike

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.060 
you run the engine walk around the bike
and<00:04:35.449> make<00:04:35.599> sure<00:04:35.810> you're<00:04:36.020> not<00:04:36.169> leaking<00:04:36.500> at<00:04:36.800> any

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
and make sure you're not leaking at any

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.020 
and make sure you're not leaking at any
of<00:04:37.220> those<00:04:37.660> ports<00:04:38.660> that<00:04:38.810> we<00:04:38.960> opened<00:04:39.349> up

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
of those ports that we opened up

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.330 
of those ports that we opened up
everything<00:04:41.030> looked<00:04:41.270> good<00:04:41.479> and<00:04:41.810> at<00:04:42.770> this<00:04:42.979> point

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
everything looked good and at this point

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.370 
everything looked good and at this point
she's<00:04:44.030> going<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.270> get<00:04:44.419> a<00:04:44.449> real<00:04:44.660> extreme<00:04:44.990> bath

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
she's going to get a real extreme bath

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.350 
she's going to get a real extreme bath
tomorrow<00:04:45.770> so<00:04:46.520> I'm<00:04:46.699> leaving<00:04:46.880> some<00:04:47.210> of<00:04:47.240> the

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
tomorrow so I'm leaving some of the

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.900 
tomorrow so I'm leaving some of the
covers<00:04:47.660> off<00:04:47.870> and<00:04:47.900> whatnot<00:04:48.380> at<00:04:48.500> this<00:04:48.680> point<00:04:48.979> but

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
covers off and whatnot at this point but

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.830 
covers off and whatnot at this point but
that's<00:04:50.060> an<00:04:50.330> engine<00:04:50.720> oil<00:04:51.229> change<00:04:52.840> probably

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
that's an engine oil change probably

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.589 
that's an engine oil change probably
next<00:04:54.349> time<00:04:54.680> it<00:04:54.949> might<00:04:55.250> take<00:04:55.310> me<00:04:55.610> a<00:04:55.639> two<00:04:56.240> hours

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 
next time it might take me a two hours

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:59.110 
next time it might take me a two hours
to<00:04:56.810> do<00:04:56.960> I<00:04:57.400> was<00:04:58.400> a<00:04:58.430> little<00:04:58.610> longer<00:04:58.849> today

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
to do I was a little longer today

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.710 
to do I was a little longer today
because<00:04:59.750> of<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.190> doing<00:05:01.190> the<00:05:01.280> video<00:05:01.550> and<00:05:01.849> doing

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
because of the doing the video and doing

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.070 
because of the doing the video and doing
some<00:05:02.900> cleanup

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
some cleanup

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.879 
some cleanup
so<00:05:04.680> I<00:05:04.710> hope<00:05:05.009> you<00:05:05.159> enjoy<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.639> video
