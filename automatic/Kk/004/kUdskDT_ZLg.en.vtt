00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
like 20 slabs with you so if they blow

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.900 
like 20 slabs with you so if they blow
up<00:02:03.620> you<00:02:03.890> can<00:02:04.010> just<00:02:04.160> replace<00:02:04.460> them<00:02:04.700> and

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
up you can just replace them and

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.350 
up you can just replace them and
continue<00:02:05.420> hitting<00:02:05.660> them<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:08.090> one

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
continue hitting them and the one

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.800 
continue hitting them and the one
without<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:09.110> piston<00:02:09.800> I<00:02:10.760> think<00:02:11.540> I<00:02:11.630> covered

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
without a piston I think I covered

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.700 
without a piston I think I covered
everything<00:02:13.690> yeah<00:02:15.370> but<00:02:16.370> make<00:02:16.910> sure<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.710> make

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
everything yeah but make sure you make

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.460 
everything yeah but make sure you make
this<00:02:18.830> little<00:02:19.040> hallway<00:02:19.370> looking<00:02:19.760> thing

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
this little hallway looking thing

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.980 
this little hallway looking thing
position<00:02:21.470> forget<00:02:21.770> then<00:02:22.070> you're<00:02:22.340> screwed<00:02:22.990> so

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
position forget then you're screwed so

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.930 
position forget then you're screwed so
just<00:02:24.440> keep<00:02:24.530> like<00:02:24.710> a<00:02:24.740> one-block<00:02:25.190> space<00:02:25.610> under

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
just keep like a one-block space under

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.090 
just keep like a one-block space under
and<00:02:26.060> just<00:02:26.210> keep<00:02:26.450> half<00:02:26.720> of<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.260> open<00:02:27.950> with

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
and just keep half of it the open with

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.470 
and just keep half of it the open with
slides<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.860> one<00:02:31.010> with<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.310> piston<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:32.060> over

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
slides and the one with a piston is over

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.320 
slides and the one with a piston is over
here<00:02:33.880> yeah

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.910 

the<00:02:38.750> difference<00:02:39.080> between<00:02:39.200> there's<00:02:39.560> not<00:02:39.680> much

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
the difference between there's not much

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.500 
the difference between there's not much
of<00:02:40.070> a<00:02:40.220> difference<00:02:40.580> between<00:02:40.730> this<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.180> the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
of a difference between this and the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.080 
of a difference between this and the
other<00:02:41.540> one<00:02:41.960> just<00:02:42.170> like<00:02:42.770> this<00:02:43.010> as<00:02:43.520> a<00:02:43.580> piston

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
other one just like this as a piston

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.810 
other one just like this as a piston
obviously<00:02:44.540> okay<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:45.590> let's<00:02:46.160> say<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:46.430> jump<00:02:46.700> in

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
obviously okay so let's say that jump in

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.020 
obviously okay so let's say that jump in
they<00:02:47.570> jump<00:02:47.840> in<00:02:47.960> after<00:02:48.110> you<00:02:48.490> you<00:02:49.490> can<00:02:49.640> just<00:02:49.760> run

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
they jump in after you you can just run

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.910 
they jump in after you you can just run
in<00:02:50.180> here<00:02:50.420> close<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.900> door<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.350> then<00:02:51.650> wait<00:02:51.890> for

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
in here close the door and then wait for

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.710 
in here close the door and then wait for
them<00:02:52.190> here<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:52.670> as<00:02:53.060> soon<00:02:53.240> as<00:02:53.360> you<00:02:53.480> see<00:02:53.600> them

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
them here and as soon as you see them

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.550 
them here and as soon as you see them
fall<00:02:54.110> you<00:02:54.410> just<00:02:54.590> press<00:02:54.800> are<00:02:56.020> you<00:02:57.020> pressed<00:02:57.320> oh

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
fall you just press are you pressed oh

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.540 
fall you just press are you pressed oh
my<00:02:57.950> god<00:02:59.020> you<00:03:00.020> press<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.410> piston<00:03:00.830> and<00:03:01.010> then<00:03:01.460> it

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
my god you press the piston and then it

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.700 
my god you press the piston and then it
closes<00:03:01.790> up<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.240> hole<00:03:02.630> so<00:03:02.660> nobody<00:03:03.140> under<00:03:03.410> pros

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
closes up the hole so nobody under pros

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.590 
closes up the hole so nobody under pros
out<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:05.380> if<00:03:06.380> they<00:03:06.890> have<00:03:07.070> the<00:03:07.850> I<00:03:08.090> wouldn't

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
out and if they have the I wouldn't

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.450 
out and if they have the I wouldn't
recommend<00:03:08.840> this<00:03:09.200> because<00:03:09.650> if<00:03:10.220> they<00:03:10.370> have

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
recommend this because if they have

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.610 
recommend this because if they have
creeper<00:03:10.820> eggs<00:03:10.940> I<00:03:11.060> can<00:03:11.210> easily<00:03:11.540> be<00:03:11.840> preg<00:03:12.140> the

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
creeper eggs I can easily be preg the

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.449 
creeper eggs I can easily be preg the
piston<00:03:13.460> and<00:03:13.810> then<00:03:14.810> they<00:03:15.350> can<00:03:15.530> easily<00:03:15.860> get<00:03:16.070> like

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
piston and then they can easily get like

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.100 
piston and then they can easily get like
hit<00:03:16.670> you<00:03:16.790> from<00:03:16.970> here<00:03:17.060> unless<00:03:17.870> you<00:03:17.990> have

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
hit you from here unless you have

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.020 
hit you from here unless you have
obtained<00:03:18.500> with<00:03:18.770> you<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.280> can<00:03:19.400> lick<00:03:19.820> let's

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
obtained with you and you can lick let's

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.210 
obtained with you and you can lick let's
say<00:03:20.180> this<00:03:20.840> is<00:03:20.959> a<00:03:21.020> great<00:03:21.230> like<00:03:21.590> it's<00:03:21.770> cold<00:03:22.070> like

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
say this is a great like it's cold like

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.390 
say this is a great like it's cold like
all<00:03:22.490> this<00:03:22.640> explode<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.959> first<00:03:24.620> cover<00:03:25.010> up<00:03:25.130> this

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
all this explode you first cover up this

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.910 
all this explode you first cover up this
and<00:03:25.700> then<00:03:26.150> you<00:03:26.200> replace<00:03:27.200> your<00:03:27.260> stone<00:03:27.650> slabs

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
and then you replace your stone slabs

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.140 
and then you replace your stone slabs
and<00:03:28.160> you<00:03:28.250> just<00:03:28.340> continue<00:03:28.520> hitting<00:03:28.820> me<00:03:29.000> and

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
and you just continue hitting me and

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.020 
and you just continue hitting me and
same<00:03:29.870> thing<00:03:29.900> over<00:03:30.200> here<00:03:30.350> make<00:03:30.709> sure<00:03:30.740> that<00:03:31.160> the

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
same thing over here make sure that the

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.600 
same thing over here make sure that the
some<00:03:32.570> factor<00:03:32.990> servers<00:03:33.380> allow<00:03:34.010> you<00:03:34.070> to<00:03:34.310> open

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
some factor servers allow you to open

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.150 
some factor servers allow you to open
doors<00:03:34.940> and<00:03:35.209> other<00:03:35.510> peoples<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:36.110> fashion<00:03:36.980> line

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
doors and other peoples of fashion line

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.570 
doors and other peoples of fashion line
so<00:03:37.910> if<00:03:38.390> that<00:03:38.930> if<00:03:39.500> that's<00:03:39.740> the<00:03:39.860> case<00:03:40.040> then<00:03:40.100> just

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
so if that if that's the case then just

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.050 
so if that if that's the case then just
keep<00:03:40.970> this<00:03:41.240> like<00:03:42.580> bring<00:03:43.580> with<00:03:43.790> you<00:03:43.910> with

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
keep this like bring with you with

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.699 
keep this like bring with you with
diamond<00:03:44.450> pickaxe<00:03:44.840> that's<00:03:45.080> actually<00:03:45.530> like

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
diamond pickaxe that's actually like

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.580 
diamond pickaxe that's actually like
efficiency<00:03:46.489> I've<00:03:46.730> leak<00:03:47.090> or<00:03:47.570> fishing<00:03:47.959> TV<00:03:48.350> and

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
efficiency I've leak or fishing TV and

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.740 
efficiency I've leak or fishing TV and
just<00:03:48.620> keep<00:03:49.370> like<00:03:49.550> with<00:03:49.700> this<00:03:49.820> oh<00:03:50.030> like<00:03:50.540> that

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
just keep like with this oh like that

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.130 
just keep like with this oh like that
and<00:03:51.019> when<00:03:51.370> you<00:03:52.370> jump<00:03:52.700> in<00:03:52.850> or<00:03:53.060> just<00:03:53.300> get<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:53.989> get

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
and when you jump in or just get to get

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
the trap and then you just yeah then he

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.750 
the trap and then you just yeah then he
money<00:04:00.440> looks<00:04:00.830> like<00:04:01.010> when<00:04:01.250> you<00:04:01.310> somebody's

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
money looks like when you somebody's

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.640 
money looks like when you somebody's
following<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.209> you<00:04:02.239> just<00:04:02.570> say<00:04:02.660> okay<00:04:02.959> open<00:04:03.560> up

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
following you you just say okay open up

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.770 
following you you just say okay open up
the<00:04:03.769> trap<00:04:04.040> I'm<00:04:04.310> coming<00:04:04.910> I'm<00:04:05.030> on<00:04:05.180> my<00:04:05.330> way<00:04:05.360> and

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
the trap I'm coming I'm on my way and

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.020 
the trap I'm coming I'm on my way and
then<00:04:06.320> just<00:04:06.830> jump<00:04:07.100> in<00:04:07.280> and<00:04:07.459> then<00:04:07.610> you<00:04:07.700> find<00:04:07.910> it

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
then just jump in and then you find it

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.390 
then just jump in and then you find it
open<00:04:08.360> and<00:04:08.630> then<00:04:08.830> once<00:04:09.830> you're<00:04:09.980> in<00:04:10.130> you<00:04:10.250> just

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
open and then once you're in you just

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.470 
open and then once you're in you just
cover<00:04:10.760> up<00:04:10.910> this<00:04:11.180> with<00:04:11.360> obsidian<00:04:11.630> and<00:04:12.040> then

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
cover up this with obsidian and then

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.930 
cover up this with obsidian and then
actually<00:04:14.480> I<00:04:15.190> would<00:04:16.190> cover<00:04:16.370> up<00:04:16.519> this<00:04:16.730> with

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
actually I would cover up this with

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.069 
actually I would cover up this with
upsetting<00:04:17.359> so<00:04:17.630> that

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
upsetting so that

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.569 
upsetting so that
roll<00:04:18.259> into<00:04:18.500> that<00:04:18.829> quarter<00:04:19.129> and<00:04:19.220> you<00:04:19.310> won't<00:04:19.459> be

roll into that quarter and you won't be

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.759 
roll into that quarter and you won't be
able<00:04:19.669> to<00:04:19.849> hear<00:04:19.909> them<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:20.900> I<00:04:21.109> would<00:04:21.530> just<00:04:21.620> hit

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
able to hear them and I would just hit

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
three under curls they actually got out
