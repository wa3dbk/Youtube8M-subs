00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
that point is you want to investigate

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.379 
that point is you want to investigate
the<00:00:11.190> recording<00:00:11.730> options<00:00:12.120> okay<00:00:12.450> so<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:14.160> should

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
the recording options okay so you should

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.000 
the recording options okay so you should
just<00:00:15.389> so<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:15.870> can<00:00:16.139> see<00:00:16.379> exactly<00:00:16.560> what<00:00:16.949> I'm

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
just so you can see exactly what I'm

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.650 
just so you can see exactly what I'm
doing<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.279> should<00:00:17.460> enlarge<00:00:17.850> this<00:00:18.150> video<00:00:18.480> as

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
doing you should enlarge this video as

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.689 
doing you should enlarge this video as
much<00:00:18.869> as<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.109> can<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.500> your<00:00:19.529> screen<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.220> set

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
much as you can on your screen and set

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.790 
much as you can on your screen and set
the<00:00:20.970> highest<00:00:21.119> resolution<00:00:21.539> because<00:00:22.529> we're

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
the highest resolution because we're

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.070 
the highest resolution because we're
going<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.039> be<00:00:23.100> looking<00:00:23.220> at<00:00:23.400> some<00:00:23.779> fairly<00:00:24.779> small

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
going to be looking at some fairly small

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.230 
going to be looking at some fairly small
symbols<00:00:25.619> here<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.430> might<00:00:26.640> not<00:00:26.820> show<00:00:26.849> a

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
symbols here so it might not show a

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.000 
symbols here so it might not show a
default<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.380> know<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> lower<00:00:28.769> resolution

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
default on you know a lower resolution

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.939 
default on you know a lower resolution
or<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> smaller<00:00:30.269> em<00:00:30.660> smaller<00:00:31.650> screen

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
or on a smaller em smaller screen

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.979 
or on a smaller em smaller screen
setting<00:00:32.340> okay<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.120> these<00:00:33.300> are<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.630> symbols

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
setting okay so these are the symbols

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.209 
setting okay so these are the symbols
we're<00:00:34.140> going<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.380> be<00:00:34.440> looking<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:34.829> up<00:00:34.950> along

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
we're going to be looking at up along

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.139 
we're going to be looking at up along
here<00:00:35.250> okay

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
here okay

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.780 
here okay
so<00:00:36.660> there<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.440> particular<00:00:37.620> over<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.550> video

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
so there is in particular over the video

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.520 
so there is in particular over the video
or<00:00:39.090> over<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> camera<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.110> have<00:00:40.260> set<00:00:40.500> up

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
or over the camera that we have set up

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.200 
or over the camera that we have set up
already<00:00:40.800> but<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.250> just<00:00:41.550> show<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:41.910> here

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
already but I just show you here

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.940 
already but I just show you here
hopefully<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.930> bit<00:00:43.079> clearer<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.800> ones

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
hopefully it's a bit clearer the ones

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.110 
hopefully it's a bit clearer the ones
we're<00:00:44.160> looking<00:00:44.370> at<00:00:44.460> when<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.700> put<00:00:44.850> your<00:00:44.969> mouse

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
we're looking at when you put your mouse

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.090 
we're looking at when you put your mouse
over<00:00:45.360> them<00:00:45.629> then<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.379> know<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:46.770> see<00:00:46.920> what

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
over them then you know you can see what

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.540 
over them then you know you can see what
so<00:00:47.219> far<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.550> gives<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> little<00:00:48.000> bumps<00:00:48.809> okay

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
so far it gives you a little bumps okay

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.279 
so far it gives you a little bumps okay
so<00:00:50.550> what<00:00:51.180> we're<00:00:51.300> going<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.510> do<00:00:51.629> now<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> live

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
so what we're going to do now is a live

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.100 
so what we're going to do now is a live
record<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.270> just<00:00:54.390> basically<00:00:54.570> doing

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
record so this is just basically doing

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.020 
record so this is just basically doing
it<00:00:55.230> manually<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.980> use<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.489> little<00:00:56.820> symbol

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
it manually so use this little symbol

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.000 
it manually so use this little symbol
here<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.449> camera<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.590> just<00:00:58.770> press

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
here for the camera and you just press

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.590 
here for the camera and you just press
it<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.550> can<00:00:59.699> see<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.090> prompt<00:01:00.420> here

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
it and you can see the prompt here

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.930 
it and you can see the prompt here
that's<00:01:00.809> starting<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.379> record<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.550> I'm<00:01:02.850> just

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
up the IP the camera the kilobits per

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.510 
up the IP the camera the kilobits per
second<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:16.290> frame<00:01:16.530> rate<00:01:16.560> things<00:01:17.280> like

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
second and the frame rate things like

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.580 
second and the frame rate things like
this<00:01:17.729> okay<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.659> when<00:01:18.869> you're<00:01:18.990> recording<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
this okay and when you're recording the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.039 
this okay and when you're recording the
other<00:01:19.770> thing<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.130> note<00:01:20.310> would<00:01:20.580> be<00:01:20.840> down<00:01:21.840> below

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
other thing to note would be down below

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.660 
other thing to note would be down below
here<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.439> have<00:01:22.680> video<00:01:23.009> quality<00:01:23.250> when<00:01:23.640> you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
here you have video quality when you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.249 
here you have video quality when you
click<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.299> can<00:01:24.420> do<00:01:24.540> low<00:01:24.720> quality<00:01:24.990> or

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
click on that you can do low quality or

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.050 
click on that you can do low quality or
high<00:01:25.500> quality<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.520> obviously<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:28.579> the<00:01:29.579> lower

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
high quality so obviously and the lower

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.120 
high quality so obviously and the lower
high<00:01:30.299> quality<00:01:30.810> will<00:01:30.960> determine<00:01:31.290> obviously<00:01:31.829> if

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
high quality will determine obviously if

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.550 
high quality will determine obviously if
the<00:01:32.340> picture<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:33.180> know<00:01:33.299> if<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:33.659> very<00:01:34.290> good

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the picture you know if it's very good

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.249 
the picture you know if it's very good
or<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.280> absolutely<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.689> world<00:01:36.900> sort

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
or is it just absolutely this world sort

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:37.700 
or is it just absolutely this world sort
of<00:01:37.380> thing

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
of thing

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.730 
of thing
IP<00:01:38.369> cameras<00:01:38.759> are<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.509> know<00:01:39.630> HD<00:01:40.140> cameras<00:01:40.560> by

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
IP cameras are you know HD cameras by

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.200 
IP cameras are you know HD cameras by
default<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.430> pictures<00:01:41.759> never<00:01:41.939> going<00:01:42.180> to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
default so the pictures never going to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.940 
default so the pictures never going to
be<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.329> bad<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:43.170> when<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.380> double<00:01:43.619> click<00:01:43.799> on

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
be that bad so when you double click on

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.950 
be that bad so when you double click on
it<00:01:44.100> there<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> mean<00:01:44.549> that's<00:01:45.060> low<00:01:45.240> quality<00:01:45.509> there

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
it there I mean that's low quality there

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.630 
it there I mean that's low quality there
and<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.290> can<00:01:46.439> see<00:01:46.590> that's<00:01:46.770> very<00:01:46.950> very<00:01:47.310> clear

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
and you can see that's very very clear

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.260 
and you can see that's very very clear
okay

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
okay

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.350 
okay
so<00:01:49.229> why<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.860> might<00:01:50.159> want<00:01:50.399> set<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.850> low<00:01:51.030> is

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
so why you might want set to low is

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.359 
so why you might want set to low is
maybe<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.170> won't<00:01:52.320> interfere<00:01:52.860> with<00:01:53.220> your

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
maybe it won't interfere with your

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.520 
maybe it won't interfere with your
network<00:01:53.579> as<00:01:53.880> much<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.720> won't<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.020> as<00:01:55.110> heavy<00:01:55.290> on

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
network as much it won't be as heavy on

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.429 
network as much it won't be as heavy on
it<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.250> also<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.880> might<00:01:57.090> intend<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:58.170> won't

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
it and also it might intend it won't

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.050 
it and also it might intend it won't
take<00:01:58.680> up<00:01:58.829> as<00:01:58.950> much<00:01:58.979> space<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.579> your<00:01:59.610> hard<00:01:59.909> drive

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
take up as much space on your hard drive

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.560 
take up as much space on your hard drive
on<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.329> PC<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.250> so<00:02:02.250> that'd<00:02:02.549> be<00:02:02.790> basically<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.450> so

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
on a PC and so that'd be basically it so

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.819 
on a PC and so that'd be basically it so
I'm<00:02:03.659> just<00:02:03.780> going<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.020> kill<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.350> recording

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
I'm just going to kill that recording

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.560 
I'm just going to kill that recording
now<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.820> by<00:02:05.909> clicking<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.420> camera

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
now just by clicking on the camera

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.930 
now just by clicking on the camera
symbol<00:02:06.990> again<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.619> stopped<00:02:07.950> recording<00:02:08.099> so

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
symbol again and it stopped recording so

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.690 
symbol again and it stopped recording so
we<00:02:09.660> have<00:02:09.869> recorded<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.530> now<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.039> we<00:02:11.430> want<00:02:11.610> to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
we have recorded that now and we want to

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.490 
we have recorded that now and we want to
play<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:11.970> back<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.330> where<00:02:12.510> do<00:02:12.660> we<00:02:12.690> go

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
play it back so where do we go

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.740 
play it back so where do we go
so<00:02:13.770> we<00:02:14.040> go<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.430> folder<00:02:14.670> here<00:02:14.940> called<00:02:15.000> c<00:02:15.450> /

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
so we go to this folder here called c /

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.320 
so we go to this folder here called c /

this on the windows XP system but should

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.080 
this on the windows XP system but should
be<00:02:25.350> very<00:02:25.620> similar<00:02:25.920> on<00:02:26.220> Windows<00:02:26.520> Vista<00:02:26.670> Windows

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090

be very similar on Windows Vista Windows
7<00:02:27.240> Windows<00:02:27.630> 8<00:02:27.930> things<00:02:28.230> like<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:29.880> this

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
7 Windows 8 things like this so in this

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.450 
7 Windows 8 things like this so in this
PS<00:02:30.360> s<00:02:30.540> folder<00:02:30.960> you<00:02:31.470> have<00:02:31.680> two<00:02:31.920> folders<00:02:32.340> here

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
PS s folder you have two folders here

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.790 
PS s folder you have two folders here
one<00:02:32.730> called<00:02:32.970> pic<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:33.420> one<00:02:33.690> called<00:02:33.930> record<00:02:34.320> so

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
one called pic and one called record so

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.530 
one called pic and one called record so
pic<00:02:35.070> would<00:02:35.280> be<00:02:35.430> for<00:02:35.640> like<00:02:35.670> pictures<00:02:36.240> which

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
pic would be for like pictures which

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.640 
pic would be for like pictures which
would<00:02:36.720> be<00:02:36.840> like<00:02:36.990> you<00:02:37.200> know<00:02:37.230> if<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.470> took<00:02:37.590> a

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
would be like you know if you took a

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.110 
would be like you know if you took a
snapshot<00:02:37.770> of<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.400> particular<00:02:38.820> incident

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
snapshot of a particular incident

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.570 
snapshot of a particular incident
something<00:02:39.600> like<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.260> both<00:02:40.980> record<00:02:41.400> this

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
something like that and both record this

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.150 
something like that and both record this
what<00:02:41.700> we're<00:02:41.850> more<00:02:42.030> interested<00:02:42.330> here<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:43.920> we

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
what we're more interested here so we

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.070 
what we're more interested here so we
just<00:02:44.340> go<00:02:44.460> in<00:02:44.580> there<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.630> can<00:02:45.780> see<00:02:45.930> I've

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
just go in there and you can see I've

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.240 
just go in there and you can see I've
just<00:02:46.110> been<00:02:46.320> playing<00:02:46.530> with<00:02:46.709> it<00:02:46.800> there<00:02:46.920> earlier

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
just been playing with it there earlier

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.770 
just been playing with it there earlier
and<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.490> breaks<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.820> into<00:02:48.000> little<00:02:48.240> chunks<00:02:48.390> so

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
and it breaks it into little chunks so

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.630 
and it breaks it into little chunks so
the<00:02:49.320> one<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.709> latest<00:02:50.010> one<00:02:50.160> is<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.370> one<00:02:50.490> we're

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
the one the latest one is the one we're

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.420 
the one the latest one is the one we're
after<00:02:50.820> which<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:51.270> 1<00:02:51.450> or<00:02:51.600> 6<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.350> you<00:02:53.100> can<00:02:53.250> see

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
after which is 1 or 6 and you can see

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.610 
after which is 1 or 6 and you can see
the<00:02:53.580> date<00:02:53.790> on<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.090> in<00:02:54.390> this<00:02:54.720> folder<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.470> go

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
the date on it in this folder and you go

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.280 
the date on it in this folder and you go
in<00:02:55.770> there<00:02:56.390> so<00:02:57.390> what<00:02:57.540> we're<00:02:57.660> going<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.870> do<00:02:58.020> is<00:02:58.170> we

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
in there so what we're going to do is we

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.690 
in there so what we're going to do is we
want<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.500> play<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.860> back<00:02:59.070> and<00:02:59.310> all<00:02:59.430> we<00:02:59.580> have

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
want to play that back and all we have

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.790 
want to play that back and all we have
to<00:02:59.790> do<00:02:59.910> simply<00:03:00.360> it's<00:03:00.959> double<00:03:01.200> click<00:03:01.380> on<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.650> and

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
to do simply it's double click on it and

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.880 
to do simply it's double click on it and
there<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.459> is<00:03:02.520> playing<00:03:02.820> back<00:03:03.440> so<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.709> mean

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
there it is playing back so I mean

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.560 
there it is playing back so I mean
couldn't<00:03:05.250> be<00:03:05.400> simpler<00:03:05.670> than<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:05.940> basically

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
couldn't be simpler than that basically

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.720 
couldn't be simpler than that basically
so<00:03:07.230> I'm<00:03:07.560> just<00:03:07.740> going<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:07.920> kill<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.160> now<00:03:08.490> so

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
so I'm just going to kill that now so

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.960 
so I'm just going to kill that now so
you<00:03:08.790> have<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.150> just<00:03:09.390> do<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:11.730> we'll<00:03:11.880> go

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
you have to just do that and we'll go

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.230 
you have to just do that and we'll go
back<00:03:12.000> into<00:03:12.360> PSS<00:03:12.930> now<00:03:13.170> ok<00:03:13.670> so<00:03:14.670> that's<00:03:14.910> all<00:03:15.060> well

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
back into PSS now ok so that's all well

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.150 
back into PSS now ok so that's all well
and<00:03:15.270> good<00:03:15.390> if<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:16.080> know<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.680> want<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:16.950> set<00:03:17.130> a

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
and good if you know you want to set a

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.580 
and good if you know you want to set a
manual<00:03:17.400> record<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.269> both<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.290> wouldn't<00:03:19.530> be

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
manual record and both it wouldn't be

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.110 
manual record and both it wouldn't be
very<00:03:19.739> convenient<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.489> it'd<00:03:20.790> be<00:03:20.880> a<00:03:20.910> bit

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
very convenient and it'd be a bit

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.670 
very convenient and it'd be a bit
labor-intensive<00:03:21.870> if<00:03:22.050> you<00:03:22.140> had<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.380> do<00:03:22.500> that

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
labor-intensive if you had to do that

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.630 
labor-intensive if you had to do that
every<00:03:22.830> time<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:23.100> wanted<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.430> record

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
every time you wanted to record

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.270 
every time you wanted to record
something<00:03:24.090> so<00:03:24.440> much<00:03:25.440> better<00:03:25.590> way<00:03:25.800> of<00:03:25.860> doing<00:03:26.160> it

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
something so much better way of doing it

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.190 
something so much better way of doing it
is<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.400> set<00:03:26.670> up<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.910> schedule<00:03:27.120> record<00:03:27.780> schedule

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
is to set up a schedule record schedule

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.229 
is to set up a schedule record schedule
record<00:03:28.650> okay<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.700> do<00:03:29.820> this<00:03:30.030> you're<00:03:30.209> going

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
record okay and to do this you're going

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.540 
record okay and to do this you're going
to<00:03:30.390> config<00:03:30.780> manager<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.920> what<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.220> want<00:03:32.400> to

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
to config manager and what you want to

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.580 
to config manager and what you want to
do<00:03:32.730> is<00:03:32.940> you<00:03:33.600> want<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.840> go<00:03:33.989> into<00:03:34.110> this<00:03:34.320> stinkhole

do is you want to go into this stinkhole
record<00:03:35.130> plan<00:03:35.610> config<00:03:36.650> so<00:03:37.650> it'll<00:03:38.430> pull<00:03:38.580> up<00:03:38.610> this

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
record plan config so it'll pull up this

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.430 
record plan config so it'll pull up this
window<00:03:39.060> here<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:39.630> what<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.870> can<00:03:39.989> see<00:03:40.230> is

window here and what you can see is

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.740 
window here and what you can see is
first<00:03:40.980> thing<00:03:41.160> is<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.700> packed<00:03:41.940> time<00:03:42.269> so<00:03:42.600> what

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
first thing is the packed time so what

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.539 
first thing is the packed time so what
that<00:03:42.870> means<00:03:43.140> is<00:03:43.290> basically<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:44.070> chunks<00:03:44.430> is

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
that means is basically the chunks is

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.479 
that means is basically the chunks is
going<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:44.880> recording<00:03:45.390> is<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.660> 15<00:03:46.019> 30<00:03:46.380> 45<00:03:46.530> or<00:03:47.220> 60

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:25.660 
had a standalone PC to do this or laptop

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.090 
had a standalone PC to do this or laptop
or<00:07:25.780> something<00:07:25.900> like<00:07:26.200> that<00:07:26.260> that<00:07:26.590> probably<00:07:26.950> be

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:27.100 
or something like that that probably be

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.600 
or something like that that probably be
okay

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:27.610 
okay

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.880 
okay
you<00:07:28.030> probably<00:07:28.330> especially<00:07:28.990> if<00:07:29.530> it's<00:07:29.650> going<00:07:29.800> to

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:29.890 
you probably especially if it's going to

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.590 
you probably especially if it's going to
be<00:07:29.950> John<00:07:30.100> working<00:07:30.370> hours<00:07:30.790> it's<00:07:31.030> not<00:07:31.270> a<00:07:31.300> great

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:31.600 
be John working hours it's not a great

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.080 
be John working hours it's not a great
idea<00:07:31.630> to<00:07:32.200> have<00:07:32.380> this<00:07:32.560> set<00:07:32.800> up<00:07:32.950> you<00:07:33.220> know<00:07:33.850> on<00:07:34.060> a

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.090 
idea to have this set up you know on a

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.909 
idea to have this set up you know on a
PC<00:07:34.510> that<00:07:34.870> someone's<00:07:35.200> using<00:07:35.440> and<00:07:35.770> stuff

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 
PC that someone's using and stuff

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:37.740 
PC that someone's using and stuff
because<00:07:36.340> you<00:07:36.910> know<00:07:36.940> it's<00:07:37.240> going<00:07:37.390> to<00:07:37.480> be<00:07:37.570> fairly

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:37.750 
because you know it's going to be fairly

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.080 
because you know it's going to be fairly
heavy<00:07:38.110> on<00:07:38.380> it<00:07:38.560> and<00:07:38.740> also<00:07:39.250> if<00:07:39.490> you're<00:07:39.669> doing<00:07:39.700> it

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.090 
heavy on it and also if you're doing it

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.090 
heavy on it and also if you're doing it
over<00:07:40.330> the<00:07:40.450> network<00:07:40.630> although<00:07:40.960> again<00:07:41.890> this

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:42.100 
over the network although again this

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.159 
over the network although again this
would<00:07:42.310> apply<00:07:42.490> to<00:07:42.580> NVRs<00:07:43.270> or<00:07:43.540> if<00:07:43.660> you<00:07:43.780> were<00:07:43.930> using

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:44.169 
would apply to NVRs or if you were using

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:46.409 
would apply to NVRs or if you were using
and<00:07:44.680> as<00:07:44.919> device<00:07:45.430> or<00:07:45.669> something<00:07:46.030> like<00:07:46.180> this

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:46.419 
and as device or something like this

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:48.540 
and as device or something like this
it's<00:07:47.080> still<00:07:47.230> going<00:07:47.530> to<00:07:47.620> be<00:07:47.680> heavy<00:07:48.100> enough<00:07:48.280> on

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:48.550 
it's still going to be heavy enough on

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.690 
it's still going to be heavy enough on
your<00:07:48.640> network<00:07:49.000> so<00:07:49.210> but<00:07:49.450> you<00:07:49.720> know<00:07:50.490> these<00:07:51.490> are

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:51.700 
your network so but you know these are

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.820 
your network so but you know these are
just<00:07:51.730> things<00:07:52.060> to<00:07:52.150> consider<00:07:52.600> so<00:07:53.380> that's

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:53.830 
just things to consider so that's

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.420 
just things to consider so that's
basically<00:07:54.340> it<00:07:54.490> and<00:07:54.820> how<00:07:55.720> you<00:07:55.780> set<00:07:56.110> up<00:07:56.290> and<00:07:56.560> live

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:57.430 
basically it and how you set up and live

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.480 
basically it and how you set up and live
recording<00:07:58.060> and<00:07:58.210> schedules<00:07:58.660> recording<00:07:59.229> on<00:07:59.490> the

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:00.490 
recording and schedules recording on the

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.210 
recording and schedules recording on the
PSS<00:08:00.970> software<00:08:01.450> on<00:08:01.630> your<00:08:01.660> PC<00:08:01.810> or<00:08:02.320> laptop<00:08:02.350> so<00:08:02.950> you

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:03.220 
PSS software on your PC or laptop so you

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:07.979 
PSS software on your PC or laptop so you
can<00:08:03.669> record<00:08:04.120> em<00:08:04.450> your<00:08:05.110> IP<00:08:05.380> cameras
