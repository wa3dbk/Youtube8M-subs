and our question this week is from Gayle
who<00:00:18.150> has<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.360> fruit<00:00:18.779> tree<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.349> peach<00:00:19.980> tree<00:00:20.220> that

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
who has a fruit tree a peach tree that

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.980 
who has a fruit tree a peach tree that
she<00:00:20.789> would<00:00:20.940> like<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.210> know<00:00:21.300> if<00:00:21.390> she<00:00:21.449> can<00:00:21.660> prune

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
she would like to know if she can prune

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.349 
she would like to know if she can prune
right<00:00:22.260> now<00:00:22.550> normally<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.699> would<00:00:23.820> not<00:00:23.970> prune

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
right now normally you would not prune

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.150 
right now normally you would not prune
any<00:00:24.570> fruit<00:00:24.869> trees<00:00:25.140> right<00:00:25.410> now<00:00:25.439> or<00:00:25.800> any<00:00:25.949> other

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
any fruit trees right now or any other

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.340 
any fruit trees right now or any other
trees<00:00:26.460> really<00:00:26.730> very<00:00:26.939> much<00:00:27.090> as<00:00:27.330> well<00:00:27.539> but<00:00:28.140> fruit

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 
trees really very much as well but fruit

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.769 
trees really very much as well but fruit
trees<00:00:28.650> especially<00:00:28.800> because<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.789> are<00:00:29.939> pruning

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
trees especially because you are pruning

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.259 
trees especially because you are pruning
out<00:00:30.900> some<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.769> buds<00:00:32.099> for<00:00:32.369> next<00:00:32.610> year<00:00:32.850> but

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:33.269 
out some of the buds for next year but

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:35.689 
out some of the buds for next year but
more<00:00:33.420> importantly<00:00:33.960> you're<00:00:34.410> pruning<00:00:34.860> out<00:00:35.070> some

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
more importantly you're pruning out some

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:37.610 
more importantly you're pruning out some
of<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.420> growth<00:00:36.690> if<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.140> prune<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.410> up

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
of the growth if you prune it up

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.280 
of the growth if you prune it up
improperly<00:00:38.489> you're<00:00:39.030> encouraging<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.960> grow

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
improperly you're encouraging it to grow

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.990 
improperly you're encouraging it to grow
so<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.649> don't<00:00:40.920> want<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.309> do<00:00:41.489> that

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
so you don't want to do that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.030 
so you don't want to do that
this<00:00:42.420> particular<00:00:43.050> tree<00:00:43.260> has<00:00:43.410> very<00:00:43.770> heavy

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
this particular tree has very heavy

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.740 
this particular tree has very heavy
limbs<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.790> does<00:00:45.059> need<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> lot<00:00:45.719> of

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
limbs and it does need a lot of

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.510 
limbs and it does need a lot of
correcting<00:00:46.500> you'll<00:00:46.980> notice<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.370> it's

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
correcting you'll notice that it's

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.880 
correcting you'll notice that it's
growing<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.940> lot<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.270> one<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.660> one<00:00:49.050> side<00:00:49.379> has<00:00:49.860> a

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
growing a lot of one on one side has a

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.130 
growing a lot of one on one side has a
bunch<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.399> branches<00:00:50.640> down<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> ground<00:00:51.450> so

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
bunch of branches down on the ground so

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.600 
bunch of branches down on the ground so
Gayle<00:00:52.350> does<00:00:52.620> need<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.860> go<00:00:53.039> ahead<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.190> remove

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
Gayle does need to go ahead and remove

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.310 
Gayle does need to go ahead and remove
those<00:00:53.850> branches<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.420> kind<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.780> balance<00:00:55.170> a

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
those branches and kind of balance a

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.680 
those branches and kind of balance a
tree<00:00:55.620> bring<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:55.980> back<00:00:56.160> into<00:00:56.550> balance<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.210> so

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
tree bring it back into balance and so

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.029 
tree bring it back into balance and so
what<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.050> need<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.350> do<00:00:58.469> if<00:00:58.620> you're<00:00:58.739> going<00:00:58.890> to

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
what you need to do if you're going to

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.430 
what you need to do if you're going to
prune<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.489> time<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.910> year<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.360> remove<00:01:00.960> all<00:01:01.230> of

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
prune this time of year is remove all of

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.110 
prune this time of year is remove all of
those<00:01:01.590> limbs<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.039> are<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> hazard<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.910> ones

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
those limbs that are a hazard the ones

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.639 
those limbs that are a hazard the ones
that<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> ground<00:01:03.750> are<00:01:04.020> on<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.259> ground<00:01:04.470> or

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
that on the ground are on the ground or

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:06.529 
that on the ground are on the ground or
a<00:01:04.680> tripping<00:01:05.070> hazard<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.030> do<00:01:06.330> need<00:01:06.479> to

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:06.539 
a tripping hazard so you do need to

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:08.060 
a tripping hazard so you do need to
prune<00:01:06.840> those<00:01:07.020> all<00:01:07.259> the<00:01:07.440> way<00:01:07.500> back<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
prune those all the way back to the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.920 
prune those all the way back to the
source<00:01:08.430> all<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.790> way<00:01:09.000> back<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.659> branch

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
source all the way back to the branch

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.350 
source all the way back to the branch
that<00:01:10.020> they<00:01:10.229> came<00:01:10.500> from<00:01:10.740> or<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> main<00:01:11.939> trunk

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
that they came from or to the main trunk

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.630 
that they came from or to the main trunk
and<00:01:12.630> when<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.229> do<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.920> don't<00:01:14.159> encourage

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
and when you do that you don't encourage

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.270 
and when you do that you don't encourage
the<00:01:14.909> tree<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.360> branch<00:01:15.659> any<00:01:16.020> further<00:01:16.439> breaking

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the tree to branch any further breaking

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.190 
the tree to branch any further breaking
buds<00:01:17.729> if<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.090> cut<00:01:18.420> all<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> way<00:01:18.750> back<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
buds if you cut all the way back to the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.810 
buds if you cut all the way back to the
source<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.619> that's<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.920> proper<00:01:20.159> way<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.430> prune

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
source so that's the proper way to prune

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.390 
source so that's the proper way to prune
this<00:01:21.000> time<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.420> year<00:01:21.659> our<00:01:21.840> plant<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:22.920> week<00:01:23.040> is

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
this time of year our plant this week is

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.719 
this time of year our plant this week is
cedar<00:01:23.729> sage<00:01:24.119> salvia<00:01:24.750> ro<00:01:25.259> Maryana<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
cedar sage salvia ro Maryana this is a

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.910 
cedar sage salvia ro Maryana this is a
perennial<00:01:27.030> salvia<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:28.290> native<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
perennial salvia it's native to the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.820 
perennial salvia it's native to the
Edwards<00:01:29.310> Plateau<00:01:29.600> under<00:01:30.600> ash<00:01:30.780> juniper<00:01:31.380> trees

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
Edwards Plateau under ash juniper trees

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.520 
Edwards Plateau under ash juniper trees
so<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.759> does<00:01:32.939> grow<00:01:33.240> very<00:01:33.780> well<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.200> us<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.409> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
so it does grow very well for us in the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.310 
so it does grow very well for us in the
shade<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:35.280> gets<00:01:35.759> one<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.240> two<00:01:36.450> feet<00:01:36.659> tall<00:01:36.990> and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
shade it gets one to two feet tall and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.289 
shade it gets one to two feet tall and
then<00:01:37.560> would<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> one<00:01:38.280> foot<00:01:38.579> flower<00:01:38.909> stalk

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
then would have a one foot flower stalk

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.840 
then would have a one foot flower stalk
it<00:01:40.049> does<00:01:40.229> great<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> shade<00:01:41.009> as<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.310> said<00:01:41.579> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
it does great in the shade as I said and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.670 
it does great in the shade as I said and
