00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
season where was this kind of freedom

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.900 
season where was this kind of freedom
with<00:05:15.539> the<00:05:15.690> team<00:05:15.900> previously<00:05:16.560> do<00:05:16.800> you<00:05:16.889> think<00:05:17.130> uh

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
with the team previously do you think uh

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.879 
with the team previously do you think uh
well<00:05:18.389> a<00:05:18.419> lot<00:05:18.690> of<00:05:18.780> that<00:05:18.900> came<00:05:19.259> from<00:05:19.440> just<00:05:19.650> our

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
well a lot of that came from just our

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.320 
well a lot of that came from just our
few<00:05:20.250> weeks<00:05:20.400> of<00:05:20.490> practice<00:05:20.789> that<00:05:20.849> we<00:05:20.970> had<00:05:21.120> before

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
few weeks of practice that we had before

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.189 
few weeks of practice that we had before
this<00:05:21.660> gauntlet

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
this gauntlet

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.360 
this gauntlet
so<00:05:22.470> we<00:05:22.560> tried<00:05:22.740> out<00:05:22.830> a<00:05:22.860> bunch<00:05:23.039> of<00:05:23.099> stuff<00:05:23.160> in

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
so we tried out a bunch of stuff in

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.370 
so we tried out a bunch of stuff in
scrims<00:05:23.669> and<00:05:24.060> I<00:05:24.419> think<00:05:24.900> we<00:05:24.960> actually<00:05:25.020> screamed

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
scrims and I think we actually screamed

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.080 
scrims and I think we actually screamed
against<00:05:25.650> liquids<00:05:26.039> specifically<00:05:26.639> when<00:05:26.970> we

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
against liquids specifically when we

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.670 
against liquids specifically when we
pulled<00:05:27.270> up<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.389> Draven<00:05:27.720> Brisbane<00:05:28.080> we<00:05:28.470> did<00:05:28.620> it

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
pulled up the Draven Brisbane we did it

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.200 
pulled up the Draven Brisbane we did it
twice<00:05:28.800> in<00:05:29.039> a<00:05:29.070> row<00:05:29.190> and<00:05:29.220> then<00:05:29.520> from<00:05:30.030> there<00:05:30.180> on

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
twice in a row and then from there on

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.850 
twice in a row and then from there on
every<00:05:30.630> week<00:05:30.750> after<00:05:31.020> they<00:05:31.260> shouted<00:05:31.560> banning

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
every week after they shouted banning

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.800 
every week after they shouted banning
Draven<00:05:32.130> primarily<00:05:32.490> so<00:05:33.120> we<00:05:33.360> knew<00:05:33.510> it<00:05:33.539> was<00:05:33.720> a

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
Draven primarily so we knew it was a

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.779 
Draven primarily so we knew it was a
pretty<00:05:34.260> good<00:05:34.409> champion<00:05:35.250> to<00:05:35.340> pick<00:05:35.460> in<00:05:35.580> a<00:05:35.639> vain

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
through this season regarded as one of

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:44.270 
through this season regarded as one of
the<00:05:42.570> top<00:05:42.750> ad<00:05:42.990> carry's<00:05:43.500> struggled<00:05:44.070> a<00:05:44.130> bit<00:05:44.159> in

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
the top ad carry's struggled a bit in

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.800 
the top ad carry's struggled a bit in
the<00:05:44.400> beginning<00:05:44.729> as<00:05:44.940> well<00:05:45.120> what<00:05:45.479> kind<00:05:45.659> of<00:05:45.690> with

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
the beginning as well what kind of with

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.390 
the beginning as well what kind of with
the<00:05:45.900> rest<00:05:46.050> of<00:05:46.199> the<00:05:46.260> team<00:05:46.470> as<00:05:46.680> it<00:05:46.979> was<00:05:47.099> a<00:05:47.130> whole

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
the rest of the team as it was a whole

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.830 
the rest of the team as it was a whole
how<00:05:47.849> did<00:05:48.030> you<00:05:48.150> kind<00:05:48.300> of<00:05:48.389> pull<00:05:48.570> out<00:05:48.659> of<00:05:48.720> that

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
how did you kind of pull out of that

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.810 
how did you kind of pull out of that
slump<00:05:49.199> and<00:05:49.500> what<00:05:50.039> was<00:05:50.159> it<00:05:50.280> like<00:05:50.310> for<00:05:50.460> the<00:05:50.639> team

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
slump and what was it like for the team

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.330 
slump and what was it like for the team
well<00:05:51.479> I<00:05:51.510> think<00:05:51.659> we<00:05:51.900> were<00:05:51.990> just<00:05:52.380> really<00:05:52.590> slumped

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
well I think we were just really slumped

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.610 
well I think we were just really slumped
as<00:05:53.520> a<00:05:53.580> whole<00:05:53.909> not<00:05:54.180> just<00:05:54.240> singular<00:05:55.139> people<00:05:55.409> like

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
as a whole not just singular people like

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.140 
as a whole not just singular people like
I<00:05:55.740> think<00:05:55.949> Jenson<00:05:56.669> was<00:05:56.789> getting<00:05:56.970> a<00:05:57.000> lot<00:05:57.090> of

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
I think Jenson was getting a lot of

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.879 
I think Jenson was getting a lot of
flack<00:05:57.360> in<00:05:57.509> the<00:05:57.570> beginning<00:05:57.900> just<00:05:57.930> because<00:05:58.139> he

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
flack in the beginning just because he

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:00.950 
flack in the beginning just because he
was<00:05:58.979> expected<00:05:59.400> to<00:05:59.430> be<00:05:59.639> an<00:05:59.909> insane<00:06:00.509> mid<00:06:00.750> lane

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
was expected to be an insane mid lane

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.420 
was expected to be an insane mid lane
player<00:06:01.169> like<00:06:01.470> the<00:06:01.620> counter<00:06:01.889> to<00:06:01.979> be<00:06:02.130> Erickson

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
player like the counter to be Erickson
