00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
forget the bike in earthbound I never

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.630 
forget the bike in earthbound I never
use<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:02.709> but<00:03:03.610> that<00:03:03.819> bike<00:03:04.090> song<00:03:04.420> though

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640

so<00:03:06.640> in<00:03:06.790> general<00:03:07.080> gameplay<00:03:08.080> has<00:03:08.590> its<00:03:08.860> pros<00:03:09.100> and

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
so in general gameplay has its pros and

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.280 
so in general gameplay has its pros and
cons<00:03:09.400> in<00:03:09.760> each<00:03:09.940> game<00:03:10.239> so<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:10.569> have<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:11.110> really

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
cons in each game so I have to really

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.830 
cons in each game so I have to really

next you don't really have a set
progression<00:05:38.900> it's<00:05:39.380> like<00:05:39.590> a<00:05:39.620> story<00:05:40.010> it's<00:05:40.220> a

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
progression it's like a story it's a

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.920 
progression it's like a story it's a
narrative<00:05:40.580> it's<00:05:40.970> supposed<00:05:41.270> to<00:05:41.390> be<00:05:41.510> like<00:05:41.690> that

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
narrative it's supposed to be like that

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.190 
narrative it's supposed to be like that
a<00:05:42.460> nun<00:05:43.460> like<00:05:43.640> mother<00:05:43.940> to<00:05:44.210> mother<00:05:44.540> three<00:05:44.930> sets

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
a nun like mother to mother three sets

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.070 
a nun like mother to mother three sets
out<00:05:45.350> to<00:05:45.380> tell<00:05:45.650> a<00:05:45.680> serious<00:05:46.160> story<00:05:46.490> well<00:05:47.360> as

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
out to tell a serious story well as

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.230 
out to tell a serious story well as
serious<00:05:48.350> as<00:05:48.590> the<00:05:48.680> mother<00:05:48.890> series<00:05:49.430> can<00:05:49.790> be<00:05:49.820> and

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
serious as the mother series can be and

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.840 
serious as the mother series can be and
it<00:05:51.170> basically<00:05:51.710> just<00:05:51.830> goes<00:05:52.220> beyond<00:05:52.700> the

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
it basically just goes beyond the

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.810 
it basically just goes beyond the
personal<00:05:53.620> my<00:05:54.620> point<00:05:54.860> is<00:05:55.040> that<00:05:55.070> mother<00:05:55.400> two<00:05:55.640> and

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
personal my point is that mother two and

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.300 
personal my point is that mother two and
three<00:05:55.940> are<00:05:56.060> telling<00:05:56.330> different<00:05:56.480> stories<00:05:56.660> but

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
three are telling different stories but

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.100 
three are telling different stories but
objectively<00:05:58.310> mother<00:05:58.820> three<00:05:59.180> story<00:05:59.570> is<00:05:59.810> more

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
objectively mother three story is more

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.830 
objectively mother three story is more
elaborate<00:06:00.440> carefully<00:06:01.310> constructed<00:06:01.970> and<00:06:02.210> more

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
elaborate carefully constructed and more

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.470 
elaborate carefully constructed and more
significant<00:06:03.770> but<00:06:04.760> does<00:06:04.940> that<00:06:04.970> mean<00:06:05.300> it's

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.480 
significant but does that mean it's

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.400 
significant but does that mean it's
better<00:06:05.920> I'm<00:06:06.920> not<00:06:07.250> exactly<00:06:07.640> sure<00:06:08.230> see<00:06:09.230> maybe

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
better I'm not exactly sure see maybe

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.020 
better I'm not exactly sure see maybe
the<00:06:09.620> fact<00:06:09.830> that<00:06:09.950> mother<00:06:10.220> three<00:06:10.550> built<00:06:10.850> off<00:06:11.000> the

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
the fact that mother three built off the

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.060 
the fact that mother three built off the
battle<00:06:11.480> system<00:06:11.840> and<00:06:11.960> several<00:06:12.380> aspects<00:06:12.950> of

battle system and several aspects of

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.260 
battle system and several aspects of
earthbound<00:06:13.430> means<00:06:13.760> that<00:06:13.940> I<00:06:13.970> should<00:06:14.180> be

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270 
earthbound means that I should be

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.600 
earthbound means that I should be
