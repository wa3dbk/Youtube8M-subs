we'll make sure that we don't have a
passcode<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.799> our<00:01:29.579> device<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.810> swipe

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
passcode on our device so if we swipe

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.440 
passcode on our device so if we swipe
over<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.560> should<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.100> unlock<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.240> we're

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
over it should just unlock so we're

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.270
