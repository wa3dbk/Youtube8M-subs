I've<00:04:23.010> read<00:04:23.250> after<00:04:23.460> doing<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.120> coconut<00:04:24.570> oil

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
I've read after doing the coconut oil

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.409 
I've read after doing the coconut oil
conditioner<00:04:25.350> you<00:04:26.280> don't<00:04:26.610> have<00:04:26.910> to<00:04:27.150> use<00:04:27.389> a

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
conditioner you don't have to use a

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.140 
conditioner you don't have to use a
regular<00:04:27.780> conditioner<00:04:28.169> for<00:04:28.590> anyway<00:04:29.000> so<00:04:30.000> the

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
regular conditioner for anyway so the

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.629 
regular conditioner for anyway so the
point<00:04:30.360> is<00:04:30.800> one<00:04:31.800> of<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:31.980> studies<00:04:32.280> are<00:04:32.310> having

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
point is one of the studies are having

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.210 
point is one of the studies are having
in<00:04:32.730> front<00:04:32.970> of<00:04:33.030> me<00:04:33.150> it<00:04:33.389> says<00:04:33.600> um<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:34.710> affinity

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
in front of me it says um the affinity

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.430 
in front of me it says um the affinity
of<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.580> penetrance<00:04:36.120> of<00:04:36.300> protein<00:04:36.750> so<00:04:37.020> coconut

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
of the penetrance of protein so coconut

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.470 
of the penetrance of protein so coconut
oil<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.860> point<00:04:38.130> is<00:04:38.250> has<00:04:38.760> a<00:04:38.790> very<00:04:39.150> high

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
oil the point is has a very high

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.420 
oil the point is has a very high
affinity<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:40.320> protein<00:04:40.770> which<00:04:41.040> is<00:04:41.130> our<00:04:41.250> hair

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
affinity to protein which is our hair

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.950 
affinity to protein which is our hair
right<00:04:42.120> um<00:04:43.790> sensing<00:04:44.790> has<00:04:45.090> a<00:04:45.120> higher<00:04:45.630> affinity

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
right um sensing has a higher affinity

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.070 
right um sensing has a higher affinity
sims<00:04:46.919> to<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.190> cause<00:04:47.490> seems<00:04:48.389> to<00:04:48.540> be<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.840> cause

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
sims to the cause seems to be the cause

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.510 
sims to the cause seems to be the cause
of<00:04:49.110> difference<00:04:49.620> in<00:04:49.740> this<00:04:49.830> behavior<00:04:50.310> and<00:04:50.490> that

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
of difference in this behavior and that

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.070 
of difference in this behavior and that
behavior<00:04:51.060> is<00:04:51.120> coconut<00:04:51.479> oil<00:04:51.720> actually

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
behavior is coconut oil actually

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.730 
behavior is coconut oil actually
penetrating<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.710> hair<00:04:53.150> this<00:04:54.590> since<00:04:55.590> the

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
penetrating the hair this since the

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.830 
penetrating the hair this since the
process<00:04:55.950> of<00:04:56.190> swivel<00:04:56.460> and<00:04:56.700> this<00:04:56.910> one<00:04:57.150> of<00:04:57.450> hair

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
process of swivel and this one of hair

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.620 
process of swivel and this one of hair
is<00:04:58.560> one<00:04:58.919> of<00:04:59.010> the<00:04:59.070> causes<00:04:59.310> of<00:04:59.520> hair<00:04:59.970> damaged<00:05:00.479> by

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
is one of the causes of hair damaged by

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.600 
is one of the causes of hair damaged by
high<00:05:00.960> growth<00:05:01.260> fatigue<00:05:01.650> hydro<00:05:02.250> meaning<00:05:02.490> water

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
high growth fatigue hydro meaning water

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.379 
high growth fatigue hydro meaning water
so<00:05:03.419> water<00:05:03.660> fatigue<00:05:04.190> coconut<00:05:05.190> oil<00:05:05.430> which<00:05:05.820> is<00:05:06.240> a

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
so water fatigue coconut oil which is a

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.120 
so water fatigue coconut oil which is a
better<00:05:06.630> penetrant<00:05:07.290> than<00:05:07.470> mineral<00:05:07.919> oil

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
better penetrant than mineral oil

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.030 
better penetrant than mineral oil
provides<00:05:09.120> better<00:05:09.570> protection<00:05:09.690> from<00:05:10.530> damaged

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
provides better protection from damaged

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.290 
provides better protection from damaged
by<00:05:11.220> haggle<00:05:11.669> fatigue<00:05:12.260> okay<00:05:13.260> so<00:05:13.320> um<00:05:13.770> all<00:05:14.729> this<00:05:15.060> is

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
by haggle fatigue okay so um all this is

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.570 
by haggle fatigue okay so um all this is
so<00:05:15.900> going<00:05:16.200> forward<00:05:16.440> for<00:05:16.860> that<00:05:16.890> says<00:05:17.160> in<00:05:17.460> an

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
so going forward for that says in an

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.640 
so going forward for that says in an
earlier<00:05:17.940> study<00:05:18.150> the<00:05:18.570> beneficial<00:05:19.110> effect<00:05:19.500> of
