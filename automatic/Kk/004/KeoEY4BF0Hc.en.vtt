bend around all sorts of corners so much

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.740 
bend around all sorts of corners so much
easier<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.790> handle<00:01:51.119> than<00:01:51.210> wrestling<00:01:51.450> with<00:01:51.720> a

and it's time to get digging I'm using a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.100 
and it's time to get digging I'm using a
technique<00:02:16.490> called<00:02:16.550> cutting<00:02:17.030> film<00:02:17.450> I'll

technique called cutting film I'll

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.140 
technique called cutting film I'll
stockpile<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.830> material<00:02:19.280> I'm<00:02:19.430> removing<00:02:19.730> and

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
stockpile the material I'm removing and

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.180 
stockpile the material I'm removing and
use<00:02:20.390> that<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.840> create<00:02:21.020> levels<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.770> fulfill

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
use that to create levels and fulfill

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.050 
use that to create levels and fulfill
behind<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:22.640> wall

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.940 
behind the wall
I'm<00:02:23.210> also<00:02:23.570> carefully<00:02:24.020> lifting<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:24.590> saving

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
I'm also carefully lifting and saving

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.340 
I'm also carefully lifting and saving
some<00:02:25.130> of<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.310> turf<00:02:25.520> for<00:02:25.790> reuse<00:02:26.200> all<00:02:27.200> my

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
some of the turf for reuse all my

some of the turf for reuse all my
services<00:02:27.920> surveys<00:02:28.430> came<00:02:28.730> back<00:02:28.910> telling<00:02:29.210> me

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
services surveys came back telling me

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.630 
services surveys came back telling me
there<00:02:29.420> was<00:02:29.450> no<00:02:29.720> pipes<00:02:30.140> in<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.470> area<00:02:30.710> but<00:02:31.190> what

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
there was no pipes in the area but what

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.940 
there was no pipes in the area but what
do<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:31.790> find<00:02:32.060> I'm<00:02:32.570> very<00:02:32.840> old<00:02:33.050> and<00:02:33.290> rusty<00:02:33.650> pipe

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
do I find I'm very old and rusty pipe

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.190 
do I find I'm very old and rusty pipe
this<00:02:34.520> is<00:02:34.640> why<00:02:34.790> it<00:02:34.850> pays<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.540> take<00:02:35.720> care<00:02:36.020> when

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
this is why it pays to take care when

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.630 
this is why it pays to take care when
you're<00:02:36.350> digging<00:02:36.500> even<00:02:36.920> if<00:02:37.010> you<00:02:37.100> think<00:02:37.460> you

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
you're digging even if you think you

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.780 
you're digging even if you think you
know<00:02:37.820> what's<00:02:38.090> underground<00:02:38.420> now<00:02:39.200> I'm<00:02:39.410> 95%<00:02:40.190> sure

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
know what's underground now I'm 95% sure

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.850 
know what's underground now I'm 95% sure
that<00:02:41.270> this<00:02:41.390> is<00:02:41.510> a<00:02:41.540> redundant<00:02:42.170> water<00:02:42.500> pipe

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
that this is a redundant water pipe

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.530 
that this is a redundant water pipe
because<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.550> only<00:02:43.760> part<00:02:43.970> that's<00:02:44.000> supposed<00:02:44.390> to

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
because the only part that's supposed to

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.570 
because the only part that's supposed to
be<00:02:44.690> here<00:02:44.990> according<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.680> surveys<00:02:46.100> was<00:02:46.550> a

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
be here according to the surveys was a

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.240 
be here according to the surveys was a
gas<00:02:46.880> pipe<00:02:47.180> further<00:02:47.630> out<00:02:47.870> that<00:02:47.900> way<00:02:48.350> but<00:02:49.010> I'm

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
gas pipe further out that way but I'm

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.920 
gas pipe further out that way but I'm
not<00:02:49.490> going<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.700> take<00:02:49.820> any<00:02:50.060> chances<00:02:50.570> what<00:02:50.810> I'll

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
not going to take any chances what I'll

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.690 
not going to take any chances what I'll
do<00:02:51.050> is<00:02:51.200> I'll<00:02:51.320> adjust<00:02:51.650> my<00:02:51.800> levels<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.340> little<00:02:52.460> bit

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
do is I'll adjust my levels a little bit

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.370 
do is I'll adjust my levels a little bit
and<00:02:52.910> I'll<00:02:53.150> cover<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.540> over<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:53.900> leave<00:02:54.020> a<00:02:54.050> mark

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
and I'll cover it over and leave a mark

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.960 
and I'll cover it over and leave a mark
on<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.710> wall<00:02:54.860> so<00:02:55.160> I<00:02:55.190> know<00:02:55.280> it's<00:02:55.550> there<00:02:55.790> in<00:02:55.940> the

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
on the wall so I know it's there in the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.610 
on the wall so I know it's there in the
future<00:02:58.450> well<00:02:59.450> thanks<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.810> my<00:02:59.960> mystery<00:03:00.380> pipe

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
future well thanks to my mystery pipe

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.770 
future well thanks to my mystery pipe
I've<00:03:00.830> had<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.130> change<00:03:01.400> plans<00:03:01.910> a<00:03:02.180> little<00:03:02.300> bit<00:03:02.540> so

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
I've had to change plans a little bit so

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.720 
I've had to change plans a little bit so
what<00:03:03.200> was<00:03:03.380> going<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.650> be<00:03:03.740> dead<00:03:03.920> leveled<00:03:04.310> is<00:03:04.460> now

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
what was going to be dead leveled is now

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.270 
what was going to be dead leveled is now
running<00:03:05.060> uphill<00:03:05.480> slightly<00:03:05.960> I<00:03:06.320> decided<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.070> put

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
running uphill slightly I decided to put

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.160 
running uphill slightly I decided to put
in<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.580> downhill<00:03:07.880> wall<00:03:08.480> first

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
in the downhill wall first

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.590 
in the downhill wall first
to<00:03:09.470> allow<00:03:09.710> me<00:03:09.860> to<00:03:09.890> more<00:03:10.250> easily<00:03:10.520> profile<00:03:11.360> my

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
to allow me to more easily profile my
