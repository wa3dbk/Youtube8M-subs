the jacket still flexible up here so you

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.919 
the jacket still flexible up here so you
don't<00:01:48.979> to<00:01:49.099> worry<00:01:49.220> about<00:01:49.459> that<00:01:49.670> elbows<00:01:50.479> still

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929

have really good range of motion and

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.570 
have really good range of motion and
then<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.110> wrists<00:01:54.410> are<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:54.619> same<00:01:54.830> also<00:01:55.280> I

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.510 
then the wrists are the same also I
painted<00:01:56.149> these<00:01:56.330> black<00:01:56.660> and<00:01:56.929> brown<00:01:57.800> stripes<00:01:58.280> on

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
painted these black and brown stripes on

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.919 
painted these black and brown stripes on
there<00:01:58.789> just<00:01:59.090> to<00:01:59.209> give<00:01:59.360> it<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.479> little<00:01:59.630> bit<00:01:59.840> of

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
there just to give it a little bit of

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:01.479 
there just to give it a little bit of
extra<00:02:00.170> character<00:02:00.709> I<00:02:00.890> think<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.220> turned<00:02:01.399> out

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:01.489 
extra character I think it turned out

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:03.520 
extra character I think it turned out
pretty<00:02:01.910> good<00:02:02.149> it<00:02:02.270> looks<00:02:02.450> gives<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.140> character<00:02:03.500> a

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
pretty good it looks gives a character a

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.589 
pretty good it looks gives a character a
nice<00:02:03.709> look<00:02:03.950> I<00:02:04.039> think<00:02:04.369> and<00:02:04.550> then<00:02:05.060> we<00:02:05.209> went<00:02:05.330> for

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:05.599 
nice look I think and then we went for

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:07.479 
nice look I think and then we went for
the<00:02:05.660> black<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:06.470> gray<00:02:06.619> look<00:02:06.649> for<00:02:07.069> that<00:02:07.250> body

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
the black and gray look for that body

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:09.370 
the black and gray look for that body
armor<00:02:07.759> or<00:02:08.179> undershirt<00:02:08.780> or<00:02:08.869> whatever<00:02:09.110> you<00:02:09.229> want

all<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.060> its<00:02:14.330> pose<00:02:14.599> ability<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:15.980> he<00:02:16.310> can<00:02:16.459> pose

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
all of its pose ability so he can pose

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.360 
all of its pose ability so he can pose
her<00:02:16.879> around<00:02:17.060> just<00:02:17.390> fine<00:02:17.599> like<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:18.219> for<00:02:19.219> the

hip<00:02:19.579> articulation<00:02:19.790> I<00:02:20.689> had<00:02:20.870> to

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
hip articulation I had to

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.930 
hip articulation I had to
I<00:02:21.530> didn't<00:02:21.710> have<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:22.010> I<00:02:22.040> chose<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.460> put<00:02:22.640> in<00:02:22.760> all

I didn't have to I chose to put in all
new<00:02:22.970> hips<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.810> we<00:02:24.530> got<00:02:24.740> rid<00:02:24.980> of<00:02:25.010> that<00:02:25.570> piece<00:02:26.570> of

new hips and we got rid of that piece of

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.220 
new hips and we got rid of that piece of
whenever<00:02:27.650> chaps<00:02:28.130> or<00:02:28.370> whatever<00:02:28.610> it<00:02:28.730> is<00:02:29.390> or<00:02:29.870> was

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
whenever chaps or whatever it is or was

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.840 
whenever chaps or whatever it is or was
that<00:02:30.470> she<00:02:30.620> had<00:02:30.650> they're<00:02:31.010> connected<00:02:31.430> here<00:02:31.610> went

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
that she had they're connected here went

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.700 
that she had they're connected here went
up<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.180> then<00:02:32.300> connected<00:02:33.050> underneath<00:02:33.350> the

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
up and then connected underneath the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.410 
up and then connected underneath the
torso<00:02:34.130> articulation<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:34.880> went<00:02:35.030> down<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.300> this

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
torso articulation and went down to this

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.900 
torso articulation and went down to this
side<00:02:35.630> also<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:36.650> removed<00:02:37.340> that<00:02:37.430> completely

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
side also so I removed that completely

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.880 
side also so I removed that completely
every<00:02:38.270> sculpted<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.840> sides<00:02:39.050> of<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.320> legs<00:02:39.530> and

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
every sculpted the sides of the legs and

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.440 
every sculpted the sides of the legs and
like<00:02:40.070> I<00:02:40.220> said<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.430> rebuilt<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.880> hips<00:02:41.060> in<00:02:41.240> there

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
like I said I rebuilt the hips in there

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.330 
like I said I rebuilt the hips in there
so<00:02:41.960> now<00:02:42.080> she's<00:02:42.320> got<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.530> really<00:02:42.710> good<00:02:42.950> range<00:02:43.220> of

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
so now she's got a really good range of

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.790 
so now she's got a really good range of
motion<00:02:43.520> all<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.390> way<00:02:44.540> around<00:02:44.960> and<00:02:45.410> you<00:02:45.650> can

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
motion all the way around and you can

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.620 
motion all the way around and you can
pose<00:02:46.010> her<00:02:46.220> pretty<00:02:46.520> much<00:02:46.580> however<00:02:46.820> you<00:02:47.060> want<00:02:47.420> to

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
pose her pretty much however you want to

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.490 
pose her pretty much however you want to
really<00:02:48.290> good<00:02:48.970> everything<00:02:49.970> pretty<00:02:50.180> much<00:02:50.500> there

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
really good everything pretty much there

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.560 
really good everything pretty much there
widen<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:51.950> hips<00:02:52.160> a<00:02:52.250> little<00:02:52.280> bit<00:02:52.520> to<00:02:53.240> account

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
widen the hips a little bit to account

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.910 
widen the hips a little bit to account
for<00:02:53.630> that<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.050> she<00:02:54.170> still<00:02:54.380> has<00:02:54.500> this<00:02:54.620> floating

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.170 
for that and she still has this floating
piece<00:02:55.250> here<00:02:55.490> for<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.790> belt

the<00:02:59.810> gun<00:02:59.990> in<00:03:00.140> there<00:03:00.430> but<00:03:01.430> that<00:03:01.790> was<00:03:01.820> pretty

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
the gun in there but that was pretty

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.790 
the gun in there but that was pretty
much<00:03:02.180> it<00:03:02.360> we<00:03:02.510> have<00:03:02.600> a<00:03:02.630> thigh<00:03:03.110> swivel<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:03.680> here

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
much it we have a thigh swivel and here

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.380 
much it we have a thigh swivel and here
still<00:03:04.040> works<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:04.550> then<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:05.209> knee

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
still works and then the knee

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.090 
still works and then the knee
articulation<00:03:05.570> still<00:03:06.470> works<00:03:06.650> pretty<00:03:06.830> well

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
articulation still works pretty well

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.790 
articulation still works pretty well
also<00:03:07.340> didn't<00:03:08.030> do<00:03:08.150> much<00:03:08.270> to<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:09.080> then<00:03:09.620> for

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
also didn't do much to that and then for

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.620 
also didn't do much to that and then for
the<00:03:09.890> ankles<00:03:10.190> I<00:03:10.250> had<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.400> rebuild<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.910> ankles<00:03:11.330> I

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
the ankles I had to rebuild the ankles I

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.080 
the ankles I had to rebuild the ankles I
gave<00:03:12.080> her<00:03:12.260> new<00:03:12.530> lower<00:03:12.770> legs<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:13.459> new<00:03:13.760> ankle

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
gave her new lower legs and new ankle

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.449 
gave her new lower legs and new ankle
articulation<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:14.840> modified<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.500> boots<00:03:15.770> so

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
articulation and modified the boots so

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.860 
articulation and modified the boots so
that<00:03:16.640> she<00:03:16.820> had<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.030> really<00:03:17.270> good<00:03:17.540> range<00:03:17.720> of

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
that she had a really good range of

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.470 
that she had a really good range of
motion<00:03:18.080> in<00:03:18.680> those<00:03:19.100> so<00:03:19.340> she<00:03:19.400> should<00:03:19.730> be<00:03:19.760> about

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
motion in those so she should be about

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.660 
motion in those so she should be about
as<00:03:20.660> poseable<00:03:21.080> as<00:03:21.290> you<00:03:21.500> can<00:03:21.650> get<00:03:21.860> a<00:03:21.890> figment<00:03:22.340> to

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
as poseable as you can get a figment to

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.640 
as poseable as you can get a figment to
be<00:03:22.880> so<00:03:23.120> I'm<00:03:23.180> pretty<00:03:23.360> happy<00:03:23.600> for<00:03:24.020> that<00:03:24.320> and

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
be so I'm pretty happy for that and

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.630 
be so I'm pretty happy for that and
everything<00:03:24.709> worked<00:03:25.130> out<00:03:25.250> pretty<00:03:25.459> much<00:03:25.550> the

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
everything worked out pretty much the

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.920 
everything worked out pretty much the
way<00:03:25.790> I<00:03:25.820> wanted<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.440> as<00:03:27.440> far<00:03:27.830> as<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:29.630> helmet

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
way I wanted to as far as the helmet
