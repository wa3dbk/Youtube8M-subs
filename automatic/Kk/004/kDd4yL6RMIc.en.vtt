00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.100 
Direct X 12 right now as we speak now in
terms<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.189> games<00:00:32.399> coming<00:00:32.700> up<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.180> strongly

believe<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.649> quantum<00:00:35.070> break<00:00:35.570> that<00:00:36.570> that's

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
believe that quantum break that that's

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.470 
believe that quantum break that that's
coming<00:00:37.110> out<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.320> 2015<00:00:37.739> on<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.910> new<00:00:39.059> halo

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
coming out in 2015 I believe titles like

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.560 
coming out in 2015 I believe titles like
that<00:00:42.989> are<00:00:43.170> going<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.440> definitely<00:00:43.710> utilize

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
that are going to definitely utilize

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.040 
that are going to definitely utilize
DirectX<00:00:45.570> 12<00:00:45.800> now<00:00:46.800> um<00:00:47.539> four<00:00:48.539> games<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.899> are

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
DirectX 12 now um four games that are

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.889 
DirectX 12 now um four games that are
coming<00:00:49.379> up<00:00:49.469> sooner<00:00:50.039> like<00:00:50.340> possibly<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
coming up sooner like possibly the the

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.220 
coming up sooner like possibly the the
halo<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.410> 2014<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.430> stuff<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.180> I'm<00:00:54.960> not

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
halo in 2014 and stuff like that I'm not

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.090 
halo in 2014 and stuff like that I'm not
sure<00:00:55.440> if<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:56.039> going<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.570> DX<00:00:57.570> 12<00:00:57.960> or<00:00:58.289> not

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
sure if it's going to be a DX 12 or not

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.310 
sure if it's going to be a DX 12 or not
but<00:00:59.640> that's<00:00:59.760> one<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.149> main<00:01:00.539> reasons<00:01:01.050> why

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
but that's one of the main reasons why

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.290 
but that's one of the main reasons why
I'm<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.250> be<00:01:02.370> watching<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.850> conference
