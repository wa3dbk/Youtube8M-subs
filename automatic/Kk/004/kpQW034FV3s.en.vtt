00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
what robot blood looks like yes yellow

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.830 
what robot blood looks like yes yellow
might<00:02:09.369> actually<00:02:09.519> stand<00:02:10.060> so<00:02:10.390> you<00:02:10.420> might<00:02:10.660> want

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
might actually stand so you might want

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.570 
might actually stand so you might want
to<00:02:10.899> know<00:02:11.230> like<00:02:11.440> it<00:02:11.680> machine<00:02:11.920> oil<00:02:12.190> basically

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
to know like it machine oil basically

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.180 
to know like it machine oil basically
actually<00:02:13.569> actually<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.200> fluid<00:02:14.950> it's

actually actually the fluid it's

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.210 
actually actually the fluid it's
hydraulic<00:02:15.519> fluid<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.480> edible<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.950> can't

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
hydraulic fluid it is edible you can't

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.570 
hydraulic fluid it is edible you can't
eat<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.489> I'm<00:02:21.640> not<00:02:21.790> saying<00:02:22.000> you<00:02:22.090> should<00:02:23.580> they

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
arterial blood shooting at Ron what's

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.809 
arterial blood shooting at Ron what's
connects<00:02:33.810> together<00:02:38.160> this<00:02:39.160> is<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.400> very<00:02:39.640> first

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
connects together this is the very first

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:47.940 
connects together this is the very first
this<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.269> very<00:02:40.390> first<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.590> command

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
this is the very first so the command

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.100 
this is the very first so the command
pod<00:02:50.910> up<00:02:51.910> in<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.180> command<00:02:52.450> pod<00:02:52.599> the<00:02:52.720> techs<00:02:52.930> have

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
pod up in the command pod the techs have

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.660 
pod up in the command pod the techs have
balls<00:02:53.650> just<00:02:53.829> like<00:02:53.890> these<00:02:54.190> you<00:02:54.519> are
