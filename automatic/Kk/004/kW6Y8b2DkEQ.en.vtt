00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:13.449
 but 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.160
 then roberto giordano not only cabaret artist but also the runner what 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.989
 an oversight 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:34.010
 well let's say the knight is my job while I was reading about some 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.620
 it's a passion that is turning into a job 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.220
 It all started when I stopped playing soccer with 95 I didn't have 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.809
 more 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.420
 for possibility of elena 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.990
 armin why 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.390
 therefore working in tourist villages until very late in the season 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.070
 all the preparation in the companions had already begun 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.070
 and then I decided to keep myself in wave form where love is born 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.610
 why 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.920
 for example 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.680
 living in an area where in a few minutes I have the chance to run 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.710
 a seaside walk or in just a few minutes of color 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.740
 super a mountain surely the scenarios are varied so it turned 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.950
 is a city that is very suitable for those who want to run because they want to 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.090
 you have the opportunity to alternate find billy sheehan walk by the shore 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.649
 sea ​​or a walk along the mountains so this was just one 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.570
 a passion that was born that surely 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.320
 the territory to the 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.469
 has helped to make more and more 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.920
 then a passion turned into a job 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.680
 with this program that I have been conducting for 3 years last week in Thailand 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.680
 today in genoa passing through spain 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.670
 goal the transmission on network4 run around the world 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.030
 it is a transmission that we have seen or is experiencing its own success 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.230
 why 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.420
 in the race it is a very simple thing 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.340
 very cheap and also with the possibility of 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.560
 to be able 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.899
 d starts at any stage of life i friends that started running at 60 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.820
 years later a life of sedentary and say 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.900
 thanks to the race I was reborn with this program 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.660
 if we try to get this message through, the run made with 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.689
 1000 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:21.729
 right 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:24.369
 and the characters are therefore with the right ones 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:29.519
 approach that I saw the nights the race faced gradually is 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.879
 surely something that has only benefits there are no contrary aspects 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.639
 on the run so it's all that can be linked to the races and everything 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.699
 healthy because after the first month that makes a terrible effort because later 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:47.169
 200 meters you stop that you have no breath after a couple of months begins to 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:52.479
 acquire a certain autonomy and the results in terms of 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:55.479
 health weight and everything you want to be connected 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.149
 doctorate 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:02.749
 I want tonight 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.989
 that's no good 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.099
 accompanied by home understand that I do not want to look 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.169
 I'm show 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.169
 which rome 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:21.109
 April 2005 you ran in the Sahara desert then toubkal in Morocco 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.290
 like in the movie forrest gamp you feel a little tired 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:28.189
 but look at the end of each 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:32.000
 nigara times you mess with rab and now I rest a moment it's okay to rest a 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:32.719
 moment though 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:37.440
 so many letters are energies that trigger the corsets 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.900
 the fact of being a little tired after a couple of days and obviously disappears 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.279
 make so many rides 

00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:51.529
 sometimes competitions and he can at the 80 - fatima in maurizius tao other races a lot 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:52.479
 extreme 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.520
 surely they leave you then 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.620
 the tiredness standards, however, after a couple of days I repeat is so beautiful 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.430
 go for a run then run in absolute and + total 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.740
 autonomy in the sense of not being conditioned by watches 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.279
 not to be conditioned by any result factor therefore 

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:17.799
 and after a couple of days you get the urge and then you start again 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.120
 icons said here we have a big fortune 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.900
 good morning you can say I run to the sea a day of cycle trembling speed law 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.460
 really i repeat just corpse a bus ticket is flip in 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.870
 air moitié mean 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.840
 dorelan to run to the sea then montelepre hardly 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.029
 per verifiable in any other large Italian city 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:41.180
 Here it is. I'll ask you an additional question like this 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:47.169
 the rediscovery of Genoa. the series of marathon initiatives around the 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.460
 city 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.830
 what do you think of initiatives like for different city different way 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.849
 hd via calculate qi view 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:01.520
 running the city in receiving running or walking the city does not come out 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.789
 see no other part eeee 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:05.000
 a certain way 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.350
 in the best way for machines there are always constraints to enter 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.710
 on the internet in areas with buses of the same size 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:13.539
 is always 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.289
 it is impossible to be able to see all the places in the city which one instead 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.819
 walking or running you can do it again it's true the genoa 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:27.349
 the city that you are discovering very typical foot races 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:29.240
 lara half marathon 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.909
 every year some really incredible growing numbers 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:34.569
 perhaps also because 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:38.819
 obviously it's a joke and sports rarely come down economically to 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.990
 level at no cost to read surrender 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.309
 it's something I do
