00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:29.760 

you<00:04:12.650> max<00:04:13.010> out<00:04:13.280> bets<00:04:13.640> on<00:04:13.909> all<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.420> triplets

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.529 

and<00:04:30.430> once<00:04:30.580> he's<00:04:30.699> on<00:04:30.789> that<00:04:30.910> you<00:04:31.090> just<00:04:31.120> roll<00:04:33.539> now
