00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.479 
comics you know for better or worse is
that<00:04:14.540> he's<00:04:14.720> an<00:04:14.930> atheist<00:04:15.130> despite<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:16.280> fact

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
that the spectre is responsible for him

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.400 
that the spectre is responsible for him
taking<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.370> name<00:04:19.549> mr.<00:04:19.820> terrific<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:21.049> spectre

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
taking the name mr. terrific the spectre

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.920 
taking the name mr. terrific the spectre
is<00:04:21.440> literally<00:04:22.190> God's<00:04:22.520> spirit<00:04:23.210> of<00:04:23.390> vengeance

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
is literally God's spirit of vengeance

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.690 
is literally God's spirit of vengeance
so<00:04:24.140> if<00:04:24.229> God<00:04:24.410> exists<00:04:24.919> then<00:04:25.100> how<00:04:25.250> can<00:04:25.430> you<00:04:25.490> be<00:04:25.610> an

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
so if God exists then how can you be an

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.950 
so if God exists then how can you be an
atheist<00:04:25.970> so<00:04:26.180> it's<00:04:26.479> like<00:04:26.570> it's<00:04:26.720> a<00:04:26.810> big

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
atheist so it's like it's a big

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.030 
atheist so it's like it's a big

Barrowman has

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.350 
Barrowman has
like<00:06:42.140> a<00:06:42.230> broad<00:06:42.470> background<00:06:42.740> a<00:06:43.250> good<00:06:43.940> example

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
like a broad background a good example

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.090 
like a broad background a good example
of<00:06:44.390> that<00:06:44.450> on<00:06:44.660> the<00:06:44.750> flash<00:06:44.990> is<00:06:45.290> Tom<00:06:45.530> Cavanaugh

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.100 
of that on the flash is Tom Cavanaugh

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.520 
of that on the flash is Tom Cavanaugh
like<00:06:46.400> he's<00:06:46.820> probably<00:06:47.090> like<00:06:47.420> the<00:06:47.690> best<00:06:48.080> actor

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
like he's probably like the best actor

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:49.930 
like he's probably like the best actor
on<00:06:48.680> the<00:06:48.770> flash<00:06:49.010> which<00:06:49.310> is<00:06:49.430> why<00:06:49.550> he's<00:06:49.760> probably

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
on the flash which is why he's probably

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.460 
on the flash which is why he's probably
going<00:06:50.210> to<00:06:50.270> be<00:06:50.330> the<00:06:50.450> villain<00:06:50.690> again<00:06:50.780> it<00:06:51.410> just

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:51.470 
going to be the villain again it just

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.960 
going to be the villain again it just
feels<00:06:51.800> right<00:06:51.980> that<00:06:52.190> the<00:06:52.280> best<00:06:52.460> actor<00:06:52.820> on<00:06:52.940> a

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:52.970 
feels right that the best actor on a

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.790 
feels right that the best actor on a
superhero<00:06:53.540> show<00:06:53.780> gets<00:06:54.080> to<00:06:54.290> be<00:06:54.410> the<00:06:54.530> villain

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
superhero show gets to be the villain

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.260 
superhero show gets to be the villain
just<00:06:54.830> because<00:06:55.190> villains<00:06:55.730> tend<00:06:55.970> to<00:06:56.030> be<00:06:56.120> the

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
just because villains tend to be the

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.480 
just because villains tend to be the
most<00:06:56.420> complicated<00:06:56.870> characters<00:06:57.590> you<00:06:58.190> guys<00:06:58.340> can
