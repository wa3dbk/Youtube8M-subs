00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.179
 why there is no rubber in planes 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.349
 american airlines 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.099
 welcome to american 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.740
 airlines 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.750
 thank you for your evil with us 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.609
 captain and now i would like you 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.859
 talk about safety rules on 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.689
 plane so let's start so everyone thinks 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.769
 that flies on the plane is very cool 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.260
 the right stealth is very serious 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.719
 dangers await you around every corner because 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.300
 any moment you can fly out the window 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.460
 and die either freezing or it's soul 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.129
 not due to lack of air and then yours 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.000
 a dead carcass will fly 11,000 meters down 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.100
 break into a million pieces or you 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.059
 can throw the other way up in 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.739
 open space 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.180
 where your body will never be again 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.730
 parents never so let's talk about 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.620
 security okay 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:04.710

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.729
 I use the safety belt you pipets 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.830
 so the government is leaving me 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.150
 explain to people how to do it so we 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.799
 take one end of the belt then we take 2 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.799
 then we put them together like this 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.850
 toni it hurry i can't take it anymore 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.860
 endure it unsafe to shape 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.650
 queues around the toilet so now 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.070
 imposed a limit of 30 seconds on what 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.780
 you do everything to hurry 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.659
 time has already gone Damn oh 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.240
 most are no longer allowed to walk 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.479
 what is this rule generally for 10 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.149
 seconds god not enough time 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:07.179
 protection we've got an intruder who 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:10.119
 shocker what you do is not oxygen 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.739
 masks if cable pressure changes 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.350
 the panel will open on above your heads 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.510
 oxygen masks fall out fix 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.870
 mask yourself on the face and calmly breathe 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.670
 and don't even worry if your masks are 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.350
 oxygen will be inflated anyway 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.060

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.060
 gray masks they work 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.709
 emergency exits if god's volume 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.310

 on the right is terrorism to prevent 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.430
 hijacking terrorists to visit 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:54.989
 crew of all suspicious types 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:59.200

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:02.910

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.519
 so that he can explain to you how he is already 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.519
 tired of seeing days 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.080

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:25.000
 to smoke but allowed on airplanes 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.980
 that they have terrible gas leaks 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.790

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:36.940

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.170
