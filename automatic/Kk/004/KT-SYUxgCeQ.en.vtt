mitosis<00:00:11.180> can<00:00:11.600> be<00:00:11.720> complicated<00:00:12.080> but<00:00:12.560> if<00:00:12.680> we<00:00:12.830> can

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
mitosis can be complicated but if we can

I like to remember these by relating

interface to the word initial and
cytokinesis<00:00:37.910> to<00:00:38.090> completion<00:00:38.480> so<00:00:39.470> before<00:00:39.650> we

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
cytokinesis to completion so before we

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.070 
cytokinesis to completion so before we
begin<00:00:40.370> try<00:00:40.820> to<00:00:40.880> remember<00:00:41.150> interface<00:00:41.780> or

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
begin try to remember interface or

finally<00:04:04.800> split<00:04:05.070> into<00:04:05.370> two<00:04:05.550> so<00:04:06.480> we<00:04:07.020> are<00:04:07.110> at<00:04:07.260> the

end of our sporting event the teams are

end of our sporting event the teams are
finally<00:04:10.200> into<00:04:10.530> their<00:04:10.680> separate<00:04:11.100> locker<00:04:11.340> rooms

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
finally into their separate locker rooms

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.850 
finally into their separate locker rooms
they<00:04:12.270> are<00:04:12.330> packing<00:04:12.810> up<00:04:12.900> their<00:04:13.110> equipment<00:04:13.290> and

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
they are packing up their equipment and

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.190 
they are packing up their equipment and
Knoxville<00:04:14.760> once<00:04:15.030> again<00:04:15.360> be<00:04:15.600> preparing<00:04:16.049> for

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
Knoxville once again be preparing for

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.710 
Knoxville once again be preparing for
the<00:04:16.440> next<00:04:16.709> big<00:04:16.860> game<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.760> cycle<00:04:18.180> starts<00:04:18.570> all

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
the next big game the cycle starts all

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.130 
the next big game the cycle starts all
over<00:04:18.810> once<00:04:19.530> again<00:04:19.680> all<00:04:20.400> in<00:04:21.000> all<00:04:21.150> mitosis<00:04:21.959> can

over once again all in all mitosis can

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.230 
over once again all in all mitosis can
seem<00:04:22.350> really<00:04:22.590> difficult<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.220> understand<00:04:23.760> just

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
seem really difficult to understand just

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.450 
seem really difficult to understand just
remember<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.960> process<00:04:25.380> initially<00:04:26.010> starts

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
remember the process initially starts

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.360 
remember the process initially starts
with<00:04:26.640> interface<00:04:27.260> then<00:04:28.260> goes<00:04:28.620> through<00:04:28.650> P<00:04:29.160> mat

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
with interface then goes through P mat

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.980 
with interface then goes through P mat
and<00:04:30.950> finally<00:04:31.950> completes<00:04:32.790> with<00:04:33.120> cytokinesis

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
and finally completes with cytokinesis

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.710 
and finally completes with cytokinesis

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
easy as shooting a basketball into hoop

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.560 
easy as shooting a basketball into hoop
