and<00:00:39.430> laptop<00:00:39.760> banks<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:42.640> have<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:43.030> 30<00:00:43.330> mil

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:43.659 
and laptop banks you have the 30 mil

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:45.780 
and laptop banks you have the 30 mil
often<00:00:44.320> used<00:00:44.530> on<00:00:44.650> lockers<00:00:45.010> and<00:00:45.129> larger<00:00:45.489> bags

often used on lockers and larger bags

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.969 
often used on lockers and larger bags
and<00:00:46.150> then<00:00:46.510> you've<00:00:46.659> got<00:00:46.839> the<00:00:47.019> 40<00:00:47.440> mil<00:00:47.619> with<00:00:47.769> four

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:47.979 
and then you've got the 40 mil with four

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:50.640 
and then you've got the 40 mil with four
digits<00:00:48.369> and<00:00:48.460> ten<00:00:48.640> thousand<00:00:49.119> combinations<00:00:49.809> for

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
digits and ten thousand combinations for

lock boxes smaller gates smaller doors
and<00:00:53.890> things<00:00:54.010> like<00:00:54.190> that<00:00:55.049> so<00:00:56.049> the<00:00:56.619> padlock

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
and things like that so the padlock

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:01.410 
and things like that so the padlock
itself<00:00:57.369> is<00:00:58.110> really<00:00:59.110> well<00:00:59.619> made<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:01.030> can<00:01:01.210> just

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
itself is really well made you can just

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.530 
itself is really well made you can just
see<00:01:01.659> by<00:01:01.689> the<00:01:01.930> engraving<00:01:02.680> the<00:01:02.920> numbers<00:01:03.540> just

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
see by the engraving the numbers just

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.080 
see by the engraving the numbers just
its<00:01:04.960> general<00:01:05.500> machining<00:01:06.040> as<00:01:06.159> Labour's<00:01:06.970> have

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
its general machining as Labour's have

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.080 
its general machining as Labour's have
put<00:01:07.270> a<00:01:07.299> lot<00:01:07.479> of<00:01:07.630> effort<00:01:07.900> into<00:01:08.080> it<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:09.460> lock

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
put a lot of effort into it the lock

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.910 
put a lot of effort into it the lock
can't<00:01:10.509> be<00:01:10.659> picked<00:01:10.960> by<00:01:11.289> the<00:01:11.320> traditional

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
can't be picked by the traditional

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.380 
can't be picked by the traditional
methods<00:01:12.250> of<00:01:12.369> listening<00:01:12.700> and<00:01:12.789> feeling<00:01:13.240> for

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
methods of listening and feeling for

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.020 
methods of listening and feeling for
clicks<00:01:13.689> so<00:01:14.469> it<00:01:14.590> is<00:01:14.679> excellent<00:01:15.159> as<00:01:15.280> there<00:01:15.490> was

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
clicks so it is excellent as there was

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.200 
clicks so it is excellent as there was
an<00:01:16.119> option<00:01:16.270> for<00:01:16.570> lockers<00:01:16.810> and<00:01:18.060> they're<00:01:19.060> all

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
an option for lockers and they're all

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.630 
an option for lockers and they're all
resettable<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:20.020> their<00:01:20.140> own<00:01:20.289> code<00:01:20.619> so<00:01:21.490> as

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
resettable to their own code so as

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.130 
resettable to their own code so as
you'll<00:01:21.850> see<00:01:22.090> in<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.329> top<00:01:22.359> there<00:01:22.840> is<00:01:22.929> a<00:01:22.960> little

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
you'll see in the top there is a little

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.999 
you'll see in the top there is a little
little<00:01:23.770> notch<00:01:24.130> in<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:25.149> little<00:01:25.390> disk<00:01:25.689> and<00:01:26.009> once

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
little notch in the little disk and once

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.279 
little notch in the little disk and once
you<00:01:27.189> open<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:27.609> padlock<00:01:27.789> at<00:01:28.179> its<00:01:28.299> default<00:01:28.869> code

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
you open the padlock at its default code

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.620 
you open the padlock at its default code
which<00:01:29.439> is<00:01:29.619> three<00:01:30.189> zeros<00:01:30.579> or<00:01:30.759> four<00:01:31.149> zeros<00:01:31.479> in

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
which is three zeros or four zeros in

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.550 
which is three zeros or four zeros in
the<00:01:31.719> 40-mile<00:01:32.200> case<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:33.520> spin<00:01:34.060> it<00:01:34.179> round<00:01:34.560> 180

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
the 40-mile case you spin it round 180

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.700 
the 40-mile case you spin it round 180
degrees<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:37.210> now<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:37.479> need<00:01:37.689> to<00:01:37.869> push<00:01:38.679> the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
degrees and now you need to push the

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.120 
degrees and now you need to push the
shackle<00:01:39.509> into<00:01:40.509> itself<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:41.079> you<00:01:41.649> will<00:01:41.770> see<00:01:41.979> the

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
shackle into itself and you will see the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.599 
shackle into itself and you will see the
knotch

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609

push down in there that means it's in
the<00:01:45.909> reset<00:01:46.270> mode<00:01:46.479> now<00:01:46.749> you<00:01:46.810> need<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:47.020> keep<00:01:47.229> that

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
the reset mode now you need to keep that

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.450 
the reset mode now you need to keep that
press<00:01:48.640> down<00:01:48.969> fairly<00:01:49.929> firmly<00:01:50.259> in<00:01:51.039> order<00:01:51.340> to

press down fairly firmly in order to
reset<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:52.060> so<00:01:53.460> we'll<00:01:54.460> set<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:54.729> to<00:01:55.030> one<00:01:56.340> two

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
reset it so we'll set it to one two

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:03.840 
reset it so we'll set it to one two
three<00:02:00.060> let<00:02:01.060> go<00:02:01.270> and<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:03.100> check<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.490> numbers

are still on one two three and it goes

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:08.609 
are still on one two three and it goes
back<00:02:06.520> in<00:02:06.700> so<00:02:06.939> that<00:02:07.030> it's<00:02:07.179> been<00:02:07.299> reset<00:02:07.749> we<00:02:08.440> can

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
back in so that it's been reset we can

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.859 
back in so that it's been reset we can
now<00:02:08.709> spin<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:09.160> and<00:02:09.610> it's<00:02:09.759> locked<00:02:10.030> now<00:02:10.270> again

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
now spin it and it's locked now again

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.380 
now spin it and it's locked now again
you<00:02:11.020> can't<00:02:11.350> you<00:02:12.010> can't<00:02:12.340> listen<00:02:12.670> for<00:02:12.970> clicks<00:02:13.120> on

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
you can't you can't listen for clicks on

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.110 
you can't you can't listen for clicks on
this<00:02:13.540> lock<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.460> can<00:02:15.670> on<00:02:15.790> certain
