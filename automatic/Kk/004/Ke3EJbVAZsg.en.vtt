00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
25 levels in the in each thing so 25

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.370 
25 levels in the in each thing so 25

levels they are 25 feet here here I mean

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.199 
levels they are 25 feet here here I mean
that's<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.650> lot<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.860> levels<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.790> really<00:02:23.060> give

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.840 
spend hours trying to figure out in this
game<00:02:28.880> out<00:02:29.170> however<00:02:30.430> I'm<00:02:31.430> gonna<00:02:31.580> start<00:02:31.790> with

game out however I'm gonna start with

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.190 
game out however I'm gonna start with
morning<00:02:32.270> because<00:02:32.480> it's<00:02:32.630> probably<00:02:33.020> the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
morning because it's probably the

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.380 
morning because it's probably the
simplest<00:02:33.470> in<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.830> best<00:02:34.010> way<00:02:34.160> teacher<00:02:34.430> so<00:02:35.330> as

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
simplest in the best way teacher so as

pause we have back we have time taken so

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.130 
pause we have back we have time taken so

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
far number of moves and reset level so

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.170 
far number of moves and reset level so
I'm<00:02:48.530> with<00:02:48.800> also<00:02:49.520> on<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.760> bottom<00:02:50.060> we<00:02:50.150> have

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
level one time and moves as well so the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.699 
level one time and moves as well so the
whole<00:02:56.060> point<00:02:56.270> of<00:02:56.420> this<00:02:56.540> is<00:02:56.750> there<00:02:56.930> is<00:02:57.050> a<00:02:57.080> purple

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709

boats<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.959> point<00:03:06.260> of<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.769> game<00:03:06.800> is<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.700> move

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
boats the point of the game is to move

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.670 
boats the point of the game is to move
these<00:03:08.540> boats<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:10.730> let<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.030> driver<00:03:11.500> so<00:03:12.500> that

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
these boats so let the driver so that

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.259 
these boats so let the driver so that
you<00:03:12.799> can<00:03:12.950> slide<00:03:13.220> them<00:03:13.400> out<00:03:15.670> really<00:03:16.670> simple

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
you can slide them out really simple

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:24.990 
you can slide them out really simple
however<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:18.200> does<00:03:18.440> get<00:03:18.650> insanely<00:03:19.160> challenging

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.370 

the<00:03:26.000> height<00:03:26.209> of<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.510> level<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:27.019> are<00:03:27.170> the

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
the height of the level you are the

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.410 
the height of the level you are the
higher<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.910> harder<00:03:29.209> it<00:03:29.329> gets<00:03:30.519> so<00:03:31.519> you<00:03:32.180> have<00:03:32.269> to

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
higher the harder it gets so you have to

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.050 
higher the harder it gets so you have to
really<00:03:32.450> start<00:03:32.989> thinking<00:03:33.019> out<00:03:33.680> on<00:03:33.950> how<00:03:34.640> can<00:03:34.970> you

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
really start thinking out on how can you

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.509 
really start thinking out on how can you
get<00:03:35.209> a<00:03:35.239> mannequin<00:03:35.750> and<00:03:36.040> everything<00:03:37.040> single

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
get a mannequin and everything single

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.610 
get a mannequin and everything single
boat<00:03:37.700> moves<00:03:38.060> how<00:03:38.720> we<00:03:38.780> can't<00:03:39.170> move<00:03:39.320> them<00:03:39.470> up<00:03:39.560> and

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
boat moves how we can't move them up and

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.520 
boat moves how we can't move them up and
down<00:03:39.829> you<00:03:40.100> can<00:03:40.310> only<00:03:40.459> go<00:03:40.670> left<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:41.570> right<00:03:41.780> or

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
down you can only go left and right or

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.620 
down you can only go left and right or
up<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:43.430> down<00:03:43.579> on<00:03:43.850> the<00:03:43.880> ones<00:03:44.120> that<00:03:44.269> aren't<00:03:44.540> and

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
up and down on the ones that aren't and

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:59.410 
up and down on the ones that aren't and
going<00:03:44.900> up

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.210 

so<00:04:00.420> as<00:04:00.480> you<00:04:00.599> can<00:04:00.720> see<00:04:00.870> it's<00:04:01.020> really<00:04:01.440> addictive

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
so as you can see it's really addictive

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.640 
so as you can see it's really addictive

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
going to the next level I like this page

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.170 
going to the next level I like this page
there<00:04:12.959> are<00:04:13.019> no<00:04:13.290> ads<00:04:13.500> I've<00:04:13.800> seen<00:04:14.099> so<00:04:14.340> far<00:04:14.580> pop<00:04:15.000> up

on here and I have pretty much beat the
entire<00:04:17.669> game<00:04:20.450> so<00:04:21.450> as<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:21.660> can<00:04:21.780> see<00:04:22.019> here<00:04:22.260> I<00:04:22.470> had

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
entire game so as you can see here I had

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.400 
entire game so as you can see here I had
to<00:04:23.010> actually<00:04:23.100> move<00:04:23.490> what<00:04:24.450> I<00:04:24.479> mean<00:04:24.690> by<00:04:24.750> thinking

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
to actually move what I mean by thinking

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.409 
to actually move what I mean by thinking
out<00:04:25.620> things<00:04:25.889> as<00:04:26.130> I<00:04:26.250> had<00:04:26.669> to<00:04:26.760> move<00:04:26.910> this<00:04:27.090> yellow

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
out things as I had to move this yellow

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.460 
out things as I had to move this yellow
boat<00:04:27.720> back<00:04:28.760> move<00:04:29.760> it<00:04:29.910> down<00:04:30.150> then<00:04:30.930> move<00:04:31.110> it<00:04:31.229> back

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
boat back move it down then move it back

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.420 
boat back move it down then move it back
over<00:04:31.740> here<00:04:32.100> and<00:04:32.310> down<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:34.070> while<00:04:35.070> that's<00:04:35.190> not

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
over here and down and while that's not

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.210 
over here and down and while that's not
necessarily<00:04:35.940> a<00:04:36.090> hard<00:04:36.419> challenge<00:04:36.950> that's<00:04:37.950> how

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
necessarily a hard challenge that's how

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.030 
necessarily a hard challenge that's how
they<00:04:38.460> start<00:04:38.850> game<00:04:39.060> card<00:04:39.360> with<00:04:39.660> little<00:04:40.320> six<00:04:40.740> and

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
they start game card with little six and

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:48.260 
they start game card with little six and
things<00:04:41.220> like<00:04:41.430> that<00:04:46.010> so<00:04:47.010> it<00:04:47.370> does<00:04:47.669> get<00:04:47.850> hard<00:04:48.090> now

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
things like that so it does get hard now

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.210 
things like that so it does get hard now
the<00:04:48.690> cool<00:04:48.900> thing<00:04:48.930> is<00:04:49.080> new<00:04:49.620> things<00:04:49.889> such<00:04:50.190> as

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
the cool thing is new things such as

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.520 
the cool thing is new things such as
buoys<00:04:50.850> and<00:04:51.180> things<00:04:51.570> like<00:04:51.690> this<00:04:51.750> pop<00:04:52.200> up<00:04:52.229> that

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530
