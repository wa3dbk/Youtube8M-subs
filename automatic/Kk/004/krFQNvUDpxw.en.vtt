cheated in terms of scale in Paris the

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.270 
cheated in terms of scale in Paris the
monuments<00:00:44.050> are<00:00:44.140> done<00:00:44.260> one<00:00:44.500> to<00:00:44.710> one<00:00:44.890> because

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
monuments are done one to one because

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.040 
monuments are done one to one because
you<00:00:45.340> are<00:00:45.370> able<00:00:45.579> to<00:00:45.789> go<00:00:45.910> inside<00:00:46.120> seamlessly

you are able to go inside seamlessly

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.439 
you are able to go inside seamlessly
with<00:00:47.230> no<00:00:47.410> loading<00:00:47.710> so<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.550> exercise<00:00:48.940> of<00:00:49.059> Paris

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
with no loading so the exercise of Paris

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.509 
with no loading so the exercise of Paris
is<00:00:49.570> larger<00:00:50.170> than<00:00:50.289> all<00:00:50.530> of<00:00:50.679> the<00:00:50.769> land<00:00:50.949> mass<00:00:51.219> in

is larger than all of the land mass in

assassin's creed 4 black flag now while
this<00:00:56.589> is<00:00:56.739> definitely<00:00:57.280> awesome<00:00:57.640> to<00:00:58.239> hear<00:00:58.539> that

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
this is definitely awesome to hear that

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.590 
this is definitely awesome to hear that
Paris<00:00:59.440> is<00:00:59.589> going<00:00:59.859> to<00:00:59.980> be<00:01:00.160> more<00:01:00.699> to<00:01:00.879> scale<00:01:01.239> and

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
Paris is going to be more to scale and

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.259 
Paris is going to be more to scale and
that<00:01:02.079> have<00:01:02.350> less<00:01:02.620> cheats<00:01:02.980> than<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:03.519> previous

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
that have less cheats than the previous

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.240 
that have less cheats than the previous
large<00:01:04.780> cities<00:01:05.140> we've<00:01:05.290> seen<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.620> game<00:01:05.770> such<00:01:06.040> as

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
large cities we've seen the game such as

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.140 
large cities we've seen the game such as
rome<00:01:07.030> or<00:01:07.330> florence<00:01:07.390> or<00:01:08.080> what<00:01:08.350> have<00:01:08.590> you<00:01:08.620> I

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
rome or florence or what have you I

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.300 
rome or florence or what have you I
think<00:01:10.150> the<00:01:10.480> wording<00:01:10.960> that<00:01:11.470> Leslie<00:01:11.860> used<00:01:12.040> here

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
think the wording that Leslie used here

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.330 
think the wording that Leslie used here
is<00:01:12.600> quite<00:01:13.600> clever<00:01:13.960> actually<00:01:14.170> as<00:01:14.650> he<00:01:14.800> said<00:01:15.040> the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
is quite clever actually as he said the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.400 
is quite clever actually as he said the
landmass<00:01:15.970> an<00:01:16.390> assassin's<00:01:16.870> creed<00:01:17.110> 4<00:01:17.350> black

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
landmass an assassin's creed 4 black

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.180 
landmass an assassin's creed 4 black
flag<00:01:17.680> so<00:01:18.250> he's<00:01:18.930> pretty<00:01:19.930> much<00:01:20.140> not<00:01:20.650> including

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
flag so he's pretty much not including

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.190 
flag so he's pretty much not including
the<00:01:21.340> oceans<00:01:21.880> in<00:01:22.480> that<00:01:22.810> game<00:01:22.990> because

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
the oceans in that game because

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.290 
the oceans in that game because
obviously<00:01:23.350> a<00:01:23.920> large<00:01:24.460> portion<00:01:25.000> of<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.180> game

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
obviously a large portion of the game

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.820 
obviously a large portion of the game
was<00:01:25.600> sailing<00:01:25.990> around<00:01:26.080> in<00:01:26.260> your<00:01:26.290> ship<00:01:26.590> being

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
was sailing around in your ship being

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.530 
was sailing around in your ship being
and<00:01:27.010> being<00:01:27.430> a<00:01:27.520> pirate<00:01:27.760> and<00:01:27.970> doing<00:01:28.210> pirate

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
and being a pirate and doing pirate

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.770 
and being a pirate and doing pirate
things<00:01:29.010> so<00:01:30.010> also<00:01:30.940> you're<00:01:31.150> not<00:01:31.270> going<00:01:31.450> to<00:01:31.570> clear

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
things so also you're not going to clear

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.270 
things so also you're not going to clear
the<00:01:31.870> ocean<00:01:32.140> when<00:01:32.230> you<00:01:32.290> say<00:01:32.410> the<00:01:32.530> word<00:01:32.680> landmass

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
the ocean when you say the word landmass

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.910 
the ocean when you say the word landmass
now<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.210> CSS<00:01:34.690> creed<00:01:34.960> 4<00:01:35.110> black<00:01:35.170> flag<00:01:35.410> is<00:01:35.890> a

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
now the CSS creed 4 black flag is a

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.790 
now the CSS creed 4 black flag is a
pretty<00:01:36.430> huge<00:01:36.850> game<00:01:37.360> but<00:01:37.900> if<00:01:38.230> you<00:01:38.410> took<00:01:38.530> all<00:01:38.650> the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
pretty huge game but if you took all the

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.350 
pretty huge game but if you took all the
little<00:01:39.040> islands<00:01:39.700> that<00:01:39.910> were<00:01:39.940> scattered

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
little islands that were scattered

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.750 
little islands that were scattered
around<00:01:40.600> how<00:01:41.470> big<00:01:41.740> of<00:01:41.830> a<00:01:41.920> landmass<00:01:42.310> would<00:01:42.580> you

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
around how big of a landmass would you

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.550 
around how big of a landmass would you
really<00:01:43.060> have<00:01:43.180> a<00:01:43.510> lot<00:01:43.810> of<00:01:43.870> those<00:01:44.080> islands<00:01:44.410> of

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
really have a lot of those islands of

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.800 
really have a lot of those islands of
tiny<00:01:45.130> we're<00:01:45.430> not<00:01:45.610> much<00:01:45.760> more<00:01:46.060> than<00:01:46.570> a<00:01:46.630> couple

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
tiny we're not much more than a couple

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.380 
tiny we're not much more than a couple
of<00:01:46.960> treasure<00:01:47.200> chests<00:01:47.740> or<00:01:48.030> what<00:01:49.030> have<00:01:49.180> you<00:01:49.210> of

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
of treasure chests or what have you of

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.940 
of treasure chests or what have you of
course<00:01:49.540> you<00:01:49.720> have<00:01:49.870> the<00:01:49.990> larger<00:01:50.350> area<00:01:50.740> such<00:01:50.920> as

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
course you have the larger area such as

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.520 
course you have the larger area such as
Havana<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:52.810> probably<00:01:52.990> would<00:01:53.230> still<00:01:53.320> be<00:01:53.500> a

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
Havana so it probably would still be a

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.620 
Havana so it probably would still be a
fairly<00:01:53.890> large<00:01:54.160> map<00:01:54.580> if<00:01:54.760> you<00:01:54.820> combine<00:01:55.360> them<00:01:55.510> all

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
fairly large map if you combine them all

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.420 
fairly large map if you combine them all
together<00:01:55.810> but<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:56.860> sounds<00:01:57.070> a<00:01:57.100> lot<00:01:57.220> that's

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
together but it sounds a lot that's

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.070 
together but it sounds a lot that's
impressive<00:01:58.180> if<00:01:58.330> you<00:01:58.360> think<00:01:58.660> about<00:01:58.750> it<00:01:58.930> that

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
impressive if you think about it that

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.280 
impressive if you think about it that
way<00:01:59.410> still<00:02:00.370> it<00:02:00.670> is<00:02:01.030> impressive<00:02:01.420> just<00:02:01.810> not<00:02:02.170> as

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
way still it is impressive just not as

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.550 
way still it is impressive just not as
impressive<00:02:02.590> as<00:02:02.860> it<00:02:02.890> first<00:02:03.310> seems<00:02:03.990> how<00:02:04.990> exactly

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
impressive as it first seems how exactly

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.410 
impressive as it first seems how exactly
big<00:02:06.130> it<00:02:06.250> will<00:02:06.310> be<00:02:06.490> well<00:02:06.730> it's<00:02:06.940> kind<00:02:07.090> of<00:02:07.150> hard<00:02:07.360> to

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
big it will be well it's kind of hard to

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.719 
big it will be well it's kind of hard to
say<00:02:07.690> until<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.289> game<00:02:08.500> is<00:02:08.530> actually<00:02:08.950> released

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
say until the game is actually released

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.729 
say until the game is actually released
it's<00:02:10.390> pretty<00:02:10.569> awesome<00:02:10.750> that<00:02:10.989> the<00:02:11.200> monuments

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739

it's pretty awesome that the monuments
will<00:02:11.860> be<00:02:12.010> recreated<00:02:12.459> one<00:02:12.849> to<00:02:13.030> one<00:02:13.239> and<00:02:13.450> i

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
will be recreated one to one and i

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:14.970 
will be recreated one to one and i
really<00:02:13.960> look<00:02:14.080> forward<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.440> be<00:02:14.710> able<00:02:14.770> to
