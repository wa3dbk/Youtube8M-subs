00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
to complete it at the end of the video

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.370 
to complete it at the end of the video
so<00:00:20.810> we're<00:00:21.810> running<00:00:22.199> 24<00:00:23.300> fancy<00:00:24.300> full<00:00:24.900> hours<00:00:25.109> in

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
so we're running 24 fancy full hours in

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.359 
so we're running 24 fancy full hours in
dakar<00:00:25.650> lands<00:00:26.220> just<00:00:26.400> because<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:28.160> don't<00:00:29.160> know

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
dakar lands just because I don't know

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.709 
dakar lands just because I don't know
why<00:00:30.330> not<00:00:30.679> this<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.830> going<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.040> be<00:00:32.189> my<00:00:32.690> one<00:00:33.690> and

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
why not this is going to be my one and

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.889 
why not this is going to be my one and
probably<00:00:34.230> only<00:00:35.030> competitive<00:00:36.030> standard<00:00:36.719> deck

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
probably only competitive standard deck

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.510 
probably only competitive standard deck
so<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.140> figured<00:00:37.440> I'd<00:00:37.559> minus<00:00:37.860> open<00:00:38.190> bout<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
so I figured I'd minus open bout the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.680 
so I figured I'd minus open bout the
land<00:00:41.480> so<00:00:42.829> 24<00:00:43.829> land<00:00:44.579> sounds<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.270> lot<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
land so 24 land sounds like a lot in the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.139 
land so 24 land sounds like a lot in the
