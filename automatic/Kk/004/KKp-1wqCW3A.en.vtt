200 to 850 in a very short amount of
time<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.519> think<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:22.170> precursor<00:02:22.799> to<00:02:23.040> what

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
time I think that is a precursor to what

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.740 
time I think that is a precursor to what
we're<00:02:23.430> going<00:02:23.549> to<00:02:23.640> see<00:02:23.820> in<00:02:23.940> this<00:02:24.090> market<00:02:24.600> I

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
we're going to see in this market I

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.600 
we're going to see in this market I
think<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.440> gold<00:02:25.650> roller<00:02:25.920> coaster<00:02:26.370> has<00:02:26.430> been

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
think the gold roller coaster has been

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.910 
think the gold roller coaster has been
tough<00:02:26.850> on<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.090> lot<00:02:27.269> of<00:02:27.390> gold<00:02:27.570> bulls<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.200> think

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
tough on a lot of gold bulls I think

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.370 
tough on a lot of gold bulls I think
that<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.910> two<00:02:30.120> context<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.900> market<00:02:31.260> or
