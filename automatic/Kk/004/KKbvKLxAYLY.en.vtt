the<00:02:12.410> bag<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:12.800> disclosure<00:02:13.540> looks<00:02:14.540> like<00:02:14.750> this

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
the bag of disclosure looks like this

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.350 
the bag of disclosure looks like this
and<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:16.250> looks<00:02:16.459> white<00:02:16.790> because<00:02:17.000> like<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.300> said

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
and it looks white because like I said

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.090 
and it looks white because like I said
she's<00:02:17.690> already<00:02:17.959> bleached<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.590> night<00:02:18.800> and

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
she's already bleached the night and

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.059 
she's already bleached the night and
she's<00:02:19.490> already<00:02:19.700> sealed<00:02:20.240> it<00:02:20.510> ok<00:02:20.959> but<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:21.800> like

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
she's already sealed it ok but I like

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.150 
she's already sealed it ok but I like
this<00:02:22.400> because<00:02:22.640> it<00:02:22.970> has<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.420> pre-cut<00:02:24.160> the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
this because it has to pre-cut the

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.730 
this because it has to pre-cut the
predefined<00:02:25.640> holes<00:02:26.300> there<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:27.230> know<00:02:27.470> where

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
predefined holes there so you know where

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.740 
predefined holes there so you know where
to<00:02:27.770> guide<00:02:28.130> your<00:02:28.490> your<00:02:28.820> needle<00:02:29.240> through<00:02:29.270> when

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
to guide your your needle through when

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.150 
to guide your your needle through when
you're<00:02:29.900> trying<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.200> sew<00:02:30.410> this<00:02:30.590> closure<00:02:30.890> on
