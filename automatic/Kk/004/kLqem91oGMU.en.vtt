00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
then but if I did that's pretty cool

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.440 
then but if I did that's pretty cool
blast<00:02:21.120> from<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.450> past<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:23.280> let's<00:02:23.490> go<00:02:23.670> over<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
blast from the past so let's go over the

it's<00:03:49.170> really<00:03:49.410> strange<00:03:49.740> probably<00:03:50.130> attached<00:03:50.430> it

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
it's really strange probably attached it

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.360

I<00:03:50.850> don't<00:03:51.660> even<00:03:51.780> I<00:03:52.080> don't<00:03:52.230> get<00:03:52.680> way<00:03:52.860> cuz<00:03:53.190> they

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
I don't even I don't get way cuz they

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.040 
I don't even I don't get way cuz they
could<00:03:53.580> just<00:03:53.610> given<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.209> regular<00:03:54.360> cannon

could just given it the regular cannon

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.230 
could just given it the regular cannon
piece<00:03:55.400> that<00:03:56.400> would<00:03:56.459> have<00:03:56.610> worked<00:03:56.700> better<00:03:56.880> and

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
piece that would have worked better and

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.150 
piece that would have worked better and
fits<00:03:57.780> one<00:03:58.020> of<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.200> theme<00:03:58.410> but<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.740> catapult

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
fits one of the theme but a catapult

fits one of the theme but a catapult
still<00:03:59.610> pretty<00:03:59.700> cool<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.990> yeah<00:04:01.620> it<00:04:01.830> does<00:04:02.010> fire

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
still pretty cool and yeah it does fire

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.320 
still pretty cool and yeah it does fire
it<00:04:03.810> works<00:04:04.050> pretty<00:04:04.230> well<00:04:04.380> a<00:04:04.850> lot<00:04:05.850> of<00:04:05.880> times<00:04:06.120> when

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
it works pretty well a lot of times when

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.060 
it works pretty well a lot of times when
Lego<00:04:06.630> makes<00:04:06.840> these<00:04:07.020> catapults<00:04:07.590> this<00:04:07.770> brick
