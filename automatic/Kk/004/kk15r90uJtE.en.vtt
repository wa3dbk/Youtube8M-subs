probably the worst teams in the league
right<00:01:32.700> now<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.090> think<00:01:33.240> we're<00:01:33.540> dead<00:01:33.750> last

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.469 
right now I think we're dead last
unfortunately<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.280> picked<00:01:35.520> up<00:01:35.610> eric<00:01:35.939> bledsoe

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
unfortunately we picked up eric bledsoe

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.569 
unfortunately we picked up eric bledsoe
and<00:01:36.780> then<00:01:37.229> he<00:01:37.530> was<00:01:37.650> out<00:01:37.799> he<00:01:38.130> injured<00:01:38.460> himself

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
and then he was out he injured himself

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.330 
and then he was out he injured himself
in<00:01:38.880> his<00:01:38.970> debut<00:01:39.540> game<00:01:39.860> while<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.890> was<00:01:41.130> swimming

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
in his debut game while I was swimming

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.880 
in his debut game while I was swimming
it<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.759> he<00:01:42.570> missed<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.960> whole<00:01:43.110> month<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.530> action

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
it and he missed a whole month of action

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.679 
it and he missed a whole month of action
so<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.220> his<00:01:44.340> first<00:01:44.579> game<00:01:44.670> back<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.119> knew<00:01:45.450> I

and then you know I want them to box out
on<00:04:29.819> the<00:04:30.120> defensive<00:04:30.419> board<00:04:30.960> so<00:04:31.229> that's<00:04:31.800> gonna

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
on the defensive board so that's gonna

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.679 
on the defensive board so that's gonna
be<00:04:32.039> something<00:04:32.520> that<00:04:32.699> we're<00:04:33.419> gonna<00:04:33.479> have<00:04:33.629> to

00:04:33.679 --> 00:04:33.689 
be something that we're gonna have to

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:35.510 
be something that we're gonna have to
pay<00:04:33.840> attention<00:04:34.229> to<00:04:34.349> because<00:04:34.530> I've<00:04:34.860> made<00:04:35.159> every

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
pay attention to because I've made every

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.089 
pay attention to because I've made every
decision<00:04:35.849> you<00:04:36.210> know<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:37.199> know<00:04:37.289> roster<00:04:37.889> wise

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
decision you know you know roster wise

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:41.270 
decision you know you know roster wise
to<00:04:39.110> play<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.349> guys<00:04:40.500> that<00:04:40.650> are<00:04:40.740> gonna<00:04:40.860> rebound

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
to play the guys that are gonna rebound

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.249 
to play the guys that are gonna rebound
the<00:04:41.400> ball<00:04:41.550> better<00:04:41.849> but<00:04:42.689> we're<00:04:42.840> still<00:04:43.110> not

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
the ball better but we're still not

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:44.779 
the ball better but we're still not
rebounding<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.710> ball<00:04:43.919> better<00:04:44.159> so<00:04:44.430> I<00:04:44.460> think<00:04:44.580> a

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
rebounding the ball better so I think a

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.790 
rebounding the ball better so I think a
trade<00:04:45.000> is<00:04:45.150> definitely<00:04:45.689> needed<00:04:45.900> you<00:04:46.469> know<00:04:46.560> even

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
trade is definitely needed you know even

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.409 
trade is definitely needed you know even
the<00:04:46.889> coaching<00:04:47.250> strategy<00:04:47.729> is<00:04:47.909> all<00:04:48.120> about

getting rebounds securing defensive

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.070

possessions ending it with a rebound

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.749 
possessions ending it with a rebound
that's<00:04:52.199> a<00:04:52.349> big<00:04:52.590> thing<00:04:52.830> about<00:04:52.860> basketball

you<00:04:54.090> can<00:04:54.240> play<00:04:54.419> good<00:04:54.659> defense<00:04:54.689> but<00:04:55.199> if<00:04:55.289> you

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
you can play good defense but if you

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:56.899 
you can play good defense but if you
don't<00:04:55.530> end<00:04:55.680> it<00:04:55.770> with<00:04:55.860> a<00:04:55.889> rebound<00:04:56.250> it's<00:04:56.610> it's

Afflalo cuts the lead back down to ten
and<00:05:19.520> that<00:05:20.520> would<00:05:20.669> have<00:05:20.939> be<00:05:21.150> out<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.419> third

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
and that would have be out the third

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:22.909 
and that would have be out the third
quarter<00:05:21.930> would<00:05:22.050> end<00:05:22.229> so<00:05:22.409> we<00:05:22.529> have<00:05:22.620> a<00:05:22.650> lot<00:05:22.830> of

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
quarter would end so we have a lot of

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.379 
quarter would end so we have a lot of
ground<00:05:23.129> to<00:05:23.219> make<00:05:23.310> up<00:05:23.490> in<00:05:23.759> the<00:05:23.849> fourth<00:05:24.120> quarter

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
something I was a little bit concerned

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.219 
something I was a little bit concerned
about<00:05:26.430> but<00:05:26.699> once<00:05:26.879> again<00:05:27.180> we're<00:05:27.629> on<00:05:27.659> the<00:05:27.990> road

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:30.689 
against a Washington team that's just as

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:32.839 
against a Washington team that's just as
bad<00:05:30.930> as<00:05:31.110> us<00:05:31.289> really<00:05:31.710> but<00:05:32.190> they<00:05:32.339> also<00:05:32.490> have<00:05:32.819> a

that<00:07:37.310> would<00:07:37.460> pretty<00:07:37.700> much<00:07:37.820> do<00:07:38.180> it<00:07:38.330> for<00:07:38.539> this

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:38.630

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360 
instead of the second half we would have

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.480 
instead of the second half we would have
had<00:07:44.479> a<00:07:44.510> chance<00:07:44.750> to<00:07:44.900> win<00:07:45.050> this<00:07:45.200> game<00:07:45.490> but
