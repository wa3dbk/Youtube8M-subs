 programs at the console for life 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:33.160
 and today we have testing one of 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.680
 most popular models of this class 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.350
 this model and that of the trophy 46 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.379
 updated version here or right and now 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.059
 Trophy 46 is an all-wheel drive traggie 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.530

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:51.339
 its length is 580 millimeters 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.739
 width 400 5 millimeters height 180 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.719
 millimeters and wheelbase three hundred 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.769
 sixty five millimeters and now 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:03.489
 trophy 46 first entered the market in 2009 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:06.220
 year in 2011 a series of updated model 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.650
 received hardware 2 and 4 gigahertz 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.300
 different body coloring and moisture 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.210
 protected electronics 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.550
 This model is a copy of the hot model. 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.940
 bodies up to 8 tons which was released 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.910
 much earlier than trophy 46 at the base 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.940
 trophy chassis 46 and lies aluminum 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.160
 plate 4 millimeter thick highway 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.650
 additionally reinforced with aluminum 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.150
 plates and metal struts 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.780
 in the front and in the back 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.370
 model is equipped with aluminum racks 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.400
 shock absorbers swivel and 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.340
 semiaxes also made of aluminum 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.160
 mount arms and steering rack model 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.590
 very strong to break something 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.320
 really try the rest of the items 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.290
 made of composite plastic 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.530
 model is equipped with long stroke oil 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.520
 cover shock absorbers and housing 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.490
 made of aluminum 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.400
 there are also anthers on the shock absorbers 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.740
 that prevent dirt for popadenii 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.590
 the model stops responding the other two 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.750
 brakes are customizable independent 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.420
 from each other then note that on 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.000
 models used two types of bearings 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.300
 this can be attributed to the benefits on 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.140
 or trophy 46 is equipped with a series engine 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.590
 nitro star 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:27.490
 volume of 4.6 centimeters cubic 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.920
 which gives out 2.9 horsepower and that 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.000
 allows you to accelerate about 70 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.120
 kilometers per hour 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.850
 the numbers are impressive but for such a powerful 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.090
 motor need a big tank tank here 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.550
 volume of 160 centimeters cubic what 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.730
 allows you to ride around continuously 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.120
 20 minutes kit fear 46 enters 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.209
 equipment top-40 with a frequency of 2.4 dozen 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.400
 gigahertz which has the function fails 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.660
 fail safe works by the following 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.630
 principle 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.060
 if you have batteries in the remote or 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.690
 lost signal with model or inadvertently 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.190
 turned off the remote during skating 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.800
 gas servo automatically 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.260
 translated into brake position very 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.170
 useful thing on models of this type 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.470
 A new model of Moscow can be purchased at 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.769
 an average of 18 thousand 500 rubles was 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.080
 option for 10-12 thousand depending on 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.269
 complete model of modifications 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.280
 preferably after buying the model immediately 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.900
 change servos to others with 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.900
 metal gears 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:35.169
 5 is a bit of a lyric business 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:39.099
 retreat guys I tell you the car 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:42.069
 really cool reliable in terms of running 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:45.969
 nothing broke during operation 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:48.999
 entered as best they could and jumped on springboards 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:53.489
 Well, that just did not do it with running 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:55.239
 does not break at all about the engine 

00:04:53.489 --> 00:04:59.529
 the engine is here 

00:04:55.239 --> 00:05:02.919
 volume of 4.6 centimeters cubic for 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:07.179
 this engine is enough 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:10.419
 acceleration dynamics is a very good model 

00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:13.149
 pretty quickly accelerates here and 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.769
 top speed is impressive many 

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:16.329
 on the forum or there in the same 

00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:20.919
 numerous group VKontakte 

00:05:16.329 --> 00:05:25.229
 ask here what do i get traffic 46 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:28.739
 or the same savage 46 honestly I would take 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.939
 346 because it seems to me this model 

00:05:28.739 --> 00:05:35.079
 universal and you can 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:38.919
 I will try to compete in competitions 

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:41.610
 and in principle towers along the same park and 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:45.639
 and winter clearance allows 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:48.459
 the car is well controlled keeps the road 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:51.999
 not that savage us which when 

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:54.490
 turn immediately begins to tumble but 

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:57.550
 if you take the car 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.360
 but springboards yes here you cleanly want on 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.599
 jump her 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.539
 the savage here will be clearly relevant 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:06.759
 for you we advise making purchases in 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:09.490
 store ercy division point ru 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:12.130
 where is this car worth 19 thousand 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.990
 seven hundred and ninety rubles but all 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:17.880
