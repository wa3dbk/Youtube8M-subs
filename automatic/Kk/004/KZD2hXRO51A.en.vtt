00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.940
 now if we see that it is already ending 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.770
 we just have to wait for it 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:17.799
 open the applications and now yes they 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.799
 I'll show those mistakes that have 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.740
 the cip s 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.560
 What we can notice at the beginning is that 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.100
 the notification bar is a bit 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.000
 wider 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:36.170
 but that's normal 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.100
 so this thing that asks them to start touch or 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.100
 the new launcher 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:46.820
 if we give always then that place 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:51.079
 is going to restart that is the one that is one 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:55.989
 of the two ships that has this is 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.989
 this cip but I'm going to erase this 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.980
 we give him we have to give him only once 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.980
 so that it does not restart cellular 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.360
 ready to eat 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.230
 It has many interesting options 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.720
 First, what is this button here? 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.060
 what it does is show us the 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.910
 notifications like I do not have any 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.360
 it is blank then and what 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.850
 unmarked is going to open this this little 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.020
 normal menu where we can upload the 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.390
 shine or lower it as always true 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.450
 but here it shows us the tablets 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.800
 now we have to give it here in hide 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.960
 hide date and no longer display it 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.130
 we can also activate it to see another 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.890
 time 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.600
 or we can give it here to hide 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.600
 that panel is hidden 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.150
 and this is so that we are all 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.150
 transparent or they show us anything 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.710
 of can be used after 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.320
 also if we leave him crushed here he 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.110
 will restart instead of showing us the 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.400
 options to turn it off restart it or 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.879
 put other options more 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.459
 Well, the truth is, I liked it. 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:25.620
 this little change if you are going to 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.500
 lend here all the very strange color 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.069
 but to customize it we must 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.579
 look for the application that let us 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.579
 it would be this 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.450
 status bar mod to start we can 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.280
 customize to our whim we can 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.930
 put what color here for example be 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:51.890
 all red give you transparency or leave it 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.720
 normal red look like they see change 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.170
 and that's one of the options that 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.450
 they like it a lot or it can be colored 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:04.440
 transparent medium black 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.000
 ready and also the curtain of 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.290
 notifications as you can see me the 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.700
 I left a little red red transparent but 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.069
 I can put it with whatever you want 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.350
 or black if they want 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.100
 They can give you transparency 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.100
 total 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.390
 to see well 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.280
 well that transparency has 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.170
 I really liked this one but it can be 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.280
 that you do not like, that's why 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.870
 who tell them the video so that the 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.299
 can see well 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.980
 and well that has been all I hope that you 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:46.370
 like this is status bar is I 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.769
 they get a page but I did some 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.379
 modifications according to one of you has 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.650
 tried some of my roms can see 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.180
 that the 5 are not of them 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:01.439
 also the 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.840
 this part of here is like that of me only 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:07.890
 it's a personal taste I'll still leave you 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.870
 both the other one is being like 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.299
 the factory 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.740
 I'll do both to see which ones 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.790
 like more 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.840
 and good if everything 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.840
 hope you like
