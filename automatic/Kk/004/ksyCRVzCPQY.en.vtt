 some discouragement due to the delay of 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.920

 does not look at the team of equal 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.900
 in the elite category are those that

 I had quite a lot of cramps on the way 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.130
 I escaped and the one that came in second place 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.440

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.119
 hard and sacrificed and we have trained a 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.330
 little to be able to give as much as possible 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.270
