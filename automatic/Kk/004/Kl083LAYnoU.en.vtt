but will we ever take a ride in a real
space<00:04:58.730> elevator<00:04:59.180> I<00:04:59.450> think<00:04:59.960> it's<00:05:00.080> crazy<00:05:00.200> but<00:05:01.130> I

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
space elevator I think it's crazy but I

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.190 
space elevator I think it's crazy but I
still<00:05:01.970> think<00:05:02.120> it's<00:05:02.210> possible<00:05:02.630> and<00:05:02.900> I<00:05:02.990> think

still think it's possible and I think
it's<00:05:03.290> something<00:05:03.470> that<00:05:03.710> if<00:05:03.830> we<00:05:03.950> can<00:05:04.190> do<00:05:04.370> it<00:05:04.600> we

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
it's something that if we can do it we

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.870 
it's something that if we can do it we
should<00:05:05.630> do<00:05:05.960> it<00:05:06.080> well<00:05:07.040> one<00:05:07.340> thing's<00:05:07.610> for<00:05:07.700> sure

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
should do it well one thing's for sure

should do it well one thing's for sure
we've<00:05:08.600> got<00:05:08.810> a<00:05:08.840> long<00:05:09.170> way<00:05:09.590> to<00:05:09.650> go<00:05:09.860> before<00:05:10.070> that
