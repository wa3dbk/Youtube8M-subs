00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.330
 how good friend, well, here we are 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.280
 with this little tutorial of breeding 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.679
 rodents breeding rodents for 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.070
 our animals for our what 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.930
 it's good in my case the tombola I have 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.020
 this tarantulas also good the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.390
 Tarantula I give him a ping and he 's here 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.910
 I'm going to say what it is that I use and 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.590
 as I do it good to start a 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.990
 outline as this point by basic 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.660
 I put it I put sawdust there 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.970
 who use this what it is I think I 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.760
 it seems that it is called connection that is 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.340
 so that it absorbs a little bit the evil 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.040
 smell of the ring and I feed them 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.420
 croquette croquettes for dogs 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:53.350
 and here is your baby this apart from the 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:58.070
 Croquettes I'm also on this route 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:01.280
 the apple is not recommended to give them 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:05.030
 this citrus as what is tangerines 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:09.670
 oranges for the vitamin in vitamin c 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.670
 It does not make girls very well 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.170
 the top have to be clean 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.170
 as you always know 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.369
 me in this cap 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:36.960
 5 I have nothing else here 627 rodents and 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:41.460
 to wash it I am an atomizer is 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.850
 Chlorinated water the dry thousand with 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.920
 papers with virtual being and well then 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.959
 here is my sawdust 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.689
 this is very cheap really very easy 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:54.539
 to get it 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.909
 is what I have of substrates then 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.500
 what are we going to do 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.039
 obviously this always has to be 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.469
 well well clean thick because if 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:08.090
 we had delgadito and you can get in 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.090
 the eyes of the mouse 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.750
 some other instruction then it's not 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.730
 highly recommended that it be thin is not 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.960
 good newspaper to me I do not like it here 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:27.540
 but if it's okay to make wine or eat there 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.540
 who use hills of better 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.530
 a little bit clearer but good 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:37.019

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.030

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.680
 is the care of the pythons to me 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.469
 they like tarantulas I also have 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.420
 scorpions and I like gaps in 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:48.239
 hollows I do not have much experience but 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.310
