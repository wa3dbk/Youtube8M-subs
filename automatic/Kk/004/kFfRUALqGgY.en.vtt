00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.130
 simple as basically all my recipes 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.510
 and she's completely natural and she 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.809

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.800
 perfect scissors and so is my mask 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.890
 consists of three ingredients but if you 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.020
 want it can be just two 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.110
 The main masked loans are not 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.680
 eat cute oatmeal and the same here they say from 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.510
 which I cookies recently here 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.210
 but I absolutely like it because 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.340
 what 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.860
 just such simple ingredients he has 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.880
 very good health actions for 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.560
 skin for everything is just incredible and 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.500
 the third ingredient in this mask will be 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.420
 essential oil your essential oil 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.790
 choice to anyone you like 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.300
 maybe lavender i usually choose 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.130
 Oils Essential oils of seeds and carrots for 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.790
 me it fits best and me 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.270
 love the effect of this oil 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.159
 so usually masked i use 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.760
 last time basque oil aspen bar 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.700
 making this mask is very easy first 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.860
 you will need to take your oatmeal 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.020
 this is the usual quick oatmeal 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.380
 cooking and grind and in 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:49.010
 processor the less the better i usually 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.979
 I take two tablespoons and it is enough for 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:55.100
 a very long time 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.860
 then you will need honey i have 1 min 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.180
 no shops i bought it on the farm from 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:06.229
 a farmer so she is absolutely organic 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.289
 healthy and healthy but on my dog 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.939
 I will say that for masks and the most common honey 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.680
 from the store works very efficiently and 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:16.390
 oils first thing we put one 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.170
 teahouse 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:25.120
 the school swept away the hosted and 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:28.870
 and in it I put one spoon of honey and here I am 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:34.000
 I put some three drops of essential oil 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:36.100
 of your choice if it seems to me that the mask 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.840
 a little tired this i add more 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.500
 one spoon we mean two 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.709
 spoons of honey for one teaspoon of oatmeal 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.900
 and mix and put everything on your face and 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:52.870
 then i hold her for about 15 minutes i usually go 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:56.769
 I lay down 15 minutes of relaxation because 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.890
 when you lie then this mask is not for you 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:02.110
 dripping eyes because she is pretty 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.820
 liquid and you do not want what you dripped 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.080
 eyes because essential oils will 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:10.480
 very pinching after 15 minutes you flush 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.450
 mask with warm water and after that 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.750
 apply your day cream and so now I 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.320
 I'll tell you a little about hot mela why he 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.750
 don't like i read the reverse here in 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:27.100
 this book I usually take all the recipes from 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:30.310
 this book tells all 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.790
 the ingredients we use 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.690
 every day fruits and vegetables he dare very 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.010
 useful book 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:42.250
 and here in this book it is written that oatmeal 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:46.900
 it has a very wonderful effect on the skin 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:50.310
 she bleaches all damage if they 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.260
 solar damage was done all 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:58.510
 spots that you have on your skin 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:02.380
 they are from the world oatmeal contributes to them 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:05.730
 bleaching and also to this in everyones 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.829
 contains beta glucan which 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.450
 when you put it on your skin she 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:14.109
 takes root in their skin and helps 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.579
 made to your natural 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:21.970
 collagen which promotes elasticity 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:24.580
 your skin it promotes rotation 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.410
 small wrinkles well, that is, it is very 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.040
 useful 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:33.960
 mask gradient and when you apply 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:36.420
 the mask itself then oatmeal it serves its 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.930
 kind of a crab that is after you 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:42.900

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.660
