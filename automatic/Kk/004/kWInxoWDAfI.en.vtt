I've not heard of anything like this i

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.700 
I've not heard of anything like this i
mean<00:00:05.339> i<00:00:05.580> think<00:00:05.640> it's<00:00:06.000> it's<00:00:06.330> it's<00:00:07.140> sometimes

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
mean i think it's it's it's sometimes

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.650 
mean i think it's it's it's sometimes
happened<00:00:08.189> in<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.550> race<00:00:08.790> where<00:00:09.090> somebody<00:00:09.599> has

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
happened in a race where somebody has

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.180 
happened in a race where somebody has
decided<00:00:10.380> they<00:00:10.469> didn't<00:00:10.679> want<00:00:10.710> someone<00:00:11.099> to

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
decided they didn't want someone to

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.129 
decided they didn't want someone to
overtake<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:12.410> they<00:00:13.410> have<00:00:13.769> not<00:00:14.700> been<00:00:14.820> able<00:00:14.969> to

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
overtake and they have not been able to

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.599 
overtake and they have not been able to
resist<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.260> temptation<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:16.949> prevent<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
resist the temptation to prevent the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.490 
resist the temptation to prevent the
person<00:00:18.210> from<00:00:18.390> overtaking<00:00:18.750> my<00:00:18.930> crashing<00:00:19.289> into

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
person from overtaking my crashing into

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.420 
person from overtaking my crashing into
them<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:20.039> has<00:00:20.520> happened<00:00:20.970> that's<00:00:21.180> kind<00:00:21.570> of

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
them so that has happened that's kind of

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.200 
them so that has happened that's kind of
something<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.670> happens<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.000> sport<00:00:24.180> but

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
something that happens to the sport but

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.790 
something that happens to the sport but
usually<00:00:24.660> what<00:00:24.779> happens<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:25.199> those<00:00:25.289> incidents

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
usually what happens in those incidents

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.339 
usually what happens in those incidents
is<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.400> stewards<00:00:27.090> will<00:00:27.210> take<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> pretty

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
is that the stewards will take a pretty

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.660 
is that the stewards will take a pretty
dim<00:00:28.560> view<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:29.010> sort<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.250> thing<00:00:29.310> but<00:00:29.609> to

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
dim view of that sort of thing but to

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.690 
dim view of that sort of thing but to
actually<00:00:30.470> create<00:00:31.820> an<00:00:32.820> accident<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.570> order<00:00:33.989> for

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
actually create an accident in order for

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.130 
actually create an accident in order for
the<00:00:35.700> race<00:00:35.880> strategy<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.600> work<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:36.989> their<00:00:37.079> favor

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
the race strategy to work in their favor

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.170 
the race strategy to work in their favor
and<00:00:37.559> then<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.920> other<00:00:38.190> team<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.940> quite

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
and then the other team this is quite

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.119 
and then the other team this is quite
deep<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.570> think<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.050> then<00:00:40.350> something<00:00:40.890> quite

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
deep I think and then something quite

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.799 
deep I think and then something quite
new<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:41.969> difficult<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.390> talk<00:00:42.510> about<00:00:42.660> this

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
new it is difficult to talk about this

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.569 
new it is difficult to talk about this
because<00:00:43.020> there's<00:00:43.320> still<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> lot<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.399> we

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
because there's still a lot that we

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.400 
because there's still a lot that we
don't<00:00:44.700> really<00:00:44.850> know<00:00:45.090> for<00:00:45.120> certain<00:00:45.450> but<00:00:46.260> it's

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
don't really know for certain but it's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.920 
don't really know for certain but it's
not<00:00:46.559> good<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:46.770> Formula<00:00:47.190> One<00:00:47.809> whichever<00:00:48.809> way

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
not good for Formula One whichever way

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.900 
not good for Formula One whichever way
you<00:00:48.989> look<00:00:49.110> at<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.430> think<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:50.850> is

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
you look at it and I think that this is

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.880 
you look at it and I think that this is
not<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.360> can't<00:00:51.629> look<00:00:51.809> at<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.260> total

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
not you can't look at this in total

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.770 
not you can't look at this in total
isolation<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.730> there's<00:00:53.940> obviously<00:00:54.329> lots<00:00:54.449> of

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
isolation that there's obviously lots of

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.660 
isolation that there's obviously lots of
pressures<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.289> come<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.590> bear<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:55.949> all<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
pressures that come to bear on all the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.970 
pressures that come to bear on all the
players<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.750> drivers<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.379> team<00:00:58.559> owners

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
players the drivers the team owners

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.670 
players the drivers the team owners
within<00:00:59.730> Formula<00:01:00.149> One<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:01.350> think<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.620> is

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
within Formula One and I think this is

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.650 
within Formula One and I think this is
more<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.250> symptom<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.940> something<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.480> much

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
more a symptom of something that is much

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.560 
more a symptom of something that is much
more<00:01:03.930> deep<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> problem

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
more deep that is that as a problem

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.030 
more deep that is that as a problem
perhaps<00:01:06.869> with<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.229> sport<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:07.950> very

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
perhaps with the sport it's very

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.700 
perhaps with the sport it's very
difficult<00:01:08.280> as<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:09.060> young<00:01:09.299> driver<00:01:09.500> coming<00:01:10.500> into

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
difficult as a young driver coming into

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.399 
difficult as a young driver coming into
the<00:01:10.799> sport<00:01:11.390> 22<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.689> know<00:01:12.810> exactly<00:01:13.229> what's

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
the sport 22 to know exactly what's

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.080 
the sport 22 to know exactly what's
right<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.650> what's<00:01:13.979> wrong<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.250> mean<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.939> only

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
right and what's wrong I mean you only

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.310 
right and what's wrong I mean you only
have<00:01:15.240> your<00:01:15.330> conscience<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:15.930> your<00:01:16.080> guide<00:01:16.290> in

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
have your conscience as your guide in

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.990 
have your conscience as your guide in
this<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.280> sort<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.490> instance<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:17.970> I

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
this in this sort of instance and I

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.760 
this in this sort of instance and I
would<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.299> would<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.600> hoped<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:19.259> any<00:01:19.409> driver

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
would I would have hoped that any driver

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.980 
would I would have hoped that any driver
if<00:01:20.070> they've<00:01:20.220> been<00:01:20.340> asked<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.759> do<00:01:21.509> something<00:01:21.659> a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
if they've been asked to do something a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.640 
if they've been asked to do something a
which<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.350> dangerous<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.340> B<00:01:23.670> which<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.650> that

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
which is dangerous and B which is that

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.060 
which is dangerous and B which is that
perhaps<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.040> little<00:01:26.130> bit<00:01:27.439> questionable<00:01:28.439> like

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
perhaps a little bit questionable like

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.190 
perhaps a little bit questionable like
that<00:01:29.280> they<00:01:30.150> would<00:01:30.329> say<00:01:30.509> I'm<00:01:30.780> not<00:01:30.840> going<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.140> do

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
that they would say I'm not going to do

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.460 
that they would say I'm not going to do
it<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.530> you'd<00:01:31.799> hope<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.220> but<00:01:33.060> if<00:01:33.479> your<00:01:33.960> job<00:01:34.350> is

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
it I you'd hope that but if your job is

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.640 
it I you'd hope that but if your job is
on<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.619> line<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:36.020> you<00:01:37.020> know<00:01:37.140> youth<00:01:37.320> you're

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
on the line and you know youth you're

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.399 
on the line and you know youth you're
under<00:01:37.890> contract<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.640> all<00:01:38.909> those<00:01:39.090> things

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
under contract and all those things

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.330 
under contract and all those things
sometimes<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.710> have<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.979> obey<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
sometimes you have to obey the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.160 
sometimes you have to obey the
instructions<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.000> team<00:01:42.720> owner<00:01:42.930> but<00:01:43.140> I

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
instructions of the team owner but I

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.249 
instructions of the team owner but I
think<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.189> down<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259
