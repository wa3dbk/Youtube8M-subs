00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.519
 it was interesting as you say ah 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.389
 it was in italy back up the water that 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.910
 selected six trophies 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.160
 championships young and before that was 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.779
 much more fit 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.039
 sometimes it was much younger 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.380
 that she would count five career themes 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.869
 I never think I could come in 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.000
 more people that year dÃ©ziel 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:38.070
 just before the f1 world champion that 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.270
 the selections in holland with even 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.239
 again I thought no more 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.340
 skeptics that day and why that 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.739
 walk and then I would like if I had 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.180
 a lot of sick people with a lot 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.910
 tinker for owns seven days for 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.829
 his troops to make games of equipped 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.090
 before losing there was a lot of 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.550
 shouts left that moment there as well 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.410
 than me but I 'll be a day going 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.799
 wrong that seems like jazz was 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.930
 on the side of the less good and Russia 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.520
 who was with me I find myself in the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.110
 good breakaway in the end they had 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.630
 three teammates with me it was a 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.369
 bad waking this contest that easy 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.659
 to go to say when I left at 3 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.030
 km the arrival a few seconds advanced 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:24.960
 kageyu scolari so it's done 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.970
 now 22 September that there is no 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.650
 of Dutch who won champions the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.159
 world championship and why they 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.890
 did not win 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.590
 is it because there is something missing 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.479
 something that announces this unpreparedness 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.030
 specific for the chicken is this 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.710
 day and menard who surrender 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.380
 maybe they will do it and why 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.539
 not this year it would make you happy 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.219
 of course it's nice because it 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.259
 that even if he's a little bit of a bike 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.450
 this one alan ball but they do 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.000
 a lot of effort to do it for 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.959
 all the sport it took refuge camp 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.959
 dutch who sells
