00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.130 
didn't have the foresight really to
prepare<00:03:27.960> it's<00:03:28.960> extremely<00:03:29.440> rugged<00:03:29.860> Canyon<00:03:31.140> but

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
prepare it's extremely rugged Canyon but

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.130 
prepare it's extremely rugged Canyon but
it<00:03:32.260> has<00:03:32.500> almost<00:03:33.100> a<00:03:33.310> year-round<00:03:33.610> water<00:03:34.390> flow<00:03:34.750> so

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
it has almost a year-round water flow so

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.040 
it has almost a year-round water flow so
I<00:03:35.170> makes<00:03:35.380> it<00:03:35.530> extremely<00:03:35.800> attractive<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.870> it's

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
I makes it extremely attractive and it's

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.530 
I makes it extremely attractive and it's
the<00:03:38.260> probably<00:03:38.800> quickest<00:03:39.700> most<00:03:39.910> accessible

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
the probably quickest most accessible

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.360 
the probably quickest most accessible
place<00:03:40.900> into<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.410> national<00:03:41.800> forest<00:03:42.160> adventure

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
place into the national forest adventure

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.030 
place into the national forest adventure
okay
