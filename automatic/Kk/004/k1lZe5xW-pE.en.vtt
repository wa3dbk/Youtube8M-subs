if processing power is is not is is

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.019 
if processing power is is not is is
adequate<00:00:04.220> given<00:00:05.220> today's<00:00:05.460> technology<00:00:06.000> so

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
adequate given today's technology so

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.120 
adequate given today's technology so
that's<00:00:06.299> not<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.509> limiting<00:00:06.810> step<00:00:07.020> so<00:00:07.710> we<00:00:07.830> very

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
that's not a limiting step so we very

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.940 
that's not a limiting step so we very
very<00:00:08.460> recently<00:00:08.970> exploited<00:00:09.719> these<00:00:10.679> are

very recently exploited these are

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.339 
very recently exploited these are

arranged<00:00:13.679> ours<00:00:13.920> in<00:00:14.549> our<00:00:14.730> technology

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
arranged ours in our technology

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.529 
arranged ours in our technology
conventional<00:00:16.049> systems<00:00:17.119> typically<00:00:18.119> are<00:00:18.330> very

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
conventional systems typically are very

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.859 
conventional systems typically are very
very<00:00:18.779> done<00:00:19.080> they<00:00:19.350> don't<00:00:19.850> adapt<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:21.210> train<00:00:21.539> and

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
very done they don't adapt to train and

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.380 
very done they don't adapt to train and
if<00:00:22.859> they<00:00:23.070> do<00:00:23.130> there's<00:00:23.519> one<00:00:23.670> product<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.090> does

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
if they do there's one product that does

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.179 
if they do there's one product that does
but<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.750> doesn't<00:00:24.990> adapt<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.529> human-like<00:00:25.949> way

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
but it doesn't adapt in a human-like way

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.820 
but it doesn't adapt in a human-like way
and<00:00:26.519> also<00:00:27.269> takes<00:00:27.539> several<00:00:27.960> steps<00:00:28.230> percha

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
and also takes several steps percha

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.429 
and also takes several steps percha
conversion<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:30.300> our<00:00:30.480> goal<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.960> have<00:00:31.410> a

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
conversion so our goal is to have a

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.770 
conversion so our goal is to have a
memory<00:00:31.830> lift<00:00:32.070> system<00:00:32.460> from<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.120> other<00:00:33.300> two<00:00:33.600> to

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
memory lift system from the other two to

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.160 
memory lift system from the other two to
talk<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.399> and<00:00:35.399> then<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.809> situation

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
talk to you and then in that situation

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.470 
talk to you and then in that situation
immediately<00:00:37.649> turn<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.430> step<00:00:38.670> off<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.450> curb

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
immediately turn and step off the curb

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.690 
immediately turn and step off the curb
and<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.469> system<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.920> immediately<00:00:41.430> know<00:00:41.670> that

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
and the system to immediately know that

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.580 
and the system to immediately know that
I'm<00:00:41.969> stepping<00:00:42.360> off<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> curb<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
I'm stepping off a curb and to do the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.740 
I'm stepping off a curb and to do the
right<00:00:43.770> thing<00:00:45.770> so<00:00:46.770> again<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.629> terms<00:00:48.629> of

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
right thing so again it's in terms of

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.260 
right thing so again it's in terms of
computation<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:49.950> very<00:00:50.250> very<00:00:50.700> very<00:00:51.030> low

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
computation it's very very very low

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.060 
computation it's very very very low
what's<00:00:51.809> more<00:00:52.050> important<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.829> power

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
what's more important is the power

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.189 
what's more important is the power
consumption<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.300> processor<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.930> needs<00:00:55.110> to

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
consumption of the processor it needs to

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.639 
consumption of the processor it needs to
be<00:00:55.320> very<00:00:55.530> very<00:00:55.680> low<00:00:56.270> so<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:58.020> get<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.320> battery

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
be very very low so to get that battery

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.849 
be very very low so to get that battery
life<00:00:59.340> spec<00:00:59.870> what<00:01:00.870> has<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.230> happen<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.680> when<00:01:01.829> I

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
life spec what has to happen is when I

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.670 
life spec what has to happen is when I
sit<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.460> stand<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:03.690> has<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.019> detect<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.559> I'm

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
sit and stand it has to detect that I'm

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.130 
sit and stand it has to detect that I'm
sitting<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.189> standing<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.880> immediately<00:01:06.840> a

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
sitting or standing and immediately a

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.870 
sitting or standing and immediately a
short<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.590> motor<00:01:07.770> leads<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.310> safety<00:01:08.700> and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
short the motor leads for safety and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.450 
short the motor leads for safety and
shut<00:01:09.420> down<00:01:09.600> all<00:01:09.900> sis<00:01:10.409> phenix<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.950> keep<00:01:11.250> only

shut down all sis phenix and keep only

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.789 
shut down all sis phenix and keep only
one<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.119> longer<00:01:12.570> life<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.650> when<00:01:13.770> I

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
one and so longer life so that when I

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.620 
one and so longer life so that when I
start<00:01:14.130> moving<00:01:14.460> again<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.150> detect<00:01:15.420> that

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
start moving again we can detect that

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.899 
start moving again we can detect that
movement<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.200> turn<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.920> system<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.880> as

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
movement and turn on the system so as

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.090 
movement and turn on the system so as
soon<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.390> stand<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.990> needs<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.320> shut<00:01:19.560> down<00:01:19.619> to

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
soon as I stand it needs to shut down to

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.690 
soon as I stand it needs to shut down to

walk down a hill or steps the robot will

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.660 
walk down a hill or steps the robot will
take<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.080> load<00:01:49.289> and<00:01:49.369> then<00:01:50.369> when<00:01:50.520> they're

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
take that load and then when they're

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.279 
take that load and then when they're
walking<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:51.119> level<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.570> will<00:01:51.630> decrease<00:01:51.869> the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
didn't bring my phone here but my phone
can<00:02:08.160> talk<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.610> my<00:02:08.729> ankles<00:02:09.500> so<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.560> can<00:02:10.769> program

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
can talk to my ankles so I can program
