00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.070 
sure you have a hose clamp and get this
is<00:00:17.910> loose<00:00:18.300> as<00:00:18.690> possible<00:00:20.600> there<00:00:21.600> we<00:00:21.720> go<00:00:21.840> we<00:00:22.020> have

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
is loose as possible there we go we have

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.859 
is loose as possible there we go we have
little<00:00:22.470> playing<00:00:22.740> there<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.910> whenever<00:00:24.510> you're

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
little playing there so whenever you're

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.929 
little playing there so whenever you're
looking<00:00:25.140> at<00:00:25.230> your<00:00:25.380> carburetor<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.490> part<00:00:26.789> that

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
looking at your carburetor the part that

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.509 
looking at your carburetor the part that
you<00:00:27.060> want<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.420> plug<00:00:27.570> into<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.990> engine<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
you want to plug into the engine is the

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.600 
you want to plug into the engine is the
area<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.210> releases<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.260> fuel<00:00:31.560> air<00:00:31.859> mixture

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
area that releases the fuel air mixture

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.970 
area that releases the fuel air mixture
now<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.719> lot<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.989> carburetors<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.710> looks

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
now in a lot of carburetors this looks

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.190 
now in a lot of carburetors this looks
the<00:00:35.250> same<00:00:35.489> as<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.820> area<00:00:36.360> where<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.780> air<00:00:36.960> is

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
the same as the area where the air is

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.380 
the same as the area where the air is
coming<00:00:37.380> into<00:00:37.739> your<00:00:38.070> carburetor<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:39.120> how<00:00:39.329> can

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
coming into your carburetor so how can

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.690 
coming into your carburetor so how can
you<00:00:39.660> tell<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.020> difference<00:00:40.050> well<00:00:41.040> an<00:00:41.190> easy<00:00:41.399> way

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
you tell the difference well an easy way

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.190 
you tell the difference well an easy way
where<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.000> can<00:00:42.149> tell<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.329> difference<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.960> if

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
where you can tell the difference is if

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.069 
where you can tell the difference is if
you<00:00:43.500> look<00:00:43.770> where<00:00:44.070> your<00:00:44.190> throttle<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.079> where

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
you look where your throttle is where

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.110 
you look where your throttle is where
the<00:00:46.230> throttle<00:00:46.590> cable<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.129> go<00:00:47.280> you

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
the throttle cable is going to go you

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.299 
the throttle cable is going to go you
see<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.450> little<00:00:48.719> door<00:00:48.930> right<00:00:49.200> there<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:50.070> is

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
see that little door right there this is

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.910 
see that little door right there this is
the<00:00:50.460> area<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.030> goes<00:00:51.390> into<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.870> engine<00:00:52.050> now

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
the area that goes into the engine now

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.920 
the area that goes into the engine now
also<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.489> lot<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.879> carburetors<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.600> hoses

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
also on a lot of carburetors the hoses

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.840 
also on a lot of carburetors the hoses
are<00:00:55.079> different<00:00:55.410> sizes<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> only

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
are different sizes so this is the only

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.090 
are different sizes so this is the only
side<00:00:57.149> that's<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> fit<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.859> you

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
side that's going to fit it in but I you

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.040 
side that's going to fit it in but I you
know<00:00:59.160> that's<00:00:59.520> also<00:00:59.789> another<00:01:00.000> way<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.300> tell<00:01:00.600> so

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
know that's also another way to tell so

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.759 
know that's also another way to tell so
go<00:01:01.260> ahead<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.530> carefully<00:01:02.399> slide<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:03.769> into

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
go ahead and carefully slide this into

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.590 
go ahead and carefully slide this into
the<00:01:04.860> intake<00:01:05.280> manifold<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.090> your<00:01:06.180> engine<00:01:06.510> you

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
the intake manifold and your engine you

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.700 
the intake manifold and your engine you
actually<00:01:06.869> want<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.080> be<00:01:07.200> really<00:01:07.530> careful

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
actually want to be really careful

filter is going to go and these extra
hoses<00:01:52.290> are<00:01:52.439> for<00:01:52.860> something<00:01:53.070> called<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.399> PCV

system<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:55.049> I'll<00:01:55.140> talk<00:01:55.320> about<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.680> later

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
system and I'll talk about that later

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.920 
system and I'll talk about that later
but<00:01:56.579> just<00:01:56.610> remember<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.780> the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
but just remember that that is the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.929 
but just remember that that is the
basics<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.530> what<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.799> carburetor<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.790> how

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
basics of what a carburetor is and how

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.630 
basics of what a carburetor is and how
you<00:02:00.000> install<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:00.750> your<00:02:00.810> engine<00:02:01.079> but<00:02:01.890> just

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
you install it on your engine but just

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.039 
you install it on your engine but just
remember<00:02:02.939> you're<00:02:03.060> not<00:02:03.090> done<00:02:03.479> working<00:02:03.689> whether

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
remember you're not done working whether

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:04.590 
remember you're not done working whether
you<00:02:04.200> have<00:02:04.320> to

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
you have to

you have to
other<00:02:04.960> things<00:02:05.260> in<00:02:05.470> whenever<00:02:05.650> I<00:02:05.860> put<00:02:06.310> those

other things in whenever I put those

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.860 
other things in whenever I put those
systems<00:02:06.850> in<00:02:07.030> I'll<00:02:07.210> show<00:02:07.330> you<00:02:07.390> guys<00:02:07.479> how<00:02:07.659> to<00:02:07.690> do
