00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello youtube people today I bring you my 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.420
 first video loquendo which is a top 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.240
 of the best pokemon of each type 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.269
 according to my opinion without including legendaries 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.219
 let's start the normal guy first 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.949
 I chose schnohr lax because of its high 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.109
 amount of psi special defense so 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.210
 it's hard to bring it down and when 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.279
 you are about to defeat what you use 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.680
 rest and recovers all his life the son 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.900
 of a bitch even though she is asleep 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.269
 continues to attack with snoring or sleepwalking 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.189
 apart it also has very good attack and 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.340
 learn powerful attacks like giga 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.950
 heavy body impact shred rest 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.840
 etcetera his skills are sebo the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.149
 which makes fire-type attacks 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.190
 and ice only cause half the damage 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.440
 that should cause you the other skill 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.410
 it's immunity that makes the pokemon not 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.690
 can poison us we continue with the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.219
 water type I chose to guided by his 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.260
 incredible attack and attacks 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.660
 very good you can learn by emt 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.300
 as for example with the dragon terra 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.039
 sharp rock tremor and earthquake and by 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.739
 level can learn others that also 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.720
 they are good as ice fang water with 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.940
 the dragon dance and hit only 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.250
 has a skill called bullying 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.560
 which is to lower the attack to 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.830
 rival pokemon when the pokemon comes out 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.810
 first time now the best fire for 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.030
 me is arcana in very good attack and 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.370
 Special attack learns good attacks 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.650
 by emt as cruel volt flare 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.690
 retaliation and solar ray by level 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.180
 learns few attacks but they are good 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.250
 like extreme speed knock down fang 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.680
 Fiery and Fang Lightning Your Skills 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.320
 they are intimidation which I have already explained 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.660
 and absorbs fire that makes the pokemon 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.580
 be immune to fire-type attacks and 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.890
 also when the pokemon receives these 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.430
 attacks increases the power of attacks 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.830
 fire type of this by 50% the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.080
 next is the steel type the best without 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.450
 doubt is aaron has one of the defenses 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.580
 highest of all and a very good attack 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.740
 apart it also has a skill that a 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.020
 my opinion is very good call head 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.850
 rock which makes attacks like 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.040
 demolition or double edge do not take away the 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.259
 part of life that should be removed 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.420
 another skill is robustness that makes 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.550
 the pokemon survives with a psa attacks 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.770
 that will weaken that of a single 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.410
 hit the best attacks you learn 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.470
 double edged heavy body with the iron and 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.660
 metal repression let's continue with the type 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.630
 ghost the best for me is obviously 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.550
 counter and they will tell me why counter and not 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.860
 play or one of the other ghosts 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.960
 Well, it's because playing is achieved by 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.450
 exchange and I play it by emulator 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.010
 so I can not get a hangar and I do not 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.320
 I like to use game art 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.120
 as for the other ghosts not the 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.610
 I chose because from the first time that 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.860
 I played pokemon beat everyone with counter 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.350
 so it became my favorite pokemon 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.300
 in terms of statistics counter 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.670
 It has good speed and a very good 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.530
 special attack learns good attacks 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.050
 as hypnosis eats dreams 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.240
 shadow ball and confused ray by emt 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.060
 he learns very good attacks such as 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.160
 psychic ray energy ball and pump mud 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.170
 his only ability is levitation that 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.590
 makes hunter immune to attacks from 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.390
 earth type now the bug type the best 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.970
 it's was cross has a very good attack 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.250
 good special defense but very low 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.650
 special attack his best attacks are 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.490
 mega horn investment demolition already 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.190
 point-blank his skills are guts 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.440
 the attack by 50 percent if the pokemon 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.840
 suffers an alteration of state and the other 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.810
 skill is swarm that powers the 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.120
 bug attacks a 15 if the 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.540
 pokemon that uses it is the same or lower 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.610
 of a third of his ps we went to last 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.740
 kind of pokemon of this video the plan 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.050
 is the one that I chose is by land 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.300
 good attack and good defense 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.940
 attacks like shredding train you adore 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.950
 earthquake and it rains leaves its only 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.980
 skill is thicket that increases the 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.380
 power of plant-type attacks 115 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.710
 if it 's equaled below one third of 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:01.450
 your weigh up here the video then 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.450
 climb in the second part bye
