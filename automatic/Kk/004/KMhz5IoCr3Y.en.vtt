00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
just so you can see as far as the height

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.620 
just so you can see as far as the height
comparison<00:00:11.250> between<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.610> three<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.120> also<00:00:12.480> so

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
comparison between the three and also so

you can see him is a set because that's

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.990 
you can see him is a set because that's
the<00:00:14.070> way<00:00:14.160> i<00:00:14.190> think<00:00:14.490> they<00:00:14.580> look<00:00:14.610> at<00:00:14.880> their

the way i think they look at their

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.240 
the way i think they look at their
absolute<00:00:15.540> best<00:00:15.710> going<00:00:16.710> ahead<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.070> moving

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
quite a bit taller than the Seekers just

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.400 
quite a bit taller than the Seekers just
because<00:00:56.600> Hasbro<00:00:57.600> Dakkar<00:00:57.870> started<00:00:58.199> making

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
because Hasbro Dakkar started making

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.740 
because Hasbro Dakkar started making
their<00:00:58.530> robots<00:00:58.920> quite<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> bit<00:00:59.609> larger<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.329> a

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
their robots quite a bit larger and a

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.420 
their robots quite a bit larger and a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
little bit more articulation and stuff

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.770 
little bit more articulation and stuff
like<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.789> because<00:01:02.940> they<00:01:03.180> were<00:01:03.239> starting<00:01:03.570> to

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
like that because they were starting to

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.609 
like that because they were starting to
do<00:01:03.960> their<00:01:04.110> own<00:01:04.320> designs<00:01:05.689> do<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:06.960> one<00:01:07.409> more

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
do their own designs do have one more

do their own designs do have one more
size<00:01:07.830> comparison<00:01:08.280> whenever<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.610> put<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:08.909> him

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
size comparison whenever we put in him

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.070

in his bat mode he did have one kind of
I<00:01:14.090> guess<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.119> can<00:01:15.299> call<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.540> like<00:01:15.630> a

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
I guess you can call it like a

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.899 
I guess you can call it like a
superpower<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.650> see<00:01:16.890> him<00:01:17.009> use<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.640> think

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
superpower you see him use it I think

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.240 
superpower you see him use it I think
once<00:01:18.420> or<00:01:18.600> twice<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.500> American<00:01:19.979> released

once or twice in the American released

kid as well as far as the stats go I'll

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.540 
kid as well as far as the stats go I'll
bring<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.380> see<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.710> and

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
you can also kind of get a good look at

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.380 
you can also kind of get a good look at
the<00:02:10.950> head<00:02:11.220> as<00:02:12.180> far<00:02:12.510> as<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.780> head<00:02:13.020> go

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
the head as far as the head go

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.900 
the head as far as the head go
and<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:14.170> anime<00:02:14.710> series<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.460> kind<00:02:15.670> of<00:02:15.730> have

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
and the anime series it kind of have

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.760 
and the anime series it kind of have
like<00:02:16.150> these<00:02:16.570> corners<00:02:17.080> we're<00:02:17.350> missing<00:02:17.740> right

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
like these corners we're missing right

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.410 
like these corners we're missing right
here<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.400> got<00:02:18.520> a<00:02:18.580> little<00:02:18.730> bit<00:02:18.910> more<00:02:18.970> narrow

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
here so it got a little bit more narrow

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.510 
here so it got a little bit more narrow
up<00:02:19.810> top<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:20.680> that's<00:02:20.920> probably<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.370> little

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
up top and so that's probably a little

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.370 
up top and so that's probably a little
bit<00:02:21.640> more<00:02:21.880> accurate<00:02:22.330> right<00:02:22.480> there<00:02:22.660> which<00:02:23.200> they

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
bit more accurate right there which they

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.470 
bit more accurate right there which they
again<00:02:23.830> they<00:02:23.980> would<00:02:24.100> have<00:02:24.190> put<00:02:24.370> some<00:02:25.210> stickers

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
again they would have put some stickers

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.810 
again they would have put some stickers
or<00:02:25.930> paint<00:02:26.410> on<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.740> eyes<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.250> kind<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.490> improve

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
or paint on the eyes to kind of improve

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.060 
or paint on the eyes to kind of improve
it<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.000> little<00:02:28.120> bit<00:02:28.300> but<00:02:28.570> I<00:02:28.750> still<00:02:29.140> not<00:02:29.710> too<00:02:29.860> bad

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
it a little bit but I still not too bad

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.670 
it a little bit but I still not too bad
and<00:02:30.310> this<00:02:30.580> is<00:02:30.760> probably<00:02:31.150> about<00:02:31.660> accurate<00:02:32.260> he

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
and this is probably about accurate he

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.780 
and this is probably about accurate he
was<00:02:32.800> probably<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.130> smartest<00:02:33.250> one<00:02:33.640> out<00:02:33.760> of

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
was probably the smartest one out of

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.330 
was probably the smartest one out of
three<00:02:34.530> all<00:02:35.530> right<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:35.830> let's<00:02:36.010> go<00:02:36.100> ahead<00:02:36.250> and

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
three all right so let's go ahead and

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.740 
three all right so let's go ahead and
get<00:02:36.430> this<00:02:36.520> guy<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.760> transform<00:02:37.330> first<00:02:37.630> thing

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
get this guy to transform first thing

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.690 
get this guy to transform first thing
we're<00:02:37.900> going<00:02:37.990> to<00:02:38.050> do<00:02:38.200> is<00:02:38.410> take<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.070> look<00:02:39.430> at

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
we're going to do is take a look at

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.500 
we're going to do is take a look at
barracks<00:02:40.510> here<00:02:40.780> hit<00:02:41.230> him<00:02:41.410> transformed<00:02:42.510> and

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
barracks here hit him transformed and

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.020 
barracks here hit him transformed and
like<00:02:43.810> I've<00:02:43.930> said<00:02:43.959> before<00:02:44.140> in<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:45.400> American

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
like I've said before in the American

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.460 
like I've said before in the American
release<00:02:46.209> cartoon<00:02:46.660> this<00:02:46.959> was<00:02:47.140> one<00:02:47.320> of<00:02:47.350> the

basically put all that back there
you<00:03:44.110> swing<00:03:44.440> this<00:03:44.709> tail<00:03:45.010> that's<00:03:45.580> as<00:03:45.760> far<00:03:46.030> is

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
you swing this tail that's as far is

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.120 
you swing this tail that's as far is
back<00:03:46.900> as<00:03:47.080> it'll<00:03:47.290> go<00:03:47.320> so<00:03:47.650> I'll<00:03:47.739> kind<00:03:47.890> of<00:03:47.980> show

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
in there if it's a square it won't allow

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.949 
in there if it's a square it won't allow
this<00:04:08.650> so<00:04:08.799> close<00:04:09.040> or<00:04:09.579> at<00:04:09.670> least<00:04:09.850> whatever<00:04:10.780> I

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
like that but it's not that big of a

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.120 
like that but it's not that big of a
deal

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130
