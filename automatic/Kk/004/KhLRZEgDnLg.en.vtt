00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
features so first of all a big thing is

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.760 
features so first of all a big thing is
that<00:01:00.059> Windows<00:01:00.390> Phone<00:01:00.690> 8<00:01:00.960> will<00:01:01.289> officially

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
that Windows Phone 8 will officially

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.860 
that Windows Phone 8 will officially
support<00:01:02.280> multi-core<00:01:03.120> processors<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
support multi-core processors and the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.600 
support multi-core processors and the
cool<00:01:04.080> thing<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.470> not<00:01:05.159> only<00:01:05.250> will<00:01:05.489> it

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
cool thing is that not only will it

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.820 
cool thing is that not only will it
support<00:01:05.760> dual-core<00:01:06.659> processors<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.590> quad

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
support dual-core processors and quad

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.039 
support dual-core processors and quad
core<00:01:08.070> processors<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.180> it'll<00:01:09.390> supports

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
core processors but it'll supports

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.350 
core processors but it'll supports
virtually<00:01:10.619> any<00:01:11.010> number<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.670> cores<00:01:12.119> they

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
virtually any number of cores they

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.570 
virtually any number of cores they
eventually<00:01:12.600> use<00:01:13.049> all<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> way<00:01:13.470> up<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.590> 64

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
eventually use all the way up to 64

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.100 
eventually use all the way up to 64
cores<00:01:14.880> if<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.180> eventually<00:01:15.390> use<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:15.960> its

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
cores if we eventually use that so its

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.960 
cores if we eventually use that so its
future<00:01:16.439> proof<00:01:16.710> which<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.009> nice<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.790> also

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
future proof which is nice but also

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.560 
future proof which is nice but also
means<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:19.110> fall<00:01:19.470> we<00:01:19.920> will<00:01:20.100> have

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
means that this fall we will have

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.780 
means that this fall we will have
dual-core<00:01:21.799> processors<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:23.070> Windows<00:01:23.490> phones

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
dual-core processors in Windows phones

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.969 
dual-core processors in Windows phones
or<00:01:24.119> quad<00:01:24.540> core<00:01:24.780> processors<00:01:25.409> if<00:01:25.530> manufacturers

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
or quad core processors if manufacturers

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.609 
or quad core processors if manufacturers
decide<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.549> do<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.909> also<00:01:27.750> another<00:01:28.110> hardware

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
decide to do that also another hardware

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.249 
decide to do that also another hardware
upgrade<00:01:29.040> they<00:01:29.549> will<00:01:29.790> now<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.270> support<00:01:30.869> for

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
upgrade they will now have support for

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.929 
upgrade they will now have support for
HD<00:01:31.860> displays<00:01:32.310> there's<00:01:32.549> actually<00:01:32.909> three

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
HD displays there's actually three

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.450 
HD displays there's actually three
resolutions<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:34.500> Microsoft<00:01:35.070> will<00:01:35.310> be

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
resolutions that Microsoft will be

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.490 
resolutions that Microsoft will be
supporting<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.090> Windows<00:01:36.390> Phone<00:01:36.630> 8<00:01:36.869> one<00:01:37.380> of

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
supporting with Windows Phone 8 one of

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.240 
supporting with Windows Phone 8 one of
those<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.890> 1280<00:01:38.400> by<00:01:38.579> 720<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.930> support<00:01:40.920> for

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
those is 1280 by 720 and support for

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.609 
those is 1280 by 720 and support for
micro<00:01:41.610> SD<00:01:42.060> cards<00:01:42.450> which<00:01:42.600> was<00:01:42.630> kind<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.500> a

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
micro SD cards which was kind of a

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.620 
micro SD cards which was kind of a
feature<00:01:43.860> with<00:01:44.189> Windows<00:01:44.520> Phone<00:01:44.820> 7<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.509> it

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
feature with Windows Phone 7 but it

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.030 
feature with Windows Phone 7 but it
didn't<00:01:45.869> really<00:01:45.930> work<00:01:46.079> out<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.860> way<00:01:47.009> that

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
didn't really work out the way that

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.819 
didn't really work out the way that
Microsoft<00:01:47.790> wanted<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.259> avoid<00:01:49.680> all

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
Microsoft wanted to and so to avoid all

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.050 
Microsoft wanted to and so to avoid all
the<00:01:50.009> trouble<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.369> confusion<00:01:50.549> most

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
the trouble and confusion most

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.850 
the trouble and confusion most
manufacturers<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:51.960> ditched<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.380> completely

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
manufacturers just ditched it completely

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.580 
manufacturers just ditched it completely

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
so now those are live tiles they take up

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.870 
so now those are live tiles they take up
the<00:02:48.270> entire<00:02:48.450> Start<00:02:49.410> screen<00:02:49.700> personally<00:02:50.700> I

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
the entire Start screen personally I

the entire Start screen personally I
kind<00:02:51.209> of<00:02:51.239> don't<00:02:51.420> like<00:02:51.600> this<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:52.080> might<00:02:52.260> take<00:02:52.500> a

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
kind of don't like this it might take a

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.930 
kind of don't like this it might take a
little<00:02:52.770> bit<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:53.040> getting<00:02:53.220> used<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.670> because

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
little bit of getting used to because

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.180 
little bit of getting used to because
now<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.450> just<00:02:54.480> seems<00:02:54.870> more<00:02:55.200> clutter<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.950> have

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190

skype<00:05:20.080> and<00:05:20.349> so<00:05:20.740> the<00:05:21.099> assumption<00:05:21.580> was<00:05:21.759> that

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
skype and so the assumption was that

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.189 
skype and so the assumption was that
eventually<00:05:22.389> we<00:05:22.509> would<00:05:22.659> see<00:05:22.870> a<00:05:22.900> skype

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 
eventually we would see a skype

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.830 
eventually we would see a skype
integration<00:05:23.500> in<00:05:23.949> windows<00:05:24.310> phone<00:05:24.840> microsoft

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
integration in windows phone microsoft

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.379 
integration in windows phone microsoft
detailed<00:05:26.530> that<00:05:26.830> yes<00:05:27.219> there<00:05:27.639> would<00:05:27.880> be<00:05:27.940> some

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
detailed that yes there would be some

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.060 
detailed that yes there would be some
sort<00:05:28.570> of<00:05:28.659> skype<00:05:28.930> integration<00:05:29.199> but<00:05:29.740> it's<00:05:29.889> not

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
sort of skype integration but it's not

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.670 
sort of skype integration but it's not
exactly<00:05:30.639> what<00:05:30.909> everyone<00:05:31.240> thought<00:05:31.690> the<00:05:32.380> way<00:05:32.530> it

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
exactly what everyone thought the way it

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.640 
exactly what everyone thought the way it
works<00:05:32.919> is<00:05:33.159> that<00:05:33.219> any<00:05:33.669> VoIP<00:05:34.240> application<00:05:35.110> can

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
works is that any VoIP application can

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.950 
works is that any VoIP application can
plug<00:05:36.009> into<00:05:36.340> the<00:05:36.699> windows<00:05:37.300> phone<00:05:37.570> calling

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
plug into the windows phone calling

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.100 
plug into the windows phone calling
feature<00:05:38.440> so<00:05:39.130> that<00:05:39.159> it<00:05:39.400> basically<00:05:39.550> becomes

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
feature so that it basically becomes

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.310 
feature so that it basically becomes
integrated<00:05:41.110> into<00:05:41.650> the<00:05:41.740> software<00:05:43.320> microsoft

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:08.409 
but they did it in a way that really I

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:10.830 
but they did it in a way that really I
don't<00:06:08.710> think<00:06:08.949> anyone<00:06:09.370> was<00:06:09.520> expecting<00:06:09.840> so

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
don't think anyone was expecting so

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.320 
don't think anyone was expecting so
Microsoft<00:06:11.380> has<00:06:11.560> created<00:06:11.860> standard<00:06:12.430> ap<00:06:12.789> is<00:06:12.909> for

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
Microsoft has created standard ap is for

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.420 
Microsoft has created standard ap is for
speech<00:06:13.630> recognition<00:06:13.860> that<00:06:14.860> each<00:06:15.159> app

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
speech recognition that each app

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.029 
speech recognition that each app
developer<00:06:16.000> can<00:06:16.150> take<00:06:16.389> advantage<00:06:16.539> of<00:06:17.229> and<00:06:17.469> use

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:18.039 
developer can take advantage of and use

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:20.580 
developer can take advantage of and use
in<00:06:18.340> their<00:06:18.639> app<00:06:18.819> so<00:06:19.389> this<00:06:19.780> speech<00:06:20.050> recognition

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
in their app so this speech recognition

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.589 
in their app so this speech recognition
is<00:06:20.860> not<00:06:21.039> necessarily<00:06:21.550> a<00:06:21.729> feature<00:06:22.060> of<00:06:22.389> the

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:22.599 
is not necessarily a feature of the

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:25.110 
is not necessarily a feature of the
phone<00:06:22.630> or<00:06:23.349> the<00:06:23.650> operating<00:06:24.099> system<00:06:24.490> but<00:06:24.969> it's

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
phone or the operating system but it's

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.360 
phone or the operating system but it's
really<00:06:25.300> each<00:06:25.630> individual<00:06:26.440> app<00:06:26.620> that<00:06:27.250> will

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
really each individual app that will

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.219 
really each individual app that will
have<00:06:27.639> the<00:06:27.880> function<00:06:28.360> and<00:06:28.569> you'll<00:06:28.930> be<00:06:29.050> able<00:06:29.110> to

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:29.229 
have the function and you'll be able to

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:31.560 
have the function and you'll be able to
communicate<00:06:29.620> with<00:06:30.099> that<00:06:30.550> app<00:06:30.729> so<00:06:31.240> it's<00:06:31.389> kind

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
communicate with that app so it's kind

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:32.030 
communicate with that app so it's kind
of<00:06:31.599> different

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.040 
of different

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.980 
of different
unique<00:06:32.340> and<00:06:32.490> on<00:06:32.550> the<00:06:32.670> one<00:06:32.820> hand<00:06:33.120> i'm<00:06:33.480> excited

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
unique and on the one hand i'm excited

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.960 
unique and on the one hand i'm excited
to<00:06:34.230> see<00:06:34.470> it<00:06:34.620> it's<00:06:34.890> kind<00:06:35.310> of<00:06:35.400> going<00:06:35.610> to<00:06:35.700> be<00:06:35.760> kind

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
to see it it's kind of going to be kind

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.550 
to see it it's kind of going to be kind
of<00:06:36.030> cool<00:06:36.300> to<00:06:36.360> see<00:06:36.720> it<00:06:36.840> implemented<00:06:37.230> in<00:06:37.530> a

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
of cool to see it implemented in a

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.440 
of cool to see it implemented in a
different<00:06:37.920> way<00:06:38.070> but<00:06:38.610> at<00:06:38.700> the<00:06:38.730> same<00:06:38.970> time<00:06:39.210> I'm

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:39.450 
different way but at the same time I'm

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.730 
different way but at the same time I'm
thinking<00:06:39.660> would<00:06:40.020> it<00:06:40.050> be<00:06:40.200> easier<00:06:40.230> to<00:06:40.590> just

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
thinking would it be easier to just

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.650 
thinking would it be easier to just
touch<00:06:41.310> the<00:06:41.520> screen<00:06:41.700> i<00:06:41.970> don't<00:06:42.360> know<00:06:42.420> i'll<00:06:42.510> have

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
touch the screen i don't know i'll have

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.030 
touch the screen i don't know i'll have
to<00:06:42.780> see<00:06:42.960> how<00:06:43.110> it<00:06:43.140> plays<00:06:43.380> out<00:06:43.710> but<00:06:43.890> it's

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.040 
to see how it plays out but it's

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.040 
to see how it plays out but it's
definitely<00:06:44.250> a<00:06:44.520> unique<00:06:45.000> way<00:06:45.390> of<00:06:45.420> implementing

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
definitely a unique way of implementing

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.430 
definitely a unique way of implementing
this<00:06:46.380> feature<00:06:47.450> now<00:06:48.450> when<00:06:48.690> can<00:06:48.840> we<00:06:48.960> expect<00:06:48.990> to

this feature now when can we expect to

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.440 
this feature now when can we expect to
see<00:06:49.590> it<00:06:50.040> windows<00:06:50.340> phone<00:06:50.520> 8<00:06:50.700> 0<00:06:50.730> microsoft's
