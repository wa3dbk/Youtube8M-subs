Sundays for my pastor back in Atlanta he

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.990 
Sundays for my pastor back in Atlanta he
said<00:00:28.230> oh<00:00:28.349> cool<00:00:28.890> what<00:00:29.099> are<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.250> preaching<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:29.820> I

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
said oh cool what are you preaching on I

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.060 
said oh cool what are you preaching on I
say<00:00:30.269> well<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.599> series<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.679> glory<00:00:31.920> of

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
say well the series is on the glory of

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.340 
say well the series is on the glory of
God<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.489> human<00:00:32.850> body

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
God in the human body

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.530 
God in the human body
he<00:00:34.350> said<00:00:34.559> that's<00:00:34.860> really<00:00:35.579> amazing<00:00:35.850> I'm<00:00:36.480> a

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
he said that's really amazing I'm a

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.510 
he said that's really amazing I'm a
molecular<00:00:37.070> biologist<00:00:38.070> at<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.370> University

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
molecular biologist at the University

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.619 
molecular biologist at the University
down<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.540> road<00:00:42.440> he<00:00:43.440> give<00:00:43.649> me<00:00:43.739> your<00:00:43.920> talk<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.629> I

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
down the road he give me your talk and I

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.299 
down the road he give me your talk and I
was<00:00:45.750> like<00:00:45.899> oh<00:00:46.050> well<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.320> wasn't<00:00:46.710> quite<00:00:47.039> yet

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
was like oh well I wasn't quite yet

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.270 
was like oh well I wasn't quite yet
ready<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.789> unload<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.360> talk<00:00:48.570> for<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> molecular

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
ready to unload the talk for a molecular

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.250 
ready to unload the talk for a molecular
biologist<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.149> kind<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.570> stumbled<00:00:52.050> through

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
biologist so I kind of stumbled through

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.959 
biologist so I kind of stumbled through
what<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.469> had<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.039> he's<00:00:53.160> kind<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.460> being<00:00:53.670> kind

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
what I had and he's kind of being kind

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.790 
what I had and he's kind of being kind
and<00:00:54.210> gracious<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:55.020> uh-huh<00:00:55.170> that's<00:00:55.559> good

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
and gracious and like uh-huh that's good

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.350 
and gracious and like uh-huh that's good
and<00:00:56.219> then<00:00:56.370> he<00:00:56.460> says<00:00:56.670> well<00:00:56.850> what's<00:00:57.030> your<00:00:57.120> big

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
and then he says well what's your big

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.090 
and then he says well what's your big
left<00:00:57.660> hook<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.109> got<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> left<00:00:58.739> hook<00:00:58.920> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
left hook you got to have a left hook a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.889 
left hook you got to have a left hook a
big<00:00:59.280> finish<00:00:59.489> right<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.090> said<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.510> don't<00:01:00.629> have<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
big finish right I said I don't have a

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.280 
big finish right I said I don't have a
left<00:01:01.109> hook<00:01:01.289> yet<00:01:01.559> he<00:01:02.280> said<00:01:02.489> oh<00:01:02.520> Louie<00:01:02.850> oh<00:01:03.290> man

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
left hook yet he said oh Louie oh man

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.609 
left hook yet he said oh Louie oh man
your<00:01:04.680> left<00:01:04.920> hook<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.400> laminin<00:01:09.260> and<00:01:10.260> I'm

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
your left hook is laminin and I'm

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.800 
your left hook is laminin and I'm
totally<00:01:11.040> blank<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.729> lamin<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.240> he<00:01:12.299> goes<00:01:12.479> Louie

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
totally blank on lamin and he goes Louie

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.770 
totally blank on lamin and he goes Louie
it's<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.470> cell<00:01:13.710> adhesion<00:01:13.890> molecule<00:01:14.780> protein

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
it's a cell adhesion molecule protein

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.910 
it's a cell adhesion molecule protein
molecule<00:01:17.689> do<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.780> know<00:01:18.930> about<00:01:19.049> proteins<00:01:19.680> I'm

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
molecule do you know about proteins I'm

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.630 
molecule do you know about proteins I'm
like<00:01:20.100> no<00:01:20.960> he<00:01:21.960> said<00:01:22.170> Louie<00:01:22.320> cells<00:01:22.979> organized

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
like no he said Louie cells organized

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.640 
like no he said Louie cells organized
into<00:01:23.970> certain<00:01:24.299> molecular<00:01:24.540> structures<00:01:25.409> and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
into certain molecular structures and

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.530 
into certain molecular structures and
that<00:01:26.009> determines<00:01:26.640> what<00:01:26.759> protein<00:01:27.240> there<00:01:27.420> are

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
that determines what protein there are

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.109 
that determines what protein there are
there<00:01:27.840> between<00:01:27.990> 10<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.680> 60,000<00:01:29.549> proteins<00:01:29.970> in

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
there between 10 and 60,000 proteins in

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.789 
there between 10 and 60,000 proteins in
the<00:01:30.210> human<00:01:30.479> body<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:30.930> don't<00:01:31.079> even<00:01:31.200> know<00:01:31.439> how

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
the human body we don't even know how

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.560 
the human body we don't even know how
many<00:01:31.950> proteins<00:01:32.430> are<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.700> human<00:01:32.970> body<00:01:33.060> but

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
many proteins are in the human body but

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.840 
many proteins are in the human body but
one<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.780> them<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.350> cell<00:01:34.770> adhesion<00:01:34.979> molecule

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
one of them is a cell adhesion molecule

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.760 
one of them is a cell adhesion molecule
it's<00:01:36.299> organized<00:01:36.930> into<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.439> certain

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
it's organized into this certain

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.130 
it's organized into this certain
structure<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.850> tells<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.390> cell<00:01:39.630> what

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
structure and that tells the cell what

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.130 
structure and that tells the cell what
its<00:01:40.320> job<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.430> body<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:42.869> is

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
its job is in the body and this one is

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.429 
its job is in the body and this one is
the<00:01:43.350> cell<00:01:43.560> adhesion<00:01:43.740> molecule<00:01:44.610> I'm<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.630> all

I<00:03:00.920> love<00:03:01.610> laminin<00:03:02.269> I'm<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:03.200> fired<00:03:03.620> up<00:03:03.890> you

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.790 

should<00:03:08.450> see<00:03:08.630> laminate<00:03:09.080> I<00:03:09.170> guess<00:03:09.380> that's<00:03:09.650> the

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
should see laminate I guess that's the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.990 
should see laminate I guess that's the
thing<00:03:09.830> right<00:03:10.190> okay<00:03:11.530> here<00:03:12.530> is<00:03:12.650> a<00:03:13.000> scientific

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
thing right okay here is a scientific

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.479 
thing right okay here is a scientific
diagram<00:03:14.239> of<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.590> laminate<00:03:16.010> cell<00:03:16.310> adhesion
