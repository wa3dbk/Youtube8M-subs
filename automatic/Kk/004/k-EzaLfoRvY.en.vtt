00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.730
 two 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:15.190
 now it's all for me 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:21.360
 as a local 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:25.550
 spector and we really hope 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.550
 not for that 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.399
 briefly everyone has lived has existed 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.200
 and now my chance to experience 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.200
 it is not also serious things 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.110
 here 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.380
 I marked him child 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.359
 automatically bikepark harding 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.800
 but this really does not end either 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.640
 as I told you when customers 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.640
 like you 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:36.790
 more advanced different powers with 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:50.680
 33 biggest battles 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:52.690
 20 43 55 95 and 105 and 115 that of the 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.409
 name of the series ' the of 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.709
 reference to technology tractors 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.980
 reliable 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:03.160
 simple tastes in terms of vision of 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.940
 Mechanical change mechanical values not 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.940
 there are electronic switchboards 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.530
 takes the machine inside an inclinometer 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.200
 electronic goes measuring the slope 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.750
 front that carries the machine and in 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.760
 function of the front slope the 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.400
 revolutions that the operator has set 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.980
 are variables would be given automatically 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.810
 based on that slope which is what 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.969
 which makes a conventional machine when 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.319
 do not regulate the hours the speed of the 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:44.730
 fan automatically when 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.769
 go denying everything goes well 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.989
 the machine cleans the grain does not have 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.060
 losses that happens if you start a 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.889
 uphill so if a slope starts 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.260
 up the grain is easier for 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:57.150
 come out and the risk of grain losses 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.450
 increases the second characteristic 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.780
 fundamental is the restyling or the housing 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:07.150
 the new fairing that has lateral 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.250
 front and back has thus been given a 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.829
 a new loaded realizes with being a 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.230
 machine that is not conventional in what 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:17.440
 refers to threshing and separation of 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.720
 culture that processes is a machine that 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.639
 it's called rotors or threshing with 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.250
 axial flow because it is called with flo 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.500
 facial because it shines in the sense the 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.110
 advancement of cultivation is in the sense of 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.120
 axis of the rotors otherwise it would be what it is 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.240
 the transversal threshing that is the 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.660
 conventional slip until it 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.470
 joins let's say the belt to the pulley in this 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.870
 case is not like that 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.820
 all the straps are thought and the 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.949
 union or threshing connection the 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.690
 connection of the discharge is made through 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.449
 clutch packs the oil bath 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.120
 that technology does not have anyone to day 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.979
 today except us then that 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.960
 system gives you much longer duration and 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.820
 longevity belts and all 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.410
 mechanisms that the machine has miles 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.960
 of total agreement that is the complement 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.550
 perfect machine this head for 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.550
 that suits everyone 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.240
 yes 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.950
 yes 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.289
 and
