what a hit and that is why he was in the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.890 
what a hit and that is why he was in the
center<00:02:34.010> of<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.340> pitch<00:02:34.580> sometimes<00:02:35.510> he<00:02:35.660> swaps

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.500 
center of the pitch sometimes he swaps
an<00:02:36.050> Oscar<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.620> when<00:02:37.010> is<00:02:37.280> in<00:02:37.460> that<00:02:37.610> center<00:02:38.000> that

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
an Oscar and when is in that center that

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.270 
an Oscar and when is in that center that
is<00:02:38.630> where<00:02:38.870> he's<00:02:39.050> most<00:02:39.080> effective<00:02:39.830> yes<00:02:40.100> from

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
is where he's most effective yes from

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.980 
is where he's most effective yes from
the<00:02:40.430> earth<00:02:40.490> on<00:02:40.670> Sidon<00:02:41.090> cutting<00:02:41.360> he<00:02:41.780> can

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
the earth on Sidon cutting he can

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.040 
the earth on Sidon cutting he can
finesse<00:02:42.380> but<00:02:43.130> for<00:02:43.370> me<00:02:43.610> left<00:02:44.360> hand<00:02:44.600> side<00:02:44.840> is

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
finesse but for me left hand side is

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.080 
finesse but for me left hand side is
just<00:02:45.290> not<00:02:45.470> in<00:02:45.620> his<00:02:45.800> 40<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:46.670> shouldn't<00:02:47.000> be

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
that actually but I think that is what

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.790 
that actually but I think that is what
he's<00:03:32.360> worth<00:03:32.600> I<00:03:32.750> mean<00:03:32.930> just<00:03:33.110> look<00:03:33.290> at<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.500> shot
