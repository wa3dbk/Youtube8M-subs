travel<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.110> feedback<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.119> you<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.299> just

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
travel and feedback and you can just

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.679 
travel and feedback and you can just
kind<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.900> see<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.140> little<00:01:25.350> bit<00:01:25.530> how<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.250> hinge

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
kind of see a little bit how the hinge

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.770 
kind of see a little bit how the hinge
looks<00:01:27.689> here<00:01:28.229> from<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.250> back<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.570> course

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
looks here from the back and of course

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.020 
looks here from the back and of course
we<00:01:30.900> can<00:01:31.049> see<00:01:31.259> 5<00:01:31.590> megapixel<00:01:32.250> camera<00:01:32.640> with<00:01:32.700> LED

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
we can see 5 megapixel camera with LED

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.100 
we can see 5 megapixel camera with LED
flash<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:34.490> nothing<00:01:35.490> along<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.850> top

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
flash and nothing along the top

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.210 
flash and nothing along the top
basically<00:01:37.110> all<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.320> controls<00:01:37.710> are<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.009> this

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
basically all the controls are on this

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.940 
basically all the controls are on this
surface<00:01:38.520> here<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.470> what<00:01:40.590> we'll<00:01:40.710> do<00:01:40.829> is

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
surface here and so what we'll do is

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.600 
surface here and so what we'll do is
we'll<00:01:41.130> crack<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.030> open<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.509> just<00:01:43.350> do<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.310> side

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
we'll crack it open so just do the side

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.389 
we'll crack it open so just do the side
way<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.149> can<00:01:45.299> see<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.860> see<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.890> hinge<00:01:47.250> in

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
way so you can see the see the hinge in

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.740 
way so you can see the see the hinge in
action<00:01:47.820> here<00:01:49.100> this<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.240> pops<00:01:51.509> up

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
action here this is a it and it pops up

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.060 
action here this is a it and it pops up
and<00:01:52.020> gives<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.909> laptop<00:01:53.909> look<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.409> to

and gives you this laptop look to the to

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.510 
and gives you this laptop look to the to
the<00:01:56.119> echo<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.469> you<00:01:58.469> can<00:01:58.649> use<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.070> work<00:01:59.310> in

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
the echo and you can use it to work in

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.410

kyocera said they spent a lot of time
engineering<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.500> so<00:03:26.799> that's<00:03:27.639> the<00:03:27.760> handset

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
engineering it so that's the handset

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.150

itself<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:28.870> now<00:03:29.440> what<00:03:29.590> we're<00:03:29.680> going<00:03:29.769> to<00:03:29.859> do<00:03:29.980> is

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
itself and now what we're going to do is

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.009 
itself and now what we're going to do is
dive<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.489> little<00:03:30.760> bit<00:03:31.000> in<00:03:31.269> a<00:03:31.329> more<00:03:31.630> in-depth

dive a little bit in a more in-depth

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.960 
dive a little bit in a more in-depth
into<00:03:32.319> how<00:03:32.440> some<00:03:32.739> of<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.980> software<00:03:33.519> features

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
into how some of the software features

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.239 
into how some of the software features
work
