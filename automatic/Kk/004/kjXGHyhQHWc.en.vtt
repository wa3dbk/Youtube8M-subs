and this one of my favorite times a year

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.890 
and this one of my favorite times a year
because<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.370> can<00:02:30.580> ride<00:02:31.090> in<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.330> morning<00:02:31.480> and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
because you can ride in the morning and

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.720 
because you can ride in the morning and
as<00:02:31.990> it<00:02:32.140> heats<00:02:32.290> up<00:02:32.530> go<00:02:32.950> paddleboard<00:02:33.640> is

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
as it heats up go paddleboard is

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.520 
as it heats up go paddleboard is
probably<00:02:34.000> like<00:02:34.180> 70<00:02:34.690> degrees<00:02:34.990> on<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.320> lake

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
probably like 70 degrees on the lake

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.230 
probably like 70 degrees on the lake
