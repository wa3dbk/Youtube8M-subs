we'll start off the course talking about

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.140 
we'll start off the course talking about
whole<00:00:03.300> numbers<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:03.959> place<00:00:04.589> value<00:00:04.799> and<00:00:05.370> we<00:00:05.970> get

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
whole numbers and place value and we get

whole numbers and place value and we get
we<00:00:06.359> began<00:00:06.629> with<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.049> discussion<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.560> number

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
we began with the discussion of number

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.790 
we began with the discussion of number
systems<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.730> throughout<00:00:09.420> history<00:00:09.800> numbers

systems and throughout history numbers
have<00:00:11.040> been<00:00:11.250> used<00:00:11.700> even<00:00:12.120> in<00:00:12.240> very<00:00:12.480> ancient

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
have been used even in very ancient

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.990 
have been used even in very ancient
civilizations<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:13.920> most<00:00:14.160> basic<00:00:14.790> reason

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
civilizations and the most basic reason

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.269 
civilizations and the most basic reason
that<00:00:15.540> they<00:00:15.690> have<00:00:15.809> been<00:00:15.929> used<00:00:16.199> has<00:00:16.859> been<00:00:17.039> to

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
that they have been used has been to

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:25.550 
that they have been used has been to
keep<00:00:17.490> track<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.820> things<00:00:24.080> for<00:00:25.080> example<00:00:25.470> you

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
keep track of things for example you

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.040 
keep track of things for example you
might<00:00:25.710> imagine<00:00:26.039> counting<00:00:26.640> sheep<00:00:28.490> and<00:00:29.900> I'm<00:00:30.900> not

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
might imagine counting sheep and I'm not

might imagine counting sheep and I'm not
just<00:00:31.230> talking<00:00:31.289> about<00:00:31.800> counting<00:00:32.309> sheep<00:00:32.759> trying

to fall asleep you might actually have

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.620 
to fall asleep you might actually have
someone<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> long<00:00:35.910> time<00:00:36.090> ago<00:00:36.300> who<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.600> a

sheep and he might not have been able to

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.750 
sheep and he might not have been able to
count<00:00:39.989> but<00:00:40.590> he<00:00:40.739> might<00:00:40.860> have<00:00:40.890> had<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.129> handful<00:00:41.579> of

count but he might have had a handful of
pebbles<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.390> he<00:00:42.840> knew<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.200> there<00:00:43.320> was<00:00:43.469> one

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
pebbles and he knew that there was one

pebbles and he knew that there was one
pebble<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.250> his<00:00:44.370> hand<00:00:44.640> for<00:00:44.879> every<00:00:45.120> sheep<00:00:45.360> and

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
pebble in his hand for every sheep and

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.569 
pebble in his hand for every sheep and
as<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.140> sheep<00:00:46.320> came<00:00:46.620> into<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> pasture<00:00:47.430> he

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
as the sheep came into the pasture he

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.040 
as the sheep came into the pasture he
could<00:00:47.730> move<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.120> pebble<00:00:48.450> from<00:00:48.600> one<00:00:48.780> side<00:00:49.020> to

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
could move a pebble from one side to

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.080 
could move a pebble from one side to
another<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.739> he<00:00:50.190> could<00:00:50.309> have<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> one-to-one

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
another and he could have a one-to-one

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.180 
another and he could have a one-to-one
correspondence<00:00:51.870> between<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.710> sheep<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
correspondence between the sheep and the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.100 
correspondence between the sheep and the
pebbles<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.480> Sheep<00:00:54.750> went<00:00:54.899> through

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
pebbles and if the Sheep went through

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.110 
pebbles and if the Sheep went through
the<00:00:55.199> gate<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.620> um<00:00:56.190> he<00:00:56.309> had<00:00:56.399> some<00:00:56.579> pebbles<00:00:56.760> left

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the gate and um he had some pebbles left

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.729 
the gate and um he had some pebbles left
over<00:00:57.420> he<00:00:57.570> knew<00:00:57.750> some<00:00:57.960> sheep<00:00:58.170> were<00:00:58.350> missing

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
over he knew some sheep were missing

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.250 
over he knew some sheep were missing
this<00:00:59.670> was<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> little<00:01:00.149> bit<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.600> cumbersome

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
this was a little bit of a cumbersome

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.229 
this was a little bit of a cumbersome
system<00:01:01.559> with<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> development<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.030> just

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
system with the development of just

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.630 
system with the development of just
basic<00:01:03.840> numbers<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> ability<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.369> count

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
basic numbers and the ability to count

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.640 
basic numbers and the ability to count
you<00:01:06.150> could<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.450> remember<00:01:06.960> one<00:01:07.170> number<00:01:07.530> if

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
you could just remember one number if

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.620 
you could just remember one number if
you<00:01:07.740> had<00:01:07.860> 38<00:01:08.280> sheep<00:01:08.700> then<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.299> could<00:01:09.450> just

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
you had 38 sheep then you could just

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.820 
you had 38 sheep then you could just
count<00:01:09.840> them<00:01:10.080> as<00:01:10.260> they<00:01:10.380> went<00:01:10.470> through<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> gate

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
count them as they went through the gate

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.410 
count them as they went through the gate
and<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.340> would<00:01:11.490> know<00:01:11.700> if<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.000> had<00:01:12.180> any

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
and you would know if you had any

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.730 
and you would know if you had any
missing<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.049> didn't<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.439> carry

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
missing and you didn't have to carry

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.410 
missing and you didn't have to carry
around<00:01:13.830> pebbles<00:01:14.460> or<00:01:14.580> physically<00:01:15.030> move<00:01:15.210> them

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
around pebbles or physically move them

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.649 
around pebbles or physically move them
around<00:01:15.650> numbers<00:01:16.650> are<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.189> basic<00:01:17.820> part<00:01:18.450> of

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
around numbers are just a basic part of

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.420 
around numbers are just a basic part of
everyday<00:01:18.990> existence<00:01:19.259> they<00:01:19.799> help<00:01:20.009> us<00:01:20.189> keep

obviously<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.729> count<00:01:23.970> anything<00:01:24.590> with

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
obviously you can count anything with

have<00:01:30.750> been<00:01:30.930> used<00:01:30.990> as<00:01:31.500> civilizations<00:01:32.250> get<00:01:32.850> more

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
have been used as civilizations get more

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.469 
have been used as civilizations get more
advanced<00:01:33.720> they<00:01:33.930> need<00:01:34.140> more<00:01:34.799> more<00:01:35.700> advanced

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
advanced they need more more advanced

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.480 
advanced they need more more advanced
number<00:01:36.930> systems<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.500> more<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.860> an<00:01:37.950> ability<00:01:38.189> to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
do things with them if you're gonna buy

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.020 
do things with them if you're gonna buy
and<00:01:40.470> sell<00:01:40.680> land<00:01:41.009> for<00:01:41.340> example<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.909> they<00:01:41.970> were

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and sell land for example and they were

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.580 
and sell land for example and they were
doing<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.750> very<00:01:42.960> ancient<00:01:43.049> ancient

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
doing that in very ancient ancient

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.020 
doing that in very ancient ancient
cultures<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.220> need<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:44.820> able<00:01:44.909> to

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
cultures you need to be able to

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.760 
cultures you need to be able to
calculate<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.689> area<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.350> land<00:01:46.560> and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
calculate the area of a land and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.700 
calculate the area of a land and
calculate<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.340> cost<00:01:47.479> maybe<00:01:48.479> even<00:01:48.899> calculate

could draw a little picture of a bird
for<00:02:39.440> example<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.510> don't<00:02:41.630> know<00:02:41.989> exactly

it's just the important point is they
had<00:02:46.790> different<00:02:47.000> symbols<00:02:47.540> for<00:02:47.720> different

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
the 4th century BC we're talking about

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.770 
the 4th century BC we're talking about
almost<00:03:44.780> two<00:03:45.170> and<00:03:45.350> a<00:03:45.410> half<00:03:45.590> thousand<00:03:46.280> years<00:03:46.310> ago

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
almost two and a half thousand years ago

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.420 
almost two and a half thousand years ago
and<00:03:47.780> and<00:03:48.049> the<00:03:48.170> Hindus<00:03:48.560> invented<00:03:48.980> that<00:03:49.070> and<00:03:49.340> it

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
and and the Hindus invented that and it

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.400 
and and the Hindus invented that and it
was<00:03:49.519> later<00:03:49.730> adopted<00:03:50.060> by<00:03:50.299> the<00:03:50.420> Arabs<00:03:50.930> so<00:03:51.230> it's

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
was later adopted by the Arabs so it's

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.380 
was later adopted by the Arabs so it's
sometimes<00:03:51.709> referred<00:03:52.070> to<00:03:52.310> as<00:03:52.700> the

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
sometimes referred to as the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:00.130 
sometimes referred to as the
hindu-arabic<00:03:54.160> system<00:03:55.930> and<00:03:57.549> this<00:03:58.549> system<00:03:59.140> then

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
hindu-arabic system and this system then

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.440 
hindu-arabic system and this system then
came<00:04:00.500> from<00:04:00.829> from<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.489> Arabs<00:04:01.850> into<00:04:02.299> the

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
came from from the Arabs into the

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.990 
Western world Westerners first learned
about<00:04:05.269> it<00:04:05.450> from<00:04:05.709> arabic<00:04:06.709> writings<00:04:07.160> and<00:04:07.370> it

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
about it from arabic writings and it

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.120 
about it from arabic writings and it
quickly<00:04:08.299> became<00:04:09.140> the<00:04:09.350> dominant<00:04:09.530> system

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
quickly became the dominant system

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.979 
quickly became the dominant system
because<00:04:10.370> it's<00:04:10.549> superior<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.420> other<00:04:11.570> number

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
because it's superior to other number

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.110 
because it's superior to other number
systems<00:04:12.380> and<00:04:12.560> it's<00:04:12.680> one<00:04:12.920> in<00:04:13.070> widespread<00:04:13.880> use

is<00:05:01.940> a<00:05:01.970> really<00:05:02.360> difficult<00:05:02.840> problem<00:05:03.169> but<00:05:03.259> people

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
is a really difficult problem but people

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.200 
is a really difficult problem but people
had<00:05:03.620> to<00:05:03.710> do<00:05:03.889> that<00:05:04.070> at<00:05:04.280> one<00:05:04.460> time<00:05:04.490> so<00:05:05.000> when

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
had to do that at one time so when

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.089 
had to do that at one time so when
you're<00:05:05.389> doing<00:05:05.720> math<00:05:05.900> problems<00:05:06.020> and<00:05:06.590> you<00:05:06.800> think

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
you're doing math problems and you think

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:08.800 
you're doing math problems and you think
yourself<00:05:07.490> oh<00:05:07.729> my<00:05:07.910> goodness<00:05:08.330> I've<00:05:08.479> got<00:05:08.630> to<00:05:08.720> do

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
yourself oh my goodness I've got to do

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.600 
yourself oh my goodness I've got to do
some<00:05:08.990> long<00:05:09.289> division<00:05:09.320> or<00:05:10.190> something<00:05:10.490> like

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
some long division or something like

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.060 
some long division or something like
that<00:05:10.669> just<00:05:11.030> realize<00:05:11.960> how<00:05:12.199> much<00:05:12.770> more

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
that just realize how much more

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.920 
that just realize how much more
difficult<00:05:13.340> it<00:05:13.759> would<00:05:13.880> be<00:05:13.940> with<00:05:14.660> a<00:05:14.690> more

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
difficult it would be with a more

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.020 
difficult it would be with a more
cumbersome<00:05:15.530> number<00:05:15.979> system<00:05:16.340> or<00:05:16.729> what<00:05:16.849> if<00:05:16.940> you

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
cumbersome number system or what if you

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.150 
cumbersome number system or what if you
had<00:05:17.180> to<00:05:17.330> add<00:05:17.479> or<00:05:17.810> subtract<00:05:18.199> or<00:05:18.380> multiply<00:05:18.440> and

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
had to add or subtract or multiply and

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.890 
had to add or subtract or multiply and
divide<00:05:19.400> using<00:05:19.789> little<00:05:20.210> pictures<00:05:20.660> to

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
divide using little pictures to

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.779 
divide using little pictures to
represent<00:05:21.349> your<00:05:21.470> numbers<00:05:21.860> like<00:05:22.400> that<00:05:22.430> would

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
represent your numbers like that would

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.360 
represent your numbers like that would
be<00:05:22.940> probably<00:05:23.270> even<00:05:23.690> more<00:05:24.050> difficult<00:05:24.560> so<00:05:25.099> that

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
be probably even more difficult so that

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.390 
be probably even more difficult so that
the<00:05:25.520> number<00:05:25.849> system<00:05:26.030> that<00:05:26.210> we<00:05:26.449> use<00:05:26.780> is

the number system that we use is
extremely<00:05:28.400> efficient<00:05:28.849> and<00:05:29.000> it<00:05:29.090> makes<00:05:29.300> math<00:05:29.599> a

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.339 
position of the 3 and the 7 and the 4
all<00:06:06.979> mean<00:06:07.430> something<00:06:07.639> and<00:06:08.000> specifically<00:06:08.599> the

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:09.349 
all mean something and specifically the

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.790 
all mean something and specifically the
3<00:06:09.710> means<00:06:10.009> three<00:06:10.880> hundreds

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
3 means three hundreds

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.610 
3 means three hundreds
and<00:06:13.660> the<00:06:14.660> seven<00:06:14.990> means<00:06:15.220> seven<00:06:16.220> tens<00:06:17.030> and<00:06:17.620> the

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
and the seven means seven tens and the

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.050 
and the seven means seven tens and the
four<00:06:18.860> means<00:06:19.220> four<00:06:20.319> ones<00:06:21.319> so<00:06:22.220> if<00:06:22.400> you<00:06:22.520> take<00:06:22.849> all

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
four means four ones so if you take all

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.480 
four means four ones so if you take all
of<00:06:23.120> those<00:06:23.360> together<00:06:23.569> you<00:06:24.020> have<00:06:24.490> three

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
of those together you have three

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:35.140 
of those together you have three
hundreds<00:06:26.120> and<00:06:27.849> seven<00:06:28.849> tens<00:06:29.270> and<00:06:30.430> four<00:06:34.150> four

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
hundreds and seven tens and four four

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.450 
hundreds and seven tens and four four
ones<00:06:35.599> that<00:06:36.560> means<00:06:36.710> you<00:06:36.800> have<00:06:36.919> a<00:06:36.949> total<00:06:37.310> of

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460 
ones that means you have a total of

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.950 
ones that means you have a total of
three<00:06:37.879> hundred<00:06:38.479> and<00:06:38.629> seventy<00:06:39.500> four<00:06:40.069> and

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
three hundred and seventy four and

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.999 
three hundred and seventy four and
understanding<00:06:41.960> this<00:06:42.080> concept<00:06:42.349> of<00:06:42.740> place

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009 
understanding this concept of place

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:45.279 
understanding this concept of place
value<00:06:43.490> is<00:06:43.699> the<00:06:44.330> key<00:06:44.479> to<00:06:44.599> understanding<00:06:45.169> our

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:45.289 
value is the key to understanding our

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:49.180 
value is the key to understanding our
whole<00:06:45.500> number<00:06:45.800> system<00:06:46.130> and<00:06:46.340> how<00:06:46.759> it<00:06:46.789> works
