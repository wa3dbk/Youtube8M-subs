hate buying fuel everyone does and
that's<00:00:32.920> the<00:00:33.100> problem<00:00:33.489> so<00:00:34.300> build<00:00:34.600> a<00:00:34.720> bridge<00:00:35.020> and

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260

falls<00:00:45.790> chaotically<00:00:46.480> you<00:00:46.930> could<00:00:47.080> throw<00:00:47.290> a

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
falls chaotically you could throw a

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.189
