00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
application with a lot of really cool

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.120 
application with a lot of really cool
functions<00:00:08.910> so<00:00:09.230> it<00:00:10.230> loads<00:00:10.530> up<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.010> it's

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
functions so it loads up and it's

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.249 
functions so it loads up and it's
actually<00:00:11.700> kind<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.120> confusing<00:00:12.929> from<00:00:13.139> the

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
actually kind of confusing from the

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.589 
actually kind of confusing from the
beginning<00:00:13.380> here<00:00:13.860> because<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.880> wonder<00:00:15.360> why

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
beginning here because you wonder why

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.260 
beginning here because you wonder why
you're<00:00:15.870> getting<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.859> let<00:00:17.190> me<00:00:17.279> zoom<00:00:17.520> out<00:00:17.820> a

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
you're getting to let me zoom out a

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.420 
you're getting to let me zoom out a
little<00:00:18.630> bit<00:00:19.109> here<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:19.439> we<00:00:19.740> could<00:00:19.890> see<00:00:20.220> what

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
little bit here so we could see what

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.019 
little bit here so we could see what
we've<00:00:21.000> got<00:00:21.029> going<00:00:21.270> on<00:00:22.250> you<00:00:23.250> have<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> preview

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
we've got going on you have a preview

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.810 
we've got going on you have a preview
screen<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:25.039> the<00:00:26.039> reason<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.699> would

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.910 
screen and the reason that you would
need<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.060> preview<00:00:27.359> screen<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:28.080> because<00:00:28.500> you

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
need a preview screen is because you

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.429 
need a preview screen is because you
have<00:00:29.130> all<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.550> these<00:00:30.269> options<00:00:30.630> over<00:00:31.410> here

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
these settings so I can go and I could

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.869 
these settings so I can go and I could
go<00:00:36.570> sepia<00:00:39.020> choose<00:00:40.020> sepia<00:00:40.440> tone<00:00:40.680> here<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.250> now

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
I'm getting a preview of what it's going

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.029 
I'm getting a preview of what it's going
to<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.489> before<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.910> take<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> picture<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.039> no

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
to be before I take the picture so no

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.860 
to be before I take the picture so no
having<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.550> take<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.820> picture<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.270> then<00:00:48.600> apply

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
having to take a picture and then apply

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.330 
having to take a picture and then apply
effects<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.469> could<00:00:49.620> see<00:00:49.800> what<00:00:49.829> it's<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.219> to

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
effects we could see what it's going to

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.670 
effects we could see what it's going to
look<00:00:50.430> like<00:00:50.579> beforehand<00:00:51.390> which<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.260> one<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
look like beforehand which is one of the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.170 
look like beforehand which is one of the
things<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.010> makes<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.399> app<00:00:53.760> kind<00:00:54.090> of

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
things that makes this app kind of

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.770 
things that makes this app kind of
unique<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.800> see<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.250> we've<00:00:56.340> got<00:00:56.780> you

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
unique so you see that we've got you

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.689 
unique so you see that we've got you
know<00:00:57.899> our<00:00:58.079> actual<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.890> our<00:00:58.980> preview<00:00:59.460> down

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
know our actual and our preview down

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.080 
know our actual and our preview down
here<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.930> little<00:01:01.170> choppy<00:01:01.850> but<00:01:02.850> keep

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
here and it is a little choppy but keep

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.700 
here and it is a little choppy but keep
in<00:01:03.239> mind<00:01:03.270> it's<00:01:03.690> doing<00:01:03.960> all<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.229> stuff<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
in mind it's doing all this stuff on the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.800 
in mind it's doing all this stuff on the
fly<00:01:04.979> which<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.430> pretty<00:01:05.610> good<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.119> if<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.689> is

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
fly which is pretty good and if it is

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.929 
fly which is pretty good and if it is
really<00:01:07.170> choppy<00:01:07.470> for<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.950> or<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.220> app<00:01:08.490> happens

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
really choppy for you or the app happens

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.710 
really choppy for you or the app happens
to<00:01:09.090> freeze<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:10.260> can<00:01:10.439> restart<00:01:10.920> your<00:01:11.070> iphone

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
to freeze you can restart your iphone

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.010 
to freeze you can restart your iphone
and<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.650> clear<00:01:14.280> up<00:01:14.430> some<00:01:14.640> memory<00:01:15.020> because

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
and and clear up some memory because

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.450 
and and clear up some memory because
this<00:01:16.259> app<00:01:16.470> does<00:01:16.500> take<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> little<00:01:17.220> bit<00:01:17.369> of

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
this app does take a little bit of

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.120 
this app does take a little bit of
memory<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.750> also<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.290> some<00:01:19.590> other<00:01:19.740> stuff

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
memory so we also have some other stuff

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.600 
memory so we also have some other stuff
over<00:01:20.490> here<00:01:20.720> one<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.900> nice<00:01:22.080> things<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.770> is

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
over here one of the nice things is is

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.160 
over here one of the nice things is is
that<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.210> do<00:01:24.360> all<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.840> kind<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.350> deciding

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
that you do all this kind of deciding

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.859 
that you do all this kind of deciding
preprocess<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:29.000> it's<00:01:30.000> almost<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.479> adding

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
preprocess so it's almost like adding

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.510 
preprocess so it's almost like adding
filters<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.590> your<00:01:31.680> iPhone<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.250> know<00:01:32.369> we've

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
filters to your iPhone you know we've

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.310 
filters to your iPhone you know we've
got<00:01:33.229> text<00:01:34.229> your<00:01:34.380> eyes<00:01:34.500> as<00:01:34.829> an<00:01:34.979> option<00:01:35.369> here<00:01:36.320> and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
got text your eyes as an option here and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.890 
got text your eyes as an option here and
so<00:01:37.890> now<00:01:38.040> i'm<00:01:38.220> looking<00:01:38.430> at<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:39.180> texturized

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
so now i'm looking at a texturized

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.710 
so now i'm looking at a texturized
version<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.100> picture<00:01:41.520> which<00:01:42.390> some<00:01:42.630> of

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
version of the picture which some of

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.999 
version of the picture which some of
them<00:01:42.810> are<00:01:42.930> kind<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.200> hard<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.530> see<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
them are kind of hard to see the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.389 
them are kind of hard to see the
difference<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.640> small<00:01:45.000> preview<00:01:45.299> screen

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
difference in the small preview screen

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.859 
difference in the small preview screen
unless<00:01:47.399> it's<00:01:47.610> one<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.939> more<00:01:48.090> drastic<00:01:48.659> ones

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
unless it's one of the more drastic ones

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.550 
unless it's one of the more drastic ones
like<00:01:49.280> like<00:01:50.280> outline<00:01:50.790> here<00:01:51.210> come<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.960> there<00:01:52.470> we

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
like like outline here come on there we

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.620 
like like outline here come on there we
go<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.610> now<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:54.030> see<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.420> huge

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
go so now you can see the huge

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.480 
go so now you can see the huge
difference<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:56.040> there's<00:01:56.189> some<00:01:56.369> other

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
difference so there's some other

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.160 
difference so there's some other
functions<00:01:57.060> those<00:01:57.270> are<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.570> all<00:01:57.840> kind<00:01:58.110> of

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
functions those are just all kind of

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.289 
functions those are just all kind of
filters<00:01:58.590> or<00:01:58.860> special<00:01:59.250> effects<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.090> can

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
filters or special effects that you can

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.160 
filters or special effects that you can
use<00:02:00.649> we<00:02:01.649> also<00:02:01.829> have<00:02:02.549> some<00:02:03.450> settings<00:02:03.930> whoops

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
use we also have some settings whoops

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.990 
use we also have some settings whoops
that's<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.439> photo<00:02:04.649> album<00:02:04.979> I'm<00:02:05.070> sorry<00:02:05.310> we<00:02:05.850> also

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
that's the photo album I'm sorry we also

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.700 
that's the photo album I'm sorry we also
have<00:02:06.210> some<00:02:06.630> settings<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.259> we<00:02:07.320> could<00:02:07.500> choose

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
have some settings that we could choose

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.910 
have some settings that we could choose
from<00:02:08.390> when<00:02:09.390> we<00:02:09.599> take<00:02:09.840> an<00:02:10.050> actual<00:02:10.500> picture

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
from when we take an actual picture

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.130 
from when we take an actual picture
taking<00:02:11.670> an<00:02:11.790> actual<00:02:12.120> picture<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.599> just<00:02:12.810> as<00:02:12.959> easy

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
taking an actual picture is just as easy

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.680 
taking an actual picture is just as easy
as<00:02:13.349> click

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
as click

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.860 
as click
the<00:02:13.870> shutter<00:02:14.110> right<00:02:14.380> in<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.560> middle<00:02:15.270> so<00:02:16.270> you

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
the shutter right in the middle so you

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.690 
the shutter right in the middle so you
know<00:02:16.990> it's<00:02:17.440> no<00:02:17.680> different<00:02:17.920> than<00:02:18.160> taking<00:02:18.580> a

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
know it's no different than taking a

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.970 
know it's no different than taking a
regular<00:02:19.150> picture<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:20.470> then<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.710> get<00:02:20.860> the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
regular picture and then you get the

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.220 
regular picture and then you get the
full<00:02:21.190> screen<00:02:21.550> there<00:02:21.910> so<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:22.810> can<00:02:22.930> see<00:02:23.080> the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
full screen there so you can see the

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.590 
full screen there so you can see the
full<00:02:23.380> screen<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:23.920> what<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:24.130> looks<00:02:24.310> like<00:02:24.600> and

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
full screen and what it looks like and

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.910 
full screen and what it looks like and
you<00:02:25.750> can<00:02:25.900> make<00:02:26.050> changes<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.680> it

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
you can make changes to it

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.610 
you can make changes to it
post-production<00:02:27.760> as<00:02:28.210> well<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:29.110> we<00:02:29.260> could<00:02:29.440> go

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
post-production as well so we could go

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.740 
post-production as well so we could go
and<00:02:29.950> make<00:02:30.160> changes<00:02:30.700> because<00:02:30.940> it's<00:02:31.240> doing<00:02:31.570> all

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
and make changes because it's doing all

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.680 
and make changes because it's doing all
this<00:02:31.990> stuff<00:02:32.190> in<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.430> software<00:02:33.910> so<00:02:34.240> it<00:02:34.270> didn't

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
this stuff in the software so it didn't

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.350 
this stuff in the software so it didn't
actually<00:02:34.920> take<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.160> picture<00:02:36.550> any<00:02:36.880> different

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
actually take the picture any different

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.910 
actually take the picture any different
than<00:02:37.450> normally<00:02:37.960> what<00:02:38.140> it's<00:02:38.290> just<00:02:38.440> displaying

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
than normally what it's just displaying

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.800 
than normally what it's just displaying
it<00:02:39.130> back<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.550> you<00:02:39.640> then<00:02:40.150> when<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:40.390> hit<00:02:40.540> save

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
it back to you then when you hit save

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.840 
it back to you then when you hit save
it's<00:02:41.080> actually<00:02:41.470> going<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.830> apply<00:02:42.190> that

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
it's actually going to apply that

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.290 
it's actually going to apply that
setting<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.560> we<00:02:44.800> also<00:02:44.950> have<00:02:45.340> color<00:02:45.670> adjustment

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
setting so we also have color adjustment

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.900 
setting so we also have color adjustment
here<00:02:46.540> we<00:02:47.530> could<00:02:47.710> white<00:02:47.890> balance<00:02:48.370> high

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
here we could white balance high

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.570 
here we could white balance high
contrast<00:02:49.600> optimized<00:02:50.380> for<00:02:50.410> faces<00:02:51.100> turn<00:02:51.370> that

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
contrast optimized for faces turn that

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.520 
contrast optimized for faces turn that
on<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:53.290> there's<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.680> lot<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.370> features<00:02:55.300> and<00:02:55.660> if

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
on so there's a lot of features and if

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.530 
on so there's a lot of features and if
you<00:02:56.710> start<00:02:56.950> hitting<00:02:57.310> them<00:02:57.400> too<00:02:57.550> fast<00:02:57.850> you

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
you start hitting them too fast you

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.530 
you start hitting them too fast you
possibly<00:02:59.050> could<00:02:59.380> freeze<00:02:59.740> the<00:03:00.100> app<00:03:00.460> so<00:03:00.940> as<00:03:01.270> I've

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
possibly could freeze the app so as I've

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.400 
possibly could freeze the app so as I've
said<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:02.800> is<00:03:02.980> kind<00:03:03.280> of<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.540> ram<00:03:04.540> intensive<00:03:05.200> app

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
said it is kind of a ram intensive app

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.640 
said it is kind of a ram intensive app
so<00:03:06.040> don't<00:03:06.430> worry<00:03:06.610> in<00:03:07.570> that<00:03:07.810> situation<00:03:08.170> if<00:03:08.560> it

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
so don't worry in that situation if it

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.730 
so don't worry in that situation if it
does<00:03:08.830> freeze<00:03:09.160> up<00:03:10.260> obviously<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.380> brought<00:03:11.590> us

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
does freeze up obviously it brought us

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.200 
does freeze up obviously it brought us
right<00:03:11.920> back<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.130> where<00:03:12.400> we<00:03:12.580> were<00:03:12.610> which<00:03:13.060> is

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
right back to where we were which is

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.840 
right back to where we were which is
really<00:03:13.420> good<00:03:13.720> so<00:03:14.050> it's<00:03:14.260> not<00:03:14.440> a<00:03:15.040> total<00:03:15.550> loss

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
really good so it's not a total loss

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.310 
really good so it's not a total loss
here<00:03:16.390> so<00:03:17.080> let's<00:03:17.620> actually<00:03:19.020> well<00:03:20.020> that's<00:03:20.200> our

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
here so let's actually well that's our

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.380 
here so let's actually well that's our
image<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:20.920> it's<00:03:21.070> got<00:03:21.280> loaded<00:03:21.610> in<00:03:21.850> down<00:03:22.120> there

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
image that it's got loaded in down there

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.330 
image that it's got loaded in down there
let's<00:03:23.320> look<00:03:23.440> at<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.680> rest<00:03:23.709> of<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.100> settings

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
let's look at the rest of the settings

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.790 
let's look at the rest of the settings
while<00:03:24.700> we're<00:03:24.850> in<00:03:24.970> here<00:03:25.320> so<00:03:26.320> we've<00:03:26.470> got<00:03:26.650> the

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
while we're in here so we've got the

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.490 
while we're in here so we've got the
color<00:03:27.239> we've<00:03:28.239> got<00:03:28.480> face<00:03:29.190> detection<00:03:31.500> qualities

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
color we've got face detection qualities

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.820 
color we've got face detection qualities
of<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:32.860> face<00:03:33.550> show<00:03:34.420> in<00:03:34.570> preview<00:03:35.050> and<00:03:35.350> show<00:03:35.590> an

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
of the face show in preview and show an

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.400 
of the face show in preview and show an
export<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:37.180> then<00:03:37.360> we've<00:03:37.540> got<00:03:37.750> some<00:03:37.989> camera

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
export and then we've got some camera

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.670 
export and then we've got some camera
settings<00:03:38.800> here<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:40.120> modes<00:03:40.360> preview<00:03:41.140> we<00:03:41.500> could

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
settings here the modes preview we could

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.040 
settings here the modes preview we could
turn<00:03:41.860> off<00:03:42.100> that<00:03:42.400> if<00:03:42.700> we<00:03:43.269> don't<00:03:43.510> want<00:03:43.720> to

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
turn off that if we don't want to

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.860 
turn off that if we don't want to
preview<00:03:44.830> on<00:03:45.160> anymore<00:03:45.489> we<00:03:46.300> could<00:03:46.480> turn<00:03:46.630> that

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
preview on anymore we could turn that

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:54.120 
preview on anymore we could turn that
off<00:03:49.769> go<00:03:50.769> on<00:03:50.920> settings<00:03:52.410> come<00:03:53.410> back<00:03:53.590> there<00:03:53.920> we<00:03:54.010> go

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
to the photo album you know and it won't

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.009 
to the photo album you know and it won't
prompt<00:04:04.060> you<00:04:04.150> to<00:04:04.180> do<00:04:04.450> anything<00:04:04.570> with<00:04:04.930> the

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
prompt you to do anything with the

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.199 
prompt you to do anything with the
picture<00:04:05.350> so<00:04:05.860> you<00:04:05.920> can<00:04:05.980> go<00:04:06.190> continuous<00:04:06.850> as<00:04:07.000> well

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
picture so you can go continuous as well

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.810 
picture so you can go continuous as well
you've<00:04:07.780> got<00:04:08.019> a<00:04:08.050> delay<00:04:08.470> timer<00:04:09.040> here<00:04:09.400> which<00:04:09.640> is

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
you've got a delay timer here which is

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.949 
you've got a delay timer here which is
really<00:04:10.000> nice<00:04:10.209> you've<00:04:10.510> got<00:04:10.660> image

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
really nice you've got image

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.040 
really nice you've got image
stabilization<00:04:11.410> and<00:04:11.980> then<00:04:12.459> wait<00:04:12.670> for<00:04:12.700> faces<00:04:13.450> so

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
stabilization and then wait for faces so

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.780 
stabilization and then wait for faces so
what's<00:04:14.350> really<00:04:14.530> cool<00:04:14.830> is<00:04:14.890> that<00:04:15.190> this<00:04:15.489> actually

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
what's really cool is that this actually

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.690 
what's really cool is that this actually
has<00:04:16.239> face<00:04:16.600> detection<00:04:16.630> built<00:04:17.620> into<00:04:17.980> it<00:04:18.130> like<00:04:18.640> a

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
has face detection built into it like a

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.270 
has face detection built into it like a
lot<00:04:19.000> of<00:04:19.030> the<00:04:19.180> new<00:04:19.390> cameras<00:04:19.900> are<00:04:20.109> and<00:04:21.010> then<00:04:21.160> you

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
lot of the new cameras are and then you

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.340 
lot of the new cameras are and then you
can<00:04:21.459> choose<00:04:21.700> a<00:04:21.729> minimum<00:04:22.360> of<00:04:22.479> faces<00:04:22.990> how<00:04:23.200> many

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
can choose a minimum of faces how many

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.710 
can choose a minimum of faces how many
faces<00:04:23.770> you<00:04:23.919> want<00:04:24.130> it<00:04:24.220> to<00:04:24.340> detect<00:04:24.729> it'll<00:04:25.450> detect

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
faces you want it to detect it'll detect

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.780 
faces you want it to detect it'll detect
up<00:04:25.960> to<00:04:26.140> three

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
up to three

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.020 
up to three
with<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:27.600> setting<00:04:27.990> there<00:04:28.370> so<00:04:29.370> really<00:04:29.790> cool

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
with the setting there so really cool

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.910 
with the setting there so really cool
application<00:04:31.370> let's<00:04:32.370> actually<00:04:33.620> get<00:04:34.620> out<00:04:34.680> of

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
application let's actually get out of

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.350 
application let's actually get out of
here<00:04:35.070> and<00:04:35.220> I'm<00:04:35.310> going<00:04:35.460> to<00:04:35.490> restart<00:04:35.730> it<00:04:36.150> just

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
here and I'm going to restart it just

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.380 
here and I'm going to restart it just
for<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.600> sake<00:04:36.810> of<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:38.000> clearing<00:04:39.000> out<00:04:39.150> that

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
for the sake of it clearing out that

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.370 
for the sake of it clearing out that
image<00:04:41.480> that's<00:04:42.480> probably<00:04:42.750> not<00:04:42.900> going<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.110> clear

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
image that's probably not going to clear

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.710 
image that's probably not going to clear
it<00:04:43.470> out<00:04:43.880> one<00:04:44.880> of<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.060> things<00:04:45.180> that<00:04:45.360> I<00:04:45.450> haven't

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
it out one of the things that I haven't

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.490 
it out one of the things that I haven't
figured<00:04:46.200> out<00:04:46.320> how<00:04:46.980> to<00:04:47.040> do<00:04:47.400> really<00:04:47.730> is<00:04:48.000> to<00:04:48.500> clear

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
figured out how to do really is to clear

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.690 
figured out how to do really is to clear
this<00:04:49.710> out<00:04:49.920> very<00:04:49.980> well<00:04:50.520> I<00:04:51.480> I<00:04:52.440> don't<00:04:53.160> find<00:04:53.490> a

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
this out very well I I don't find a

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.590 
this out very well I I don't find a
setting<00:04:54.090> for<00:04:54.120> for<00:04:54.840> that<00:04:54.990> to<00:04:55.230> get<00:04:55.380> rid<00:04:55.410> of<00:04:56.600> what

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
setting for for that to get rid of what

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.560 
setting for for that to get rid of what
had<00:04:57.750> been<00:04:57.900> stored<00:04:58.290> in<00:04:58.500> the<00:04:58.590> preview<00:04:59.040> but<00:04:59.880> I'm

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
had been stored in the preview but I'm

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.920 
had been stored in the preview but I'm
sure<00:05:00.840> if<00:05:00.990> I<00:05:01.110> restarted<00:05:01.770> my<00:05:01.830> phone<00:05:02.720> then<00:05:03.720> that

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
sure if I restarted my phone then that

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.160 
sure if I restarted my phone then that
would<00:05:04.110> probably<00:05:04.400> happen<00:05:05.400> but<00:05:05.840> I'm<00:05:06.840> not<00:05:06.990> going

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
would probably happen but I'm not going

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.510 
would probably happen but I'm not going
to<00:05:07.260> do<00:05:07.440> that<00:05:07.470> so<00:05:08.010> anyhow<00:05:10.070> there<00:05:11.070> now<00:05:11.280> it's<00:05:11.460> a

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
to do that so anyhow there now it's a

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.280 
to do that so anyhow there now it's a
little<00:05:11.730> more<00:05:11.850> responsive<00:05:12.480> but<00:05:12.630> still<00:05:13.020> showing

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
little more responsive but still showing

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.490 
little more responsive but still showing

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
all this text here so and they're

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.260 
all this text here so and they're
working<00:05:38.010> on<00:05:38.100> a<00:05:38.160> frequently<00:05:38.580> asked<00:05:38.760> questions

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
working on a frequently asked questions

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.590 
working on a frequently asked questions
so<00:05:39.540> this<00:05:40.470> is<00:05:40.650> really<00:05:40.980> it's<00:05:41.370> a<00:05:41.550> lot<00:05:41.850> in<00:05:42.210> an<00:05:42.390> app

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
so this is really it's a lot in an app

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.340 
so this is really it's a lot in an app
for<00:05:43.530> a<00:05:43.590> camera<00:05:43.980> app<00:05:44.780> we've<00:05:45.780> reviewed<00:05:46.170> other

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
for a camera app we've reviewed other

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.620 
for a camera app we've reviewed other
apps<00:05:46.650> before<00:05:46.920> obviously<00:05:47.460> that<00:05:48.000> do<00:05:48.120> stuff<00:05:48.420> but

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
apps before obviously that do stuff but

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.080 
apps before obviously that do stuff but
this<00:05:48.780> one<00:05:49.050> kind<00:05:49.710> of<00:05:49.980> it<00:05:50.250> just<00:05:50.490> has<00:05:50.670> a<00:05:50.700> lot<00:05:51.060> of

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
this one kind of it just has a lot of

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.110 
this one kind of it just has a lot of
functionality<00:05:52.190> it<00:05:53.190> doesn't<00:05:53.550> respond<00:05:53.910> any

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
functionality it doesn't respond any

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.940 
functionality it doesn't respond any
different<00:05:54.510> when<00:05:54.600> you<00:05:54.660> turn<00:05:54.900> it<00:05:54.930> sideways<00:05:55.320> the

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
different when you turn it sideways the

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.580 
different when you turn it sideways the
controls<00:05:56.430> still<00:05:56.730> stay<00:05:56.970> over<00:05:57.270> here<00:05:57.510> which<00:05:58.440> is

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
controls still stay over here which is

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.200 
controls still stay over here which is
okay<00:05:58.950> because<00:05:58.980> that<00:05:59.550> feels<00:05:59.760> more<00:06:00.000> like<00:06:00.060> a

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
okay because that feels more like a
