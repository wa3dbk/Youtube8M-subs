length of the hole on the boat what
Craig<00:00:31.890> does<00:00:32.309> once<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.700> boat<00:00:32.850> comes<00:00:33.120> out<00:00:33.300> of

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
Craig does once the boat comes out of

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.680 
Craig does once the boat comes out of
water<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:34.140> he<00:00:34.890> will<00:00:35.070> rub<00:00:35.309> off<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:36.239> actual

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
water is he will rub off the actual

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:47.139 
water is he will rub off the actual
steel<00:00:37.320> work<00:00:37.559> here<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.399> xre<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.300> actual

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.080 

to<00:00:47.390> see<00:00:47.660> if<00:00:47.989> the<00:00:48.620> thickness<00:00:49.010> of<00:00:49.130> the<00:00:49.280> steel<00:00:49.550> is

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
to see if the thickness of the steel is

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.790 
to see if the thickness of the steel is
what<00:00:50.390> we've<00:00:50.540> actually<00:00:50.690> declared<00:00:51.290> on<00:00:51.440> there<00:00:51.620> so

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800

millimeters on a six mil bottom what is
important<00:01:09.200> is<00:01:09.320> when<00:01:09.530> we<00:01:09.650> look<00:01:09.770> at<00:01:09.920> things

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
important is when we look at things

important is when we look at things
along<00:01:10.640> here<00:01:10.700> we'll<00:01:11.360> go<00:01:11.479> along<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:11.810> whole

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
along here we'll go along the whole

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.380 
along here we'll go along the whole
length<00:01:12.259> of<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.619> boat<00:01:12.830> you<00:01:13.520> can<00:01:13.700> see<00:01:14.030> what<00:01:14.360> I

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
length of the boat you can see what I

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.710 
length of the boat you can see what I
call<00:01:14.780> a<00:01:15.110> pit<00:01:15.650> here<00:01:16.040> this<00:01:16.790> is<00:01:16.970> where<00:01:17.180> there's

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
call a pit here this is where there's

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.020 
call a pit here this is where there's
been<00:01:17.960> degradation<00:01:18.740> of<00:01:19.160> the<00:01:19.310> actual<00:01:19.670> steel

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
been degradation of the actual steel

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.630 
been degradation of the actual steel
work<00:01:20.300> and<00:01:20.539> the<00:01:21.500> thickness<00:01:21.860> of<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.280> steel<00:01:22.490> is

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
work and the thickness of the steel is

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.160 
work and the thickness of the steel is
actually<00:01:22.940> going<00:01:23.060> to<00:01:23.149> be<00:01:23.240> affected<00:01:23.690> to<00:01:23.840> kraid

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
actually going to be affected to kraid

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.040 
actually going to be affected to kraid
we'll<00:01:24.890> take<00:01:25.070> a<00:01:25.100> measurement<00:01:25.610> then<00:01:25.940> of<00:01:26.149> that

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
we'll take a measurement then of that

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.180 
we'll take a measurement then of that
pit<00:01:27.830> and<00:01:28.009> see<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:29.030> depth<00:01:29.360> of<00:01:29.630> that<00:01:29.800> pit<00:01:30.800> on<00:01:31.009> the

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
pit and see the depth of that pit on the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.700 
pit and see the depth of that pit on the
boat<00:01:31.399> that<00:01:31.670> is<00:01:32.259> 1.75<00:01:33.259> so<00:01:33.890> if<00:01:33.979> you<00:01:34.100> take<00:01:34.340> the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
boat that is 1.75 so if you take the

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.050 
boat that is 1.75 so if you take the
mass<00:01:36.710> from<00:01:37.160> the<00:01:37.310> thickness<00:01:37.580> of<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:37.880> steel

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
mass from the thickness of the steel

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.389 
mass from the thickness of the steel
which<00:01:38.300> is<00:01:38.420> five<00:01:38.630> point<00:01:38.899> seven<00:01:39.380> nine<00:01:39.560> taking

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
which is five point seven nine taking

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.880 
which is five point seven nine taking
1.75<00:01:41.270> off<00:01:41.479> this<00:01:41.660> boat<00:01:41.960> is<00:01:42.200> right<00:01:42.560> on<00:01:42.770> the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
1.75 off this boat is right on the

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.419 
1.75 off this boat is right on the
limits<00:01:43.220> of<00:01:43.429> its<00:01:43.759> insurability<00:01:44.710> for<00:01:45.710> insurance

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
limits of its insurability for insurance

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.040 
limits of its insurability for insurance
purposes<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:47.060> insurance<00:01:47.450> companies<00:01:47.810> do

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
purposes the insurance companies do

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.469 
purposes the insurance companies do
actually<00:01:48.530> say<00:01:48.890> that<00:01:49.520> this<00:01:49.700> steel<00:01:50.030> thickness

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
actually say that this steel thickness

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.140 
actually say that this steel thickness
needs<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:51.020> be<00:01:51.170> four<00:01:51.920> millimeters<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:52.790> you<00:01:53.000> can

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
needs to be four millimeters and you can

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.690 
needs to be four millimeters and you can
see<00:01:53.360> just<00:01:53.540> on<00:01:53.720> that<00:01:53.840> one<00:01:54.079> pit<00:01:54.380> there<00:01:54.619> it<00:01:55.070> starts

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
see just on that one pit there it starts

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.240 
see just on that one pit there it starts
to<00:01:55.850> become<00:01:56.079> uninsurable<00:01:57.079> as<00:01:57.470> we<00:01:57.920> walk<00:01:58.100> along
