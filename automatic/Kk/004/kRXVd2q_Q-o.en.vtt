 hello again come to another section of 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.990
 pokemon news not really so 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.210
 important and good this is not 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.040
 we will talk about the new letters that 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.270
 Nintendo just announced do not know if 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.300
 you know but nintendo also 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.880
 has a pokemon version for cards 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.490
 collectibles the pokemon training card 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.420
 I do not know if you have ever used 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.320
 these letters or if any of my 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.970
 subscribers be fan of these letters 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.530
 but well, it's also a franchise 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.210
 which is also very good and in fact 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.310
 I think Nintendo puts a little more 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.410
 Attention to this franchise since it is usually 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.450
 leave a little more money than 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.640
 video games itself and well we already 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.399
 we know nintendo but in short and good 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.670
 what we are going to talk about this time is 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.160

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.429

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.100
 constantly updated according to 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:51.780
 versions according to the same 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.699
 generations are advancing also the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.609

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.589

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:59.610

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.820
