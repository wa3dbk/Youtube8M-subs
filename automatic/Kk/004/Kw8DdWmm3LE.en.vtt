00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
the backup program in Windows 8.1 and

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.379 
the backup program in Windows 8.1 and
how<00:00:07.290> it's<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.620> little<00:00:07.740> different<00:00:08.069> from<00:00:08.519> Windows

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
how it's a little different from Windows

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.129 
how it's a little different from Windows
8<00:00:10.519> now<00:00:11.719> before<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.750> get<00:00:12.960> too<00:00:13.590> far<00:00:13.620> into<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.370> um

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
8 now before I get too far into this um

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.040 
8 now before I get too far into this um
there<00:00:16.139> are<00:00:16.170> two<00:00:16.680> types<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.130> backup<00:00:17.580> there's

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
there are two types of backup there's

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.269 
there are two types of backup there's
one<00:00:19.050> where<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.410> just<00:00:19.439> backup<00:00:19.859> your<00:00:20.130> data

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
one where you just backup your data

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.929 
one where you just backup your data
files<00:00:20.609> which<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.600> called<00:00:21.810> file<00:00:22.080> history<00:00:22.590> in

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
files which is called file history in

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.080 
files which is called file history in
Windows<00:00:23.939> 8.1<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.720> Windows<00:00:25.619> 8<00:00:26.310> it's<00:00:26.910> also

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
Windows 8.1 and Windows 8 it's also

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.419 
Windows 8.1 and Windows 8 it's also
called<00:00:27.359> file<00:00:27.599> history<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.260> then<00:00:29.130> there's<00:00:29.369> a

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
called file history and then there's a

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.999 
called file history and then there's a
system<00:00:29.880> image<00:00:30.150> backup<00:00:30.260> where<00:00:31.260> backs<00:00:31.619> up<00:00:31.859> your

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
system image backup where backs up your

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.650 
system image backup where backs up your
entire<00:00:32.250> hard<00:00:32.550> drive<00:00:32.610> programs<00:00:33.710> applications

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
entire hard drive programs applications

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.860 
entire hard drive programs applications
data<00:00:36.660> files<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.260> whole<00:00:37.410> nine<00:00:37.620> yards<00:00:38.870> in

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
data files the whole nine yards in

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.780 
data files the whole nine yards in
Windows<00:00:40.290> 8<00:00:40.440> was<00:00:40.649> called<00:00:40.920> Windows<00:00:41.219> 7<00:00:41.520> file

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
Windows 8 was called Windows 7 file

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.779 
Windows 8 was called Windows 7 file
recovery<00:00:42.320> now<00:00:43.320> Windows<00:00:43.739> 7<00:00:44.040> file<00:00:44.250> recovery<00:00:44.550> is

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
recovery now Windows 7 file recovery is

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.529 
recovery now Windows 7 file recovery is
no<00:00:45.000> longer<00:00:45.300> available<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:46.050> Windows<00:00:46.350> 8.1<00:00:47.539> so

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
no longer available in Windows 8.1 so

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.700 
no longer available in Windows 8.1 so
let's<00:00:48.930> start<00:00:49.320> with<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:51.000> backup<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.629> we<00:00:52.530> can

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
let's start with the backup and we can

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.360 
let's start with the backup and we can
just<00:00:52.920> start<00:00:53.550> typing<00:00:53.820> here<00:00:54.559> file<00:00:55.559> history<00:00:55.860> and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
just start typing here file history and

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.709 
just start typing here file history and
it'll<00:00:57.210> take<00:00:57.390> us<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.930> file<00:00:58.410> history<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.719> right

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
it'll take us to file history and right

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.469 
it'll take us to file history and right
now<00:01:01.020> um<00:01:01.670> I<00:01:03.470> have<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:05.119> first<00:01:06.119> thing<00:01:06.270> I'm<00:01:06.390> going

now um I have the first thing I'm going

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.060 
now um I have the first thing I'm going
to<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.810> select<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.260> device<00:01:07.530> where<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.830> want<00:01:08.010> to

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
to do is select a device where I want to

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.050 
to do is select a device where I want to
backup<00:01:08.460> file<00:01:09.000> history<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:11.970> to

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
backup file history to so it's going to

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.320 
backup file history to so it's going to
go<00:01:12.180> through<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.479> search<00:01:12.810> here<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:14.150> then<00:01:15.150> once

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
go through a search here and then once

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.450 
go through a search here and then once
it<00:01:15.479> finds<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.930> backup<00:01:16.320> Drive<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.220> select

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
it finds the backup Drive I just select

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.469 
it finds the backup Drive I just select
that<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.850> hit<00:01:17.970> OK<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:19.880> I'm<00:01:20.880> going<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.060> say<00:01:21.240> no

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
to this because I have done this before

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.020 
to this because I have done this before
for<00:01:24.540> testing<00:01:24.930> purposes<00:01:25.430> but<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.640> might<00:01:26.850> want

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
for testing purposes but you might want

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.550 
for testing purposes but you might want
to<00:01:27.060> say<00:01:27.210> yes<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.750> just<00:01:27.990> depends<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.409> what

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
to say yes it just depends on what

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.289 
to say yes it just depends on what
you've<00:01:28.680> done<00:01:28.860> before<00:01:29.540> um<00:01:31.070> ok<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.250> right<00:01:33.090> now

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
you've done before um ok so right now

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.940 
you've done before um ok so right now
set<00:01:33.630> up<00:01:33.659> file<00:01:33.960> history<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.650> what<00:01:34.799> it's

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
set up file history and what it's

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.520 
set up file history and what it's
basically<00:01:35.159> doing<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.790> making<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.180> copy<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.810> all

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
basically doing is making a copy of all

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.120 
basically doing is making a copy of all
of<00:01:38.040> my<00:01:38.189> files<00:01:39.049> onto<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.290> external<00:01:40.740> hard<00:01:40.860> drive

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
of my files onto the external hard drive

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.520 
of my files onto the external hard drive
and<00:01:41.159> making<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.610> backup<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.990> it's

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
and making a backup of it and it's

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.370 
and making a backup of it and it's
really<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.950> simple<00:01:45.049> we<00:01:46.049> could<00:01:46.170> effectively

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
really that simple we could effectively

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.350 
really that simple we could effectively
stop<00:01:46.920> here<00:01:47.220> all<00:01:47.430> your<00:01:47.610> data<00:01:47.790> files<00:01:48.060> are<00:01:48.210> backed

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
stop here all your data files are backed

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.630 
stop here all your data files are backed
up<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:49.290> what<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.560> not<00:01:49.710> going<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.979> backup<00:01:50.189> is

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
up but what it's not going to backup is

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.590 
up but what it's not going to backup is
your<00:01:50.850> programs<00:01:51.360> um<00:01:52.880> before<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.090> get<00:01:54.329> into<00:01:54.479> that

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
your programs um before I get into that

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.080 
your programs um before I get into that
let<00:01:54.990> me<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.530> hit<00:01:55.740> touch<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:56.670> advanced

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
let me just hit touch on advanced

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.109 
let me just hit touch on advanced
settings<00:01:57.329> here<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.280> then<00:01:59.280> here<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.670> can

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
settings here and then here you can

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.240 
settings here and then here you can
change<00:02:00.570> how<00:02:01.140> frequently<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.890> wanted<00:02:02.159> to

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
change how frequently you wanted to

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.429 
change how frequently you wanted to
backup<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.850> recommend<00:02:03.840> every<00:02:04.049> 10<00:02:04.229> minutes

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
backup I recommend every 10 minutes

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.389 
backup I recommend every 10 minutes
especially<00:02:05.100> if<00:02:05.520> it's<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.700> desktop<00:02:06.000> machine

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
especially if it's a desktop machine

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.650 
especially if it's a desktop machine
you're<00:02:08.399> probably<00:02:08.729> not<00:02:08.940> even<00:02:09.000> notice<00:02:09.629> that

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
you're probably not even notice that

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.420 
you're probably not even notice that
it's<00:02:09.899> running<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.319> background<00:02:10.500> and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
it's running in the background and

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.580 
it's running in the background and
anyways<00:02:13.430> that's<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.970> way<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.150> would<00:02:14.300> do<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.690> as

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
anyways that's the way I would do it as

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.800 
anyways that's the way I would do it as
far<00:02:15.800> as<00:02:15.920> keeping<00:02:16.220> saved<00:02:16.459> versions<00:02:16.940> at<00:02:17.180> some

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
far as keeping saved versions at some

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.270 
far as keeping saved versions at some
point<00:02:18.140> you'll<00:02:18.350> run<00:02:18.500> out<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:18.650> space<00:02:18.950> in<00:02:19.010> your

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
point you'll run out of space in your

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.500 
point you'll run out of space in your
external<00:02:19.580> hard<00:02:19.760> drive<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:20.770> I<00:02:22.209> change<00:02:23.209> it<00:02:23.360> until

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
external hard drive so I change it until

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.860 
external hard drive so I change it until
space<00:02:23.959> is<00:02:24.170> needed<00:02:25.300> that's<00:02:26.300> just<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.600> way<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:26.720> do

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
space is needed that's just the way I do

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.230 
space is needed that's just the way I do
it<00:02:27.200> but<00:02:27.440> you<00:02:28.190> have<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.430> decide<00:02:28.550> for<00:02:28.760> yourself

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
it but you have to decide for yourself

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.860 
it but you have to decide for yourself
what<00:02:29.390> works<00:02:29.600> best<00:02:29.840> for<00:02:29.959> you<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:32.450> going<00:02:32.600> back

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
what works best for you so going back

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.080 
what works best for you so going back
here<00:02:33.260> as<00:02:33.470> far<00:02:33.709> as<00:02:33.770> creating<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.430> system<00:02:34.640> image

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
here as far as creating a system image

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.979 
here as far as creating a system image
now<00:02:35.930> Microsoft<00:02:37.120> put<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.270> thing<00:02:38.510> here<00:02:38.810> this

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
now Microsoft put this thing here this

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.840 
now Microsoft put this thing here this
is<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.200> manual<00:02:39.950> click<00:02:40.250> you<00:02:40.430> can<00:02:40.580> create<00:02:40.790> a

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
is a manual click you can create a

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.150 
is a manual click you can create a
system<00:02:41.209> image<00:02:41.330> by<00:02:41.989> clicking<00:02:42.560> on<00:02:42.709> it<00:02:42.920> and

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
system image by clicking on it and

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.979 
system image by clicking on it and
running<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.459> manually<00:02:43.940> as<00:02:44.330> of<00:02:44.780> right<00:02:44.930> now

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
running it manually as of right now

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.470 
running it manually as of right now
there's<00:02:45.380> no<00:02:45.470> automated<00:02:45.830> method<00:02:46.340> of<00:02:46.520> creating

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
there's no automated method of creating

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.360 
there's no automated method of creating
an<00:02:47.720> image<00:02:47.870> backup<00:02:48.500> on<00:02:48.709> a<00:02:48.770> scheduled<00:02:49.459> basis<00:02:50.050> so

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
an image backup on a scheduled basis so

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.310 
an image backup on a scheduled basis so
unless<00:02:52.370> you're<00:02:52.580> going<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.730> do<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:53.420> script<00:02:54.140> line

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
unless you're going to do a script line

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.050 
unless you're going to do a script line
there<00:02:54.739> are<00:02:54.769> some<00:02:55.040> partial<00:02:55.489> scripts<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:55.910> could

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
there are some partial scripts you could

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.900 
there are some partial scripts you could
do<00:02:56.180> but<00:02:56.890> most<00:02:57.890> average<00:02:58.340> users<00:02:58.640> aren't<00:02:58.850> going

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
do but most average users aren't going

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.270 
do but most average users aren't going
to<00:02:59.090> bother<00:02:59.180> with<00:02:59.360> that<00:02:59.510> and<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.769> reality<00:03:01.250> of

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
to bother with that and the reality of

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.610 
to bother with that and the reality of
it<00:03:01.489> is<00:03:01.810> most<00:03:02.810> people<00:03:03.140> aren't<00:03:03.260> even<00:03:03.320> going<00:03:03.530> to

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
it is most people aren't even going to

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.979 
it is most people aren't even going to
use<00:03:03.769> this<00:03:04.040> system<00:03:04.280> image<00:03:04.700> backup<00:03:04.780> because<00:03:05.780> you

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
use this system image backup because you

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.150 
use this system image backup because you
have<00:03:06.110> to<00:03:06.230> manually<00:03:06.590> do<00:03:06.890> it

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
have to manually do it

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.030 
have to manually do it
so<00:03:07.760> Microsoft's<00:03:08.360> really<00:03:08.720> made<00:03:08.989> it<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:09.500> that

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
so Microsoft's really made it so that

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.729 
so Microsoft's really made it so that
you<00:03:10.540> pretty<00:03:11.540> much<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.959> only<00:03:12.260> backup<00:03:12.440> program

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
you pretty much the only backup program

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.170 
you pretty much the only backup program
they're<00:03:13.070> really<00:03:13.310> offering<00:03:13.730> is<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:13.850> file

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
they're really offering is the file

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.890 
they're really offering is the file
history<00:03:14.620> on<00:03:15.620> an<00:03:15.739> automated<00:03:16.160> basis<00:03:16.730> I<00:03:16.910> really

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
history on an automated basis I really

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.770 
history on an automated basis I really
do<00:03:18.049> hope<00:03:18.260> that<00:03:18.940> Microsoft<00:03:19.940> will<00:03:20.120> rethink<00:03:20.600> this

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
do hope that Microsoft will rethink this

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.520 
do hope that Microsoft will rethink this
I<00:03:21.019> can<00:03:21.680> only<00:03:21.739> imagine<00:03:22.010> what<00:03:22.519> they're<00:03:22.700> thinking

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
I can only imagine what they're thinking

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.199 
I can only imagine what they're thinking
processes<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:24.799> which<00:03:25.160> I'm<00:03:25.549> going<00:03:25.850> to<00:03:25.940> guess

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
processes and which I'm going to guess

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.500 
processes and which I'm going to guess
here<00:03:26.690> is<00:03:27.320> that<00:03:28.280> they're<00:03:28.640> trying<00:03:29.209> to<00:03:29.269> put

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
here is that they're trying to put

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.750 
here is that they're trying to put
everything<00:03:29.810> through<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.590> application<00:03:31.489> store

everything through the application store

everything through the application store
through<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.150> app<00:03:32.299> store<00:03:33.040> that<00:03:34.040> they<00:03:34.160> want<00:03:34.340> all

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
through the app store that they want all

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:35.949 
through the app store that they want all
of<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.000> vendors<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.450> go<00:03:35.570> through<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.840> app

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
of the vendors to go through the app

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.310 
of the vendors to go through the app

Adobe Photoshop or avid studio to name a

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
few programs that are not available

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.770 
few programs that are not available
through<00:03:59.870> the<00:04:00.940> Windows<00:04:01.940> Store<00:04:02.180> right<00:04:02.450> at<00:04:02.630> this

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
through the Windows Store right at this

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.500 
through the Windows Store right at this
moment<00:04:03.640> it's<00:04:04.640> not<00:04:04.760> going<00:04:05.000> to<00:04:05.060> restore<00:04:05.390> those

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
moment it's not going to restore those

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.759 
moment it's not going to restore those
programs<00:04:06.079> and<00:04:06.730> so<00:04:07.730> I<00:04:08.329> hope<00:04:09.079> Microsoft<00:04:09.620> will

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
programs and so I hope Microsoft will

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.130 
programs and so I hope Microsoft will
rethink<00:04:09.920> this<00:04:10.430> and<00:04:11.150> at<00:04:11.450> least<00:04:11.600> give<00:04:11.840> us<00:04:11.870> an

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
rethink this and at least give us an

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.539 
rethink this and at least give us an
opportunity<00:04:12.380> to<00:04:13.180> create<00:04:14.180> a<00:04:14.900> schedule<00:04:15.890> to<00:04:16.430> do<00:04:16.519> a

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
opportunity to create a schedule to do a
