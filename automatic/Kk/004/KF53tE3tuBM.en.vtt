little<00:01:25.080> bit<00:01:25.229> loose<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.680> it'll<00:01:25.920> swing<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.430> tiny

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.980 
tyre cocon get some good dubstep going
on<00:04:27.919> there<00:04:28.100> and<00:04:28.310> yes<00:04:28.730> I<00:04:28.940> am<00:04:28.970> well<00:04:29.240> aware<00:04:29.360> of<00:04:29.510> what

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
probably a somewhat easy pass but the

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.969

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
getting the set is definitely the easier

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.000

route<00:06:17.699> however<00:06:18.659> be<00:06:19.050> warned<00:06:19.320> that<00:06:19.349> the<00:06:19.620> box<00:06:19.830> is

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010

quite<00:06:20.159> a<00:06:20.280> bit<00:06:20.460> bigger<00:06:20.580> so<00:06:20.789> shipping<00:06:21.389> costs<00:06:21.780> on

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
quite a bit bigger so shipping costs on

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.320 
quite a bit bigger so shipping costs on
the<00:06:22.110> set<00:06:22.409> might<00:06:22.620> actually<00:06:22.860> be<00:06:23.310> higher<00:06:23.760> than<00:06:24.120> if

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
the set might actually be higher than if

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.629 
the set might actually be higher than if
you<00:06:24.510> were<00:06:24.659> to<00:06:24.690> buy<00:06:24.960> them<00:06:25.199> separately<00:06:25.650> so<00:06:26.460> do

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 
you were to buy them separately so do

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:28.790 
you were to buy them separately so do
keep<00:06:26.820> that<00:06:27.060> in<00:06:27.210> mind<00:06:27.419> by<00:06:28.020> what<00:06:28.229> you<00:06:28.380> can<00:06:28.560> but

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800
