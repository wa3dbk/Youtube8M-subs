very similar to the schedule may be that

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.570

for<00:02:19.980> another<00:02:20.930> video<00:02:21.930> if<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.350> like<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.620> but<00:02:23.550> I

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
for another video if you like it but I

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.680 
for another video if you like it but I
think<00:02:23.940> we<00:02:24.060> should<00:02:24.240> give<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.569> credit<00:02:25.020> to<00:02:26.690> what

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
think we should give the credit to what

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.100 
think we should give the credit to what
I<00:02:28.640> think<00:02:29.640> we<00:02:29.790> should<00:02:29.970> give<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.300> credit<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.660> and

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
I think we should give the credit to and

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.100 
I think we should give the credit to and
you'll<00:02:31.470> see<00:02:31.770> why<00:02:31.950> let<00:02:32.610> us<00:02:32.640> read<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.060> first<00:02:33.420> so
