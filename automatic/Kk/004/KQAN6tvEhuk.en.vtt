put<00:03:28.440> up<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:30.290> good<00:03:31.290> shot<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.680> ketchup<00:03:37.879> know<00:03:38.879> as

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
put up a good shot of ketchup know as

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.379 
put up a good shot of ketchup know as
much<00:03:39.389> moisture<00:03:39.660> as<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:40.019> thought<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:40.260> did<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:41.389> but

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
much moisture as I thought I did so but

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.509 
much moisture as I thought I did so but
I<00:03:42.660> didn't<00:03:43.260> put<00:03:43.410> this<00:03:43.500> mustard<00:03:43.949> in<00:03:44.069> last<00:03:44.310> time

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:45.530 
I didn't put this mustard in last time
but<00:03:44.669> I<00:03:44.730> think<00:03:44.910> it's<00:03:45.030> gonna<00:03:45.120> give<00:03:45.299> it<00:03:45.329> a<00:03:45.449> little

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
but I think it's gonna give it a little

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.360 
but I think it's gonna give it a little
bit<00:03:45.720> of<00:03:45.810> bite<00:03:45.989> to<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.410> gonna<00:03:46.650> be<00:03:46.769> good

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.759 

and<00:03:50.370> then<00:03:51.709> grated<00:03:52.709> cheese<00:03:54.409> more<00:03:55.409> the<00:03:55.530> merrier

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
and then grated cheese more the merrier

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:13.050 
and then grated cheese more the merrier
on<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.129> cheese<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.609> then<00:03:56.699> that<00:03:56.879> goes

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.009 

and<00:04:14.060> that's<00:04:14.239> making<00:04:14.540> like<00:04:14.659> a<00:04:14.689> cream-based

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
and that's making like a cream-based

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.460 
and that's making like a cream-based
soup<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:15.739> can<00:04:15.769> see<00:04:16.100> kinda<00:04:16.729> and<00:04:17.359> then<00:04:18.109> like<00:04:18.289> I

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
soup you can see kinda and then like I

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:25.810

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
got four hot dogs here and I don't know

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.990 
got four hot dogs here and I don't know
why<00:04:26.320> but<00:04:27.320> to<00:04:27.380> flavor<00:04:27.740> these<00:04:27.979> hot<00:04:28.190> dogs<00:04:28.430> with

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
why but to flavor these hot dogs with

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.730 
why but to flavor these hot dogs with
the<00:04:29.120> rest<00:04:29.270> of<00:04:29.419> this<00:04:29.479> stuff<00:04:29.720> this<00:04:30.289> seems<00:04:30.590> to

the rest of this stuff this seems to

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.860

match<00:04:30.889> up<00:04:31.160> really<00:04:31.340> well<00:04:31.639> and<00:04:31.970> I<00:04:32.660> probably

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
match up really well and I probably

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.020 
match up really well and I probably
