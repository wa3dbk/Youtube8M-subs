00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.459
 laterality is an exercise of the most 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.529
 important laterality allows us 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:19.230
 synchronize a part with the part 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.869
 opposite with the brain laterality 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.750
 it has to do with even the movement 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.850
 of the little boy who puts a 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.250
 element more usually laterality 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.590
 we do exercises of a part and of 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.040
 another or movements of one part of another 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.430
 but here is also the turn that makes 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.129
 the child when crawling in one direction 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.700
 contrary many times to the leg 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:47.670
 then from that laterality allows 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.829
 a synchronization of the hemispheres 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.409
 brain 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.260
 every time we move an arm what 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:58.079
 we work with the opposite hemisphere 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.370
 a leg with the contracted hemisphere 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.460
 and then we go synchronizing 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.369
 when there is an imbalance the attention 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.640
 a lot of attention is lost a lot 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:14.390
 of concentration is important in 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.940
 important runners in any type 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.420
 of exercise and simply the fact of 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.450
 we are already synchronizing the theme 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.490
 basic synchronization 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.799
 the laterality 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.149
 even in walking when a person 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:34.729
 walks on a more robotic level a foot 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.680
 right and right hand is not there 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.070
 synchronizing 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.290
 in the balance of its laterality but 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.530
 rather there is a confusion in the 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.950
 information that will lead to some locks 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.350
 more or less clear that it will be necessary to be 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.970
 through kinesiology and see where 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.580
 comes the deep conflict and how 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.950
 actually release it the balance 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.310
 I would be in a movement that whole 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.439
 side 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.020
 in the movement that unbalances that 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.060
 movement as lateral a movement 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.789
 from the same side always everything from above 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.680
 down brain everything in motion 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:16.730
 Side whole has many advantages 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:20.090
 not only the fact of stimulating all the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.599
 balance of the body but also 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.579
 can help fix information when 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.739
 we have a substance in the 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.180
 body that we want to take for example 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.340
 to the brain 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.069
 we can use the lymphatic neuro 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.959
 of the brain placing the substance in the 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.379
 mouth and start doing the movements 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.230
 crossroads with which it is good to 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:44.780
 we are giving the information to the brain 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.629
 from the brain with information from 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.799
 the substance and then when we take that 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.439
 substance 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.180
 that substance will go more directly to that area 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:56.209
 because we are stimulating a 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.659
 energy information towards an area 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.650
 we are giving the information if it were the 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:07.000
 liver or run the same 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:10.689
 how we had the liver in the pectoral 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.360
 we would take and choose the exercise of 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:16.569
 synchronization and so we would achieve 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.900
 integrate the substance and the organ 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.340
 associated to create a balance 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.049
 internal in some way you're 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.230
 sending the information so that the 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.840
 body understand and the brain understand 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.770
 what is he pretending then 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.920
 to do this 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:37.250
 The first thing we are going to use is a 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.740
 very simple test logically a 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.520
 movement as lateral no 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:46.020
 we would represent with two stripes and a 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.470
 movement 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.450
 the lateral turn 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.129
 with a cruise 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:57.130
 here we would have what would be an X and 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:00.940
 two parallel 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.450
 so that if we take a 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.020
 person and place it on the stretcher 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:10.620
 we start from a muscle 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.560
 indicator we simply check with a 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.740
 magnet 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.930
 if that muscle 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.440
 has the ability to contract or 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.440
 relax 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.530
 without having to fix any information 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.960
 because what we are now is 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.310
 asking the body in general not 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.400
 specifically 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:35.210
 then we take the two lines 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.790
 parallel in the consultant and look at 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.630
 two lines and we check the 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.630
 muscle indicator 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.650
 and now 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.650
 we would do the same with the X 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.390
 and good 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.840
 the two parallels must weaken 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:04.330
 here is not a question of whether you affirm and 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.110
 strong not weak or if you place a 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.930
 substance to change not about two lines 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.330
 parallel a movement or lateral bo 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.820
 that organizes the whole system 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.350
 his hetero lateral movement organizes 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.780
 then if we 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.730
 by putting the two parallel lines 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.400
 weakens the body of levitation 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:28.040
 muscle is correct and if the X 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.180
 It strengthens is right there is a good 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.000
 integration of cerebral hemispheres 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.970
 we can also do it from the following 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.479
 way if we do not have a card with the 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.910
 hand touches first let's do what I put 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:45.150
 lateral with the hand touches the knee of the 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:48.780
 same side and loose and then the knee and 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.729
 loose and then the knee and loose is 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.420
 making a movement as lateral 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:56.920
 robotic 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.920
 and we check the muscle 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:06.270
 here they do not have anything of force 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:09.830
 and now it's better to end up with likes for 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.830
 that the muscle stays well balanced 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.340
 maarten keep 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.409
 it is understood 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.909
 Well, there we are 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:27.909
 then he is fine 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.900
 we check the muscle 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:46.300
 the correct integrator muscle use 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.300
 the parallels 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:51.409
 and we use the X 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:02.219
 both 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:05.459
 you realize here the muscle as it is 

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:05.459
 and here 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.500
 returns
