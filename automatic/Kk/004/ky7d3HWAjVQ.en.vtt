00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
the bottom of the tin so that would

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.830 
the bottom of the tin so that would

and<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.500> did<00:01:13.650> use<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> vinyl<00:01:14.130> hose<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.939> direct

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479

and we did use a vinyl hose to direct
the<00:01:15.600> water<00:01:15.840> away<00:01:16.049> from<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.590> driveway<00:01:17.630> because

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the water away from the driveway because

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.270 
the water away from the driveway because
I<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.439> didn't<00:01:19.650> feel<00:01:19.740> like<00:01:19.799> crawling<00:01:20.130> around

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
I just didn't feel like crawling around

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.390 
I just didn't feel like crawling around
on<00:01:20.520> wet<00:01:20.729> concrete<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.590> carefully<00:01:22.890> get<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
on wet concrete so we carefully get the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.830 
on wet concrete so we carefully get the
wheels<00:01:23.610> off<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.060> wheels<00:01:24.299> are<00:01:24.540> still

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
extremely heavy even without the water

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.789 
extremely heavy even without the water
in<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.840> know<00:01:27.900> somebody's<00:01:28.470> probably

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
in it and I know somebody's probably

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:29.990

one<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.180> those<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.540> don't<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:36.780> access<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.140> one

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
one of those I don't have access to one

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.410 
one of those I don't have access to one
of<00:01:37.380> those<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.890> I'm<00:01:37.979> not<00:01:38.159> going<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.430> go<00:01:39.180> out<00:01:39.210> and

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
of those and I'm not going to go out and

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.390 
of those and I'm not going to go out and
buy<00:01:39.600> one<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.320> project<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.009> we<00:01:41.189> just

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
buy one just for this project so we just

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.730 
buy one just for this project so we just
dealt<00:01:41.579> with<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.229> dealt<00:01:43.439> with<00:01:43.619> it

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
dealt with it and we just dealt with it

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.620 
dealt with it and we just dealt with it
you'll<00:01:44.040> see<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.939> rear<00:01:45.240> end<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.420> going<00:01:45.540> to

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
you'll see the this rear end is going to

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.450 
you'll see the this rear end is going to
clean<00:01:45.810> up<00:01:45.960> real<00:01:46.110> nice<00:01:46.350> than<00:01:46.649> grease<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
clean up real nice than grease and the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.600 
clean up real nice than grease and the
grime<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.270> rear<00:01:48.540> right<00:01:48.780> drum<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.350> is

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
grime and that rear right drum this is

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.490 
grime and that rear right drum this is
not<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> surprise<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.390> knew<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.930> was<00:01:52.020> leaking<00:01:52.409> I

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
not a surprise I knew it was leaking I

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.050 
not a surprise I knew it was leaking I
knew<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.680> was<00:01:52.770> leaking<00:01:53.009> for<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.220> long<00:01:53.430> time<00:01:53.700> and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
knew it was leaking for a long time and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.270 
knew it was leaking for a long time and
right<00:01:54.930> now<00:01:55.110> we're<00:01:55.320> just<00:01:55.470> kind<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.829> checking

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
right now we're just kind of checking

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.760 
right now we're just kind of checking
out<00:01:56.659> everything<00:01:57.659> how<00:01:58.020> everything's<00:01:58.530> put

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
out everything how everything's put

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.350 
out everything how everything's put
together<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.369> suppose<00:01:59.759> I<00:01:59.909> could<00:02:00.149> have<00:02:00.180> done

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
together I suppose I could have done

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.270 
together I suppose I could have done
some<00:02:00.600> research<00:02:00.780> on<00:02:01.170> how<00:02:01.350> these<00:02:01.560> rear<00:02:01.829> ends<00:02:02.130> are

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
some research on how these rear ends are

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.039 
some research on how these rear ends are
put<00:02:02.490> together<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:03.000> how<00:02:03.090> they<00:02:03.210> come<00:02:03.360> apart<00:02:03.689> but

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
put together and how they come apart but

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.010 
put together and how they come apart but
I<00:02:04.530> kind<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.189> like<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.240> work<00:02:06.509> on<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.810> fly

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
I kind of like to just work on the fly

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.589 
I kind of like to just work on the fly
so<00:02:07.049> neither<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.890> us<00:02:08.039> have<00:02:08.250> done<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.459> 48<00:02:08.940> Ford<00:02:09.239> we

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
so neither of us have done a 48 Ford we

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.660 
so neither of us have done a 48 Ford we
both<00:02:09.929> got<00:02:10.679> some<00:02:10.830> pretty<00:02:11.039> good<00:02:11.129> experience

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
both got some pretty good experience

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.930 
both got some pretty good experience
work

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
work

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.980 
work
drum<00:02:12.360> brakes<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:14.720> mechanically<00:02:15.720> they're<00:02:15.870> all

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
drum brakes and mechanically they're all

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.530 
drum brakes and mechanically they're all
about<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.380> same<00:02:16.580> but<00:02:17.580> we<00:02:18.090> just<00:02:18.240> wanted<00:02:18.450> to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
about the same but we just wanted to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.090 
about the same but we just wanted to
make<00:02:18.660> sure<00:02:18.780> we<00:02:18.900> got<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.140> order<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.560> parts<00:02:19.890> and

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
make sure we got the order of parts and

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.460 
make sure we got the order of parts and
how<00:02:20.160> things<00:02:20.460> are<00:02:20.700> on<00:02:21.000> there<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:22.020> we<00:02:22.170> get<00:02:22.350> it

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
how things are on there so we get it

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.760 
how things are on there so we get it
together<00:02:22.830> properly<00:02:24.320> coming<00:02:25.320> apart<00:02:25.590> was

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
together properly coming apart was

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.600 
together properly coming apart was
pretty<00:02:26.010> straightforward

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
pretty straightforward

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.150 
pretty straightforward

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
as I got some of the grime wiped off the

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.220 
as I got some of the grime wiped off the
brake<00:02:58.590> shoes<00:02:59.270> there<00:03:00.270> was<00:03:00.450> stamping<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:01.020> there

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
brake shoes there was stamping in there

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.110 
brake shoes there was stamping in there
that<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.710> was<00:03:01.800> made<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.010> Taiwan<00:03:02.490> not<00:03:02.850> asbestos

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
that it was made in Taiwan not asbestos

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.990 
that it was made in Taiwan not asbestos
semi<00:03:03.960> metallic<00:03:04.440> shoes<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:05.340> that's<00:03:05.580> really<00:03:05.790> the

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
semi metallic shoes so that's really the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.490 
semi metallic shoes so that's really the
only<00:03:06.030> reason<00:03:06.450> why<00:03:06.570> I'm<00:03:06.660> even<00:03:06.720> handling<00:03:07.350> these

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
only reason why I'm even handling these

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.440 
only reason why I'm even handling these
shoes<00:03:07.790> but<00:03:08.790> they<00:03:08.940> were<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.180> old-school

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
shoes but they were the old-school

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.080 
shoes but they were the old-school
riveted<00:03:09.930> ones<00:03:10.110> that<00:03:10.320> had<00:03:10.470> asbestos<00:03:10.650> in<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:11.190> I

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
riveted ones that had asbestos in it I

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.060 
riveted ones that had asbestos in it I
would<00:03:12.660> have<00:03:12.780> been<00:03:13.050> wearing<00:03:13.380> rubber<00:03:13.560> gloves<00:03:13.680> I

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
would have been wearing rubber gloves I

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.260 
would have been wearing rubber gloves I
would<00:03:14.280> have<00:03:14.370> bagged<00:03:14.580> them<00:03:14.820> and<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.030> would<00:03:15.180> have

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
would have bagged them and I would have

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.640 
would have bagged them and I would have
deleted<00:03:15.600> them<00:03:15.920> but<00:03:16.920> as<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.760> said<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.930> was<00:03:19.470> made

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
deleted them but as I said this was made

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.650 
deleted them but as I said this was made
in<00:03:19.680> Taiwan<00:03:20.160> it<00:03:20.370> says<00:03:20.580> not<00:03:20.790> asbestos<00:03:20.970> right<00:03:21.510> on

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
in Taiwan it says not asbestos right on

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.160 
in Taiwan it says not asbestos right on
it<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.080> I<00:03:22.110> assume<00:03:22.650> at<00:03:22.860> some<00:03:23.040> point<00:03:23.310> in<00:03:23.400> time

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
it so I assume at some point in time

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.210 
it so I assume at some point in time
they<00:03:25.170> did<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.410> brakes<00:03:25.590> probably<00:03:25.950> within<00:03:26.100> the

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
they did the brakes probably within the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.520 
they did the brakes probably within the
last<00:03:26.310> fifteen<00:03:26.850> years<00:03:27.230> being<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.410> this

see

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
see

see
the<00:04:14.340> rear<00:04:14.490> left<00:04:14.700> wheel<00:04:14.910> did<00:04:15.240> not<00:04:15.450> have<00:04:15.720> any

indication of leaking seal leaking and
you'll<00:04:19.860> see<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.190> difference<00:04:20.580> in<00:04:20.760> how<00:04:20.880> clean

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
you'll see the difference in how clean

very nicely centered the balance is very
centered<00:04:33.780> even<00:04:34.110> though<00:04:34.230> it's<00:04:34.350> extremely

the<00:04:38.250> thing<00:04:38.460> would<00:04:38.640> probably<00:04:39.060> if<00:04:39.510> it<00:04:39.660> was<00:04:39.750> on

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
the thing would probably if it was on

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.910 
the thing would probably if it was on
level<00:04:40.170> ground<00:04:40.200> it<00:04:40.500> would<00:04:40.590> probably<00:04:40.740> just

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
level ground it would probably just

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.070 
level ground it would probably just
stand<00:04:41.250> up<00:04:41.400> on<00:04:41.550> its<00:04:41.730> own<00:04:41.880> and<00:04:42.570> of<00:04:42.720> course<00:04:42.960> the

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
stand up on its own and of course the

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.330 
stand up on its own and of course the
last<00:04:43.260> thing<00:04:43.410> we<00:04:43.530> wanted<00:04:43.770> to<00:04:43.920> do<00:04:44.010> is<00:04:44.160> lay<00:04:44.310> it

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
last thing we wanted to do is lay it

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.820 
last thing we wanted to do is lay it
flat<00:04:44.610> on<00:04:44.730> the<00:04:45.060> surface<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.810> then<00:04:45.990> have<00:04:46.200> to<00:04:46.410> get

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
flat on the surface and then have to get

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.620 
flat on the surface and then have to get
it<00:04:46.920> back<00:04:47.040> into<00:04:47.310> an<00:04:47.490> upright<00:04:47.790> so<00:04:48.090> we<00:04:48.480> just

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
it back into an upright so we just

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.990 
it back into an upright so we just
leaned<00:04:48.810> it<00:04:48.930> against<00:04:49.140> the<00:04:49.230> tractor<00:04:49.620> there<00:04:49.740> and

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
leaned it against the tractor there and

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.240 
leaned it against the tractor there and
ultimately<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:51.780> used<00:04:52.230> in<00:04:52.380> cargo<00:04:52.710> strap<00:04:52.980> to<00:04:53.130> hold

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
ultimately I used in cargo strap to hold

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.400 
ultimately I used in cargo strap to hold
it<00:04:53.400> to<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.550> tracker<00:04:53.760> so<00:04:54.060> it<00:04:54.210> wouldn't<00:04:54.510> roll

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
it to the tracker so it wouldn't roll

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.740 
it to the tracker so it wouldn't roll
out<00:04:55.620> into<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:55.890> street<00:04:56.310> you'll<00:04:57.150> see<00:04:57.390> this<00:04:57.510> rear

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
out into the street you'll see this rear

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.990 
out into the street you'll see this rear
left<00:04:57.930> drum<00:04:58.170> it's<00:04:58.350> a<00:04:58.440> broken<00:04:58.800> stud<00:04:59.100> and<00:04:59.460> today's
