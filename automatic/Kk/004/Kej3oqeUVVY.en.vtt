you how to actually add forms so that
you<00:00:11.099> can<00:00:11.280> open<00:00:11.580> another<00:00:11.610> form<00:00:12.120> from<00:00:12.450> within<00:00:12.780> a

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
you can open another form from within a

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.670 
you can open another form from within a
program<00:00:13.400> so<00:00:14.400> we're<00:00:14.490> going<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.700> start<00:00:14.730> with<00:00:15.059> our

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
program so we're going to start with our

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.720 
program so we're going to start with our
simple<00:00:16.680> text<00:00:16.949> writer<00:00:17.160> from<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.490> last

software<00:00:18.150> SP<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:19.410> actually<00:00:19.710> start<00:00:19.949> many

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
software SP you actually start many

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.160 
software SP you actually start many

14<00:00:22.560> min<00:00:22.769> we're<00:00:23.460> going<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.609> right<00:00:23.760> click<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
14 min we're going to right click on the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.089 
14 min we're going to right click on the
test<00:00:24.449> project<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.170> add<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.619> new<00:00:26.369> windows<00:00:27.090> form

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.279 
test project to add and new windows form
it's<00:00:29.099> quite<00:00:29.279> simple<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.699> do<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.359> add<00:00:30.900> new

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
it's quite simple to do just add new

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.910 
it's quite simple to do just add new
form<00:00:32.960> it's<00:00:33.960> not<00:00:34.079> going<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.260> ask<00:00:34.410> us<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.739> name

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
form it's not going to ask us for a name

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.520 
form it's not going to ask us for a name
now<00:00:35.160> for<00:00:35.760> naming<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.300> always<00:00:36.600> use<00:00:36.780> frm<00:00:37.320> at<00:00:37.469> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
now for naming I always use frm at the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.440 
now for naming I always use frm at the
start<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.950> my<00:00:38.040> forms<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.579> i<00:00:38.640> can<00:00:38.820> identify<00:00:38.940> them

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
start of my forms so i can identify them

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.360 
start of my forms so i can identify them
quite<00:00:39.660> easily<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:40.079> code<00:00:40.410> now<00:00:41.100> i'm<00:00:41.190> going<00:00:41.309> to

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
quite easily in code now i'm going to

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.260 
quite easily in code now i'm going to
call<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.700> one<00:00:41.760> form<00:00:44.450> items<00:00:46.910> now<00:00:47.910> take<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
call this one form items now take the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.439 
call this one form items now take the
reason<00:00:48.570> for<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:49.940> and<00:00:50.940> they'll<00:00:51.149> give<00:00:51.329> me<00:00:51.420> a

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
reason for that and they'll give me a

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.189 
reason for that and they'll give me a
chance<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.989> show<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.230> other<00:00:53.160> bits<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.460> pieces

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
chance to show you other bits and pieces

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.569 
chance to show you other bits and pieces
first<00:00:55.199> thing<00:00:55.410> we'll<00:00:55.559> do<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.710> change<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.039> text

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
first thing we'll do is change the text

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.869 
first thing we'll do is change the text
so<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.449> says<00:00:57.660> items<00:00:58.379> rather<00:00:59.039> than<00:00:59.250> frm

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
so that it says items rather than frm

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.610 
so that it says items rather than frm
items<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.480> always<00:01:00.660> gives<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> name<00:01:01.260> that

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
items it always gives it the name that

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.740 
items it always gives it the name that
you've<00:01:01.770> given<00:01:01.890> them<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.550> move<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.600> center

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
you've given them and move to the center

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.429 
you've given them and move to the center
screen<00:01:05.420> i'm<00:01:06.420> now<00:01:06.600> going<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.810> add<00:01:06.869> something

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
screen i'm now going to add something

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.969 
screen i'm now going to add something
called<00:01:07.710> radio<00:01:08.070> buttons<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:09.270> our<00:01:09.390> list<00:01:09.979> when

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
called radio buttons to our list when

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.260 
called radio buttons to our list when
their<00:01:11.130> buttons<00:01:11.460> are<00:01:11.580> quite<00:01:11.729> interesting

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
their buttons are quite interesting

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.660 
their buttons are quite interesting
because<00:01:12.470> only<00:01:13.470> one<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.770> them<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.010> be<00:01:14.220> selected

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
because only one of them can be selected

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.870 
because only one of them can be selected
to<00:01:14.700> any<00:01:14.909> one<00:01:15.090> time<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:17.400> way<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.729> it

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
to any one time and the way that it

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.560 
to any one time and the way that it
works<00:01:18.650> if<00:01:19.650> i<00:01:19.860> had<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.640> many<00:01:20.790> radio<00:01:21.119> buttons<00:01:21.450> at

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
works if i had as many radio buttons at

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.870 
works if i had as many radio buttons at
once<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.810> on<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.960> form<00:01:22.259> i<00:01:22.560> can<00:01:23.369> only<00:01:23.430> select<00:01:23.640> one

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
once it on a form i can only select one

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.179 
once it on a form i can only select one
of<00:01:24.150> them<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:25.350> i<00:01:25.470> create<00:01:25.740> something<00:01:25.950> called<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
of them if i create something called a

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.819 
of them if i create something called a
panel<00:01:26.960> which<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.470> our<00:01:28.619> little

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
panel which is if you like our little

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.520 
panel which is if you like our little
container<00:01:29.400> i<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:30.659> actually<00:01:30.869> put<00:01:31.020> another<00:01:31.259> set

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
container i can actually put another set

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.560 
container i can actually put another set
of<00:01:31.680> radio<00:01:31.979> buttons<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.729> container<00:01:33.119> and

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
of radio buttons in that container and

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.010 
of radio buttons in that container and
those<00:01:34.409> will<00:01:34.619> have<00:01:34.740> their<00:01:34.950> own<00:01:35.420> choice<00:01:36.420> if<00:01:36.750> you

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
those will have their own choice if you

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.260 
those will have their own choice if you
like<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.619> i'll<00:01:37.950> now<00:01:38.340> be<00:01:38.400> able<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.670> select<00:01:38.880> one

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
like so i'll now be able to select one

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.840 
like so i'll now be able to select one
out<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.630> four<00:01:39.840> five<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.110> six<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.890> one<00:01:41.400> out<00:01:41.640> of

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
out of four five and six and one out of

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.410 
out of four five and six and one out of
one<00:01:42.180> two<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.479> three<00:01:43.670> this<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.790> how<00:01:44.939> allows<00:01:45.180> you

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
one two and three this is how allows you

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.590 
one two and three this is how allows you
to<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:46.079> more<00:01:46.320> than<00:01:46.439> one<00:01:46.649> option<00:01:47.600> selected

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
then I cannot do anything on this form

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.789 
then I cannot do anything on this form
until<00:04:16.760> this<00:04:16.880> form<00:04:17.120> is<00:04:17.239> closed<00:04:17.540> it<00:04:18.440> might<00:04:18.620> be

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
until this form is closed it might be

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.770 
until this form is closed it might be
you<00:04:18.919> want<00:04:19.130> both<00:04:19.400> forms<00:04:19.760> to<00:04:19.850> be<00:04:19.880> accessible<00:04:20.239> at

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
you want both forms to be accessible at

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.380 
you want both forms to be accessible at
the<00:04:20.900> same<00:04:21.080> time<00:04:21.730> in<00:04:22.730> which<00:04:22.880> case<00:04:23.090> we'll<00:04:23.240> go

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
the same time in which case we'll go

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.900 
the same time in which case we'll go
back<00:04:23.540> to<00:04:23.600> our<00:04:23.840> items<00:04:24.380> show

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.140 

now<00:04:29.910> I<00:04:30.210> open<00:04:31.020> this<00:04:31.139> one<00:04:31.380> I<00:04:31.680> can<00:04:32.250> still<00:04:32.520> use<00:04:33.000> this

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
now I open this one I can still use this

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.420 
now I open this one I can still use this
form<00:04:33.479> just<00:04:33.720> as<00:04:33.840> if<00:04:33.990> I've<00:04:34.620> got<00:04:34.770> two<00:04:34.979> programs

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
form just as if I've got two programs

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.129 
form just as if I've got two programs
open<00:04:35.639> as<00:04:36.240> my<00:04:37.220> open<00:04:38.220> file<00:04:38.849> format<00:04:39.330> so<00:04:39.930> i<00:04:39.960> can

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
open as my open file format so i can

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.570 
open as my open file format so i can
still<00:04:40.349> use<00:04:40.470> that<00:04:40.500> one<00:04:40.740> at<00:04:40.949> the<00:04:41.069> same<00:04:41.220> time<00:04:41.400> as

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
still use that one at the same time as

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.180 
still use that one at the same time as
this<00:04:41.699> one<00:04:42.349> it<00:04:43.349> depends<00:04:43.650> what<00:04:43.770> you<00:04:43.830> need<00:04:43.979> to<00:04:44.099> use

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
this one it depends what you need to use

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.790 
this one it depends what you need to use
the<00:04:44.220> forms<00:04:44.610> for<00:04:45.410> lettuce<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:46.470> program

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
the forms for lettuce the program

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.710 
the forms for lettuce the program
doesn't<00:04:46.979> close<00:04:47.220> down<00:04:47.460> until<00:04:47.789> I<00:04:47.880> closed<00:04:48.180> for

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
doesn't close down until I closed for

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.870 
doesn't close down until I closed for
one<00:04:48.960> CS<00:04:49.650> that's<00:04:50.099> because<00:04:50.430> this<00:04:50.580> is<00:04:50.729> the<00:04:50.849> first

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
one CS that's because this is the first

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.820 
one CS that's because this is the first
program<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.750> first<00:04:51.990> form<00:04:52.199> this<00:04:52.289> is<00:04:52.440> open<00:04:52.710> by

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
program the first form this is open by

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.610 
program the first form this is open by
the<00:04:52.889> program<00:04:53.870> now<00:04:54.870> what<00:04:55.020> would<00:04:55.110> happen<00:04:55.410> if<00:04:55.500> I

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
the program now what would happen if I

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.159 
the program now what would happen if I
wanted<00:04:56.000> frm<00:04:57.000> items<00:04:57.509> to<00:04:57.780> load<00:04:57.930> up<00:04:58.110> first<00:05:00.169> let's

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
wanted frm items to load up first let's

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.890 
wanted frm items to load up first let's
put<00:05:01.320> a<00:05:01.349> new<00:05:01.500> button<00:05:01.710> on<00:05:01.889> here<00:05:05.479> then<00:05:06.479> call<00:05:06.750> it

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
put a new button on here then call it

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.749 
put a new button on here then call it
text<00:05:08.960> this<00:05:09.960> time<00:05:10.289> this<00:05:10.800> button<00:05:11.039> is<00:05:11.400> going<00:05:11.699> to

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 
text this time this button is going to

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:18.690 
text this time this button is going to
open<00:05:11.880> up<00:05:12.120> for<00:05:12.570> one

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.510 

again<00:05:19.450> a<00:05:19.480> creative<00:05:19.960> memory<00:05:20.350> well<00:05:21.220> I'll<00:05:21.340> show

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
again a creative memory well I'll show

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.200 
again a creative memory well I'll show
it<00:05:21.700> now<00:05:23.340> first<00:05:24.340> thing<00:05:24.520> to<00:05:24.640> notice<00:05:24.790> is<00:05:24.880> this<00:05:25.060> is

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
it now first thing to notice is this is

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.420 
it now first thing to notice is this is
a<00:05:25.240> totally<00:05:25.720> different<00:05:26.110> form<00:05:26.440> one<00:05:26.710> to<00:05:27.220> this<00:05:27.370> one

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
a totally different form one to this one

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.130 
a totally different form one to this one
that's<00:05:27.730> currently<00:05:27.910> running<00:05:28.240> on<00:05:28.360> the<00:05:28.510> screen<00:05:28.810> I

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
that's currently running on the screen I

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.650 
that's currently running on the screen I
can<00:05:29.650> open<00:05:30.070> that<00:05:30.100> and<00:05:30.580> I<00:05:30.730> code<00:05:30.970> open<00:05:31.360> yes

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
can open that and I code open yes

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.990 
can open that and I code open yes
another<00:05:31.900> one<00:05:32.110> I<00:05:32.320> can<00:05:32.650> open<00:05:32.740> another<00:05:32.890> items<00:05:33.430> as

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
another one I can open another items as

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.350 
another one I can open another items as
you<00:05:34.210> can<00:05:34.330> see<00:05:34.570> i<00:05:34.810> can<00:05:35.410> open<00:05:35.530> number<00:05:35.890> one<00:05:36.360> it

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
you can see i can open number one it

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.360 
you can see i can open number one it
doesn't<00:05:37.630> automatically<00:05:38.290> reuse<00:05:38.890> the<00:05:39.070> item

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
doesn't automatically reuse the item

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.460 
doesn't automatically reuse the item
that<00:05:39.400> you<00:05:39.610> want<00:05:39.640> that<00:05:40.030> you<00:05:40.210> first<00:05:40.720> opened<00:05:41.230> each

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
that you want that you first opened each

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.160 
that you want that you first opened each
one<00:05:41.710> of<00:05:41.740> these<00:05:41.890> is<00:05:41.950> a<00:05:42.370> separate<00:05:43.000> new<00:05:43.330> object

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
one of these is a separate new object

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.950 
one of these is a separate new object
and<00:05:44.440> it's<00:05:45.220> completely<00:05:45.630> independent<00:05:46.630> from<00:05:46.750> the

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
and it's completely independent from the

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.070 
and it's completely independent from the
first<00:05:47.230> one<00:05:47.470> so<00:05:48.430> I<00:05:48.460> can<00:05:48.820> make<00:05:48.970> something<00:05:49.780> into

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
first one so I can make something into

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.630 
first one so I can make something into
that<00:05:50.230> one<00:05:50.440> and<00:05:50.980> though<00:05:51.100> something<00:05:51.280> different

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
that one and though something different

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.150 
that one and though something different
into<00:05:51.730> this<00:05:51.910> one<00:05:52.150> for<00:05:52.510> example<00:05:55.800> but<00:05:56.800> that

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
into this one for example but that

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160 
into this one for example but that
program<00:05:57.640> that<00:05:58.090> first<00:05:58.390> form<00:05:58.630> one<00:05:58.810> is<00:05:58.930> always

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.170 
program that first form one is always

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.100 
program that first form one is always
the<00:05:59.290> one<00:05:59.440> that<00:05:59.470> closes<00:05:59.980> the<00:06:00.130> program<00:06:00.750> if<00:06:01.750> I<00:06:01.840> say

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
the one that closes the program if I say

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.810 
the one that closes the program if I say
wanted<00:06:02.440> to<00:06:02.560> open<00:06:02.680> the<00:06:02.980> form<00:06:03.190> items<00:06:03.580> first

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
wanted to open the form items first

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.560 
wanted to open the form items first
instead<00:06:04.210> of<00:06:04.270> 41<00:06:05.170> I<00:06:05.410> go<00:06:05.800> into<00:06:06.060> program<00:06:07.060> dot<00:06:07.270> C<00:06:07.300> s

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
instead of 41 I go into program dot C s

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.990 
instead of 41 I go into program dot C s
and<00:06:07.990> here<00:06:08.770> is<00:06:08.860> where<00:06:09.010> it<00:06:09.130> tells<00:06:09.310> me<00:06:09.550> what<00:06:09.880> is

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
and here is where it tells me what is

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.280 
and here is where it tells me what is
actually<00:06:10.150> the<00:06:10.390> first<00:06:10.420> thing<00:06:10.840> that<00:06:10.870> is<00:06:11.080> run

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
actually the first thing that is run

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.950 
actually the first thing that is run
application<00:06:12.040> run<00:06:12.400> if<00:06:13.090> I<00:06:13.270> change<00:06:13.510> it<00:06:13.630> to<00:06:13.720> a<00:06:13.780> new

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
application run if I change it to a new

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.490 
application run if I change it to a new
form<00:06:14.290> items<00:06:14.680> instead<00:06:15.160> now<00:06:16.060> form<00:06:16.960> items<00:06:17.320> way

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
form items instead now form items way

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.700 
form items instead now form items way
opens<00:06:17.800> first<00:06:18.120> so<00:06:19.120> I<00:06:19.150> can<00:06:19.240> change<00:06:19.630> what<00:06:20.380> four

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
opens first so I can change what four

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
opens first so I can change what four
months<00:06:20.740> you<00:06:21.130> want<00:06:21.310> to<00:06:21.430> load<00:06:21.580> up<00:06:21.700> first<00:06:23.610> and<00:06:24.610> now

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:24.730 
months you want to load up first and now

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.790 
months you want to load up first and now
it's<00:06:24.910> this<00:06:25.060> one<00:06:25.270> that<00:06:25.450> if<00:06:25.630> I<00:06:25.810> close<00:06:26.050> closes

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
it's this one that if I close closes

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.000 
it's this one that if I close closes

forms and I go several forms deep so

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.010 
forms and I go several forms deep so
I've<00:08:04.150> got<00:08:04.330> all<00:08:04.539> these<00:08:04.780> forms<00:08:05.259> open<00:08:07.020> doesn't

I've got all these forms open doesn't
matter<00:08:08.110> which<00:08:08.349> one<00:08:08.530> I<00:08:08.620> use<00:08:08.889> to<00:08:09.190> close<00:08:09.669> that<00:08:09.940> was

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:10.060 
matter which one I use to close that was
