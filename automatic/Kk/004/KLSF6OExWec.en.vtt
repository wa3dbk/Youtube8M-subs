the<00:01:57.840> same<00:01:58.049> recipe<00:01:58.350> but<00:01:59.070> putting<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.430> into<00:01:59.729> a

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
the same recipe but putting it into a

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.609 
the same recipe but putting it into a
different<00:02:00.570> setting<00:02:00.899> but<00:02:01.200> really<00:02:01.469> all<00:02:01.590> of

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
different setting but really all of

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.590 
different setting but really all of
these<00:02:01.890> differences<00:02:02.850> are<00:02:02.909> just<00:02:03.060> kind<00:02:03.479> of

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
these differences are just kind of

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.660 
these differences are just kind of
window<00:02:03.899> dressing<00:02:04.409> because<00:02:04.860> Bronson<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
window dressing because Bronson is the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.700 
window dressing because Bronson is the
same<00:02:05.939> guy<00:02:06.180> on<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.630> album<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.170> he<00:02:07.290> was<00:02:07.530> on

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
same guy on this album that he was on

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.529

just<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.400> new<00:02:13.580> installment<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.240> bars<00:02:14.600> on<00:02:15.020> a<00:02:15.080> new

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
just a new installment of bars on a new

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.280 
just a new installment of bars on a new
assortment<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.850> beats<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.660> go<00:02:17.960> to<00:02:18.020> the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
assortment of beats to go to the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.200 
assortment of beats to go to the
instrumentals<00:02:18.860> like<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.160> said<00:02:19.490> some<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.060> the

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
instrumentals like I said some of the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.420 
instrumentals like I said some of the
samples<00:02:20.600> here<00:02:20.870> kind<00:02:21.380> of<00:02:21.470> surprising<00:02:22.070> a<00:02:22.160> lot<00:02:22.190> of

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
samples here kind of surprising a lot of

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.600 
samples here kind of surprising a lot of
synth<00:02:22.880> pop<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.480> new<00:02:23.930> wave<00:02:24.170> and<00:02:24.500> funk<00:02:25.100> music<00:02:25.280> on

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
synth pop and new wave and funk music on

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.220 
synth pop and new wave and funk music on
here<00:02:25.850> that<00:02:25.880> feels<00:02:26.210> like<00:02:26.390> it's<00:02:26.540> from<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.720> 80s

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
here that feels like it's from the 80s

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.900 
here that feels like it's from the 80s
and<00:02:27.530> then<00:02:27.950> again<00:02:28.160> there<00:02:28.280> are<00:02:28.430> some<00:02:28.640> tracks

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
and then again there are some tracks

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.760 
and then again there are some tracks
that<00:02:29.180> do<00:02:29.330> feature<00:02:29.600> some<00:02:29.900> soul<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.410> Motown

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
that do feature some soul and Motown

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.800 
that do feature some soul and Motown
sampling<00:02:31.370> just<00:02:31.400> like<00:02:31.820> on<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.210> original<00:02:32.660> blue

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
sampling just like on the original blue

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.140 
sampling just like on the original blue
chips<00:02:33.110> project<00:02:33.710> but<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.220> lot<00:02:34.490> of<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.700> time<00:02:34.970> it

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
chips project but a lot of the time it

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.700 
chips project but a lot of the time it
sounds<00:02:35.420> like<00:02:35.540> party<00:02:35.840> supplies<00:02:36.200> is<00:02:36.410> merely

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
sounds like party supplies is merely

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.400 
sounds like party supplies is merely
grabbing<00:02:37.340> some<00:02:37.580> loops<00:02:37.880> that<00:02:38.570> are<00:02:39.110> pretty

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
grabbing some loops that are pretty

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.070 
grabbing some loops that are pretty
great<00:02:39.830> but<00:02:40.340> he<00:02:40.520> doesn't<00:02:40.850> really<00:02:41.240> reinvent

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
great but he doesn't really reinvent

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.640 
great but he doesn't really reinvent
them<00:02:42.350> or<00:02:42.710> rehash<00:02:43.280> them<00:02:43.670> or<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:44.600> guess<00:02:44.840> alter

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
them or rehash them or I guess alter

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.130 
them or rehash them or I guess alter
them<00:02:45.860> in<00:02:46.100> a<00:02:46.490> significant<00:02:47.060> way<00:02:47.090> really<00:02:47.870> just

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
them in a significant way really just

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.620 
them in a significant way really just
kind<00:02:48.320> of<00:02:48.410> clipping<00:02:49.040> them<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.370> then<00:02:49.520> ooh<00:02:49.760> boo

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
kind of clipping them and then ooh boo

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.290 
kind of clipping them and then ooh boo
boo<00:02:51.260> boo<00:02:51.890> going<00:02:52.400> through<00:02:52.550> that<00:02:52.640> cycle<00:02:52.910> and

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
boo boo going through that cycle and

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.700 
boo boo going through that cycle and
going<00:02:53.840> that<00:02:53.960> route<00:02:54.170> is<00:02:54.350> a<00:02:54.380> bit<00:02:54.560> of<00:02:54.650> a

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
going that route is a bit of a

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.140 
going that route is a bit of a
double-edged<00:02:55.070> sword<00:02:55.100> or<00:02:55.670> maybe<00:02:55.820> even<00:02:55.910> a

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
double-edged sword or maybe even a

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.090 
double-edged sword or maybe even a
triple<00:02:56.420> edged<00:02:56.690> sword<00:02:57.050> for<00:02:57.680> one<00:02:57.890> the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
triple edged sword for one the

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.890 
triple edged sword for one the
production<00:02:58.610> can<00:02:58.790> get<00:02:59.060> kind<00:02:59.300> of<00:02:59.390> redundant

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
production can get kind of redundant

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.290 
production can get kind of redundant
with<00:03:00.020> just<00:03:00.320> hearing<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.710> same<00:03:00.920> groove<00:03:01.490> over

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
with just hearing the same groove over

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.880 
with just hearing the same groove over
and<00:03:02.510> over<00:03:02.810> throughout<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.260> entirety<00:03:03.740> of<00:03:03.770> a

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
and over throughout the entirety of a

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.130 
and over throughout the entirety of a
track<00:03:04.190> but<00:03:04.580> on<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.820> positive<00:03:05.390> side<00:03:05.600> because<00:03:05.960> the

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
track but on a positive side because the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.260 
track but on a positive side because the
sample<00:03:06.650> source<00:03:06.920> material<00:03:07.460> is<00:03:07.550> so<00:03:07.700> obvious

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
sample source material is so obvious

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.930 
sample source material is so obvious
with<00:03:08.840> how<00:03:08.960> party<00:03:09.290> supplies<00:03:09.620> treats<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:10.430> can

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
with how party supplies treats it it can

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.580 
with how party supplies treats it it can
kind<00:03:11.240> of<00:03:11.300> grab<00:03:11.570> your<00:03:11.780> ears<00:03:12.050> and<00:03:12.230> just<00:03:12.260> make<00:03:12.470> you

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
attention away from what the sample is

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.170 
attention away from what the sample is
and<00:03:30.530> toward<00:03:30.860> what<00:03:31.070> you're<00:03:31.190> saying<00:03:31.490> and<00:03:31.790> this

and toward what you're saying and this
is<00:03:32.240> a<00:03:32.600> challenge<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:33.320> action<00:03:33.830> is<00:03:33.950> up<00:03:34.130> to<00:03:34.310> most

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
is a challenge that action is up to most

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.460 
is a challenge that action is up to most
of<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:34.820> time<00:03:35.060> like<00:03:35.360> on<00:03:35.600> the<00:03:35.720> track<00:03:35.990> Amadou

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
not technical but it's funny and even

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.580 
not technical but it's funny and even
though<00:04:01.820> there's<00:04:02.000> not<00:04:02.120> a<00:04:02.180> strong<00:04:02.450> song<00:04:02.960> concept
