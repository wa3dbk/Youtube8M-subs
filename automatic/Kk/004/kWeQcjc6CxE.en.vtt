thing<00:02:03.000> about<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.570> digital<00:02:04.170> editing<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.680> that

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
thing about this digital editing is that

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.410 
thing about this digital editing is that
if<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.399> have<00:02:05.520> students<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.000> finish<00:02:06.270> this

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
if you have students that finish this

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.809 
if you have students that finish this
right<00:02:06.600> away<00:02:06.750> they<00:02:07.170> can<00:02:07.350> go<00:02:07.469> back<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.860> zoom<00:02:08.610> in

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
right away they can go back and zoom in

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.690 
right away they can go back and zoom in
and<00:02:09.119> fill<00:02:09.569> in<00:02:09.690> some<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.020> smaller<00:02:10.229> areas

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
and fill in some of the smaller areas

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.120 
and fill in some of the smaller areas
but<00:02:11.700> students<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.270> are<00:02:12.420> take

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
but students that are take

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.310 
but students that are take
a<00:02:13.160> little<00:02:13.430> bit<00:02:13.550> longer<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:14.870> know<00:02:14.990> they<00:02:15.200> don't

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
a little bit longer you know they don't

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.280 
a little bit longer you know they don't
have<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.650> fill<00:02:15.830> in<00:02:15.950> every<00:02:16.190> tiny<00:02:16.400> little<00:02:16.550> detail

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
have to fill in every tiny little detail

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.980 
have to fill in every tiny little detail
when<00:02:18.290> I'm<00:02:18.410> ready<00:02:18.620> just<00:02:18.710> fill<00:02:19.520> in<00:02:19.790> my<00:02:20.060> mid-tones

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
when I'm ready just fill in my mid-tones

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.450 
when I'm ready just fill in my mid-tones
I<00:02:21.110> choose<00:02:21.800> color<00:02:22.100> picker<00:02:22.340> one<00:02:22.580> more<00:02:22.760> time<00:02:24.460> and

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
I choose color picker one more time and

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.780 
I choose color picker one more time and
I<00:02:25.850> choose<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.180> new<00:02:26.450> color<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:28.190> want<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.640> make

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
I choose a new color and I want to make

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.850 
I choose a new color and I want to make
sure<00:02:28.820> that<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.690> is<00:02:29.960> a<00:02:30.230> little<00:02:30.970> darker<00:02:32.620> than<00:02:33.620> the

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
sure that it is a little darker than the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.950 
sure that it is a little darker than the
color<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:34.190> started<00:02:34.700> with<00:02:34.880> so<00:02:35.330> in<00:02:35.450> this<00:02:35.540> case<00:02:35.780> I'm

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
color I started with so in this case I'm

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.110 
color I started with so in this case I'm
going<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.140> compare<00:02:36.500> here's<00:02:37.220> my<00:02:37.460> highlight<00:02:37.910> and

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
going to compare here's my highlight and

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.220 
going to compare here's my highlight and
my<00:02:38.780> mid-tone<00:02:39.170> should<00:02:39.470> be<00:02:40.720> obviously<00:02:41.720> darker

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
my mid-tone should be obviously darker

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.700 
my mid-tone should be obviously darker
than<00:02:42.470> my<00:02:42.680> highlight<00:02:43.460> and<00:02:43.960> then<00:02:44.960> in<00:02:45.170> this<00:02:45.500> case

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
than my highlight and then in this case

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.990 
than my highlight and then in this case
I<00:02:45.890> would<00:02:46.040> fill<00:02:46.220> all<00:02:46.490> of<00:02:46.520> the<00:02:46.760> gray<00:02:46.940> areas<00:02:49.000> all

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
I would fill all of the gray areas all

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.690 
I would fill all of the gray areas all
of<00:02:50.270> my<00:02:50.450> mid-tones<00:02:51.130> get<00:02:52.130> filled<00:02:52.370> with<00:02:52.460> this

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
of my mid-tones get filled with this

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:01.900 
of my mid-tones get filled with this
color

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.040 

the<00:03:02.510> next<00:03:02.960> stage<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.770> would<00:03:04.460> choose<00:03:05.350> my<00:03:06.350> shadow

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
the next stage I would choose my shadow

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.680 
the next stage I would choose my shadow
and<00:03:09.580> again<00:03:10.580> you<00:03:10.790> want<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:11.030> make<00:03:11.210> sure<00:03:11.240> that<00:03:11.600> it

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
and again you want to make sure that it

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.360 
and again you want to make sure that it
is<00:03:11.750> dramatically<00:03:12.590> darker<00:03:13.070> than<00:03:13.220> your

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
is dramatically darker than your

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.990 
is dramatically darker than your
mid-tone<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:16.010> would<00:03:16.160> fill<00:03:16.340> in<00:03:16.490> those<00:03:16.640> last

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
mid-tone and I would fill in those last

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.160 
mid-tone and I would fill in those last
black<00:03:17.540> areas<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:19.400> my<00:03:20.180> photograph<00:03:20.720> with<00:03:20.990> this

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
black areas of my photograph with this

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.800 
black areas of my photograph with this
shadow<00:03:21.650> color<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:22.310> you<00:03:23.000> can<00:03:23.150> see<00:03:23.420> it's<00:03:23.720> very

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
shadow color and you can see it's very

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.480 
shadow color and you can see it's very
simple<00:03:26.350> paint<00:03:27.350> bucket<00:03:27.590> tool<00:03:27.620> so<00:03:27.980> simple<00:03:28.340> once

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
simple paint bucket tool so simple once

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.070 
simple paint bucket tool so simple once
you've<00:03:28.640> posterized<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.270> image<00:03:29.570> it's<00:03:29.780> filling

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
you've posterized the image it's filling

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.740 
you've posterized the image it's filling
in<00:03:30.170> large<00:03:30.380> areas<00:03:30.620> at<00:03:30.860> a<00:03:30.890> time<00:03:31.600> and<00:03:32.600> your

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
in large areas at a time and your

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.840 
in large areas at a time and your
students<00:03:33.110> can<00:03:33.260> really<00:03:33.440> see<00:03:33.830> when<00:03:34.670> they've

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
students can really see when they've

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.160 
students can really see when they've
used<00:03:35.210> a<00:03:35.390> high<00:03:35.540> light<00:03:35.810> mid-tone<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:37.120> shadow

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
used a high light mid-tone and shadow

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.160 
used a high light mid-tone and shadow
their<00:03:39.170> portrait<00:03:39.620> so<00:03:39.830> looks<00:03:40.040> like<00:03:40.190> them<00:03:40.370> but

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
their portrait so looks like them but

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.080 
their portrait so looks like them but
it's<00:03:42.170> definitely<00:03:42.500> in<00:03:42.800> a<00:03:42.860> pop<00:03:43.070> style<00:03:43.430> so<00:03:43.910> this

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
it's definitely in a pop style so this

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.730 
it's definitely in a pop style so this
is<00:03:44.210> about<00:03:44.450> what<00:03:44.510> I<00:03:44.660> would<00:03:44.840> expect<00:03:44.960> my<00:03:45.350> students

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
is about what I would expect my students

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.590 
is about what I would expect my students
to<00:03:45.830> have<00:03:46.010> completed<00:03:46.520> in<00:03:46.670> the<00:03:46.850> second<00:03:47.420> class

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
to have completed in the second class

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.770 
to have completed in the second class
period<00:03:48.020> some<00:03:48.530> students<00:03:48.920> will<00:03:49.480> will<00:03:50.480> be<00:03:50.600> able

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
period some students will will be able

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.600 
period some students will will be able
to<00:03:50.870> complete<00:03:51.170> this<00:03:51.320> first<00:03:51.680> portrait<00:03:52.400> and

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
to complete this first portrait and

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.850 
to complete this first portrait and
that's<00:03:52.760> it<00:03:53.090> if<00:03:53.300> you<00:03:53.930> want<00:03:54.260> you<00:03:54.350> can<00:03:54.470> take<00:03:54.680> time

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
that's it if you want you can take time

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.320 
that's it if you want you can take time
to<00:03:55.010> do<00:03:55.130> a<00:03:55.160> series<00:03:55.550> with<00:03:55.730> them<00:03:55.880> and<00:03:56.060> offer<00:03:56.300> them

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
to do a series with them and offer them

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.420 
to do a series with them and offer them
another<00:03:56.600> class<00:03:56.900> period<00:03:57.290> but<00:03:57.740> I<00:03:57.770> have<00:03:58.010> also<00:03:58.160> had

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
another class period but I have also had

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.190 
another class period but I have also had
sixth<00:03:58.910> graders<00:03:59.180> who<00:03:59.390> were<00:03:59.540> able<00:03:59.690> to<00:03:59.840> complete

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
sixth graders who were able to complete

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.970 
sixth graders who were able to complete
three<00:04:01.030> different<00:04:02.260> portraits<00:04:03.260> three

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
three different portraits three

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.760 
three different portraits three
different<00:04:04.400> color<00:04:04.640> families<00:04:05.480> all<00:04:06.260> in<00:04:06.650> one

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
different color families all in one

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.680 
different color families all in one
class<00:04:06.980> period<00:04:07.190> so<00:04:07.490> there's<00:04:07.730> a<00:04:07.790> wide<00:04:08.000> range<00:04:08.030> of

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
class period so there's a wide range of

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.720 
class period so there's a wide range of
what<00:04:09.590> you<00:04:09.710> can<00:04:09.830> accomplish<00:04:10.070> in<00:04:10.430> that<00:04:10.550> one

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
what you can accomplish in that one

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.090 
what you can accomplish in that one
