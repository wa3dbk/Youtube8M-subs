00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.399 
technique of running up the wall or a
tree<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:43.979> flipping<00:01:44.310> off<00:01:44.429> of<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:45.110> first<00:01:46.110> step

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
tree and flipping off of it first step

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.830 
tree and flipping off of it first step
and<00:01:46.649> trying<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.310> do<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.000> wall<00:01:48.149> back<00:01:48.360> lip<00:01:48.600> is

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
and trying to do the wall back lip is

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.410 
and trying to do the wall back lip is
figuring<00:01:49.679> out<00:01:49.799> which<00:01:50.039> foot<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.579> your<00:01:50.969> dominant

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
figuring out which foot is your dominant

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.120 
figuring out which foot is your dominant
foot<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.750> which<00:01:51.929> foot<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.170> your<00:01:52.530> recessive

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
foot in which foot is your recessive

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.279 
foot in which foot is your recessive
foot<00:01:53.340> because<00:01:54.179> you're<00:01:54.539> going<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.869> be<00:01:54.929> kicking

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
foot because you're going to be kicking

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.499 
foot because you're going to be kicking
off<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.770> tree<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.159> your<00:01:56.310> dominant<00:01:56.429> foot<00:01:56.700> so

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
off the tree with your dominant foot so

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.850 
off the tree with your dominant foot so
what<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.780> do<00:01:57.929> when<00:01:58.259> you're<00:01:58.380> approaching<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
what you do when you're approaching the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.190 
what you do when you're approaching the
tree<00:01:59.069> if<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.849> step<00:02:00.119> rather<00:02:00.360> close<00:02:00.780> with<00:02:01.079> your

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
tree if you step rather close with your

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.080 
tree if you step rather close with your
non-dominant<00:02:01.409> foot<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.220> then<00:02:02.759> your<00:02:02.909> first

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
non-dominant foot and then your first

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.910 
non-dominant foot and then your first
step<00:02:03.450> against<00:02:03.929> the<00:02:04.020> tree<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.439> with<00:02:04.829> your

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
step against the tree is with your

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.130 
step against the tree is with your
dominant<00:02:05.130> leg<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.789> then<00:02:06.599> as<00:02:06.810> you're<00:02:06.989> running

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
dominant leg and then as you're running

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.690 
dominant leg and then as you're running
up<00:02:07.439> your<00:02:07.619> second<00:02:08.099> step<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.399> with<00:02:08.549> your

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
up your second step is with your

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.029 
up your second step is with your
recessive<00:02:09.299> leg<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.690> then<00:02:10.049> you<00:02:10.170> kick<00:02:10.410> off<00:02:10.619> with

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
recessive leg and then you kick off with

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.740 
recessive leg and then you kick off with
the<00:02:11.160> dominant<00:02:11.579> leg<00:02:11.730> which<00:02:12.209> gives<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.510> enough

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
the dominant leg which gives you enough

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.900 
the dominant leg which gives you enough
momentum<00:02:13.049> to<00:02:13.290> flip<00:02:13.650> off<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:13.829> tree<00:02:13.950> just<00:02:14.819> to

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
momentum to flip off the tree just to

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.729 
momentum to flip off the tree just to
get<00:02:15.060> used<00:02:15.299> to<00:02:15.480> running<00:02:15.660> up<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.930> tree<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.530> just

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
get used to running up the tree you just

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.670 
get used to running up the tree you just
take<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.920> few<00:02:17.130> steps<00:02:17.220> back<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.849> just<00:02:18.560> run<00:02:19.560> up

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
take a few steps back and just run up

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.380 
take a few steps back and just run up
the<00:02:19.829> tree<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.519> see<00:02:20.730> how<00:02:20.819> high<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.000> can<00:02:21.209> get

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
the tree and see how high you can get

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.270 
the tree and see how high you can get
you<00:02:21.870> should<00:02:22.019> try<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.290> get<00:02:22.470> at<00:02:22.709> least<00:02:22.739> up<00:02:23.220> to

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
you should try and get at least up to

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.580 
you should try and get at least up to
your<00:02:23.579> own<00:02:23.730> height<00:02:24.060> because<00:02:24.989> that<00:02:25.170> should<00:02:25.379> give

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
your own height because that should give

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.170 
your own height because that should give
you<00:02:25.739> enough<00:02:25.769> time<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.370> complete<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.970> flip

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
you enough time to complete the flip

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:41.010 
you enough time to complete the flip
fully<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:29.239> that's<00:02:30.239> hina

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.810 

watch<00:02:42.020> Austin<00:02:42.590> does<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:42.860> two<00:02:43.040> steps<00:02:43.340> and

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
watch Austin does the two steps and

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.820 
watch Austin does the two steps and
kicks<00:02:44.120> off<00:02:44.330> with<00:02:44.450> his<00:02:44.600> dominant<00:02:45.050> leg<00:02:45.170> I<00:02:45.440> know

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
kicks off with his dominant leg I know

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.950 
kicks off with his dominant leg I know
it<00:02:45.950> justice<00:02:46.190> back<00:02:46.400> into<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.790> subha<00:02:47.120> do<00:02:47.270> that

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
it justice back into a subha do that

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.360 
it justice back into a subha do that
should<00:02:48.110> be<00:02:48.200> enough<00:02:48.290> momentum<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.890> get<00:02:49.250> you

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
should be enough momentum to get you

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.130 
should be enough momentum to get you
that<00:02:52.370> video<00:02:52.580> thanks<00:02:53.210> for<00:02:53.270> watching<00:02:53.390> we<00:02:54.110> hope

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
that video thanks for watching we hope

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.630 
that video thanks for watching we hope
it<00:02:54.440> out<00:02:54.590> once<00:02:55.100> you<00:02:55.190> get<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.400> down<00:02:55.430> you

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
it out once you get it down you

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.760 
it out once you get it down you
definitely<00:02:56.240> have<00:02:56.330> some<00:02:56.480> fun

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:12.690
