 Hello everyone and welcome not like you have 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.980
 seen to be doing a hologram with a 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.830
 mobile if you want to find out how they do it 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.150
 watch this video to be able to do the 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.470
 our program did at home 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.770
 we need a ruler a pen 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:31.609
 of scissors a notebook a smartphone 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:34.250
 scotch and a sheet of acetate ie a 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.140
 transparent plastic sheet of paper for 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.210
 First let's start with drawing a 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.059
 near isosceles with the minor base of 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:47.510
 a base centimeter greater than 6 and the 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:52.160
 top I say of 3.5 very well we repeat the 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.110
 measures once this is done by 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.180
 let's start cutting with scissors for 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.219
 then put it on the acetate sheet as 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.629
 walde to be able to cut a piece 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:06.070
 of plastic here we are marking i 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.070
 contours with the pen 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:15.170
 and then cut out affixed drawings one 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.420
 once cut a piece where we are 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.490
 on the acetate sheet and we use it as 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.090
 father to cut out three more pieces 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.370
 remaining once the fronts the forms 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.580
 join us with small pieces of 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.580
 Scotch tape 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.800
 they end up like this and finally they close for 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.290
 to be able to create a conical shape with 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.840
 a small impact opening sees 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.670
 to finish what we have to do is 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.040
 look for a video that is made on purpose 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.870
 to put holograms here vi 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.640
 we will leave the link in the description or 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.820
 you can click directly here in the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.680
 video later we start the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.780
 video we have chosen screen 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.050
 complete and we will have to hit ours 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.580
 shape not right at the center so that it fills 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.180
 to create your made program 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.250
 home 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.250
 what do you think we see some examples 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.200
 with 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.890
 please to do it will not happen choked
