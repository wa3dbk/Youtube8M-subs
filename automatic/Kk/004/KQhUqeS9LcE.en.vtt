00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.190 
because take a look at my caddie that is
2.3<00:04:21.330> or<00:04:22.200> I<00:04:22.490> think<00:04:23.490> that<00:04:23.640> is<00:04:23.789> pretty<00:04:24.030> good<00:04:24.570> but

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
2.3 or I think that is pretty good but

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.860 
2.3 or I think that is pretty good but
then<00:04:25.380> you<00:04:25.500> look<00:04:25.680> at<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.190> fine<00:04:26.789> details<00:04:27.360> if<00:04:27.600> you

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
then you look at the fine details if you

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.180 
then you look at the fine details if you
