got some shalimar yarn it is a merino
silk<00:00:46.339> blend<00:00:46.699> and<00:00:47.089> it's<00:00:47.239> a<00:00:47.390> really<00:00:47.659> beautiful

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
silk blend and it's a really beautiful

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.549 
silk blend and it's a really beautiful
hand-painted<00:00:48.879> kind<00:00:49.879> of<00:00:49.940> a<00:00:50.030> teal<00:00:50.510> blue<00:00:50.989> it's

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
hand-painted kind of a teal blue it's

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.619 
hand-painted kind of a teal blue it's
real<00:00:51.739> pretty<00:00:51.890> it's<00:00:52.129> a<00:00:52.430> haven<00:00:52.879> is<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.420> color

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
real pretty it's a haven is the color

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.430 
real pretty it's a haven is the color
name<00:00:53.900> and<00:00:54.080> there's<00:00:54.850> 247<00:00:55.850> yards<00:00:56.089> in<00:00:56.600> each<00:00:56.750> Hank

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
name and there's 247 yards in each Hank

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.560 
name and there's 247 yards in each Hank
so<00:00:58.220> it<00:00:58.370> looks<00:00:58.400> about<00:00:58.699> a<00:00:58.760> worsted<00:00:59.299> weight<00:00:59.540> i

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
so it looks about a worsted weight i

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.500 
so it looks about a worsted weight i
would<00:00:59.839> say<00:01:00.110> it's<00:01:00.979> a<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:01.580> there's<00:01:01.940> it<00:01:02.210> doesn't

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
would say it's a and there's it doesn't

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.049 
would say it's a and there's it doesn't
actually<00:01:02.690> say<00:01:03.320> what<00:01:03.799> size<00:01:04.100> it<00:01:04.339> is<00:01:04.400> on<00:01:04.760> the

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
actually say what size it is on the

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.500 
actually say what size it is on the
label<00:01:05.479> but<00:01:06.140> something<00:01:06.830> that<00:01:06.860> came<00:01:07.460> in<00:01:07.909> my

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
label but something that came in my

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.420 
label but something that came in my
package<00:01:08.990> is<00:01:09.229> going<00:01:09.409> to<00:01:09.500> help<00:01:09.680> me<00:01:09.890> determine

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
package is going to help me determine

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.220 
package is going to help me determine
what<00:01:11.090> exactly<00:01:11.270> wait<00:01:11.930> this<00:01:12.170> is<00:01:12.409> and<00:01:12.800> that<00:01:13.280> is<00:01:13.550> my

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
what exactly wait this is and that is my

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.220 
what exactly wait this is and that is my
fun<00:01:15.230> extra<00:01:15.800> which<00:01:16.040> is<00:01:16.220> a<00:01:16.400> wraps<00:01:17.060> per<00:01:17.600> inch<00:01:17.840> tool

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
fun extra which is a wraps per inch tool

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.900 
fun extra which is a wraps per inch tool
so<00:01:18.530> if<00:01:18.620> you<00:01:18.770> don't<00:01:18.890> know<00:01:19.070> what<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.220> wrap<00:01:19.430> springe

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
so if you don't know what a wrap springe

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.660 
so if you don't know what a wrap springe
tool<00:01:20.240> is<00:01:20.420> this<00:01:21.050> is<00:01:21.230> kind<00:01:21.440> of<00:01:21.500> what<00:01:21.650> they<00:01:21.800> use<00:01:22.310> to

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
tool is this is kind of what they use to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.850 
tool is this is kind of what they use to
figure<00:01:23.450> out<00:01:23.630> what<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.990> thickness<00:01:24.410> of<00:01:24.530> a<00:01:24.620> yarn

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
figure out what the thickness of a yarn

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.910 
figure out what the thickness of a yarn
is<00:01:25.070> so<00:01:25.280> this<00:01:25.460> is<00:01:25.640> comes<00:01:26.300> in<00:01:26.450> handy<00:01:26.630> for<00:01:26.920> hand

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
is so this is comes in handy for hand

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.310 
is so this is comes in handy for hand
spinners<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:28.580> such<00:01:28.850> ok<00:01:29.270> so<00:01:29.330> the<00:01:29.660> wraps<00:01:30.020> per

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
spinners and such ok so the wraps per

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.810 
spinners and such ok so the wraps per
inch<00:01:30.470> till<00:01:30.710> I<00:01:30.770> took<00:01:30.830> it<00:01:31.040> out<00:01:31.100> of<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.430> package

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
inch till I took it out of the package

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.660 
inch till I took it out of the package
so<00:01:31.970> you<00:01:32.090> can<00:01:32.240> see<00:01:32.600> you<00:01:33.320> will<00:01:33.500> lay<00:01:34.070> your<00:01:34.310> yarn

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
so you can see you will lay your yarn

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.220 
so you can see you will lay your yarn
through<00:01:35.060> this<00:01:35.150> little<00:01:35.330> notch<00:01:35.690> this<00:01:35.990> at<00:01:36.140> the

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
through this little notch this at the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.890 
through this little notch this at the
top<00:01:36.440> and<00:01:36.770> then<00:01:37.220> you're<00:01:37.610> going<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:37.760> wrap<00:01:38.180> it<00:01:38.210> all

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
top and then you're going to wrap it all

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.690 
top and then you're going to wrap it all
the<00:01:38.960> way<00:01:39.470> till<00:01:39.740> you<00:01:39.800> get<00:01:39.980> to<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:40.220> one<00:01:40.490> inch

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
the way till you get to the one inch

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.820 
the way till you get to the one inch
mark<00:01:41.180> so<00:01:41.450> it's<00:01:41.600> got<00:01:41.750> a<00:01:41.780> couple<00:01:42.050> it's<00:01:42.500> got<00:01:42.650> one

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
mark so it's got a couple it's got one

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.990 
mark so it's got a couple it's got one
two<00:01:42.980> and<00:01:43.100> three<00:01:43.400> inch<00:01:43.550> but<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:44.660> can<00:01:44.840> do<00:01:45.350> it<00:01:45.380> for

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
two and three inch but you can do it for

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.220 
two and three inch but you can do it for
average<00:01:47.000> sake<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:47.630> you<00:01:47.690> can<00:01:47.840> wrap<00:01:47.960> it<00:01:48.080> all<00:01:48.200> the

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
average sake so you can wrap it all the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.960 
average sake so you can wrap it all the
way<00:01:48.440> to<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.740> 3-inch<00:01:49.220> just<00:01:49.520> in<00:01:49.700> case<00:01:49.940> it's

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
way to the 3-inch just in case it's

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.020 
way to the 3-inch just in case it's
reading<00:01:50.750> not<00:01:51.140> even<00:01:51.470> on<00:01:51.980> each<00:01:52.220> inch<00:01:52.550> mark<00:01:52.880> so

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
reading not even on each inch mark so

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.630 
reading not even on each inch mark so
you<00:01:53.120> can<00:01:53.240> average<00:01:53.360> it<00:01:53.630> out<00:01:53.780> but<00:01:54.620> it<00:01:54.950> shows<00:01:55.400> you

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
you can average it out but it shows you

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.120 
you can average it out but it shows you
on<00:01:55.820> this<00:01:55.970> card<00:01:56.330> here<00:01:56.540> that<00:01:56.720> comes<00:01:56.930> with<00:01:57.170> it<00:01:57.200> how

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
on this card here that comes with it how

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.360 
on this card here that comes with it how
many<00:01:58.370> wraps<00:01:58.820> per<00:01:59.270> inch<00:01:59.620> makes<00:02:00.620> up<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:01.070> different

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
many wraps per inch makes up a different

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.990 
many wraps per inch makes up a different
kind<00:02:02.000> of<00:02:02.240> yarn<00:02:02.540> so<00:02:02.870> if<00:02:03.200> I<00:02:03.590> use<00:02:04.010> this<00:02:04.310> tool<00:02:04.580> for

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
kind of yarn so if I use this tool for

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.880 
kind of yarn so if I use this tool for
this<00:02:05.090> yarn<00:02:05.510> and<00:02:05.750> I<00:02:05.810> get<00:02:06.020> anywhere<00:02:06.440> from<00:02:06.590> nine

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
this yarn and I get anywhere from nine

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.910 
this yarn and I get anywhere from nine
to<00:02:07.190> 11<00:02:07.700> wraps<00:02:08.569> for<00:02:09.110> one<00:02:09.289> inch<00:02:09.530> that<00:02:09.769> I<00:02:09.860> know

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
to 11 wraps for one inch that I know

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.220 
to 11 wraps for one inch that I know
whoops<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.640> I<00:02:10.729> know<00:02:10.789> for<00:02:11.060> sure<00:02:11.269> that<00:02:11.540> I<00:02:12.080> have

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
whoops that I know for sure that I have

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.930 
whoops that I know for sure that I have
worsted<00:02:12.620> weight<00:02:12.769> yarn<00:02:12.800> so<00:02:13.459> it's<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.760> really

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
worsted weight yarn so it's a really

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.539 
worsted weight yarn so it's a really
cool<00:02:14.209> tool<00:02:14.420> I've<00:02:14.629> always<00:02:14.870> wanted<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:16.040> get<00:02:16.370> one

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
cool tool I've always wanted to get one

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.910 
cool tool I've always wanted to get one
of<00:02:16.670> these<00:02:16.849> so<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:17.659> way<00:02:17.810> when<00:02:17.989> I<00:02:18.049> have<00:02:18.439> a<00:02:18.469> yarn

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
of these so that way when I have a yarn

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.480 
of these so that way when I have a yarn
that<00:02:19.129> doesn't<00:02:19.849> tell<00:02:20.090> me<00:02:20.150> what<00:02:20.480> size<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:21.139> is

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
that doesn't tell me what size it is

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.910

I need<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.790> write<00:02:21.910> a<00:02:21.970> pattern<00:02:22.420> for<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:23.620> can

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
I need to write a pattern for it I can

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.120 
I need to write a pattern for it I can
use<00:02:24.100> this<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.340> kind<00:02:24.700> of<00:02:24.850> give<00:02:25.810> my<00:02:25.990> best<00:02:26.320> guess

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
buying the pattern so that is a really

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.060 
buying the pattern so that is a really
cool<00:02:34.000> fun<00:02:34.240> extra<00:02:34.660> I'm<00:02:34.720> really<00:02:34.900> excited<00:02:35.890> about

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.070 
using that one so i'll definitely use it
on<00:02:38.260> my<00:02:38.500> shalimar<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:39.310> we<00:02:39.820> can<00:02:40.030> determine<00:02:40.360> what

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
on my shalimar so we can determine what

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.580 
on my shalimar so we can determine what
exactly<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:42.610> weight<00:02:42.850> is<00:02:43.120> because<00:02:44.020> it's<00:02:44.470> like

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
exactly the weight is because it's like

exactly the weight is because it's like
a<00:02:44.620> worse<00:02:44.860> tip<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.250> maybe<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.430> little<00:02:45.610> bit

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
a worse tip and maybe a little bit

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.190 
a worse tip and maybe a little bit
thicker<00:02:46.060> then<00:02:47.050> our<00:02:47.530> soothing<00:02:48.370> extra<00:02:48.940> are<00:02:49.240> some
