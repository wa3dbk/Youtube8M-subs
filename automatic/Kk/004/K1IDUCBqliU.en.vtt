00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hi, I'm Charlie and we're going to learn 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:09.170
 build a flashlight using so 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.170
 just a graphite pencil let's see 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.840
 that nothing the people welcome to a new 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.020
 chapter of cats lapse today 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.150
 let's try to build a flashlight 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.360
 using the mine of the migra whistle is 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.700
 say the graphite but like rays it's going to 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.309
 work this good basically because 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.430
 the graphite we're going to do in cancer is 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.520
 say burn yourself as if it were a 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.830
 filament of a maximum vial 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.260
 ampules were formerly coal or 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.110
 of graphite then the first thing they're going to 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.620
 to do is take out the graphite salave mine 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.530
 for that they are going to use a cardboard cut 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.500
 or red and to completely slice the 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.690
 pencil this way and then they're going to 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.030
 carefully recreate the mine of this one 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.650
 what ends up breaking all the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.100
 pieces this is a big problem because 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.870
 because for the graphite to achieve 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.820
 affirm we need at least 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.850
 apply a current between 1 and 2 to 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.830
 perez but if we pass we will burn 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.750
 so fast the graphite that this one 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.420
 simply to burn is not going to light 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.400
 for a long time then for 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.130
 solve this problem what are we going to 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.680
 use is the law of gold the law of ohm 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.470
 tells us that the voltage is equal to the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.690
 current by resistance this law is 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.880
 very important because because it allows us 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.430
 extract one of the variables knowing 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.530
 any of the other two in this case 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.680
 we want to know how much current 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.180
 going to circulate in this graphite mine 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.570
 for this we know the voltage 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.570
 that we are going to apply in this case 12 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.610
 hores and what remains to know is that 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.320
 resistance has this piece of mines 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.110
 for which we are going to use a 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.580
 multiple using a multimeter 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.260
 we were able to determine that the resistance 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.490
 who owns the graphite is 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.530
 approximately 5 or more 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.600
 twelve poles to this little piece of 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.590
 graphite let's get it flowing a 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.900
 approximate current of 24 I thought it is 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.550
 moderately dangerous and here the most 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.350
 probable is that our small mine of 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.870
 graphite you end up burning in this 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.960
 animal but unfortunately I do not have two 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.650
 chunks is the importance of not having 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.650
 in the graphite mine 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.560
 ah 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.560
 something 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.480
 ah 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.080
 about him 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.330
 and nothing happened 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.180
 with the width 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.860
 and they could feel with all of whom 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.870
 you will not save rabid informant but 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.069
 same 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.069
 from michigan 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.370
 but that would be nice 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:04:01.319
 and obviously our 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.599
 experiment does not work 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.599
 it was predictable considering the current 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.739
 that flowed in our little one looks how 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.469
 we can solve this good 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.689
 getting another pencil and trying not to 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:14.219
 break the graphite inside the 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:16.260
 problem is that I already did it and it 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:18.960
 they broke all the crumbs 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.660
 and then the other variable that we can 

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.640
 control is the voltage at this time 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.050
 I'm using a port source 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.890
 computer on which I am using 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.440
 to draw different voltages then 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.380
 Now let's try with a voltage 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.240
 lower 5 balls which would cause here 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.470
 flow an approximate current of a 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.420
 p 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.800
 we will see if with that we manage to do 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.710
 love making it our graphite mine 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.920
 without burning it instantly but 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.920
 keeping a constant light let's try 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.919
 fuck this experiment 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.919
 what 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:05.360
 of good 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:30.800
 in your house and this is a flashlight 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:37.279
 see you the next chapter of capsule 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:52.069
 in this video 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:52.069
 why 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.180
 ah
