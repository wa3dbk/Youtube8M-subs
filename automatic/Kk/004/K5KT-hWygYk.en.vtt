useful<00:01:31.799> there<00:01:32.280> because<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.970> mean<00:01:33.000> they<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.420> so

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
useful there because I mean they have so

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.170

much<00:01:33.810> defense<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.619> forget<00:01:35.549> which<00:01:35.670> one<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:36.119> I

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
much defense I forget which one but I

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.520 
much defense I forget which one but I
think<00:01:36.390> one<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.570> them<00:01:36.689> offers<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.320> same

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
think one of them offers the same

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.340 
think one of them offers the same
protection<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.820> ribbon<00:01:39.150> does<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.810> that's

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
protection as a ribbon does so that's

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.520 
protection as a ribbon does so that's
also<00:01:40.560> very<00:01:40.829> helpful<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.960> my<00:01:42.960> plan<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.500> to
