 he did not even go there commenting that it was going to be 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.210
 warrior but they do officialize their 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.219
 hiring and immediately reports 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.949

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.900
 How did you feel about your new technician in 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.640
 your new colleagues the truth very 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.400
 happy to bring this club so 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.279
 important and it is complicated not everything well 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.199
 and that made the most of the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.599
 why I give myself to you is a club that 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.040
 is giving young people a chance 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.450
 as on its river bank with a wheel 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.030
 had little activity but here it 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.070
 can earn minutes if clear you win 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.079

 first show me training and in 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.180
 some place I think it will not be easy 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.420
 but what training show that 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.160
 I want to be there a guess 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.780
 you feel more at ease person than 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.840
 central all saints was looking for a lateral 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.660
 where I work sideways so if the 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.480
 right side I feel good and what I 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.620

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:20.070

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:22.410

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.380
 design that you will have your possible already 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:29.000
 I was here is rediscovering with your 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.060

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.120
 player 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.680

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.110

 they brought me here 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.620
 and take advantage of everything 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.650
 to change the future seen they had 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.810
 an implication 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.500
