00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.470 

I<00:00:00.680> got<00:00:01.680> a<00:00:01.709> question<00:00:01.920> about<00:00:02.280> harmonics<00:00:03.149> on<00:00:03.389> the

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
I got a question about harmonics on the

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.260 
I got a question about harmonics on the
guitar<00:00:03.780> so<00:00:04.620> first<00:00:05.040> there's<00:00:05.339> three<00:00:05.759> types<00:00:06.089> of

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
guitar so first there's three types of

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.059 
guitar so first there's three types of
harmonics<00:00:06.870> there's<00:00:07.379> these<00:00:07.589> natural

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
harmonics there's these natural

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.610 
harmonics there's these natural
harmonics<00:00:08.580> where<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:08.910> just<00:00:09.230> lightly<00:00:10.230> touch

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
harmonics where you just lightly touch

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.849 
harmonics where you just lightly touch
the<00:00:10.830> string<00:00:11.130> right<00:00:11.309> above<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.910> fret<00:00:15.740> and<00:00:16.740> they

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
the string right above the fret and they

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.259 
the string right above the fret and they
work<00:00:17.070> best<00:00:17.310> on<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.850> 5th<00:00:18.119> fret<00:00:20.090> 7th<00:00:21.090> fret<00:00:23.269> and

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
work best on the 5th fret 7th fret and

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.660 
work best on the 5th fret 7th fret and
the<00:00:24.630> 12th<00:00:24.990> fret<00:00:27.529> you<00:00:28.529> can<00:00:28.710> also<00:00:28.859> get<00:00:29.310> them<00:00:29.490> to

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
the 12th fret you can also get them to

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.770 
the 12th fret you can also get them to
work<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.090> fourth<00:00:30.330> fret<00:00:32.660> harder<00:00:33.660> on

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
work on the fourth fret harder on

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.690 
work on the fourth fret harder on
acoustic<00:00:34.320> electric<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:35.280> can<00:00:35.430> get<00:00:35.550> them<00:00:35.670> to

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
acoustic electric you can get them to

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.060 
acoustic electric you can get them to
ring<00:00:35.880> out<00:00:35.969> more<00:00:36.500> on<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> ninth<00:00:37.829> fret<00:00:40.070> some

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
ring out more on the ninth fret some

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.889 
ring out more on the ninth fret some
people<00:00:41.309> can<00:00:41.520> do<00:00:41.670> them<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:41.850> 2nd<00:00:42.270> fret<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.719> one

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
people can do them on 2nd fret and one

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.540 
people can do them on 2nd fret and one
thing<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.410> sometimes<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.829> have<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.010> adjust

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
thing is sometimes you have to adjust

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.479 
thing is sometimes you have to adjust
where<00:00:44.789> you're<00:00:44.940> picking<00:00:48.800> so<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.860> moved<00:00:50.100> my<00:00:50.160> pic

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
where you're picking so I moved my pic

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.700 
where you're picking so I moved my pic
back<00:00:51.120> farther<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.230> kind<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.500> got<00:00:52.590> an

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
back farther so you just kind of got an

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.790 
back farther so you just kind of got an
experiment<00:00:53.870> so<00:00:54.870> those<00:00:55.020> are<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.199> most<00:00:55.379> common

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
experiment so those are the most common

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.490 
experiment so those are the most common
to<00:00:55.949> use<00:00:56.100> especially<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.699> acoustic<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:58.170> next

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
to use especially on acoustic the next

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.040 
to use especially on acoustic the next
type<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.980> called<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.430> pinch<00:00:59.699> harmonic<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.539> I'm

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
type is called a pinch harmonic and I'm

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.250 
type is called a pinch harmonic and I'm
never<00:01:01.199> good<00:01:01.620> at<00:01:01.710> these<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.129> general<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:03.260> they

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
never good at these in general and they

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.899 
never good at these in general and they
work<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.589> lot<00:01:04.739> better<00:01:04.890> if<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.339> do<00:01:05.460> electric

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
work a lot better if you do electric

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.140 
work a lot better if you do electric
guitar<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.930> put<00:01:07.409> store<00:01:07.740> chinon<00:01:08.150> but

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
guitar and you put store chinon but

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.670 
guitar and you put store chinon but
basically<00:01:09.540> what<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.810> do<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:09.960> use<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.320> side<00:01:10.650> of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
basically what you do is use the side of

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.429 
basically what you do is use the side of
your<00:01:11.070> thumb<00:01:11.610> right<00:01:11.760> here<00:01:12.170> so<00:01:13.170> when<00:01:13.320> you're

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
your thumb right here so when you're

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.700 
your thumb right here so when you're
picking<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:14.070> go<00:01:14.280> like<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.869> let<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
picking you go like that and you let the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.499 
picking you go like that and you let the
side<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.130> your<00:01:17.310> thumb<00:01:17.520> hit<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> string<00:01:18.180> down

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
side of your thumb hit the string down

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.929 
side of your thumb hit the string down
here<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.170> makes<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.500> sound<00:01:22.670> is<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.850> I

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
here and it makes the sound is that I

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:32.539 
here and it makes the sound is that I
can<00:01:24.119> even<00:01:24.299> do<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> Houston<00:01:25.820> you<00:01:26.820> go

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.370 

so<00:01:33.549> I<00:01:33.579> can<00:01:33.850> metal<00:01:34.149> music<00:01:34.359> and<00:01:34.749> rock<00:01:34.899> music

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
so I can metal music and rock music

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.410 
so I can metal music and rock music
people<00:01:35.770> really<00:01:35.979> get<00:01:36.159> at<00:01:36.340> it<00:01:36.520> and<00:01:36.700> on<00:01:36.850> electric

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
people really get at it and on electric

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.559 
people really get at it and on electric
it<00:01:37.569> makes<00:01:37.750> like<00:01:37.960> a<00:01:37.990> screeching<00:01:38.649> sound<00:01:39.569> so

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
it makes like a screeching sound so

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:42.090 
it makes like a screeching sound so
that's<00:01:40.689> the<00:01:40.810> second<00:01:41.200> kind<00:01:41.319> of<00:01:41.439> harmonic<00:01:41.920> and

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
that's the second kind of harmonic and

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.440 
that's the second kind of harmonic and
then<00:01:42.189> there's<00:01:42.369> one<00:01:42.520> more<00:01:42.759> that<00:01:43.119> a<00:01:43.149> lot<00:01:43.420> of

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
then there's one more that a lot of

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.620 
then there's one more that a lot of
people<00:01:43.509> don't<00:01:43.899> know<00:01:44.049> about<00:01:44.079> or<00:01:44.679> you<00:01:44.709> can<00:01:44.979> like

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
people don't know about or you can like

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.300 
people don't know about or you can like
you<00:01:46.630> have<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:46.840> use<00:01:46.959> two<00:01:46.990> fingers<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:47.859> you

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
you have to use two fingers and you

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.800 
you have to use two fingers and you
pluck<00:01:48.579> with<00:01:48.759> your<00:01:48.909> middle<00:01:49.060> finger<00:01:49.450> and<00:01:49.479> then

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
pluck with your middle finger and then

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.410 
pluck with your middle finger and then
the<00:01:49.929> first<00:01:50.170> finger<00:01:50.409> touches<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:52.090> you<00:01:52.179> could<00:01:52.329> do

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
the first finger touches so you could do

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.999 
the first finger touches so you could do
it<00:01:52.539> like<00:01:52.689> this<00:01:52.869> this<00:01:53.109> is<00:01:53.170> 12th<00:01:53.619> fret<00:01:53.740> on<00:01:53.829> the<00:01:53.920> B

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
it like this this is 12th fret on the B

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.660 
it like this this is 12th fret on the B
string<00:01:54.599> and<00:01:55.599> I<00:01:55.750> could<00:01:55.899> do<00:01:55.990> 13th<00:01:56.679> fret<00:01:56.890> on<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.219> B

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
string and I could do 13th fret on the B

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.539 
string and I could do 13th fret on the B
string<00:01:58.319> so<00:01:59.319> I'm<00:01:59.380> holding<00:01:59.560> down<00:01:59.859> right<00:02:00.189> here

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
string so I'm holding down right here

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:07.609 
string so I'm holding down right here
and<00:02:00.759> I'm<00:02:01.090> plucking<00:02:02.729> above<00:02:03.729> a<00:02:03.879> thirteenth<00:02:04.299> fret

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.759 

yep<00:02:08.619> I<00:02:09.959> don't<00:02:10.959> know<00:02:11.019> what<00:02:11.140> these<00:02:11.260> are<00:02:11.319> called<00:02:11.440> I

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
yep I don't know what these are called I

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.140 
yep I don't know what these are called I
mean<00:02:11.920> basically<00:02:12.069> what<00:02:12.579> you're<00:02:12.700> doing<00:02:12.760> is

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
mean basically what you're doing is

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.130 
mean basically what you're doing is
you're<00:02:13.209> using<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.750> 12th<00:02:14.049> fret<00:02:14.140> harmonic<00:02:16.140> but

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
you're using the 12th fret harmonic but

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.630 
you're using the 12th fret harmonic but
you're<00:02:17.349> cutting<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.709> string<00:02:17.950> in<00:02:18.069> half<00:02:18.280> but

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
you're cutting the string in half but

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.119 
you're cutting the string in half but
you're<00:02:18.790> doing<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:19.120> like<00:02:19.560> like<00:02:20.560> if<00:02:20.680> I'm<00:02:20.799> holding

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
you're doing it like like if I'm holding

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.740 
you're doing it like like if I'm holding
here<00:02:21.370> then<00:02:21.609> the<00:02:21.700> middle<00:02:21.849> of<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.060> string<00:02:22.420> is<00:02:22.450> no

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
here then the middle of the string is no

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.630 
here then the middle of the string is no
longer<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:23.319> 12th<00:02:23.620> fret<00:02:23.709> it's<00:02:24.040> like<00:02:24.129> the<00:02:24.220> 13th

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
longer the 12th fret it's like the 13th

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.360 
longer the 12th fret it's like the 13th
fret<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.260> could<00:02:26.379> play<00:02:26.410> songs<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.250> way

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
fret so you could play songs that way

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:39.509 
fret so you could play songs that way
even<00:02:37.500> let's<00:02:38.500> plan<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.709> again<00:02:39.040> in<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.220> geeky

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
even let's plan it again in a geeky

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.289 
even let's plan it again in a geeky
doodle<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:42.310> those<00:02:42.459> are<00:02:42.609> the<00:02:42.639> three<00:02:42.730> types<00:02:42.940> of

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
doodle so those are the three types of

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.960 
doodle so those are the three types of
harmonics<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.290> there's<00:02:45.130> actually<00:02:45.250> harmonics

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
harmonics and there's actually harmonics

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.199 
harmonics and there's actually harmonics
that<00:02:46.060> occur<00:02:46.480> like<00:02:46.720> all<00:02:46.930> over<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.349> string<00:02:48.209> so

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
that occur like all over the string so

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.330 
that occur like all over the string so
you<00:02:49.299> can<00:02:49.540> well<00:02:50.049> that's<00:02:50.410> hard<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.769> do<00:02:50.919> them<00:02:51.130> like

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
you can well that's hard to do them like

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.330 
you can well that's hard to do them like
you<00:02:51.639> can<00:02:51.790> just<00:02:51.819> go<00:02:52.150> up<00:02:52.359> like<00:02:53.069> if<00:02:54.069> you're<00:02:54.250> on

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
you can just go up like if you're on

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.159 
you can just go up like if you're on
electric<00:02:54.819> you<00:02:55.000> can<00:02:55.180> hear<00:02:55.359> all<00:02:55.480> these<00:02:55.599> sort<00:02:56.109> of

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:56.169 
electric you can hear all these sort of

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:57.870 
electric you can hear all these sort of
different<00:02:56.560> harmonic<00:02:57.040> sounds<00:02:57.400> happen<00:02:57.790> in

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
different harmonic sounds happen in

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.530 
different harmonic sounds happen in
different<00:02:58.150> spots<00:03:03.000> but<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.150> way<00:03:04.239> that<00:03:04.480> I

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
different spots but the way that I

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.089 
different spots but the way that I
usually<00:03:04.989> use<00:03:05.109> them<00:03:05.290> is<00:03:05.470> either<00:03:05.590> for<00:03:05.859> like<00:03:05.980> an

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
usually use them is either for like an

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.090 
usually use them is either for like an
intro<00:03:06.489> you<00:03:07.060> can<00:03:07.239> just<00:03:07.389> be<00:03:07.540> like

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.470 

like<00:03:12.100> some<00:03:12.280> sort<00:03:12.460> of<00:03:12.550> texture<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:15.450> lot<00:03:16.450> of

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
like some sort of texture a lot of

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.790 
like some sort of texture a lot of
people<00:03:16.600> use<00:03:16.900> them<00:03:17.050> for<00:03:17.200> that<00:03:17.320> kind<00:03:17.500> of<00:03:17.560> stuff

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
people use them for that kind of stuff

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:25.160 
people use them for that kind of stuff
so<00:03:18.010> I'm<00:03:18.070> doing<00:03:18.160> like<00:03:18.250> 12th<00:03:18.610> fret<00:03:18.700> harmonics

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.330 

and<00:03:26.170> then<00:03:26.320> Michael<00:03:26.680> kind<00:03:26.860> of<00:03:26.920> look<00:03:27.010> like<00:03:27.040> power

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
and then Michael kind of look like power

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:34.100 
and then Michael kind of look like power
cords

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.240 

so<00:03:35.110> you<00:03:35.170> can<00:03:35.290> use<00:03:35.410> them<00:03:35.530> for<00:03:35.560> textures<00:03:36.160> like

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
so you can use them for textures like

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.280 
so you can use them for textures like
that<00:03:36.610> but<00:03:37.120> what<00:03:37.209> I<00:03:37.240> like<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.630> do<00:03:37.750> is<00:03:37.780> in<00:03:38.020> the<00:03:38.110> key

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
that but what I like to do is in the key

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.309 
that but what I like to do is in the key
of<00:03:38.319> G<00:03:38.560> major<00:03:38.770> I<00:03:39.480> like<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.630> just<00:03:40.750> ate<00:03:40.990> these

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
of G major I like to just ate these

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.650 
of G major I like to just ate these
harmonics<00:03:41.950> on<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.250> 5th<00:03:42.490> fret<00:03:42.640> 7th<00:03:43.240> and<00:03:43.420> 12

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
harmonics on the 5th fret 7th and 12

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.140 
harmonics on the 5th fret 7th and 12
which<00:03:43.930> are<00:03:44.080> the<00:03:44.170> loudest<00:03:44.319> they<00:03:44.800> work<00:03:44.980> best<00:03:45.280> in

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
which are the loudest they work best in

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.570 
which are the loudest they work best in
the<00:03:46.510> key<00:03:46.660> of<00:03:46.690> G<00:03:46.959> major<00:03:47.200> so<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.920> key<00:03:48.130> of<00:03:48.220> G<00:03:48.370> major

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
the key of G major so the key of G major

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.890 
the key of G major so the key of G major
has<00:03:48.819> these<00:03:49.000> chords<00:03:49.360> G

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:04:00.800 

a<00:03:51.959> minor<00:03:53.180> B<00:03:54.180> minor<00:03:54.739> C<00:03:56.269> D<00:03:57.269> E<00:03:58.230> minor<00:03:59.629> and<00:04:00.629> I've

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
a minor B minor C D E minor and I've

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.420 
a minor B minor C D E minor and I've
sharp<00:04:01.079> diminish<00:04:01.560> but<00:04:01.860> people<00:04:02.099> don't<00:04:02.159> use<00:04:02.310> it

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
sharp diminish but people don't use it

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.920 
sharp diminish but people don't use it
very<00:04:02.459> much<00:04:05.030> but<00:04:06.030> what<00:04:06.120> I<00:04:06.150> like<00:04:06.329> to<00:04:06.450> do<00:04:06.569> is<00:04:06.629> do

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
very much but what I like to do is do

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.660 
very much but what I like to do is do
this<00:04:07.079> key<00:04:07.230> minor<00:04:07.470> shape<00:04:07.769> in<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.069> middle<00:04:08.400> you

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
this key minor shape in the middle you

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.610 
this key minor shape in the middle you
Tara

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.720 

then<00:04:12.310> you<00:04:12.459> can<00:04:12.670> be<00:04:12.849> like

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.760 

this<00:04:18.270> is<00:04:18.390> a<00:04:18.420> little<00:04:18.630> C<00:04:18.810> shape<00:04:19.080> and<00:04:19.440> then<00:04:19.650> you

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
this is a little C shape and then you

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.280 
this is a little C shape and then you
visit<00:04:20.340> from<00:04:20.580> here<00:04:21.030> you<00:04:21.330> have<00:04:21.510> access<00:04:21.990> to<00:04:22.140> these

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
visit from here you have access to these

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.360 
visit from here you have access to these
more<00:04:22.590> like<00:04:23.510> I<00:04:24.800> like<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.890> just<00:04:26.010> sort<00:04:26.190> of<00:04:26.280> hit

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
more like I like to just sort of hit

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.000 
more like I like to just sort of hit
them<00:04:26.580> randomly<00:04:27.000> like<00:04:27.600> kind<00:04:28.440> of<00:04:28.560> as<00:04:28.710> part<00:04:28.950> of

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
them randomly like kind of as part of

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.580 
them randomly like kind of as part of
the<00:04:29.190> right<00:04:29.370> hand<00:04:29.610> is<00:04:30.510> like<00:04:30.750> a<00:04:30.810> strong<00:04:31.200> so<00:04:31.500> you

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
the right hand is like a strong so you

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:45.839 
the right hand is like a strong so you
could<00:04:31.680> be<00:04:31.740> like

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:56.260 

you

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.450 

you

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.240 

is<00:04:58.940> kind<00:04:59.270> of<00:04:59.389> like<00:04:59.539> using<00:05:00.410> my<00:05:00.740> finger<00:05:01.039> not

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
is kind of like using my finger not

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.830 
is kind of like using my finger not
really<00:05:01.520> worrying<00:05:01.819> too<00:05:01.970> much<00:05:02.000> about<00:05:02.150> it<00:05:02.660> and

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
really worrying too much about it and

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.469 
really worrying too much about it and
then<00:05:03.190> it<00:05:04.190> sounds<00:05:04.580> pretty<00:05:04.789> neat<00:05:05.120> as<00:05:05.300> like<00:05:05.449> a

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
then it sounds pretty neat as like a

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.960 
then it sounds pretty neat as like a
texture<00:05:06.020> or<00:05:06.740> you<00:05:06.860> can<00:05:06.979> be<00:05:07.069> more<00:05:07.250> precise<00:05:07.639> and

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
texture or you can be more precise and

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.850 
texture or you can be more precise and
be<00:05:08.030> like<00:05:08.150> I'm<00:05:08.330> going<00:05:08.449> to<00:05:08.539> hit<00:05:08.690> seventh<00:05:09.680> fret

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
be like I'm going to hit seventh fret

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:26.760 
be like I'm going to hit seventh fret
harmonic<00:05:10.240> on<00:05:11.240> B<00:05:11.990> and<00:05:12.410> Angie

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.200 

sometimes<00:05:27.770> it's<00:05:27.950> also<00:05:28.100> cool<00:05:28.550> like<00:05:28.880> you<00:05:29.060> just

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
sometimes it's also cool like you just

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.640 
sometimes it's also cool like you just
pick<00:05:29.360> a<00:05:29.420> couple<00:05:29.630> harmonics<00:05:30.230> and<00:05:30.410> you<00:05:30.500> keep

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
pick a couple harmonics and you keep

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.280 
pick a couple harmonics and you keep
going<00:05:30.830> back<00:05:31.010> to<00:05:31.190> those<00:05:31.520> two<00:05:31.990> like<00:05:32.990> I<00:05:33.110> was<00:05:33.260> just

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
going back to those two like I was just

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:47.760 
going back to those two like I was just
doing

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.810 

in<00:05:48.770> case<00:05:48.949> you<00:05:49.070> don't<00:05:49.160> know<00:05:49.250> what<00:05:49.400> I'm<00:05:49.520> doing

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
in case you don't know what I'm doing

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.670 
in case you don't know what I'm doing
this<00:05:49.970> is<00:05:50.030> e<00:05:50.300> minor<00:05:51.010> this<00:05:52.010> is<00:05:52.160> D<00:05:52.340> major<00:05:53.470> this<00:05:54.470> is

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
this is e minor this is D major this is

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.239 
this is e minor this is D major this is
C<00:05:54.889> major

00:05:56.239 --> 00:05:56.249 
C major

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:00.289 
C major
this<00:05:56.789> is<00:05:56.939> G<00:05:57.149> major<00:05:58.459> acacia<00:05:59.459> has<00:05:59.789> gone<00:05:59.939> up<00:06:00.029> the<00:06:00.119> g

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:00.299 
this is G major acacia has gone up the g

00:06:00.299 --> 00:06:03.679 
this is G major acacia has gone up the g
major<00:06:00.449> up<00:06:00.809> here<00:06:00.989> on<00:06:01.109> the<00:06:01.199> temple<00:06:02.419> so<00:06:03.419> what<00:06:03.539> that

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:03.689 
major up here on the temple so what that

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:05.749 
major up here on the temple so what that
is<00:06:03.869> that's<00:06:04.079> a<00:06:04.229> 145<00:06:04.829> in<00:06:05.039> the<00:06:05.129> key<00:06:05.279> of<00:06:05.309> G<00:06:05.579> it's

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 
is that's a 145 in the key of G it's

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:10.629 
is that's a 145 in the key of G it's
basically<00:06:06.089> like<00:06:06.269> me<00:06:06.509> going

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.170 

you

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:21.030 

I'm<00:06:14.810> going

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.280 

the<00:06:22.040> reason<00:06:22.340> why<00:06:22.430> it's<00:06:22.610> cool<00:06:22.790> here<00:06:23.060> is<00:06:23.290> it's

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.290 
the reason why it's cool here is it's

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.690 
the reason why it's cool here is it's
fun<00:06:24.530> to<00:06:24.650> play<00:06:24.830> in<00:06:24.860> the<00:06:25.010> middle<00:06:25.190> of<00:06:25.250> guitar<00:06:25.550> you

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
fun to play in the middle of guitar you

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.370 
fun to play in the middle of guitar you
can<00:06:25.730> do<00:06:25.970> more<00:06:26.150> stuff<00:06:26.420> but<00:06:26.810> also<00:06:26.960> you<00:06:27.170> have

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
can do more stuff but also you have

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.760 
can do more stuff but also you have
these<00:06:27.500> harmonics<00:06:29.020> they<00:06:30.020> also<00:06:30.170> work<00:06:30.470> pretty

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
these harmonics they also work pretty

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.620 
these harmonics they also work pretty
well<00:06:30.860> in<00:06:31.100> the<00:06:31.190> key<00:06:31.340> of<00:06:31.370> C<00:06:31.490> so<00:06:32.300> you<00:06:32.390> could<00:06:32.540> be

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
well in the key of C so you could be

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.959 
well in the key of C so you could be
like

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:37.969 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:46.200 

you

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.129 

see<00:06:47.210> you<00:06:47.270> all<00:06:47.389> right<00:06:47.539> and<00:06:47.660> sound<00:06:47.930> quite<00:06:48.110> as

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:48.139 
see you all right and sound quite as

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:49.420 
see you all right and sound quite as
good<00:06:48.380> they're<00:06:48.770> really<00:06:48.860> better<00:06:49.130> for<00:06:49.250> the<00:06:49.310> key

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
good they're really better for the key

00:06:49.430 --> 00:07:01.600 
good they're really better for the key
of<00:06:49.520> G

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.559 

so<00:07:02.610> I<00:07:02.639> tended<00:07:03.120> to<00:07:03.270> use<00:07:03.389> it<00:07:03.539> more<00:07:03.750> like<00:07:03.930> EG

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:05.569 
so I tended to use it more like EG

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:07.550 
so I tended to use it more like EG
that's<00:07:06.569> pretty<00:07:06.780> much<00:07:06.930> what<00:07:07.139> idea<00:07:07.440> with

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 
that's pretty much what idea with

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.839 
that's pretty much what idea with
harmonics<00:07:08.039> for<00:07:08.160> the<00:07:08.250> most<00:07:08.430> part<00:07:08.610> either

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:08.849 
harmonics for the most part either

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:11.719 
harmonics for the most part either
intros<00:07:09.419> or<00:07:09.780> that<00:07:10.169> style<00:07:10.590> plane<00:07:10.949> in<00:07:11.370> the<00:07:11.460> middle

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:11.729 
intros or that style plane in the middle

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:17.749 
intros or that style plane in the middle
guitar<00:07:15.349> and<00:07:16.349> I<00:07:16.650> guess<00:07:16.830> that's<00:07:17.039> really<00:07:17.280> it<00:07:17.490> so

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 
guitar and I guess that's really it so

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:20.559 
guitar and I guess that's really it so
there<00:07:17.910> has<00:07:18.090> any<00:07:18.240> questions<00:07:18.419> about<00:07:18.930> harmonics

00:07:20.559 --> 00:07:20.569 
there has any questions about harmonics

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:22.760 
there has any questions about harmonics
or<00:07:21.569> if<00:07:21.660> you<00:07:21.750> have<00:07:21.810> stuff<00:07:21.990> that<00:07:22.199> you<00:07:22.289> like<00:07:22.319> to<00:07:22.500> do

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:22.770 
or if you have stuff that you like to do

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.469 
or if you have stuff that you like to do
like<00:07:23.009> you<00:07:23.190> could<00:07:23.370> post<00:07:23.490> a<00:07:23.669> response<00:07:23.819> video<00:07:24.210> or

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 
like you could post a response video or

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:30.680 
like you could post a response video or
something<00:07:25.669> and<00:07:26.669> that<00:07:27.630> is<00:07:27.660> it<00:07:27.960> okay
