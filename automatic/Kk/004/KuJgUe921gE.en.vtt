00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.200
 and here folks here from paul sereno and the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.870
 Today's video is just an informative 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.490
 for you because the inscriptions for the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.320
 drawing of the future 2 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.109
 is already open and in the future what will 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.240
 happen in November if I 'm not mistaken 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.670
 August September October October November 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.199
 to draw the future 2 just talk 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.609
 some little things here that a lot of people 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.849
 had doubts 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.429
 good for me to draw you have to have a 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.399
 video sim on the channel is no use you 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.829
 create a channel is and did not have Diego and 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.260
 to inscribe produce in the future I want 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.480
 to draw people who really 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.489
 channel not only to earn a 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.739
 drawing something else that came up a lot 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.270
 I am already in the process of producing 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.640
 future one has to write or draw 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.170
 in the future two yes because they are 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.170
 different forms so I'll see 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.629
 all channels again logical already has 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.629
 some channels that have signed up for 11 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.420
 which I have already made a point if 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.489
 signed up for 2 then gave if you 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.500
 has a channel that you think this good 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.369
 stride making a future but even if 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.680
 did not win 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.229
 you may have the chance to hold a 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.310
 continued with me because of the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.130
 future one 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.799
 I think the rest is the staff. 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.869
 understood well and are worth much 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.220
 You're going to get a drawing of me at 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.340
 a video here my channel 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.900
 so you have the chance to appear two 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.060
 times here on my channel in the video 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.159
 drawing you thank you as already 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.290
 I made the result of the future training with 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.540
 sink we had with then that is 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.930

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.210
 video of the future saying 1 explaining 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.880
 It's better that it works because I 'm not going. 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.149
 Say it all again here, huh? 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.939
 but mine is in this drawing of the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.890
 future because it is already almost doubling 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.200
 number of channels it had in the first 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.200

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.149

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.950
