00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.490
 look at the next one that 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.590
 We're going to start now. 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.730
 not much changes not only I can not 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.340
 that will change places 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.070
 so to increase the height if not 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.560
 will be all twisted then one two three 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.390
 four chains again 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.210
 working with the high point of the catch 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.860
 then go to each point at the 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.730
 double that you have in your career 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.489
 previous 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.910
 You'll make another double high point. 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.280
 I get ahead in this career everything 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.809
 well, let's leave here 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:52.609
 because I'm almost at the end of this first 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:56.179
 part here double O highlights here 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:01:01.280
 I already did a part is good 4 chains 1 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:03.800
 2 3 4 and now that it has the difference 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.300
 Let's see then any remembers that in the 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.930
 previous career 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:12.230
 on the high point of the middle we had two 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.720
 eyes're seeing is that what changes is 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.030
 exactly here we are going to make point 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.190
 high double two thrown in the first 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.090
 double high point of the previous career 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.770
 you will make a though we did one in 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.630
 second career podium high point 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:33.710
 Previous you'll do one more, okay, I have. 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.480
 two now end in the third high point of the 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.320
 top of previous career 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.400
 you will make two high points of plus tÃ´ 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.750
 same age 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:49.850
 so I made one in the same hard here in the air 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:53.390
 It's one more that made two 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.970
 See another double high point in the 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.860
 last high point on the pole I had 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.680
 made in the previous career 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.920
 look there then there is what was a high point 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:08.989
 the quadruple turned three high points 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:14.989
 double what were three turned 4 what 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:17.090
 was 4 now turned 5 rock in that career 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.660
 you will work this way until the 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.010
 So it's okay then, where it was high 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.000
 trio got ahead in the race 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.600
 previous 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.240
 this will also be 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.700
 what changes then is here because here they were 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.790
 four career double points 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.580
 previous and this does have to come hard 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.790
 the first normal makes the second normal 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.940
 on the third you pull the colon 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.530
 double prisoners on the same base and 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.600
 last is normal 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.680
 Let's work this way then people. 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.970
 until the end of your career it's okay 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.100
 I got there at the end of your 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.110
 career, so he killed me with 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.540
 my four little chains to be 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.250
 prey in that 4 that I wanted 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.210
 initially to work up 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:06.380
 remember 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:10.140
 we were counting the 234 O you go there 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.380
 passes his ball through the fourth point and 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.810
 With the lowest point you catch ok. 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.640
 andrezinho we will then work already 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.650
 next career because she makes a 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.380
 career has a detail that changes a lot 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.620
 little baby because now that you're staying 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.140
 stick your little flag on your head 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.510
 The other thing I'm talking about here is good and 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.070
 in the beret people think it's not good yet 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.710
 the time is good is one that is well 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.230
 closed and if this is a play ring it is 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.930
 that he kills the kitten that the 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.690
 band is good, so lets correct it, it 's not 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.760
 Fine, it's played well. 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.080
 Ok let's go up Let's go up with 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.420
 four chains to 1 234 chains 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.910
 to climb klaba long hause at the point 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.720
 tall double taken by the front of the race 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.310
 previous 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:03.510
 so let's work five high points 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:08.520
 of the plus picking up the front of the point 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:12.480
 double top of his previous career 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:15.000
 otto arriving since here we come then 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.470
 the end and now I'll show 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.780
 you the difference 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.380
 remember that here he made four dots 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.350
 Ok changed here are only three 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.480
 because it will change to 3 to adjust 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.430
 to stay firm in our head not 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.060
 stand sambando business over the head 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:37.500
 Okay and now, now, high point and you 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.440
 will make a double high point for each point 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.230
 high double 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:45.310
 that exists in the previous career ok 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.500
 Remember that we did five rock in that 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.200
 hence 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.870
 we will continue hard but we will not 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.750
 increase the number of stitches 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:00.040
 okay look there O my're ready to 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.630
 new notice here was 4 again we will do 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.470
 only three 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:08.710
 and again a high point of the club I get 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.600
 the front of the double top 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.740
 previous career 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.760
 Let's leave this career here. 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.420
 all like this 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.990
 Let's go, I got there at the end of your 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:25.150
 galerinha career also looks O 3 there 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:30.670
 you still have 64 then 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:33.640
 come 1234 starts to pull needle 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:37.660
 tip concludes with very low CaÃ¡la 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:40.420
 done my other carreirinha look there 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.120
 looks digest size that is already gaining 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.140
 wind now a detail people lends 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.300
 attention 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.060
 Are you going to work this career that 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.610
 Did you do the same before 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.700
 Two Three another according to 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.950
 Any time you want, it's okay, will you? 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:01.169
 Measuring, see where you want it. 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.169
 that it is okay jewelry 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:08.260
 Look, I'm going to do this last career. 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.040
 that we worked for five more 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.940
 times 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:15.850
 now if you want more you can if you 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.050
 want - code also depends on the height 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.540
 what you want 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.880
 like I said go measure what's for you 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.440
 to be sure of where you want it 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.470
 It's okay. 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.500
 just remember that after this five 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:32.950
 careers that I will do in case I 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:35.770
 I'll still add a little bar like 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:38.110
 If it were a bowl, that's fine then. 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:41.020
 be careful only when it comes to 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:44.010
 run the careers you'll be doing 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:47.530
 follow the jewel 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:50.320
 I have already determined that all my 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.750
 little people riding my little toe 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.850
 OK 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.560
 Now it's our turn to see the 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:59.980
 her belly to make it come on 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.280
 raise the points again to a 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.250
 hurt 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:07.400
 You only have chains because now I go. 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:10.580
 work as high point that normal 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:13.580
 It's not double that is not good for every 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:16.250
 that you have in this 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.230
 base that is working you will do 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:22.040
 a high point 

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:24.260
 so without mystery each current had 

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.540
 in your previous career or each 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.530
 point of his previous career 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.800
 it's a high point let's work back 

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:34.580
 all 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:38.510
 that way then there will everyone 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:41.980
 making your career a high point 

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.980
 normal now okay
