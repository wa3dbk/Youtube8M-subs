00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.340
 the plane really first is manufactured in 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.980
 the computer with each and every one of the 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.450
 pieces have to be assembled in this case 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.560
 you are looking at a hydraulic valve of 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.360
 Braking control with these programs 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.390
 we know without having to do the tests 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.939
 mechanics how will each one work 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.210
 of the pieces before putting them in the 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.210
 airplane 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.370
 there are machining processes 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.730
 to the pieces that they have then to form 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.250
 part like this of the later train 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.989
 there are turning tower processes like 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.400
 can also be in this case the axis 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.400
 main wheels 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:59.070
 or a flap this control surface of the 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.400
 plane be unit after 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.450
 wing to give you the possibility of 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.450
 movement to the leg 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.990
 in the central part of the structure of the 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.259
 aircraft fuselage 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.930
 this is the one that carries the water or the 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:19.140
 fuel or the payment burden of 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.510
 client here can fit 2000 kilos 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.550
 product and that's what when 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.159
 we transport what the plane is for 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.380
 part of the tail of the structure of the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.600
 tail is one of the sides and this is 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.010
 the welding procedure after 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.750
 Welding processes of the process 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.140
 painting we are waiting for you to 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.509
 pieces dry from the previous cleaning 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.280
 just to be able to start painting and 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.070
 give you protection at this time 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.369
 we have the first prototype in Lleida 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.710
 in the harbor making ground tests 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.750
 especially asphalt tests tests of 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.130
 rolling and here we are already in ask 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.039
 start the production of the following 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.820
 five to validate the procedure of 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:02.910
 manufacture within the models there 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.119
 one that is fire and power 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.679
 operate day and night is not just ten 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.789
 less economic times but it is the 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.040
 double 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.109
 of profitable if we understand it also 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.939
 from the perspective of the amount of 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:18.400
 water that can throw this plane is 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:19.860
 may well have 2,000 liters each 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.100
 minute 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.780
 those are 120 milliliters at the moment there is no 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.920
 nothing now that I can put out fires 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.920
 with this efficiency
