here we'll see we're going to hold this
up<00:03:17.510> here<00:03:17.810> we<00:03:18.290> wrap<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.620> thread<00:03:18.859> around<00:03:18.889> it

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
up here we wrap the thread around it

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:35.890 
up here we wrap the thread around it
come<00:03:20.540> in<00:03:20.720> here<00:03:31.870> catch<00:03:32.870> it<00:03:34.450> even<00:03:35.450> though<00:03:35.660> even

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
come in here catch it even though even

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.309 
come in here catch it even though even
the<00:03:36.079> mounts<00:03:36.349> on<00:03:36.470> both<00:03:36.680> sides<00:03:37.989> chase<00:03:38.989> it<00:03:39.169> right

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
the mounts on both sides chase it right

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:51.099 
the mounts on both sides chase it right
around<00:03:42.310> but<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:43.340> only<00:03:43.519> use<00:03:43.609> one<00:03:47.709> one<00:03:48.709> wrap<00:03:50.109> set

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
around but I only use one one wrap set

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.970 
around but I only use one one wrap set
of<00:03:51.260> three<00:03:51.579> you<00:03:52.579> can<00:03:52.760> do<00:03:52.880> that<00:03:53.090> you<00:03:53.799> tape<00:03:54.799> it

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
of three you can do that you tape it

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.670 
of three you can do that you tape it
around<00:03:55.069> because<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:56.000> as<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:56.989> rotates<00:03:57.200> you're

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
around because the as it rotates you're

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.819 
around because the as it rotates you're
losing<00:03:58.040> that<00:03:58.160> turn<00:03:58.459> of<00:03:58.579> thread<00:03:58.849> so<00:03:59.590> every<00:04:00.590> time

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
losing that turn of thread so every time

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.220 
losing that turn of thread so every time
it<00:04:01.700> goes<00:04:01.849> around<00:04:01.910> you<00:04:02.450> got<00:04:02.599> to<00:04:02.630> chase<00:04:02.959> it

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
it goes around you got to chase it

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.259 
it goes around you got to chase it
otherwise<00:04:03.739> that<00:04:04.160> fun<00:04:04.400> little<00:04:04.519> car<00:04:04.880> right<00:04:05.120> out
