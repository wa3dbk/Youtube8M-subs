00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
school from the upperclassmen I think

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.740

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.650 
Carolina you're too good of a player
you're<00:03:32.400> never<00:03:32.609> gonna<00:03:32.760> force<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.299> don't<00:03:33.480> worry

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
you're never gonna force I don't worry

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.750 
you're never gonna force I don't worry
about<00:03:33.780> him<00:03:34.049> forcing<00:03:34.590> but<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.400> need<00:03:35.549> to<00:03:35.639> look

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
about him forcing but you need to look

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.370 
about him forcing but you need to look
for<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.030> shot<00:03:36.239> step<00:03:36.569> and<00:03:36.780> take<00:03:36.989> them<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.349> I

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
for the shot step and take them and I

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.830 
for the shot step and take them and I
thought<00:03:37.739> London<00:03:38.370> him<00:03:38.669> taking<00:03:39.000> ten<00:03:39.180> shots<00:03:39.510> you

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
thought London him taking ten shots you

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.509 
thought London him taking ten shots you
know<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.049> just<00:03:40.169> aggressive<00:03:41.130> in<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.310> lane

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
know and just aggressive in the lane

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.330 
know and just aggressive in the lane
with<00:03:42.090> his<00:03:42.239> obviously<00:03:43.019> created<00:03:43.709> six<00:03:43.950> assists

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
with his obviously created six assists

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.849 
with his obviously created six assists
that<00:03:45.030> just<00:03:45.510> adds<00:03:45.720> another<00:03:45.959> dimension<00:03:46.049> to<00:03:46.680> us

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
that just adds another dimension to us

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.800 
that just adds another dimension to us
and<00:03:47.099> and<00:03:47.549> I<00:03:47.669> you<00:03:47.910> know<00:03:48.000> we<00:03:48.120> needed<00:03:48.299> all<00:03:48.510> of<00:03:48.660> it

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
and and I you know we needed all of it

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.900 
and and I you know we needed all of it
for<00:03:49.019> sure<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.650> liked<00:03:50.069> his<00:03:50.220> approach<00:03:50.609> I

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
for sure and I liked his approach I

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.280 
for sure and I liked his approach I
thought<00:03:51.150> London<00:03:51.510> was<00:03:51.660> phenomenal<00:03:52.200> in<00:03:52.260> terms

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
thought London was phenomenal in terms

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.080 
thought London was phenomenal in terms
of<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.590> way<00:03:52.709> he<00:03:52.799> distributed<00:03:53.310> but<00:03:53.730> also<00:03:54.030> I

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
of the way he distributed but also I

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.550 
of the way he distributed but also I
felt<00:03:54.269> like<00:03:54.419> he<00:03:54.510> was<00:03:54.630> aggressive<00:03:54.870> tonight<00:03:55.169> and

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
felt like he was aggressive tonight and

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.930 
felt like he was aggressive tonight and
I<00:03:55.590> think<00:03:55.799> that<00:03:55.919> opens<00:03:56.280> up<00:03:56.430> that<00:03:56.549> takes<00:03:56.760> our

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
I think that opens up that takes our

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.819 
I think that opens up that takes our
team<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:57.269> another<00:03:57.450> level<00:03:57.780> on<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.500> offensive

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
team to another level on the offensive

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.430 
team to another level on the offensive
end<00:03:59.040> when<00:03:59.250> he<00:03:59.370> can<00:03:59.549> be<00:04:00.209> that<00:04:00.720> aggressive<00:04:00.989> but

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
end when he can be that aggressive but

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.750 
end when he can be that aggressive but
still<00:04:01.650> find<00:04:01.859> a<00:04:01.950> balance<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.370> giving<00:04:02.639> people

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
still find a balance and giving people

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.500 
still find a balance and giving people
the<00:04:02.910> ball

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
the ball

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.000 
the ball
that<00:04:04.750> was<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:04.989> lot<00:04:05.230> of<00:04:05.260> occurrences

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
that was a lot of occurrences

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.949 
that was a lot of occurrences
coast-to-coast<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.209> feel<00:04:07.569> like<00:04:07.659> we<00:04:07.750> haven't

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
coast-to-coast I feel like we haven't

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.309 
coast-to-coast I feel like we haven't
reached<00:04:08.170> our<00:04:08.379> peak<00:04:08.590> I<00:04:09.069> feel<00:04:09.760> like<00:04:09.879> we<00:04:09.970> have

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
reached our peak I feel like we have

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.720 
reached our peak I feel like we have
somebody<00:04:11.319> stepped<00:04:11.650> up<00:04:11.799> new<00:04:11.980> every<00:04:12.370> every

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
somebody stepped up new every every

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.250 
somebody stepped up new every every
single<00:04:12.879> game<00:04:13.180> never<00:04:13.689> been<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.049> same<00:04:14.200> person

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
single game never been the same person

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.890

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
have a lot of skill on our team but I

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.270 
have a lot of skill on our team but I

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.250 
feel like we are our ceiling is very
high<00:04:21.669> not<00:04:22.150> hopefully<00:04:22.510> we<00:04:22.630> reach<00:04:22.810> that<00:04:22.840> towards

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
high not hopefully we reach that towards

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.110 
high not hopefully we reach that towards
the<00:04:23.320> end<00:04:23.440> of<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.560> season<00:04:23.919> and<00:04:24.160> I<00:04:24.280> get<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:24.970> that
