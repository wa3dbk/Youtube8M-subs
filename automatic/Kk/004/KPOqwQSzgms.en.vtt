00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:13.430
 hello my name is alexey today 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.880
 I will tell you about or modern hat 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.220
 beekeeping can be divided conditionally into 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:23.240
 two lights then one method when a beekeeper 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.730
 intervenes in family life this is a framework 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.900
 the drive we will use in this 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.750
 the case of her beds and it will be innovative 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.450
 friends craft designs 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:40.580
 designed for this and the second method 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:43.670
 this is the so-called contactless method 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.580
 what's driving in which chill-out isn't 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.840
 interferes with the life of the bee family so 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:53.630
 he has unibo.ru alpine hive 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.870
 kulish from I would call him well 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:06.640
 provoking means tule capsina consists 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:12.740
 of insulated roofs of 5 buildings and 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:17.840
 combined 1 inside it looks like it 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:20.930
 narrowly tall construction diameter 315 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.610
 millimeters in this hive we use 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.860
 rulers to set 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.950
 the direction of the structure of the bees in the structure of honeycombs 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.860
 bees either use these frames 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.310
 but they are not used for inspection 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.250
 and in order to be comfortable in the honey extractor 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.110
 download honey and possibly secondary 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:48.130
 use them putting in the lower case 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.130
 so it was all quickly 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:56.119
 Tuuli design provide 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:02:02.390
 insulation so it allows the bees 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:07.790
 good about middle Russia 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:11.200
 so that you understand how and when to shoot the meter 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:16.510
 I 'll tell you a little bit in the device 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.730
 magnet widths run inside and 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:23.540
 start building 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:26.480
 draw your honeycomb from top to bottom through 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.239
 some time the bees will fold 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.840
 feed stocks top here here 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.450
 we will be honey like this and in the middle part 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:46.280
 there will be a warehouse they will brood 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:48.709
 nest and perco we will mix our 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.200
 whether for this we will be a little bit like that 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:56.829
 tilt put scales here 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.829
 or weigh the fallen 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.760
 will not reach 75 kilograms it will be 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.430
 mean we can 1-1 body this 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.570
 about 15 kilograms of min for 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.700
 to do this we need to cut everything off 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:19.380
 for it between the corps 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.610
 my stretch the wire in order 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.270
 to bees where 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.880
 build we have to substitute a new 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.640
 body 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.160
 many corpus we present with 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.420
 various gadgets in this case 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:40.100
 less we such a jack means we 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.100
 we understand all cases 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:53.440
 it was better to do it and yours could have been 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.690
 lowering reduced 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:12.290
 plague which may be on the bottom 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:14.090
 corps so that they betray all the bees 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.360
 can continue to live and practice 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.920
 their own affairs 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.410
 more information you will find them
