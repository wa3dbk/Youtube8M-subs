little bit easier for us to see the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.589 
little bit easier for us to see the
image<00:02:40.160> so<00:02:41.160> he<00:02:41.220> has<00:02:41.340> full<00:02:41.610> scanner<00:02:42.390> control

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
image so he has full scanner control

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.050 
image so he has full scanner control
just<00:02:43.079> like<00:02:43.170> we<00:02:43.349> would<00:02:43.500> on<00:02:43.709> a<00:02:43.760> laptop<00:02:44.760> or

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
just like we would on a laptop or

other devices but this is all all the
scanning<00:03:47.900> here<00:03:48.230> is<00:03:49.190> taking<00:03:49.640> place<00:03:50.890> with<00:03:51.890> just

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
scanning here is taking place with just

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.220 
scanning here is taking place with just
the<00:03:52.220> simple<00:03:52.549> probe<00:03:52.760> take<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:53.840> directly<00:03:53.959> to

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
the simple probe take you directly to

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.680 
the simple probe take you directly to
the<00:03:54.379> phone<00:03:54.700> it<00:03:55.700> will<00:03:55.819> load<00:03:56.030> a<00:03:56.060> file<00:03:56.390> that's

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
the phone it will load a file that's

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.699 
the phone it will load a file that's
been<00:03:56.870> previously<00:03:57.319> saved<00:03:58.180> you<00:03:59.180> can<00:03:59.360> save<00:03:59.709> cine

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
been previously saved you can save cine

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:09.440 
been previously saved you can save cine
data

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.440 

so<00:04:10.080> this<00:04:10.379> image<00:04:12.170> right<00:04:13.170> in<00:04:13.349> here<00:04:14.060> and<00:04:15.060> looking

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
so this image right in here and looking

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.379 
so this image right in here and looking
at<00:04:15.599> by<00:04:15.919> previously<00:04:16.919> recorded<00:04:17.220> looking<00:04:18.180> at<00:04:18.299> my

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
at by previously recorded looking at my

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.960 
at by previously recorded looking at my
carotid<00:04:18.690> artery<00:04:19.160> you<00:04:20.160> see<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.459> bifurcation

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
carotid artery you see the bifurcation

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.450 
carotid artery you see the bifurcation
as<00:04:21.239> I<00:04:21.269> move<00:04:21.480> up<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.720> neck<00:04:22.070> as<00:04:23.070> i<00:04:23.100> move<00:04:23.340> back

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
as I move up the neck as i move back

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.260 
as I move up the neck as i move back
down<00:04:23.610> you<00:04:24.000> can<00:04:24.180> see<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.540> artery<00:04:25.110> as<00:04:25.350> it

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
down you can see the artery as it

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.700 
down you can see the artery as it
becomes<00:04:27.270> one<00:04:27.570> again<00:04:27.840> at<00:04:28.139> the<00:04:28.260> connection

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
becomes one again at the connection

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.150 
becomes one again at the connection
point<00:04:29.720> so<00:04:30.720> we<00:04:30.810> have<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:30.990> ability<00:04:31.320> to<00:04:31.350> save<00:04:31.800> and

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
point so we have the ability to save and

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.820 
point so we have the ability to save and
display<00:04:32.790> laughter<00:04:33.389> the<00:04:33.510> fact<00:04:33.680> images<00:04:34.680> we<00:04:34.800> have

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
display laughter the fact images we have

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.700 
display laughter the fact images we have
full<00:04:35.100> gain<00:04:35.250> control<00:04:35.669> I<00:04:35.960> damage<00:04:36.960> control<00:04:37.320> with

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
full gain control I damage control with

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:45.250 
full gain control I damage control with
this<00:04:38.520> system<00:04:40.790> we<00:04:41.790> also<00:04:41.970> have<00:04:43.280> as<00:04:44.280> I<00:04:44.880> mentioned

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
this system we also have as I mentioned

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.020 
this system we also have as I mentioned
this<00:04:46.260> other<00:04:46.470> phone<00:04:47.750> again<00:04:48.750> we<00:04:48.930> can<00:04:49.880> run<00:04:50.880> the

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
this other phone again we can run the

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.460 
this other phone again we can run the
application<00:04:51.180> this<00:04:51.810> is<00:04:51.870> now<00:04:52.169> actually<00:04:52.440> a

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
application this is now actually a

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
application this is now actually a
smartphone<00:04:52.889> this<00:04:53.040> doesn't<00:04:53.220> even<00:04:53.310> have<00:04:53.430> a

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
smartphone this doesn't even have a

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.510 
smartphone this doesn't even have a
touchscreen<00:04:54.770> this<00:04:55.770> is<00:04:55.889> just<00:04:56.100> a<00:04:56.190> simple

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
touchscreen this is just a simple

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:03.940 
touchscreen this is just a simple
smartphone<00:05:01.100> press<00:05:02.100> ok<00:05:02.490> and<00:05:02.669> insert<00:05:02.970> my<00:05:03.120> probe

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
smartphone press ok and insert my probe

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:14.090 
smartphone press ok and insert my probe
so<00:05:04.950> I<00:05:05.010> will<00:05:05.160> do<00:05:05.310> that<00:05:10.280> again<00:05:11.280> there<00:05:11.610> is<00:05:12.919> it<00:05:13.919> just

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
so I will do that again there is it just

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.830 
so I will do that again there is it just
has<00:05:14.220> all<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.490> same<00:05:14.639> controls<00:05:15.120> it<00:05:15.419> has<00:05:15.570> to<00:05:15.720> be

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
has all the same controls it has to be

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.210 
has all the same controls it has to be
redone<00:05:16.139> a<00:05:16.200> little<00:05:16.500> bit<00:05:16.620> because<00:05:16.860> of<00:05:17.130> the

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
redone a little bit because of the

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.950 
redone a little bit because of the
interface<00:05:18.139> again<00:05:19.139> no<00:05:19.320> touchscreen<00:05:20.870> get<00:05:21.870> it

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
interface again no touchscreen get it

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:30.680 
interface again no touchscreen get it
scanning<00:05:22.260> here<00:05:24.530> so<00:05:25.530> get<00:05:25.680> it<00:05:25.830> scanning<00:05:29.570> so<00:05:30.570> if<00:05:30.630> I

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
scanning here so get it scanning so if I

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.900 
scanning here so get it scanning so if I
can<00:05:30.840> find<00:05:31.020> those<00:05:32.090> again<00:05:33.090> you<00:05:33.240> can<00:05:33.450> sort<00:05:33.660> of<00:05:33.750> see

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
can find those again you can sort of see

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.070 
can find those again you can sort of see
there's<00:05:35.910> that<00:05:36.000> row<00:05:36.270> of<00:05:36.389> pins<00:05:36.600> right<00:05:36.840> down<00:05:36.990> the

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
there's that row of pins right down the

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.210 
there's that row of pins right down the
middle<00:05:37.110> obviously<00:05:37.560> this<00:05:37.650> is<00:05:37.800> a<00:05:37.830> much<00:05:38.010> smaller

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
middle obviously this is a much smaller

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.629 
middle obviously this is a much smaller
screen<00:05:38.960> so<00:05:39.960> it's<00:05:40.110> much<00:05:40.260> harder<00:05:40.500> for<00:05:41.100> me<00:05:41.610> to

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 
screen so it's much harder for me to

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.100 
screen so it's much harder for me to
give<00:05:42.030> you<00:05:42.120> a<00:05:42.150> good<00:05:42.360> image<00:05:42.600> of<00:05:42.750> it<00:05:42.870> with<00:05:42.990> this

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
give you a good image of it with this

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.620 
give you a good image of it with this
video<00:05:43.410> camera<00:05:43.820> but<00:05:44.820> I<00:05:44.850> think<00:05:45.060> you<00:05:45.150> can<00:05:45.360> see

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
video camera but I think you can see

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.010 
video camera but I think you can see
that<00:05:46.260> we<00:05:46.380> are<00:05:46.410> imaging<00:05:46.889> live<00:05:47.660> with<00:05:48.660> nothing

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
that we are imaging live with nothing

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.800 
that we are imaging live with nothing
more<00:05:49.050> than<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:49.770> probe<00:05:50.360> plugged<00:05:51.360> into<00:05:51.570> the

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
more than the probe plugged into the

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.900 
more than the probe plugged into the
phone<00:05:52.849> put<00:05:53.849> the<00:05:54.000> phone<00:05:54.150> over<00:05:54.330> here<00:05:55.760> it's<00:05:56.760> got

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
phone put the phone over here it's got

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.110 
phone put the phone over here it's got
this<00:05:57.120> big<00:05:57.360> long<00:05:57.539> cable<00:05:58.729> so<00:05:59.729> we<00:05:59.760> could<00:06:00.000> be

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
this big long cable so we could be

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:06.469 
this big long cable so we could be
imaging<00:06:00.389> a<00:06:00.450> patient<00:06:04.639> and<00:06:05.639> there<00:06:05.849> you<00:06:06.300> have<00:06:06.330> the

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
imaging a patient and there you have the

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:15.830 
imaging a patient and there you have the
complete<00:06:06.930> system

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.070 

have<00:06:16.440> a<00:06:16.470> probe

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080
