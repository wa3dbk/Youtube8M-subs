my<00:03:43.760> next<00:03:44.090> feel<00:03:44.989> it's<00:03:45.109> great<00:03:45.370> I'm<00:03:46.370> going<00:03:46.489> to

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
my next feel it's great I'm going to

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.490 
my next feel it's great I'm going to
move<00:03:46.669> on<00:03:46.849> to<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.120> next<00:03:47.269> exercise<00:03:47.780> now<00:03:48.199> and

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
move on to the next exercise now and

00:03:48.500 --> 00:04:22.580 
move on to the next exercise now and
focus<00:03:48.949> on<00:03:49.099> the<00:03:49.190> back<00:03:49.370> my<00:03:49.609> legs<00:03:49.849> the<00:03:50.329> hamstrings

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.310 

that<00:04:23.160> gives<00:04:23.400> me<00:04:23.490> a<00:04:23.610> great<00:04:23.880> peak<00:04:24.330> in<00:04:24.660> the

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
that gives me a great peak in the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.220 
that gives me a great peak in the
housing<00:04:25.710> muscle<00:04:26.100> kind<00:04:26.520> of<00:04:26.580> bicep<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.600> if<00:04:28.110> you

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
housing muscle kind of bicep and if you

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.260 
housing muscle kind of bicep and if you
really<00:04:28.440> want<00:04:28.650> to<00:04:28.740> focus<00:04:28.919> on<00:04:29.340> that<00:04:29.490> extra<00:04:29.970> level

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
really want to focus on that extra level

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.600 
really want to focus on that extra level
of<00:04:30.540> separation<00:04:30.840> between<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:32.130> back<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.340> the

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
of separation between the back and the

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.820 
of separation between the back and the
front<00:04:32.880> keep<00:04:33.750> your<00:04:33.780> knees<00:04:34.110> angled<00:04:34.650> slightly

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
front keep your knees angled slightly

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.250 
front keep your knees angled slightly
outwards<00:04:35.669> and<00:04:36.000> this<00:04:36.150> will<00:04:36.330> focus<00:04:36.570> more<00:04:36.960> of<00:04:37.110> the

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
outwards and this will focus more of the

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.520 
outwards and this will focus more of the
stress<00:04:37.530> clearly<00:04:38.520> on<00:04:38.669> the<00:04:38.760> hamstring<00:04:39.530> it's

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
stress clearly on the hamstring it's

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.870 
stress clearly on the hamstring it's
getting<00:04:40.860> more<00:04:40.980> weight<00:04:41.190> loaded<00:04:41.520> onto<00:04:41.730> the

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
machine that's about all I've got left

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.810 
machine that's about all I've got left
in<00:04:54.600> my<00:04:54.780> hamstrings<00:04:55.229> after<00:04:55.650> that<00:04:56.340> last<00:04:56.550> work

try not to allow the heel to go all the
way<00:05:01.560> down<00:05:01.889> so<00:05:02.610> that<00:05:02.790> you<00:05:02.880> keep<00:05:03.060> some<00:05:03.300> tension

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
way down so that you keep some tension

let's get this machine set up for some

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:25.760 
let's get this machine set up for some
crunches

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:38.490

like<00:05:44.910> the<00:05:45.090> cops<00:05:45.330> are<00:05:45.690> a<00:05:45.750> slow<00:05:46.140> twitch<00:05:46.410> muscle

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
like the cops are a slow twitch muscle

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.430 
like the cops are a slow twitch muscle
fiber<00:05:47.010> so<00:05:47.790> they<00:05:47.970> respond<00:05:48.480> best<00:05:48.780> to<00:05:48.990> high

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
fiber so they respond best to high

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.400 
fiber so they respond best to high
