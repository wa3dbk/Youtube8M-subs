description so check it out pretty

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.570 
description so check it out pretty
interesting<00:00:22.050> but<00:00:22.740> let<00:00:22.949> me<00:00:23.070> tell<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.429> right

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
interesting but let me tell you right

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.349 
interesting but let me tell you right
now<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:23.849> it<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.509> a<00:00:24.660> fake<00:00:25.019> now<00:00:26.150> Sony<00:00:27.150> has

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
now that it is a fake now Sony has

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.779 
now that it is a fake now Sony has
actually<00:00:27.750> said<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.859> not<00:00:28.949> true<00:00:29.339> via

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
actually said that it's not true via

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.050 
actually said that it's not true via
Twitter<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.750> no<00:00:31.410> worries<00:00:31.800> it's<00:00:32.490> not<00:00:32.730> having

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.060 
Twitter so no worries it's not having

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.880 
Twitter so no worries it's not having
any<00:00:33.210> kind<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.540> hardware<00:00:33.840> failures<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.800> was

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
any kind of hardware failures it was

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.520 
any kind of hardware failures it was
most<00:00:35.130> likely<00:00:35.250> photoshopped<00:00:36.210> or<00:00:36.600> something

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
most likely photoshopped or something

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.320 
most likely photoshopped or something
that<00:00:37.650> we<00:00:37.740> just<00:00:37.920> didn't<00:00:38.220> understand<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.060> could

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
that we just didn't understand it could

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.780 
that we just didn't understand it could
be<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:40.230> yes<00:00:40.680> there<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.130> a<00:00:41.160> red<00:00:41.550> light<00:00:41.760> of

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
be that yes there is a red light of

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.720 
be that yes there is a red light of
death<00:00:42.150> but<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:42.660> not<00:00:42.840> really<00:00:43.140> meant<00:00:43.380> for

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
death but it's not really meant for

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.190 
death but it's not really meant for
hardware<00:00:44.730> failure<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.420> meant<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.720> actually

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
hardware failure it's meant to actually

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.770 
hardware failure it's meant to actually
prevent<00:00:46.760> hardware<00:00:47.760> failure<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.390> could<00:00:48.660> be

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
prevent hardware failure it could be

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.200 
prevent hardware failure it could be
something<00:00:49.140> like<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.530> or<00:00:50.040> it<00:00:50.970> could<00:00:51.180> have

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
something like that or it could have

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.050 
something like that or it could have
just<00:00:51.300> been<00:00:51.480> photoshopped<00:00:52.340> now<00:00:53.340> when<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.880> comes

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
just been photoshopped now when it comes

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.930 
just been photoshopped now when it comes
to<00:00:54.270> something<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.160> if<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.730> was

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
to something like this if it was

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.180 
to something like this if it was
photoshopped<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.900> most<00:00:58.140> likely<00:00:58.650> some<00:00:58.920> sort

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
photoshopped it's most likely some sort

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.680 
photoshopped it's most likely some sort
of<00:00:59.280> attack<00:00:59.670> to<00:01:00.770> kind<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.920> destroy<00:01:02.690> PlayStation

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
of attack to kind of destroy PlayStation

and<00:01:07.290> make<00:01:07.380> people<00:01:07.740> back<00:01:07.979> out<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.600> alright

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
and make people back out like alright

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.540 
and make people back out like alright
this<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.870> going<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.110> be<00:01:10.200> another<00:01:10.410> Xbox<00:01:10.950> 360

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
this is going to be another Xbox 360

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.480 
this is going to be another Xbox 360
moment<00:01:11.910> let's<00:01:12.240> not<00:01:12.450> do<00:01:12.690> this<00:01:13.070> that's<00:01:14.070> what

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
moment let's not do this that's what

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.700 
moment let's not do this that's what
some<00:01:14.760> people<00:01:14.790> might<00:01:15.270> try<00:01:15.480> to<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.470> was

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
some people might try to do if that was

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.890 
some people might try to do if that was
the<00:01:16.860> case<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.460> was<00:01:17.670> photoshopped<00:01:18.090> that's

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the case if it was photoshopped that's

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.100 
the case if it was photoshopped that's
probably<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.890> intention<00:01:20.580> I'm<00:01:20.940> pretty<00:01:21.870> damn

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
probably the intention I'm pretty damn

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.720 
probably the intention I'm pretty damn
sure<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.409> nobody<00:01:22.950> would<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.310> do<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.580> as<00:01:23.700> a

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
sure that nobody would just do it as a

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.960 
sure that nobody would just do it as a
joke<00:01:24.000> like<00:01:24.300> hahaha<00:01:24.980> they<00:01:25.980> most<00:01:26.400> likely<00:01:26.700> have

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
joke like hahaha they most likely have

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.120 
joke like hahaha they most likely have
something<00:01:27.390> against<00:01:27.690> Sony<00:01:28.050> and<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.530> console

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
something against Sony and the console

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.780 
something against Sony and the console
itself<00:01:29.490> now<00:01:30.420> if<00:01:31.050> there<00:01:31.710> really<00:01:31.740> was<00:01:32.190> a<00:01:32.550> red

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
itself now if there really was a red

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.730 
itself now if there really was a red
line<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.210> death<00:01:33.420> if<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:34.050> were<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.440> ever<00:01:34.560> happen

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
line of death if it were to ever happen

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.790 
line of death if it were to ever happen
all<00:01:35.430> right<00:01:35.490> anything<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:36.570> it

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
all right anything like it

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.969 
all right anything like it
I<00:01:37.830> don't<00:01:38.820> know<00:01:39.090> if<00:01:39.330> it<00:01:39.479> would<00:01:39.600> necessarily

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
I don't know if it would necessarily

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.399 
I don't know if it would necessarily
destroy<00:01:41.030> PlayStation<00:01:42.030> 4's<00:01:42.450> reputation

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
destroy PlayStation 4's reputation

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.880 
destroy PlayStation 4's reputation
unless<00:01:43.830> it<00:01:44.040> was<00:01:44.190> done<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.760> large<00:01:45.210> scale<00:01:46.170> like

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
unless it was done on a large scale like

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.850 
unless it was done on a large scale like
the<00:01:47.040> red<00:01:47.310> ring<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.940> death<00:01:48.080> which<00:01:49.080> was<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> large

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
the red ring of death which was a large

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.370 
the red ring of death which was a large
scale<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.090> when<00:01:51.780> you're<00:01:51.900> looking<00:01:52.020> at<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
scale so when you're looking at the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.550 
scale so when you're looking at the
PlayStation<00:01:53.010> 4<00:01:53.450> okay<00:01:54.450> even<00:01:55.140> if<00:01:55.260> there<00:01:55.409> are

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
PlayStation 4 okay even if there are

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.190 
PlayStation 4 okay even if there are
some<00:01:55.590> hardware<00:01:56.370> failures<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> very<00:01:57.720> low

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
some hardware failures to a very low

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.039 
some hardware failures to a very low
percentage<00:01:58.970> it's<00:01:59.970> not<00:02:00.299> going<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.630> be<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> big

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
percentage it's not going to be a big

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:01.520 
percentage it's not going to be a big
deal

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
deal

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.109 
deal
it<00:02:01.590> probably<00:02:01.830> won't<00:02:02.130> even<00:02:02.220> make<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.580> news<00:02:02.820> out

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
it probably won't even make the news out
