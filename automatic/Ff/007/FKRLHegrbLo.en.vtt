exactly<00:00:44.120> like<00:00:44.359> this<00:00:44.690> I<00:00:46.120> ran<00:00:47.120> a<00:00:47.420> couple<00:00:47.480> of

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
exactly like this I ran a couple of

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.829 
exactly like this I ran a couple of
guitar<00:00:48.260> licks<00:00:48.589> through<00:00:49.039> a<00:00:49.070> looper<00:00:49.690> set<00:00:50.690> the

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
guitar licks through a looper set the

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:53.770 
guitar licks through a looper set the
loop<00:00:50.989> read<00:00:51.260> about<00:00:51.499> full<00:00:51.920> volume<00:00:52.280> and<00:00:52.730> fired<00:00:53.539> it

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
loop read about full volume and fired it

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.349 
loop read about full volume and fired it
off<00:00:53.929> when<00:00:54.379> recording<00:00:54.710> each<00:00:55.070> clip<00:00:55.460> with<00:00:55.910> each

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 
off when recording each clip with each

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.860 
off when recording each clip with each
speaker<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:57.489> it's<00:00:58.489> pretty<00:00:58.670> dead-on<00:00:59.030> mic

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
speaker so it's pretty dead-on mic

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.200

placement<00:01:00.140> is<00:01:00.589> pretty<00:01:00.859> spot-on<00:01:01.219> so<00:01:01.609> let's<00:01:01.940> do

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
placement is pretty spot-on so let's do
