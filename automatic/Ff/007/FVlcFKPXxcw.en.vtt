I'm showing you guys right now is called
panic<00:00:10.440> attack<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:11.940> map<00:00:12.509> that<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.809> made

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
panic attack and it is a map that I made

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.230 
panic attack and it is a map that I made
and<00:00:13.230> it's<00:00:13.860> actually<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.549> many<00:00:14.790> ways<00:00:14.969> a

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
and it's actually in many ways a

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.720 
and it's actually in many ways a
successor<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.839> my<00:00:16.230> map<00:00:16.410> panic<00:00:16.800> station<00:00:17.369> which

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
successor to my map panic station which

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.939 
successor to my map panic station which
some<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.119> guys<00:00:18.240> may<00:00:18.449> remember<00:00:18.630> from

some of you guys may remember from

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.950 
some of you guys may remember from
shortly<00:00:19.949> after<00:00:20.310> halo<00:00:20.490> 4<00:00:20.760> came<00:00:20.939> out<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.630> also

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
shortly after halo 4 came out it also

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.160 
shortly after halo 4 came out it also
incorporates<00:00:22.699> basically<00:00:23.699> just<00:00:23.880> all<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
incorporates basically just all of the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.529 
incorporates basically just all of the
knowledge<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.369> accumulated<00:00:27.090> from

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
knowledge that I have accumulated from

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.270 
knowledge that I have accumulated from
forging<00:00:29.480> vehicle<00:00:30.679> maps<00:00:31.679> over<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.210> years<00:00:33.450> and

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
forging vehicle maps over the years and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.610 
forging vehicle maps over the years and
basically<00:00:35.280> what<00:00:35.520> panic<00:00:35.850> attack<00:00:36.120> does<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.630> it

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
basically what panic attack does is it

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.060 
basically what panic attack does is it
blends<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.899> competitive<00:00:39.899> arena<00:00:40.110> gameplay<00:00:40.710> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
blends a competitive arena gameplay the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.250 
blends a competitive arena gameplay the
sort<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.370> things<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:42.750> sort<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.020> gameplay

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
sort of things you the sort of gameplay

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.639 
sort of things you the sort of gameplay
you'd<00:00:43.440> see<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.770> map<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.190> mid<00:00:44.550> ship<00:00:44.850> or<00:00:45.649> you

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
you'd see on a map like mid ship or you

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.540 
you'd see on a map like mid ship or you
know<00:00:46.770> something<00:00:48.200> you'd<00:00:49.200> see<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.530> four<00:00:50.190> before

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
know something you'd see in four before

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.020 
know something you'd see in four before
maps<00:00:50.760> typically<00:00:51.239> good<00:00:51.420> ones<00:00:52.370> and<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.640> takes

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
maps typically good ones and it takes

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.299 
maps typically good ones and it takes
that<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.390> blends<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.960> with<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.800> vehicle

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
that and it blends it with a vehicle

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.549 
that and it blends it with a vehicle
gameplay<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.329> sort<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.629> stuff<00:00:58.109> you'd<00:00:58.320> see

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
gameplay and the sort of stuff you'd see

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.400 
gameplay and the sort of stuff you'd see
in<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:59.039> big<00:00:59.520> team<00:00:59.730> map<00:00:59.969> typically<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:01.140> kind<00:01:01.379> of

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
in a big team map typically it kind of

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.880 
in a big team map typically it kind of
breaks<00:01:01.649> down<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.370> barriers<00:01:02.820> there<00:01:03.090> and

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
breaks down the barriers there and

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.800 
breaks down the barriers there and
because<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:05.460> appeal<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.420> large

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
because of that it can appeal to a large

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.600 
because of that it can appeal to a large
audience<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.470> you're<00:01:07.650> more<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.220> big<00:01:08.400> team

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
audience if you're more of a big team

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.030 
audience if you're more of a big team
guy<00:01:09.110> you<00:01:10.110> should<00:01:10.260> feel<00:01:10.409> right<00:01:10.619> at<00:01:10.680> home<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
guy you should feel right at home on the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.560 
guy you should feel right at home on the
map<00:01:11.189> but<00:01:11.310> if<00:01:11.460> you're<00:01:11.640> used<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.090> playing<00:01:12.180> for

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
map but if you're used to playing for

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.270 
map but if you're used to playing for
before<00:01:13.070> arena<00:01:14.070> mass<00:01:14.939> um<00:01:15.560> you<00:01:16.560> know<00:01:16.650> like<00:01:17.040> once

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
before arena mass um you know like once

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.070 
before arena mass um you know like once
we've<00:01:17.490> featured<00:01:17.700> recently<00:01:18.030> like<00:01:18.390> atheists<00:01:18.900> or

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
we've featured recently like atheists or

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.740 
we've featured recently like atheists or
the<00:01:19.259> ark<00:01:19.470> or<00:01:19.710> whatever<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.790> think<00:01:21.420> you'll<00:01:21.570> also

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
the ark or whatever I think you'll also

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.749 
the ark or whatever I think you'll also
feel<00:01:22.500> right<00:01:22.770> at<00:01:22.890> home<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.159> panic<00:01:23.490> attack<00:01:23.729> and

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
feel right at home on panic attack and

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.010 
feel right at home on panic attack and
what's<00:01:23.970> something<00:01:24.240> that's<00:01:24.390> really<00:01:24.630> cool<00:01:24.840> not

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
what's something that's really cool not

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.460 
what's something that's really cool not
it<00:01:25.229> really<00:01:25.259> blends<00:01:25.950> those<00:01:27.049> two<00:01:28.049> different

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
it really blends those two different

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.249 
it really blends those two different
styles<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:29.250> map<00:01:29.790> design<00:01:30.000> together<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.900> that's

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
styles of map design together and that's

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.420 
styles of map design together and that's
something<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.560> hasn't<00:01:31.799> really<00:01:32.009> been<00:01:32.220> done

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
something that hasn't really been done

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.310 
something that hasn't really been done
before<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.939> was<00:01:33.030> something<00:01:33.210> panic<00:01:33.750> stations

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
before that was something panic stations

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.770 
before that was something panic stations
started<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.860> do<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> little<00:01:35.340> bit<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:36.270> ah<00:01:36.540> this

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
started to do a little bit but ah this

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.810 
started to do a little bit but ah this
kind<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.049> takes<00:01:37.290> out<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> next<00:01:37.770> level<00:01:38.159> so

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
kind of takes out to the next level so

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.760 
kind of takes out to the next level so
this<00:01:38.939> map<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.150> inversely<00:01:40.049> symmetrical<00:01:40.650> it's

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
this map is inversely symmetrical it's

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.850 
this map is inversely symmetrical it's
great<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.340> 5v5<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:43.200> also<00:01:43.320> works<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:43.680> you

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
great for 5v5 on it also works for you

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.359 
great for 5v5 on it also works for you
actually<00:01:44.130> for<00:01:44.310> 66<00:01:44.909> games<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:46.320> best<00:01:46.770> for

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
actually for 66 games and it's best for

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.300 
actually for 66 games and it's best for
capture<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.390> flag<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:49.170> also<00:01:49.350> really<00:01:49.860> nice

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
capture the flag it's also really nice

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.510 
capture the flag it's also really nice
for<00:01:50.610> extraction<00:01:51.350> and<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.590> play<00:01:52.740> Slayer

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
for extraction and you can play Slayer

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.330 
for extraction and you can play Slayer
and<00:01:53.729> King<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.030> hell<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.450> as<00:01:54.600> well<00:01:54.780> and

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
and King the hell on it as well and

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.100 
and King the hell on it as well and
basically<00:01:56.340> there's<00:01:56.850> two<00:01:57.090> hogs<00:01:57.329> there's<00:01:57.840> two

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
basically there's two hogs there's two

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.040 
basically there's two hogs there's two
ghosts<00:01:58.560> there's<00:01:59.070> a

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
ghosts there's a

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.850 
ghosts there's a
neutral<00:02:01.010> rocket<00:02:01.400> launcher<00:02:01.760> two<00:02:02.690> snipers<00:02:02.960> you

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
neutral rocket launcher two snipers you

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.540 
neutral rocket launcher two snipers you
know<00:02:03.980> uh<00:02:04.160> and<00:02:05.290> there's<00:02:06.290> just<00:02:06.650> a<00:02:06.830> lot<00:02:07.100> going<00:02:07.160> on

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
know uh and there's just a lot going on

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.760 
know uh and there's just a lot going on
so<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.479> first<00:02:08.780> thing<00:02:08.930> I<00:02:09.140> wanted<00:02:09.350> to<00:02:09.410> do<00:02:09.619> with

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
so the first thing I wanted to do with

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.630 
so the first thing I wanted to do with
this<00:02:09.890> map<00:02:10.130> to<00:02:10.580> kind<00:02:10.790> of<00:02:10.820> start<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.270> balance

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
this map to kind of start to balance

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.310 
this map to kind of start to balance
vehicles<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.760> infantry<00:02:13.880> you<00:02:14.270> know<00:02:14.390> in<00:02:14.600> more

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
vehicles and infantry you know in more

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.620 
vehicles and infantry you know in more
of<00:02:15.410> an<00:02:15.530> arena<00:02:15.860> setting<00:02:16.400> was<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.270> wanted<00:02:17.510> to

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
of an arena setting was I wanted to

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.740 
of an arena setting was I wanted to
create<00:02:17.900> directional<00:02:18.830> flow<00:02:19.040> for<00:02:19.550> vehicles<00:02:20.060> so

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
create directional flow for vehicles so

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.800 
create directional flow for vehicles so
I<00:02:20.780> used<00:02:21.290> um<00:02:21.590> jumps<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:22.730> drop-offs<00:02:23.240> to<00:02:23.570> kind<00:02:23.780> of

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
I used um jumps and drop-offs to kind of

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.260 
I used um jumps and drop-offs to kind of
create<00:02:23.990> this<00:02:24.290> flow<00:02:24.680> where<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.790> know<00:02:25.880> vehicles

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
create this flow where you know vehicles

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.330 
create this flow where you know vehicles
going<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.510> get<00:02:26.690> in<00:02:26.840> this<00:02:26.960> rhythm<00:02:27.350> of<00:02:27.830> driving

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
going to get in this rhythm of driving

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.100 
going to get in this rhythm of driving
around<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:28.610> map<00:02:28.790> going<00:02:29.030> off<00:02:29.270> jump<00:02:29.630> up<00:02:29.930> into

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
around the map going off jump up into

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.320 
around the map going off jump up into
the<00:02:30.260> house<00:02:30.460> dropping<00:02:31.460> down<00:02:31.730> going<00:02:32.120> off<00:02:32.210> the

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
the house dropping down going off the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.750 
the house dropping down going off the
jump<00:02:32.510> again<00:02:32.890> circling<00:02:33.890> back<00:02:34.040> around<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:34.610> then

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
jump again circling back around and then

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.550 
jump again circling back around and then
of<00:02:34.880> course<00:02:34.940> they<00:02:35.210> can<00:02:35.330> cut<00:02:35.510> back<00:02:35.690> through<00:02:36.140> the

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
of course they can cut back through the

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.730 
of course they can cut back through the
top<00:02:37.070> made<00:02:37.310> bridge<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.210> reverse<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:39.530> and

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
top made bridge and reverse that and

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.840 
top made bridge and reverse that and
start<00:02:40.730> over<00:02:40.970> on<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.480> flow<00:02:42.200> pattern<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:43.640> that's

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
start over on the flow pattern so that's

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.160 
start over on the flow pattern so that's
something<00:02:44.210> that's<00:02:44.420> very<00:02:44.510> interesting<00:02:44.810> and

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
something that's very interesting and

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.030 
something that's very interesting and
like<00:02:45.530> on<00:02:45.890> panic<00:02:46.580> station<00:02:46.970> you'll<00:02:47.090> see<00:02:47.300> that

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
like on panic station you'll see that

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.980 
like on panic station you'll see that
almost<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.550> entire<00:02:49.850> map<00:02:50.060> is<00:02:50.240> accessible<00:02:50.780> both

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
almost the entire map is accessible both

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.730 
almost the entire map is accessible both
the<00:02:51.200> infantry<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:51.950> vehicles<00:02:52.460> and<00:02:53.740> that's

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
the infantry and vehicles and that's

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.680 
the infantry and vehicles and that's
just<00:02:55.070> a<00:02:55.250> very<00:02:55.460> interesting<00:02:56.030> dynamic<00:02:56.480> there's

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
just a very interesting dynamic there's

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.390 
just a very interesting dynamic there's
lots<00:02:57.020> of<00:02:57.170> ways<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.470> counter<00:02:57.800> vehicles<00:02:58.220> but

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
lots of ways to counter vehicles but

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.510 
lots of ways to counter vehicles but
they're<00:02:58.640> also<00:02:58.910> extremely<00:02:59.420> important<00:03:00.350> for

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
they're also extremely important for

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.240 
they're also extremely important for
controlling<00:03:01.520> certain<00:03:02.030> areas<00:03:02.390> of<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.690> map<00:03:02.870> and

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
controlling certain areas of the map and

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.000 
controlling certain areas of the map and
getting<00:03:04.250> a<00:03:04.430> good<00:03:05.050> driver<00:03:06.050> gunner<00:03:06.440> combo<00:03:06.860> in

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
getting a good driver gunner combo in

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.760 
getting a good driver gunner combo in
your<00:03:07.130> wart<00:03:07.340> hog<00:03:07.520> is<00:03:07.810> just<00:03:08.810> as<00:03:08.989> important<00:03:09.620> as

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
your wart hog is just as important as

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.720 
your wart hog is just as important as

you know there's a lot of that stuff
going<00:03:18.680> on<00:03:18.770> on<00:03:19.100> this<00:03:19.220> map<00:03:19.430> there's<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:19.700> lot<00:03:19.880> of

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
going on on this map there's a lot of

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.590 
going on on this map there's a lot of
sort<00:03:21.410> of<00:03:21.640> encouragement<00:03:22.640> to<00:03:22.760> play<00:03:22.970> certain

see<00:03:37.820> on<00:03:38.060> any<00:03:38.600> other<00:03:39.140> arena<00:03:39.590> mat<00:03:39.770> so<00:03:40.340> it's<00:03:40.520> very

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
see on any other arena mat so it's very

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.780

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
before mats arena maps and you know

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.330 
before mats arena maps and you know
borders<00:03:56.060> of<00:03:56.090> big<00:03:56.540> team<00:03:56.750> maps<00:03:56.930> and<00:03:57.140> it's<00:03:57.830> it's

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
very unique map

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.209 
very unique map
regard<00:04:01.269> and<00:04:01.569> it's<00:04:02.140> uh<00:04:02.349> there's<00:04:02.799> a<00:04:02.890> ton<00:04:03.189> of

regard and it's uh there's a ton of

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:05.489 
regard and it's uh there's a ton of
stuff<00:04:03.519> going<00:04:03.700> on<00:04:03.930> there's<00:04:04.930> loads<00:04:05.319> of

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:05.499 
stuff going on there's loads of

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:08.699 
stuff going on there's loads of
multi-purpose<00:04:06.069> geometry<00:04:07.079> there's<00:04:08.079> those<00:04:08.349> you

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
multi-purpose geometry there's those you

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.559 
multi-purpose geometry there's those you
know<00:04:08.799> those<00:04:08.829> huge<00:04:09.310> jumps<00:04:09.819> that<00:04:09.939> also<00:04:10.239> break

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
know those huge jumps that also break

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.520 
know those huge jumps that also break
line-of-sight<00:04:11.019> across<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:13.510> courtyards<00:04:14.439> and

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
line-of-sight across the courtyards and

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.020 
line-of-sight across the courtyards and
from<00:04:14.769> the<00:04:14.859> basis<00:04:15.249> there's<00:04:15.430> all<00:04:15.549> this<00:04:15.760> stuff

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
from the basis there's all this stuff

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.539 
from the basis there's all this stuff
going<00:04:16.060> on<00:04:16.329> there<00:04:16.509> loads<00:04:17.049> of<00:04:17.229> jumps<00:04:17.620> most<00:04:18.340> which

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
going on there loads of jumps most which

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.159 
going on there loads of jumps most which
are<00:04:18.729> really<00:04:18.970> easy<00:04:19.150> but<00:04:19.479> a<00:04:19.539> couple<00:04:19.750> of<00:04:19.930> them<00:04:20.109> are

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
are really easy but a couple of them are

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.550 
are really easy but a couple of them are
kind<00:04:20.349> of<00:04:20.380> tricky<00:04:20.769> ah<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:22.150> you<00:04:22.479> know<00:04:22.570> there's<00:04:23.139> a

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
kind of tricky ah and you know there's a

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.140 
kind of tricky ah and you know there's a
lot<00:04:23.650> of<00:04:23.979> interest<00:04:24.460> in<00:04:24.550> things<00:04:24.729> you<00:04:24.910> can<00:04:25.030> do

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
lot of interest in things you can do

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.700 
lot of interest in things you can do
with<00:04:25.240> vehicles<00:04:25.780> that<00:04:25.930> you<00:04:25.990> might<00:04:26.169> not<00:04:26.349> pick<00:04:26.560> up

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
with vehicles that you might not pick up

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.650 
with vehicles that you might not pick up
on<00:04:26.889> right<00:04:27.130> away<00:04:27.160> there's<00:04:27.580> just<00:04:27.759> tons<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.509> tons

on right away there's just tons and tons

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.650 
on right away there's just tons and tons
of<00:04:28.840> stuff<00:04:29.050> going<00:04:29.229> on<00:04:29.520> yeah<00:04:30.520> this<00:04:31.120> is<00:04:31.300> you<00:04:31.570> know

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
of stuff going on yeah this is you know

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.080 
of stuff going on yeah this is you know
one<00:04:31.840> of<00:04:31.870> those<00:04:32.050> maps<00:04:32.349> where<00:04:32.820> you<00:04:33.820> know<00:04:33.910> the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
one of those maps where you know the

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.749 
one of those maps where you know the
design<00:04:34.599> process<00:04:34.840> I<00:04:35.440> took<00:04:36.160> a<00:04:36.340> while<00:04:36.550> like

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 
design process I took a while like

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.810 
design process I took a while like
designed<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.660> map<00:04:37.979> mostly<00:04:38.979> in<00:04:39.250> Sketchup

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
designed the map mostly in Sketchup

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.020 
designed the map mostly in Sketchup
beforehand<00:04:41.280> pulling<00:04:42.280> inspiration<00:04:42.430> from

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
beforehand pulling inspiration from

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.839 
beforehand pulling inspiration from
panic<00:04:43.570> station<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:44.490> you<00:04:45.490> know<00:04:45.580> there<00:04:45.759> was

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
panic station and you know there was

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:47.969 
panic station and you know there was
just<00:04:45.880> a<00:04:46.120> lot<00:04:46.150> of<00:04:46.840> thought<00:04:47.500> that<00:04:47.530> went<00:04:47.919> into

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
just a lot of thought that went into

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.620 
just a lot of thought that went into
this<00:04:48.250> a<00:04:48.310> lot<00:04:48.490> of<00:04:48.639> time<00:04:48.880> building<00:04:49.150> this<00:04:49.449> I've

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
this a lot of time building this I've

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.439 
this a lot of time building this I've
been<00:04:49.750> working<00:04:50.020> on<00:04:50.080> this<00:04:50.199> map<00:04:50.410> for<00:04:50.740> I<00:04:51.419> know<00:04:52.419> I

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
been working on this map for I know I

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.260 
been working on this map for I know I
started<00:04:52.840> this<00:04:52.930> summer<00:04:53.169> basically<00:04:53.979> so<00:04:54.759> uh<00:04:54.789> yeah
