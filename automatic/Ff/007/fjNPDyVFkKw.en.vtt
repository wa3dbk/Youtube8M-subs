00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.630 
environment what's up with that so
there's<00:01:35.290> nothing<00:01:35.440> really<00:01:35.800> built<00:01:36.490> in

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
there's nothing really built in

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.790 
there's nothing really built in
inherently<00:01:37.240> for<00:01:37.510> Macintosh<00:01:37.990> however<00:01:38.530> there

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
inherently for Macintosh however there

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.230 
inherently for Macintosh however there
are<00:01:38.920> a<00:01:38.950> couple<00:01:39.160> of<00:01:39.340> utilities<00:01:39.820> and<00:01:40.000> a<00:01:40.060> couple

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
are a couple of utilities and a couple

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.970 
are a couple of utilities and a couple
resources<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:41.020> I<00:01:41.050> would<00:01:41.290> like<00:01:41.440> to<00:01:41.470> point<00:01:41.830> out

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
resources that I would like to point out

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.410 
resources that I would like to point out
if<00:01:42.790> you<00:01:42.940> go<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:44.250> Brookes<00:01:45.250> Andres<00:01:45.850> has<00:01:46.060> actually

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
if you go to Brookes Andres has actually

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.030 
if you go to Brookes Andres has actually
created<00:01:46.810> a<00:01:46.840> nice<00:01:47.020> little<00:01:47.080> I<00:01:47.560> found<00:01:47.800> a<00:01:47.890> nice

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
created a nice little I found a nice

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.610 
created a nice little I found a nice
little<00:01:48.870> Automator<00:01:49.870> that<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.320> know<00:01:50.410> a<00:01:50.440> little

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
little Automator that you know a little

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.200 
little Automator that you know a little
script<00:01:50.920> that<00:01:51.160> you<00:01:51.460> can<00:01:51.490> just<00:01:51.700> copy<00:01:51.880> and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
script that you can just copy and

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.540 
script that you can just copy and
basically<00:01:52.660> glue<00:01:53.110> into<00:01:53.560> an<00:01:53.740> automated<00:01:54.070> program

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
basically glue into an automated program

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.300 
basically glue into an automated program
or<00:01:54.820> automate<00:01:55.330> or<00:01:55.450> script<00:01:55.810> inside<00:01:56.310> Macintosh

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
or automate or script inside Macintosh

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.530 
or automate or script inside Macintosh
it<00:01:57.430> allows<00:01:57.670> you<00:01:57.790> to<00:01:57.909> be<00:01:58.000> able<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.180> do<00:01:58.300> this<00:01:58.420> so

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
it allows you to be able to do this so

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.690 
it allows you to be able to do this so
that's<00:01:58.630> one<00:01:58.900> way<00:01:59.050> to<00:01:59.080> do<00:01:59.320> it<00:01:59.350> so<00:02:00.100> I<00:02:00.130> encourage

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
that's one way to do it so I encourage

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.040 
that's one way to do it so I encourage
you<00:02:00.820> to<00:02:00.850> take<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.000> look<00:02:01.150> at<00:02:01.300> that<00:02:01.390> here's<00:02:01.690> CBE

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
you to take a look at that here's CBE

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.410 
you to take a look at that here's CBE
URL<00:02:02.650> for<00:02:02.920> his<00:02:03.159> website<00:02:03.790> you<00:02:03.909> can<00:02:04.030> take<00:02:04.180> a<00:02:04.210> look

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
at that nice little a tutorial he's also

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.830 
at that nice little a tutorial he's also
got<00:02:06.640> a<00:02:06.670> screencast<00:02:07.150> that<00:02:07.300> goes<00:02:07.420> along<00:02:07.540> with<00:02:07.659> it

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
got a screencast that goes along with it

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.419 
got a screencast that goes along with it
to<00:02:08.050> shows<00:02:08.229> you<00:02:08.350> step-by-step<00:02:08.619> how<00:02:09.039> to<00:02:09.069> do<00:02:09.280> that

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
to shows you step-by-step how to do that

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.969 
to shows you step-by-step how to do that
so<00:02:09.640> take<00:02:09.819> a<00:02:09.850> look<00:02:10.060> at<00:02:10.119> what<00:02:10.270> Brooks<00:02:10.479> is<00:02:10.600> done

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
so take a look at what Brooks is done

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.610 
so take a look at what Brooks is done
the<00:02:11.610> other<00:02:11.760> thing<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.209> can<00:02:12.330> do<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.750> one

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
the other thing that you can do is one

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.830 
the other thing that you can do is one
utility<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:14.160> like<00:02:14.520> is<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:15.269> I<00:02:15.300> use<00:02:15.480> quite<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.780> bit

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
utility I like is that I use quite a bit

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.949 
utility I like is that I use quite a bit
is<00:02:16.110> something<00:02:16.500> called<00:02:16.769> backdrop<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:18.810> can

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
is something called backdrop and you can

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.770 
is something called backdrop and you can
go<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.160> John<00:02:20.160> Heaney<00:02:20.430> site<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.000> basically

go to John Heaney site and basically

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.660 
go to John Heaney site and basically
this<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.560> URL<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.069> you<00:02:23.250> would<00:02:23.489> use<00:02:23.640> to

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
goes away but here's what that's

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.610 
goes away but here's what that's
actually<00:02:51.660> doing<00:02:51.900> what<00:02:52.049> it's<00:02:52.200> doing<00:02:52.260> is

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
actually doing what it's doing is

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.130 
actually doing what it's doing is
actually<00:02:52.799> putting<00:02:53.220> an<00:02:53.310> image<00:02:53.610> file<00:02:53.880> as<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.480> wide

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.860 
actually putting an image file as a wide
window<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:55.950> what<00:02:56.760> that's<00:02:56.880> actually<00:02:57.360> doing<00:02:57.690> is

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
window so what that's actually doing is

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.370 
window so what that's actually doing is
it's<00:02:58.079> putting<00:02:58.349> a<00:02:58.739> layer<00:02:59.700> a<00:03:00.060> via<00:03:00.450> an<00:03:01.019> image

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
it's putting a layer a via an image

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.050 
it's putting a layer a via an image
layer<00:03:01.590> on<00:03:01.829> top<00:03:02.069> of<00:03:02.280> anything<00:03:02.579> else<00:03:02.849> that<00:03:02.970> you

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
layer on top of anything else that you

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.120 
layer on top of anything else that you
might<00:03:03.180> have<00:03:03.329> going<00:03:03.690> on<00:03:03.930> in<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.620> same<00:03:04.829> manner

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
might have going on in the same manner
