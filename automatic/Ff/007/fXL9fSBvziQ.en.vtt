00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the chainsaw up I used a screw n outlet

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.330 
the chainsaw up I used a screw n outlet
on<00:00:30.359> one<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.990> sockets<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.949> motion

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
sensing light routed it around the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:47.060 
sensing light routed it around the
window<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.920> back<00:00:41.670> up<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> chainsaw<00:00:46.070> I've

window and back up to the chainsaw I've

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.180 
window and back up to the chainsaw I've
removed<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.640> chainsaw<00:00:48.180> blade<00:00:48.739> you<00:00:49.739> could<00:00:49.950> use

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
removed the chainsaw blade you could use

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.060 
removed the chainsaw blade you could use
a<00:00:50.219> skill<00:00:50.670> saw<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.270> remove<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.809> blade<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
a skill saw and remove the blade the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.139 
a skill saw and remove the blade the
effect<00:00:53.460> would<00:00:53.640> probably<00:00:54.000> be<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.270> same

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
effect would probably be the same

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.330 
effect would probably be the same
they<00:00:57.149> used<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.629> red<00:00:57.840> light<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.710> use<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> black

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
they used a red light and use a black

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.520 
they used a red light and use a black
light<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.329> either<00:01:00.480> take<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> regular<00:01:01.079> bulb

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
light you can either take a regular bulb

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.549 
light you can either take a regular bulb
and<00:01:01.800> paint<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.879> but<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.870> want<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.290> have

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
and paint it but you want it to have

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.750 
and paint it but you want it to have
very<00:01:04.830> low<00:01:05.070> light<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.729> more<00:01:06.000> effective

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
very low light it's more effective

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.140 
very low light it's more effective
reduce<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.200> motion<00:01:10.200> sensor<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.890> very<00:01:11.490> low<00:01:11.760> so

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
reduce the motion sensor to very low so

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.539 
reduce the motion sensor to very low so
it<00:01:12.270> trips<00:01:12.600> right<00:01:13.020> at<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.320> last<00:01:13.530> moment

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.640 

this<00:01:19.549> is<00:01:19.640> a<00:01:19.729> very<00:01:19.970> easy<00:01:20.240> Halloween<00:01:21.020> process

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
this is a very easy Halloween process

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.880 
this is a very easy Halloween process
though<00:01:21.830> together<00:01:22.250> very<00:01:23.000> effective<00:01:23.630> if<00:01:24.560> it's

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
though together very effective if it's

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.800 
though together very effective if it's
positioned<00:01:25.520> in<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.760> right<00:01:25.940> location

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
positioned in the right location

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.330 
positioned in the right location
I<00:01:26.840> had<00:01:27.350> my<00:01:27.530> position<00:01:28.340> right<00:01:28.610> by<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:28.880> door<00:01:29.299> and

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
I had my position right by the door and

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.789 
I had my position right by the door and
it<00:01:31.340> works<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.970> best<00:01:32.240> if<00:01:32.810> there's<00:01:33.170> very<00:01:33.500> little

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
it works the best if there's very little

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.440 
it works the best if there's very little
light<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:36.350> videos<00:01:36.710> of<00:01:36.979> it<00:01:37.100> being<00:01:37.340> active<00:01:37.880> are

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
light the videos of it being active are

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.719 
light the videos of it being active are
very<00:01:39.050> low<00:01:39.290> light<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.890> camera<00:01:40.250> didn't<00:01:40.490> pick<00:01:40.700> it

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
very low light the camera didn't pick it

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.270 
very low light the camera didn't pick it
up<00:01:40.909> very<00:01:41.180> well
