00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
perk to increase in if you just sort of

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.289 
perk to increase in if you just sort of
like<00:01:20.960> sneak<00:01:21.960> around<00:01:22.850> towns<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.060> stuff<00:01:24.210> you

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
like sneak around towns and stuff you

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.120 
like sneak around towns and stuff you
just<00:01:24.329> go<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.659> sneak<00:01:24.899> in<00:01:25.079> towns<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.920> can

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
just go and sneak in towns and it can

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.959 
just go and sneak in towns and it can
increase<00:01:26.399> but<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.789> increases<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.420> slowly<00:01:27.869> that

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
increase but it increases so slowly that

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.700 
increase but it increases so slowly that
it's<00:01:29.969> not<00:01:30.270> really<00:01:30.630> but<00:01:30.840> effective<00:01:31.350> now<00:01:31.530> if

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
it's not really but effective now if

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.859

you're going to play as an archer it's a
lot<00:01:34.049> easier<00:01:34.079> because<00:01:34.679> then<00:01:35.069> you<00:01:35.520> can<00:01:35.670> get

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
lot easier because then you can get

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.520 
lot easier because then you can get
sneak<00:01:36.090> attacks<00:01:36.390> from<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.569> long<00:01:36.749> distance<00:01:36.960> and

sneak attacks from a long distance and

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.149 
sneak attacks from a long distance and
you<00:01:37.710> never<00:01:38.009> really<00:01:38.310> seemed<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.579> notice<00:01:40.159> you

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
you never really seemed to notice you

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.730 
you never really seemed to notice you
know<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:42.179> get<00:01:42.539> a<00:01:42.600> lot<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.810> perking<00:01:43.259> increases

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
know you get a lot of perking increases

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.380 
know you get a lot of perking increases
and<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.399> don't<00:01:44.609> you<00:01:44.819> never<00:01:44.909> get<00:01:45.090> found

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
and you don't you never get found

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.319 
and you don't you never get found
because<00:01:45.569> you're<00:01:45.810> at<00:01:45.869> such<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> long<00:01:46.259> distance

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
because you're at such a long distance

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.230 
because you're at such a long distance
but<00:01:48.329> for<00:01:49.009> daggers<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.219> assassins<00:01:50.850> it's<00:01:51.090> a

depth I think it's apprentice though so
it's<00:02:50.780> not<00:02:51.019> going<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.319> increase<00:02:51.650> it<00:02:52.030> hugely<00:02:53.030> but

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
it's not going to increase it hugely but

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.210 
it's not going to increase it hugely but

really powerful for they are so yeah I
just<00:03:48.349> had<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.500> sort<00:03:48.799> of<00:03:48.889> sit<00:03:49.190> back<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.879> wait

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
just had to sort of sit back and wait

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.119 
just had to sort of sit back and wait
for<00:03:50.480> his<00:03:50.569> health<00:03:51.199> recharge<00:03:51.680> which<00:03:51.829> is<00:03:51.980> useful

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
for his health recharge which is useful

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.430 
for his health recharge which is useful
because<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.579> I<00:03:52.609> got<00:03:52.790> to<00:03:52.940> span<00:03:53.299> the<00:03:53.660> air<00:03:54.260> the

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
because and I got to span the air the

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.659 
because and I got to span the air the
muffled<00:03:54.769> spell<00:03:55.010> so<00:03:55.629> he<00:03:56.629> really<00:03:56.810> didn't<00:03:57.139> matter

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:57.669 
muffled spell so he really didn't matter

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:01.390
