 to the big screen they are doing 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.570
 trying to make the film at the cinema 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.300
 such a good thing 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.280
 hunter gates bridge director vigil 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.739
 who has arrived with agreement with warner 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.899
 to end the tradition 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.399
 adaptation in live action of the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.309
 popular video game series created by 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.619
 scott lawson says daily 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.750
 it's a feeling online because playing 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.180
 with restaurants here I've called from 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.820
 freddy fat pizza where an animatronic 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.110
 or that is part of the band and such thing 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.000
 we have already seen that in the post 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.649
 previous that they put a long time ago and such 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.860
 thing and good says that they basically go 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:26.159
 that when writing the script with tyler 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.770
 burton smith road reads on this occasion the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.860
 that says the ring movie and the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.929
 godzilla in which they wrote 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.759
 producing the mincemeat set grade 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.069
 what did abraham lincoln hunter of 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.170
 vampires to light and this time they are 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:41.130
 doing several various things here the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.470
 they are already agreeing 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.909
 everyone is the post is in the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.039
 description that you want to read it 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.080
 with more detail and all that good 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.330
 here we can see some tweets from the video 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.610
 of the fact on this occasion they are already 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.289
 asking a lot of bill who have to 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.560
 about the movie on this occasion by the 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:01.319
 that is going to write the script and good you 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.810
 they ask that please tell him that 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.149
 please do not ruin the story define is 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.640
 afraid the players or the fans want 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.020
 see something that follows the path or the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.170
 his story 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.420
 or not the channel here says it's a 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.250
 great fan of the fine tailor says that the 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.380
 story is awesome and such a thing and 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.200
 scott of being a great person 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.750
 for today great person with big mind 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.180
 to be able to create something like that and one 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.730
 another great tweet that reveals the channel 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.320
 that this is a picture of what it would be like 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.750
 are doing I think the skeleton 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.940
 something like we will already know teaching 3 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.470
 there in the skeletons from within 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.260
 the animatronics in this case want 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.970
 make it real and such a thing here is a photo 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.680
 basically what they want to do or what 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.060
 what they are doing is not just 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.180
 making the movie is healthy to take 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.520
 a whole year maybe until April 2016 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.470
 maybe I do not know, I calculate that 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.360
 there he will take out the film I do not know but 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.580
 here they are asking you when 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.620
 reveal the photo they tell you if it's going to be 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.870
 the real laser animatronics or van 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.470
 to be nothing more with the animation of segi 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.900
 and in this case you continue as an animation 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.810
 that looks really realistic that 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.400
 it really is not real but it looks 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.890
 whole realistic 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.239
 this time he says it 's real real 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.670
 real that is basically going to be 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.799
 really cool things that look like 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.900
 real then this case is designing 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.730
 in animatronic as in discrete and such 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.400
 thing and an ok another video tweet the 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.290
 fact that says a guy that please 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.329
 can include scott cause like the 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.370
 phone type because many fans 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.650
 they want to see that in the movie he says 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.510
 yes and with a phone we can 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.209
 remember fiction phone then 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.920
 tells him that if they are likely to go to 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.720
 want to put scholes down to participate 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.159
 in his own movie other than that I think 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.739
 that he is going to write and such a thing is going to 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.780
 send warner bros so I told them 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.200
 as vice how is it going ready and not the 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.000
 shit without him, that is if we tell each other 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.700
 they are going to shit seriously that tells us a 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.250
 tweet here that how much has been 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.670
 involved hides in the movie and 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.430
 then the channel replies that he did 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.409
 a promise to scott in which I want it 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.700
 really involve in the movie be 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:10.500
 that will be involved in the 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.970
 movie can be that in the script and 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.889
 it may be that the type of the phone 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.769
 because you are going to love them I will quote 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.880
 as in the movie hear Scott causes a 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.160
 speaking as a type 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.450
 the phone I'm going to shit on everything but 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.070
 probably for taking it out they're going to 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.680
 translate and such thing take it 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.360
 as if that voice is latin america and good 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.070
 I'm going to try to see you in English in 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.250
 the movie the web truth to listen 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.420
 to scott it's going to be great, well, well 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.830
 this has been all kid just to 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.350
 teach him some tweets that are 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.960
 important and you know if such a thing 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.790
 which is very very confirmed the 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.710
 movie apparently they are doing it in 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.570
 this moment they are doing it with good 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.340
 With much effort the truth is but no 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.230
 the truth shit but if Scott goes to 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.090
 be involved because I think that I do not know 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.250
 is going to tell you I want such a thing 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.200
 it goes to the best realistic best and such a thing 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.090
 because it is condensed that is its own the 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.530
 own creator of fainÃ¡ those laws in 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.810
 this time I think it's not going to 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.460
 shit if he gets involved and such thing as 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.200
 type of phone is going to be generating a 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.140
 great role in history or in the 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.940
 movie rather then well this has 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.350
 been all guys then in the video of 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.060

 I reported and well the post is also in 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.300
