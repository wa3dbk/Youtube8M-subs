00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.370
 hi girls so today I 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.089
 will tell you about the fabulous oil 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.760
 coconut 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.769
 so these moments I advance a lot 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.540
 but the best oil in the world by 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.670
 the fact that she is the only one to penetrate 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.490
 the hair fiber 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.820
 So you found her so under 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.109
 solid form what makes you go 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.480
 having to soak it in water 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.220
 hot to very hot for liquefied and 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.369
 then at room temperature for voice 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.009
 solidify so know that this is the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.340
 only oil that is composed of 50% 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.280
 of boric acid which is in affinity so 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.600
 with the hair proteins of 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.340
 hair so that connect them together 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.719
 so that's it for those so I did 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.160
 little notes because otherwise I do not 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.610
 do not leave me at all with what I have to 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.539
 tell you 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.030
 so the targeting that is able to 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.610
 penetrate the inside of the hair and therefore 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.059
 its effects are seen to be very long 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.070
 term 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.890
 so know that one night the classic 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.860
 she's going to go shine will feed 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.170
 your hair and then to wash and a 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.240
 day later by washing the hair 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.830
 box still slightly oily on drying 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.900
 can be still and a day more 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.390
 later you will no longer benefit from 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.290
 positive points of another city that 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.270
 you will use 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.380
 so know that this one has effects 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.390
 on the long term 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.080
 so here's for those so she 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.869
 softens and strengthens the hair so 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.939
 then a very, very good point 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.360
 about fragile hair and 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.970
 brittle 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.280
 it prevents the cuticle so the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.590
 wrap the hair to straighten up 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.280
 so what makes it that makes them 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.689
 much less brittle and fragile it 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.610
 very very good point also for 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.350
 hot curling girls who have small 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.320
 frizz that prevents 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.659
 to curl in wet weather this is for 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.110
 these I look if I have no other 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.670
 things to say about it ah yes 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.830
 also so the hair that is 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.570
 porous and discolored so are the 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.490
 hair that benefits the most because 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.100
 it's those are the hair that have them 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.259
 the most need in quotation marks for 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.759
 repair a maximum of repair them between 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.100
 quotation marks because damaged hair does not 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.230
 can be repaired but dirty but 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.370
 really in good shape and in good shape 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.290
 in better health and also about it 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.480
 you can use it before and after 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.120
 shampoo but its effect its effectiveness 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.950
 however, is better before 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.730
 shampoo because it prevents water from 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.980
 to enter the in the fiber in the 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.840
 hair fiber 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.150
 so here is their proposal that I you 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.010
 said so the cuticle does not lift 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.830
 not and therefore it makes them less brittle 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.630
 and fragile to brushing especially if you 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.450
 are not very gentle with your hair 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.380
 so really it's the only oil 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.540
 plant to see its benefits and 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.490
 it's great I'm not very 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.530
 a few months ago and that's 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.360
 true that since I use I 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.180
 notes a difference with respect to 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.070
 other good guides alone but this being 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.290
 says that I still use others well 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.790
 obviously but when I need to 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.070
 to make a good big bath of oil I hesitate 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.930
 not on coconut oil which besides 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.050
 is half and I'm going to end up 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.130
 buy because really the beautiful 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.330
 so do not be fooled 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:20.310
 really take a 100% coconut oil 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.120
 plant and virgin and first 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.290
 cold pressure 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.989
 if possible organic and 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.150
 you will not be disappointed so 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.829
 So much for those latter therefore do Haro mazen 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.359
 not say anymore on his own website 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.790
 he just says she's emollient and 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.650
 protective so she is working for 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.719
 also to restore brilliant cv gore to 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.090
 hair but she's a lot more than 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:43.790
 that and a lot more than what they say and 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.680
 it has been proven on many 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.829
 testers elsewhere on the net that 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:53.840
 go around a lot and know that it was 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:57.650
 also proven so I do not know 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.670
 how do you usually say I 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.069
 mean there are so many people 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.489
 who talk about it is this obvious 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.049
 and that's what I really mean to you 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.819
 really recommend it even for a 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.439
 basic for an essential to have 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.750
 at home it's really something to 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:14.419
 to have it's really a lot of 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.740
 everything so that's about this oil 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:18.020
 who is really 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.370
 beautiful you see I'm doing 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.440
 really lodges but it's true that 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.570
 it's been a few months that I use is 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.840
 embarrassed I noticed a clear difference 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.360
 so about touching my hair 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.710
 so even the following days until 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.070
 next shampoo he was really 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:37.280
 very sweet unraveling bright full of 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.280
 health of vigor that's I mean 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.630
 when I was doing another oil bath 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.920
 my hair was fine during one or 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.780
 two days and right after 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.430
 it was not so good I will not say 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.040
 that they were super dry etc 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.250
 but immediately he was a little less 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.660
 sweet I felt less like that and of 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.040
 even you will find that when you 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.900
 make a bath of oil when you go 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.150
 rinse your hair long coconut stones 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.070
 your hair will be based on already 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.920
 melee and know that coconut oil 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.390
 so to the property of smoothing the fiber 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.340
 capillary so if you wish to have 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.200
 more or less smooth hair ved 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.410
 know that it is a very very good 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.180
 oil this topic so that's it for this little 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.950
 topo so I hope you enjoyed it 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.000
 and that will have made you think through 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.840
 compared to the oil bath 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.200
 know then that it is the only one to 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.750
 contain loric acids and so here 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.610
 this is a small subject so I hope that 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.200
 it will please you and then I tell you 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.950
 very soon for the next video 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.950
 Hi girls
