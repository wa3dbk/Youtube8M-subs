00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.430
 hard rock star was and one 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.250
 thick blonde girlfriend named 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.960
 madonna had the Japanese 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.940
 Developers had at the original 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.890
 development of sonic thought the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.690
 little blue hedgehog as quite a 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.260
 badboy represent problem at the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.690
 whole thing 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.920
 sega of america found this design 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.480
 somehow not so youthful 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.969
 compatible and has it simple 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.289
 changed times and published that 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.449
 In Japan, in turn, has ever 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.760
 I do not like the marketing boss 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.100
 from sega extra to japan have fly 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.320
 let that explain that may 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.909
 was not a very nice meeting but 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.390
 one has managed to prevail 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.979
 and explain to the japanese why 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.270
 rockstars because they are not alcohol women 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.850
 maybe not the best 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.259
 image for a children are healing 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.080
 on youtube there is actually one 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.810
 super super interesting documentation 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.920
 About seeger and sonic I link 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.210
 see you below in the description 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.170
 you should absolutely look at each other 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.799
 Highly recommended the next meeting 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.869
 is quite tough in the year 2007 has 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.350
 Sony at a press event for God of 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.509
 was 2 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.299
 not only naked women but had 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.280
 also sacrificed a goat where is that 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.259
 is not really fun that was part of one 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.090
 challenge for the press people the one 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.600
 playstation 3 on this event win 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.570
 could 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.490
 That's what a lot of challenges are 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.290
 strong as a jungle camp at midday 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.659
 eat and snake aside 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.460
 find room to find keys and so but that 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.860
 May be a best part of the whole story 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.509
 that actually sacrificed a goat 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.950
 was and the press people to 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.930
 her hand was invited 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.239
 in the still warm body of the dead 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.019
 goals to be stuck around the interior of the 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.400
 stomach eating was no fun from sony 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.500
 the following in the official 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.290
 playstation magazine verwurstet there was 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.599
 then lots of pictures with dead goats 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.370
 and in-house unprocessed in this 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.780
 magazine landed and sent to the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.250
 subscribers have already been sent 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.890
 before that giant screams 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.150
 happened and never said so 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.980
 we would have to call that you prefer 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.420
 quickly back again exists 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.370
 Pictures of it in the internet I'll show you 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.900
 just a pixelated thing because that is 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.630
 really tough tobak 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.160
 as far as I know sony has since no 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.660
 Goats are more sacrificed to press events 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.660
 there is always stress between nintendo 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.450
 and sega you all know he tetris that 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.920
 is a brand of nintendo you knew 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.290
 that for the sega mega drive 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.019
 Actual tetris gave it though 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.810
 never landed in stores because 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.400
 nintendo sega has sued that is called it 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.769
 There are still about ten today 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.840
 well-known examples of tetris on the 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.920
 sega mega drive keeps on coming up 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.139
 ebay are to be found 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.630
 In 2007 , a lucky auctioned off 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:15.840
 Couple for as many as 11,000 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.579
 dollar a copy of tetris and has 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.340
 four years later, it actually started 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.079
 ebay offered for a million dollars 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.079
 Well, I mean, there is the signature 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:27.060
 the offender developer on it but one 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.310
 million dollars that's not so 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.930
 unfortunately he did not sell much either 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.840
 get there were some interested parties the 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.970
 have offered up to 30,000 pounds so 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.170
 far as I know, but for one 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.190
 he has the thing million in freising 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.560
 not get sold 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.269
 Nevertheless, tetris applies to the sega mega 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.500
 drive as one of the rarest games 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.500
 which one can own as a collector 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.960
 ok i have to admit i have you 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.850
 lied there is not only always mute 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.140
 between tempo and sega have the 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.420
 actually worked together sometimes 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.820
 namely on a cache system called 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.980
 There are triforce in places right there 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.650
 Cool apps like this one 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.840
 donkey kong banana kingdom and so far 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.760
 I know it's a star fox too 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.120
 given for the triforce system 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.650
 to have 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.720
 which of you is not necessarily the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.390
 opportunity to fly to japan around 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.340
 there in the enjoyment of the try for space 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.810
 systems to come and play like mario 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.010
 kart agp or f zero mx to play the 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.540
 should times on the internet a bit 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.670
 investigate because there is probably 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.950
 allegedly possibilities on the whole 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.450
 the wii to get started like that 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.780
 I can not tell you but 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:36.400
 I am sure you will find that yourself 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.990
 We'll stay out of here right away 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.370
 batteries and are thus at the last 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.230
 gamestreamer this week I am 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.050
 actually your help needs on the 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.990
 Sockets of some neogeo mvs boards 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.300
 are under the bios chip pentagrams 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.040
 The joke is I have none 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.780
 I know why I have been very long 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.610
 but actually does research nothing 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.830
 There are always times to find out 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.690
 again follow posts on the internet where 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.730
 People have discovered that their old 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.860
 kate automaten cleaned the 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.180
 have removed bios chip and this 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.310
 pentagram discovered there and me 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.770
 just thought what if that one of you 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.870
 find out why there pentagrams 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.920
 then I send him 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.690
 a pack of cookies promised that was 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.670
 it for this week with the gamestreamer 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.200
 Unfortunately there will be no next week 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.000
 given as you may in the 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.280
 background have already seen work 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.630
 I just come to the hot shots 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.470
 you can get up there next week 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.060

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.830
 there will be and I look forward to everyone 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.090

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.460
 on my facebook channel over 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.470
 I inform you then regularly 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.270
 about when the new sequel gamestreamer

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.910
