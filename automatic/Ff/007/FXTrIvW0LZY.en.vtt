and<00:00:05.189> the<00:00:05.279> first<00:00:05.459> thing<00:00:05.609> you'll<00:00:05.850> notice<00:00:05.970> about

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
and the first thing you'll notice about

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.450 
and the first thing you'll notice about
these<00:00:06.479> cases<00:00:06.870> it<00:00:07.019> has<00:00:07.049> ventilation<00:00:07.710> ports<00:00:08.280> all

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
these cases it has ventilation ports all

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.190 
these cases it has ventilation ports all
on<00:00:08.639> this<00:00:08.789> side<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.389> you<00:00:09.480> can<00:00:09.629> see<00:00:09.780> they<00:00:09.959> pretty

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
on this side and you can see they pretty

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.140 
on this side and you can see they pretty
much<00:00:10.289> barring<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:11.039> couple<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.369> inches<00:00:11.519> or<00:00:11.940> an

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
much barring a couple of inches or an

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.090 
much barring a couple of inches or an
inch<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.840> goes<00:00:13.109> from<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.529> back<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:13.949> case

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:14.100 
inch it goes from the back of the case

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.799 
inch it goes from the back of the case
to<00:00:14.279> the<00:00:14.369> front<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.730> case<00:00:14.910> I'll<00:00:15.359> see<00:00:15.570> this

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
to the front of the case I'll see this

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:16.970 
to the front of the case I'll see this
side<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.139> going<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.320> be<00:00:16.410> where<00:00:16.560> your<00:00:16.650> graphics

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
side is going to be where your graphics

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.019 
side is going to be where your graphics
cards<00:00:17.250> are<00:00:17.340> installed<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:17.760> it's<00:00:17.880> going<00:00:17.970> to

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
cards are installed so it's going to

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.090 
cards are installed so it's going to
give<00:00:18.180> fantastic<00:00:18.439> cooling<00:00:19.439> properties<00:00:19.710> and

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
give fantastic cooling properties and

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.489 
give fantastic cooling properties and
ventilation<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.449> side<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.869> case<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:22.499 
ventilation to that side of the case the

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:24.649 
ventilation to that side of the case the
other<00:00:22.619> side<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.130> very<00:00:23.550> similar<00:00:23.909> apart<00:00:24.509> from

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:24.659 
other side is very similar apart from

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:26.089 
other side is very similar apart from
instead<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.109> having<00:00:25.259> ventilation<00:00:25.890> holes

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
instead of having ventilation holes

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.710 
instead of having ventilation holes
going<00:00:26.339> all<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.579> way<00:00:26.669> along<00:00:27.089> it's<00:00:27.449> actually

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
going all the way along it's actually

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.999 
going all the way along it's actually
split<00:00:27.929> into<00:00:28.079> two<00:00:28.230> sections<00:00:28.499> so<00:00:28.800> we've<00:00:28.919> got

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
split into two sections so we've got

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.489 
split into two sections so we've got
some<00:00:29.220> over<00:00:29.460> here<00:00:29.489> and<00:00:29.789> some<00:00:30.599> over<00:00:30.810> here<00:00:30.839> now

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:31.499 
some over here and some over here now

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:33.770 
some over here and some over here now
the<00:00:31.919> actual<00:00:32.160> area<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:33.000> these<00:00:33.180> are<00:00:33.360> based<00:00:33.570> in

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
the actual area that these are based in

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.930 
the actual area that these are based in
this<00:00:34.170> will<00:00:34.440> help<00:00:34.620> with<00:00:35.010> ventilation<00:00:35.579> around

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
this will help with ventilation around

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.030 
this will help with ventilation around
the<00:00:36.060> cpu<00:00:36.630> cooler<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.680> motherboard

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
the cpu cooler and the motherboard

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.190 
the cpu cooler and the motherboard
socket<00:00:38.400> and<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:39.000> one<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.420> actually<00:00:39.690> close<00:00:40.170> to

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
socket and this one is actually close to

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.020 
socket and this one is actually close to
where<00:00:40.560> the<00:00:40.710> hard<00:00:41.280> drives<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> power

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
where the hard drives and the power

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.550 
where the hard drives and the power
supply<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.480> because<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.050> power<00:00:43.230> supply<00:00:43.410> is

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:43.560 
supply is because the power supply is

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.110 
supply is because the power supply is
actually<00:00:43.920> situated<00:00:44.130> at<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.670> front<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.030> this

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
actually situated at the front of this

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.910 
actually situated at the front of this
case<00:00:45.330> and<00:00:45.540> lastly<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.350> will<00:00:46.530> notice<00:00:46.740> that

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
case and lastly you will notice that

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.380 
case and lastly you will notice that
there<00:00:47.250> are<00:00:47.280> ventilation<00:00:47.700> holes<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.360> top

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
there are ventilation holes on top

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.200 
there are ventilation holes on top
because<00:00:48.720> underneath<00:00:49.140> here<00:00:49.470> is<00:00:49.650> a<00:00:49.680> huge<00:00:50.220> 180

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
because underneath here is a huge 180

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.540 
because underneath here is a huge 180
millimeter<00:00:51.750> fan<00:00:52.080> so<00:00:52.560> it<00:00:52.830> is<00:00:52.860> essential<00:00:53.490> to

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
millimeter fan so it is essential to

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.220 
millimeter fan so it is essential to
have<00:00:53.700> ventilation<00:00:54.030> all<00:00:54.540> around<00:00:54.900> this<00:00:55.020> case

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
have ventilation all around this case

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.630 
have ventilation all around this case
because<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.650> is<00:00:55.740> quite<00:00:55.950> small<00:00:56.100> form<00:00:56.580> factor

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
because it is quite small form factor

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.270 
because it is quite small form factor
and<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.630> fact<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:57.960> sort<00:00:58.560> of<00:00:58.590> heat<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.040> going

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
and the fact that sort of heat is going

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.490 
and the fact that sort of heat is going
to<00:00:59.400> be<00:00:59.490> quite<00:00:59.910> problem<00:01:00.270> with<00:01:00.390> any<00:01:00.630> case<00:01:01.290> from

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
to be quite problem with any case from

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.470 
to be quite problem with any case from
any<00:01:01.650> manufacturer<00:01:02.130> of<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.520> size<00:01:02.730> now<00:01:03.150> taking

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
any manufacturer of this size now taking

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.700 
any manufacturer of this size now taking
a<00:01:03.510> look<00:01:03.630> at<00:01:03.720> the<00:01:03.810> front<00:01:03.990> of<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.229> case<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.559> can

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
a look at the front of the case we can

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.319 
a look at the front of the case we can
see<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.100> straight<00:01:05.610> away<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.850> has<00:01:05.939> some<00:01:06.150> very

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:06.329 
see that straight away it has some very

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:08.179 
see that straight away it has some very
unique<00:01:06.540> design<00:01:07.049> on<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.229> I've<00:01:07.710> always<00:01:07.920> been<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
unique design on it I've always been a

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.410 
unique design on it I've always been a
bit<00:01:08.340> weirded<00:01:08.610> out<00:01:08.700> by<00:01:08.880> small<00:01:09.150> form-factor

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
bit weirded out by small form-factor

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.300 
bit weirded out by small form-factor
cases<00:01:10.020> because<00:01:10.260> they<00:01:10.409> don't<00:01:10.620> look<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:10.800> your

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
cases because they don't look like your

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.680 
cases because they don't look like your
normal<00:01:11.460> computer<00:01:11.970> case<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.300> it<00:01:12.330> was<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.540> that

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
normal computer case so it was like that

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.630 
normal computer case so it was like that
microwaves<00:01:13.230> or<00:01:13.530> something<00:01:14.220> that's<00:01:14.310> not<00:01:14.610> a

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
microwaves or something that's not a

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.460 
microwaves or something that's not a
computer<00:01:14.940> case<00:01:15.270> but<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.540> one<00:01:15.750> does<00:01:16.230> look

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
computer case but this one does look

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.890 
computer case but this one does look
quite<00:01:17.070> nice<00:01:17.250> indeed<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.090> CEO<00:01:18.300> this<00:01:18.570> side<00:01:18.780> that

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
quite nice indeed and CEO this side that

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.200 
quite nice indeed and CEO this side that

thing to notice is there's a switch over

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.660 
thing to notice is there's a switch over
here<00:01:36.210> for<00:01:36.479> l<00:01:36.659> +<00:01:36.960> 8<00:01:37.530> which<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:37.830> for<00:01:38.130> low<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.460> high

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
here for l + 8 which is for low and high

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.000 
here for l + 8 which is for low and high
which<00:01:39.150> does<00:01:39.540> correspond<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.260> 180

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
which does correspond to the 180

which<00:03:01.770> is<00:03:01.980> just<00:03:02.130> three<00:03:02.460> screws<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:02.910> will

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
which is just three screws you will

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.280 
which is just three screws you will

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
case is the fan on top because generally

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.860 
case is the fan on top because generally
with<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.770> case<00:04:23.010> you'd<00:04:23.220> expect<00:04:23.610> 80<00:04:23.789> mil<00:04:24.120> 92

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870

underneath the 180 millimeter fan which
has<00:04:39.310> got<00:04:39.760> a<00:04:39.820> controller<00:04:40.240> on<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:40.540> back<00:04:40.720> so<00:04:41.020> you

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
has got a controller on the back so you

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.290 
has got a controller on the back so you
can<00:04:41.290> do<00:04:41.470> it<00:04:41.530> from<00:04:41.680> low<00:04:42.070> speed<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:42.820> high<00:04:43.030> speed

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
can do it from low speed to high speed

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.360 
can do it from low speed to high speed
and<00:04:43.480> I've<00:04:44.170> gotta<00:04:44.470> admit<00:04:44.710> it<00:04:44.920> looks<00:04:44.950> absolutely

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
and I've gotta admit it looks absolutely

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.160 
and I've gotta admit it looks absolutely
huge<00:04:46.180> but<00:04:46.390> it<00:04:46.480> is<00:04:46.570> going<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:46.870> be<00:04:46.990> very

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
huge but it is going to be very

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.020 
huge but it is going to be very
beneficial<00:04:47.650> in<00:04:48.190> curling<00:04:48.550> because<00:04:48.790> it's<00:04:48.910> going

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
beneficial in curling because it's going

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.000 
beneficial in curling because it's going
to<00:04:49.120> push<00:04:49.270> all<00:04:49.540> of<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:50.020> cold<00:04:50.440> air<00:04:50.620> that<00:04:50.770> it<00:04:50.860> gets

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
to push all of the cold air that it gets

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.760 
to push all of the cold air that it gets
in<00:04:51.220> from<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.490> top<00:04:51.520> down<00:04:51.960> onto<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.200> majority

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
in from the top down onto the majority

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.380 
in from the top down onto the majority
of<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:53.920> components<00:04:54.430> just<00:04:54.970> next<00:04:55.210> door<00:04:55.300> where
