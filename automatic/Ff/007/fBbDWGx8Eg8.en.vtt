I'm just going to apply the polish to
the<00:03:39.650> bottom<00:03:40.310> stars<00:03:40.609> rather<00:03:41.150> than<00:03:41.329> use<00:03:41.510> the

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
the bottom stars rather than use the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.110 
the bottom stars rather than use the
large<00:03:41.959> one<00:03:42.230> that's<00:03:42.440> all<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.680> way<00:03:42.739> at<00:03:42.829> the<00:03:42.889> top

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
large one that's all the way at the top

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.789 
large one that's all the way at the top
and<00:03:44.120> just<00:03:44.239> pick<00:03:44.569> it<00:03:44.600> up<00:03:44.780> with<00:03:44.900> my<00:03:45.079> small<00:03:45.139> end<00:03:45.709> of

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
and just pick it up with my small end of

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.710 
and just pick it up with my small end of
the<00:03:45.860> Stamper<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.549> then<00:03:47.120> I'm<00:03:47.209> going<00:03:47.390> to<00:03:47.480> just

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
the Stamper and then I'm going to just

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.590 
the Stamper and then I'm going to just
place<00:03:47.900> those<00:03:49.120> along<00:03:50.120> that<00:03:50.360> outer<00:03:50.659> edge

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
place those along that outer edge

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.350 
place those along that outer edge
see<00:03:52.560> that<00:03:52.740> that<00:03:53.400> fills<00:03:53.640> that<00:03:53.850> in<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.060> little<00:03:54.210> bit

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
see that that fills that in a little bit

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.840 
see that that fills that in a little bit
nicely<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.410> might<00:03:55.890> even<00:03:56.220> add<00:03:56.430> a<00:03:56.460> little<00:03:56.640> on<00:03:56.820> the

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
nicely I might even add a little on the

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.640 
nicely I might even add a little on the
tips<00:03:57.180> or<00:03:57.330> whatever<00:03:57.540> but<00:03:57.840> anyway<00:03:58.200> so<00:03:58.260> you<00:03:58.470> can

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
tips or whatever but anyway so you can

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.760 
tips or whatever but anyway so you can
do<00:03:58.770> that<00:03:58.980> then<00:03:59.630> when<00:04:00.630> i<00:04:00.660> do<00:04:00.780> my<00:04:00.900> thumb<00:04:01.440> i

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
do that then when i do my thumb i

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.430 
do that then when i do my thumb i
actually<00:04:02.280> want<00:04:02.610> to<00:04:02.730> do<00:04:03.000> two<00:04:03.420> sets<00:04:03.720> of<00:04:03.930> stars

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
actually want to do two sets of stars

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.520 
actually want to do two sets of stars
just<00:04:04.830> because<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.340> thumb<00:04:05.520> is<00:04:05.700> so<00:04:05.820> much<00:04:05.970> wider

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
just because the thumb is so much wider

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.920 
just because the thumb is so much wider
so<00:04:07.530> i'll<00:04:07.620> just<00:04:07.680> show<00:04:08.640> you<00:04:08.670> while<00:04:09.360> I've<00:04:09.540> got<00:04:09.780> it

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
I'm going to include a still photo of

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:23.870 
I'm going to include a still photo of

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
the patil color version of this see

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.180 
the patil color version of this see
there<00:04:24.540> we<00:04:24.810> go<00:04:24.930> that<00:04:25.380> looks<00:04:25.410> much<00:04:25.740> better<00:04:25.920> that

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
there we go that looks much better that

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.300 
there we go that looks much better that
way<00:04:27.440> so<00:04:28.440> let<00:04:28.590> me<00:04:28.620> clean<00:04:28.860> up<00:04:28.890> around<00:04:29.100> my

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
way so let me clean up around my

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.890 
way so let me clean up around my
cuticles<00:04:29.790> and<00:04:29.940> add<00:04:30.120> some<00:04:30.270> top<00:04:30.480> coat<00:04:30.510> so<00:04:30.810> you

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
cuticles and add some top coat so you

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.980 
cuticles and add some top coat so you
can<00:04:31.050> see<00:04:31.230> how<00:04:31.350> it<00:04:31.380> looks<00:04:32.030> ok<00:04:33.030> I<00:04:33.240> had<00:04:33.600> just<00:04:33.840> done

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
can see how it looks ok I had just done

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.260 
can see how it looks ok I had just done
some<00:04:34.830> top<00:04:35.010> coat<00:04:35.040> on<00:04:35.370> these<00:04:35.550> two<00:04:35.760> nails<00:04:35.970> here

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
some top coat on these two nails here

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.880 
some top coat on these two nails here
and<00:04:36.480> it<00:04:36.630> just<00:04:36.660> is<00:04:36.990> such<00:04:37.200> a<00:04:37.230> significant

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
and it just is such a significant

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.200 
and it just is such a significant
difference<00:04:38.190> in<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.430> way<00:04:38.520> that<00:04:38.670> it<00:04:38.790> looks<00:04:38.820> I

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
difference in the way that it looks I

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.540 
difference in the way that it looks I
wanted<00:04:39.540> to<00:04:39.630> show<00:04:39.840> you<00:04:40.010> see<00:04:41.010> that<00:04:41.220> how<00:04:41.490> the

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
wanted to show you see that how the

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.640 
wanted to show you see that how the
pinky<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.360> my<00:04:42.480> ring<00:04:42.690> finger<00:04:42.840> are<00:04:43.230> just<00:04:43.470> like

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
pinky and my ring finger are just like

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.850 
pinky and my ring finger are just like
super<00:04:44.160> shiny<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:44.760> then<00:04:45.720> these<00:04:45.930> are<00:04:45.990> much<00:04:46.620> more

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
super shiny and then these are much more

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.490 
super shiny and then these are much more
matte<00:04:47.160> it<00:04:48.150> just<00:04:48.540> shows<00:04:48.720> you<00:04:48.900> that<00:04:48.930> first<00:04:49.350> of

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
matte it just shows you that first of

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.080 
matte it just shows you that first of
all<00:04:49.590> it<00:04:49.710> doesn't<00:04:49.770> matter<00:04:50.190> if<00:04:50.400> the<00:04:50.610> polish<00:04:50.940> is

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
all it doesn't matter if the polish is

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.550 
all it doesn't matter if the polish is
mat<00:04:51.270> underneath<00:04:51.570> because<00:04:51.870> once<00:04:52.140> you<00:04:52.230> get<00:04:52.380> top

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
mat underneath because once you get top

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.610 
mat underneath because once you get top
coat<00:04:52.800> on<00:04:52.920> it<00:04:52.950> it's<00:04:53.550> very<00:04:53.790> shiny<00:04:54.380> but<00:04:55.380> it<00:04:55.470> also

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
coat on it it's very shiny but it also

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.230 
coat on it it's very shiny but it also
is<00:04:55.770> two<00:04:56.040> completely<00:04:56.430> different<00:04:56.790> looks<00:04:56.820> so

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
is two completely different looks so

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.910

plop some top coat on there it's just
such<00:05:04.440> a<00:05:04.470> it<00:05:04.800> actually<00:05:05.220> just<00:05:05.630> lightens<00:05:06.630> up<00:05:06.780> the

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
such a it actually just lightens up the

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.200 
such a it actually just lightens up the
colors<00:05:07.320> and<00:05:07.560> makes<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:07.890> dark<00:05:08.100> look<00:05:08.310> even<00:05:08.640> the

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
colors and makes the dark look even the

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.200 
colors and makes the dark look even the
black<00:05:09.390> look<00:05:09.660> even<00:05:09.930> richer<00:05:10.320> it<00:05:10.620> just<00:05:10.970> looks<00:05:11.970> so

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
black look even richer it just looks so
