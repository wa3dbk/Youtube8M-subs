00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
to be my review on the valise protein

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.589 
to be my review on the valise protein
skimmer<00:00:04.680> I<00:00:06.140> I<00:00:07.460> just<00:00:08.460> had<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.670> do<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.820> video<00:00:09.090> on<00:00:09.540> it

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
skimmer I I just had to do a video on it

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.690 
skimmer I I just had to do a video on it
because<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:10.080> see<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.860> whole<00:00:11.190> lot<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.340> reviews

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
because I see a whole lot of reviews

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.049 
because I see a whole lot of reviews
online<00:00:11.940> for<00:00:12.330> this<00:00:12.389> thing<00:00:12.630> but<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.230> don't<00:00:13.620> see

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
online for this thing but I don't see

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.769 
online for this thing but I don't see
except<00:00:15.059> for<00:00:15.210> one<00:00:15.450> video<00:00:17.180> review<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.390> this

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
except for one video review on this

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.689 
except for one video review on this
thing<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.289> thought<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.890> would<00:00:20.130> least<00:00:20.490> make<00:00:20.670> it

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
thing so I thought I would least make it

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.349 
thing so I thought I would least make it
to<00:00:20.850> now<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.810> step<00:00:22.020> one<00:00:22.320> first<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.400> all<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:24.090> is

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
to now in step one first of all this is

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.200 
to now in step one first of all this is
protein<00:00:24.779> skimmer<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.980> very<00:00:26.369> affordable

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.450 

this<00:00:30.210> medium<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.840> ready<00:00:31.140> for<00:00:31.320> 50<00:00:31.800> gallons<00:00:32.250> and

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
this medium is ready for 50 gallons and

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.270 
this medium is ready for 50 gallons and
my<00:00:32.640> tank<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.120> at<00:00:33.300> 55<00:00:34.309> and<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.880> reason<00:00:36.149> why<00:00:36.300> I

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
my tank is at 55 and the reason why I

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.490 
my tank is at 55 and the reason why I
got<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> medium<00:00:38.960> instead<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.079> large<00:00:40.320> because

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
got a medium instead of a large because

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.709 
got a medium instead of a large because
it<00:00:40.950> does<00:00:41.219> come<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.550> three<00:00:41.820> sizes<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.390> because

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
it does come in three sizes is because

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.369 
it does come in three sizes is because
of<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.050> lost<00:00:43.290> was<00:00:43.620> rated<00:00:44.129> pretty<00:00:44.910> low<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.600> I

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
of the lost was rated pretty low so I

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.360 
of the lost was rated pretty low so I
decided<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.039> know<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.480> go<00:00:48.480> ahead<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.370> go

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
decided you know to go ahead and go

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.750 
decided you know to go ahead and go
ahead<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.940> get<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.149> medium<00:00:52.100> and<00:00:53.100> I'm<00:00:53.399> heading

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
ahead and get the medium and I'm heading

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.840 
ahead and get the medium and I'm heading
out<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.090> couple<00:00:54.239> days<00:00:54.480> now<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:55.520> I<00:00:56.520> tell<00:00:56.730> you

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850

right now this thing I'll do a $90 to to

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.620 
right now this thing I'll do a $90 to to
$300<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.860> protein<00:01:05.489> skimmer<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:06.530> mean<00:01:08.630> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
$300 a protein skimmer I mean the

owe it to this protein skimmer I put

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.210 
owe it to this protein skimmer I put
this<00:02:34.090> way<00:02:34.330> if<00:02:34.630> you<00:02:34.780> have<00:02:34.900> $100<00:02:35.770> and<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:35.980> tried

this way if you have $100 and you tried
to<00:02:36.250> buy<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.610> protein<00:02:37.030> skimmer<00:02:37.360> or<00:02:37.660> $100<00:02:38.410> we're

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
to buy a protein skimmer or $100 we're

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:46.110 
to buy a protein skimmer or $100 we're
not<00:02:39.100> gonna<00:02:39.220> crack<00:02:39.520> it<00:02:40.560> because<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.680> stores<00:02:45.120> the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
not gonna crack it because it stores the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.930 
not gonna crack it because it stores the
lure<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:47.230> push<00:02:48.040> these<00:02:48.160> cameras<00:02:48.519> cost<00:02:48.700> about

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
lure and I push these cameras cost about

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.470 
lure and I push these cameras cost about
$120<00:02:49.930> but<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:50.590> can't<00:02:50.860> find<00:02:51.160> someone<00:02:51.550> for<00:02:51.880> $100

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
$120 but you can't find someone for $100

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.930 
$120 but you can't find someone for $100
but<00:02:52.870> but<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.320> will<00:02:53.590> say<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:53.890> go<00:02:54.280> ahead<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.760> get

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
but but I will say to go ahead and get

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.330 
but but I will say to go ahead and get
this<00:02:55.120> protein<00:02:55.630> skimmer<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.800> saves<00:02:57.069> us<00:02:57.280> some

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
this protein skimmer it saves us some

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.360 
this protein skimmer it saves us some
money<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:58.090> time<00:02:58.900> because<00:02:59.319> this<00:02:59.440> thing<00:02:59.769> can<00:03:00.220> I

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
money and time because this thing can I

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.620 
money and time because this thing can I
do<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.880> 2<00:03:01.090> or<00:03:01.239> $300<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:02.170> protein<00:03:02.590> skimmer<00:03:03.420> if<00:03:04.420> you

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
do a 2 or $300 a protein skimmer if you

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.940 
do a 2 or $300 a protein skimmer if you
have<00:03:04.750> any<00:03:04.930> questions<00:03:05.350> on<00:03:05.500> this<00:03:05.590> protein

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
have any questions on this protein

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.000 
have any questions on this protein
skimmer<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.519> will<00:03:06.790> go<00:03:06.940> ahead<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:07.630> ask<00:03:08.019> an

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
skimmer I will go ahead and ask an

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.320 
skimmer I will go ahead and ask an
answer<00:03:09.489> it<00:03:09.550> to<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:09.880> best<00:03:09.940> of<00:03:10.180> my<00:03:10.239> knowledge

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
answer it to the best of my knowledge

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.470 
answer it to the best of my knowledge
but<00:03:11.140> again<00:03:11.470> this<00:03:12.069> thing<00:03:12.370> is<00:03:12.670> worth<00:03:13.000> every

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
but again this thing is worth every

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.319 
but again this thing is worth every
single<00:03:13.690> penny<00:03:14.790> because<00:03:16.350> if<00:03:17.350> I<00:03:17.620> had<00:03:17.920> it<00:03:18.100> it<00:03:19.060> has

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
single penny because if I had it it has

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:28.240 
single penny because if I had it it has
done<00:03:19.600> its<00:03:19.780> job<00:03:21.299> as<00:03:22.299> you<00:03:22.420> can<00:03:22.570> see

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.119 

and<00:03:29.250> if<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:29.909> have<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:31.760> 100-gallon<00:03:32.760> plus<00:03:33.330> a

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
and if you have a 100-gallon plus a

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.640 
and if you have a 100-gallon plus a
crayon<00:03:35.129> I<00:03:35.340> probably<00:03:35.610> get<00:03:35.819> multiple<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:36.299> these

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
crayon I probably get multiple of these

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.440 
crayon I probably get multiple of these
and<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.769> reason<00:03:38.069> being<00:03:38.190> because<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.940> fit<00:03:39.209> I

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
and the reason being because the fit I

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.680 
and the reason being because the fit I
mean<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:40.830> minion<00:03:41.190> version<00:03:41.580> of<00:03:41.700> this<00:03:41.849> was<00:03:42.599> the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
mean the minion version of this was the

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.979 
mean the minion version of this was the
same<00:03:42.870> thing<00:03:43.019> I<00:03:43.110> got<00:03:43.610> ready<00:03:44.610> to<00:03:44.670> higher<00:03:44.989> than

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
same thing I got ready to higher than

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.259 
same thing I got ready to higher than
the<00:03:46.079> larger<00:03:46.470> ones<00:03:46.769> so<00:03:47.010> if<00:03:47.430> you<00:03:47.579> have<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.819> hundred

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
the larger ones so if you have a hundred

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.180 
the larger ones so if you have a hundred
and<00:03:48.659> twenty<00:03:49.049> gallons<00:03:49.470> I'll<00:03:49.650> probably<00:03:49.920> get

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
and twenty gallons I'll probably get

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.729 
and twenty gallons I'll probably get
about<00:03:50.489> two<00:03:50.819> of<00:03:50.879> these<00:03:53.930> they've<00:03:54.930> got<00:03:55.079> 100<00:03:55.230> a

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
about two of these they've got 100 a

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.550 
about two of these they've got 100 a
guy's<00:03:56.269> three<00:03:57.269> of<00:03:57.420> them<00:03:57.629> or<00:03:57.840> four<00:03:57.870> I'm<00:03:58.260> gonna<00:03:58.440> do

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
guy's three of them or four I'm gonna do

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.069 
guy's three of them or four I'm gonna do
those<00:03:58.739> it's<00:03:59.489> up<00:03:59.609> to<00:03:59.760> you<00:03:59.940> but<00:04:00.390> this<00:04:00.540> thing<00:04:00.810> is
