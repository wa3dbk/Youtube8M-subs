00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.820
 I found myself falling in love with women. 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:10.640
 Oh, this is nothing terrible. At that time, I realized that I am gay. 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.090
 Anna discovered that she was gay after she had been married to her husband for 25 years. 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.680
 I can't enjoy the intimacy with my husband. This makes me feel very difficult to accept. 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.390
 After that we accepted the couple's psychotherapy. Because I don't want to have sexual contact with him. 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.540
 At that time, we had to learn to make love from the beginning. I felt very painful... 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.150
 ...we saw some related videos, but no matter how hard they tried. 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.810
 There is no feeling. 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.400
 In the second year of receiving psychotherapy, I fell in love with our psychiatrist. 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.250
 She is gay, I didn't know it at the time, but she fell in love with her. 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.560
 My whole body reacted like a passionate girl. 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.970
 Ed is married to a bisexual. He discovered this fact after 12 years of marriage. 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.550
 She told me that she loves me as much as her girlfriend. 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.710
 This way she feels she is a complete person. 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.510
 I am very sad when she is not with me, when they are together, but I think, uh... 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.050
 ...still try to adapt. Our family still went on vacation together, but my wife was very unhappy at the time... 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.890
 ... she misses her girlfriend. 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.020
 At that time, I said to her: We are better off divorcing. 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.020
 She was very surprised, I will say that... 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.510
 ...she said: Then I broke up with my girlfriend because I would rather be with you. 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.710
 About a hundred thousand Dutch people discovered that they were actually gays after marriage. 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.100
 The question is, how can a situation like me confess to my husband and children? 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.770
 I have been waiting for a long time because I have no courage to say. In the end, I still said to my husband first. 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.850
 His answer is: You are in menopause, and all this will pass. 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.140
 He won't allow me to say this. I am not allowed to tell my children. 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.870
 But I also said to my husband: Yang, I will always be with you... 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.430
 ...but just like a brother and sister, not a couple in bed, he thinks it is hard to accept. 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.800
 He said: Anna, so I can't do it, I can't do this, you have to leave. 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.410
 Many families whose husbands or wives are gay are silent on this... 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.490
 ... telling the truth is a risk. 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.120
 The job of the Orpheus Foundation is to help such people. 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.800
 There we met people who are similar to ours... 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.900
 ...there we got a lot of support there, and my husband got a lot of help there. 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.660
 Anna eventually divorced her husband. 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.190
 Ed is still with his bisexual wife, although it is difficult. 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:10.660
 All this has dealt a big blow to me. My sleep is very poor and I can't work properly. 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.270
 I also got sick for this and went for help. 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.650
 A social worker introduced me to the Orpheus Foundation. 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.100
 The most important thing for me to go to the foundation's open day is for me... 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.940
 A sense of identity, people there have the same feelings as me, and can understand my situation. 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.680
 This helps me a lot. 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.310
 Although leaving my husband is a very sad thing. But it is also a relief. 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.120
 Because I can finally do it myself. 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.080
 It feels great to be able to be real. 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.310
 Why are you still with her? 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.760
 Because she is my favorite. This is not to say that all this is so easy and adaptable... 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.600
 ...this is my very clear choice. 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.250
 I was very upset when she was not with me, but this way... 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.970
 ...She feels that she is complete, and she is happy that it is good for our relationship. 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.670
 We all think that everyone has found a balance in this way and looks forward to being together.
