individual symbols and this would be 70
70<00:00:47.190> meters<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:48.090> would<00:00:48.180> be<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> straightaway

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
70 meters that would be a straightaway

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.860 
70 meters that would be a straightaway
would<00:00:49.410> be<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> right<00:00:49.860> turn<00:00:50.149> for<00:00:51.149> -<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.690> the

the inside of the corner that could
either<00:01:03.300> damage<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.960> car<00:01:04.170> or<00:01:04.350> cause<00:01:04.559> us<00:01:04.739> to

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
either damage the car or cause us to

just<00:01:07.979> means<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.430> road<00:01:08.640> surface<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.180> know

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
just means that the road surface I know

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.149 
just means that the road surface I know
is<00:01:09.600> going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.960> be<00:01:10.080> fairly<00:01:10.320> consistent<00:01:10.590> all<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
is going to be fairly consistent all the

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.070 
is going to be fairly consistent all the
way<00:01:11.250> through<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.580> corner<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.510> drive

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
way through the corner and I can drive

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.109 
way through the corner and I can drive
too<00:01:13.290> quickly<00:01:13.650> when<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.189> hear<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.580> what<00:01:14.970> does

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
too quickly when you hear this what does

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.320 
too quickly when you hear this what does
it<00:01:15.180> make<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.930> do<00:01:16.549> that's<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.729> difficult<00:01:18.119> thing

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
it make you do that's a difficult thing

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.690 
it make you do that's a difficult thing
that<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.630> lot<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.810> people<00:01:19.049> understand<00:01:19.670> not<00:01:20.670> only

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
that a lot of people understand not only

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.100 
that a lot of people understand not only
are<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.030> hearing<00:01:21.299> these<00:01:21.509> notes<00:01:21.720> but<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:21.930> have

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
are we hearing these notes but we have

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.200 
are we hearing these notes but we have
to<00:01:22.229> analyze<00:01:22.740> what<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> car<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.430> gonna<00:01:23.729> do<00:01:23.939> in

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
to analyze what the car is gonna do in

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.109 
to analyze what the car is gonna do in
every<00:01:24.420> situation<00:01:24.860> because<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.060> a

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
every situation because it's a it's a

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.109 
every situation because it's a it's a
flowing<00:01:27.479> piece<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.200> Road<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:29.119> just

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
flowing piece of Road and that just

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.940 
flowing piece of Road and that just
because<00:01:30.420> it's<00:01:30.570> 70<00:01:30.869> right<00:01:31.049> before<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.590> all

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
because it's 70 right before it all

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.590 
because it's 70 right before it all
determines<00:01:32.490> what's<00:01:32.700> before<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.390> what's

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
determines what's before it and what's

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.510 
determines what's before it and what's
after<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.079> as<00:01:34.200> far<00:01:34.439> as<00:01:34.560> what<00:01:34.770> speed<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.369> take

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
after it as far as what speed I can take

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.069 
after it as far as what speed I can take
it<00:01:35.670> how<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:36.090> attack<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.570> why<00:01:36.810> can't<00:01:36.990> you

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
it how I can attack it why can't you

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.710 
it how I can attack it why can't you
just<00:01:37.140> drive<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.680> stage<00:01:37.860> as<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.130> see<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.720> well

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
just drive the stage as you see it well

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.800 
just drive the stage as you see it well
I<00:01:40.100> I<00:01:41.100> think<00:01:41.520> without<00:01:41.880> notes<00:01:42.299> you'd<00:01:42.570> be<00:01:42.659> about

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
I I think without notes you'd be about

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.410 
I I think without notes you'd be about
30%<00:01:43.560> slower<00:01:43.710> you'd<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.909> be<00:01:45.030> guessing

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
30% slower you'd have to be guessing

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.030 
30% slower you'd have to be guessing
over<00:01:46.350> every<00:01:46.619> corner<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.070> have<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.549> be<00:01:47.670> able<00:01:47.729> to

over every corner you have to be able to
you<00:01:50.040> know<00:01:50.130> have<00:01:50.399> something<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.939> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
you know have something that the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.730 
you know have something that the
co-drivers<00:01:51.570> tell<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.110> then<00:01:52.290> trust<00:01:52.530> it

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
co-drivers tell you and then trust it

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.200 
co-drivers tell you and then trust it
implicitly

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
part of the stage this is what ken Block

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.710 
part of the stage this is what ken Block
has<00:02:02.140> for<00:02:02.440> it<00:02:02.560> which<00:02:02.710> is<00:02:02.830> a<00:02:02.860> 70<00:02:03.820> write<00:02:04.240> for<00:02:04.480> -

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
has for it which is a 70 write for -

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.420 
has for it which is a 70 write for -
don't<00:02:05.170> cut<00:02:05.470> okay

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
don't cut okay

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.070 
don't cut okay
let's<00:02:07.180> have<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.330> look<00:02:07.450> at<00:02:07.540> what<00:02:07.660> you've<00:02:07.780> got<00:02:07.960> in

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
let's have a look at what you've got in

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.530 
let's have a look at what you've got in
your<00:02:08.230> notes<00:02:08.790> see<00:02:09.790> already<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.210> looks<00:02:10.390> very

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
your notes see already it looks very

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.410 
your notes see already it looks very
different<00:02:10.830> tell<00:02:11.830> us<00:02:11.920> what<00:02:12.070> this<00:02:12.220> makes<00:02:13.030> sense

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
different tell us what this makes sense

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.410 
different tell us what this makes sense
first<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.780> all<00:02:13.870> in<00:02:14.200> 100<00:02:14.920> fast<00:02:15.700> ride<00:02:16.030> height

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
first of all in 100 fast ride height

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.560 
first of all in 100 fast ride height
okay<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:18.100> hundred<00:02:18.400> is<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.550> distance<00:02:19.240> the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
okay so hundred is the distance the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.780 
okay so hundred is the distance the
distance<00:02:19.600> yeah<00:02:20.080> then<00:02:21.010> basically<00:02:21.400> because<00:02:21.640> my

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
distance yeah then basically because my

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.270 
distance yeah then basically because my
notes<00:02:22.000> are<00:02:22.330> describing<00:02:23.050> I<00:02:23.410> don't<00:02:23.680> use<00:02:23.800> numeric

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
notes are describing I don't use numeric

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.120 
notes are describing I don't use numeric
notes<00:02:24.490> than<00:02:24.760> some<00:02:24.940> drivers<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.450> use<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.170> that

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
notes than some drivers you use and that

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.590 
notes than some drivers you use and that
actually<00:02:27.580> doesn't<00:02:27.730> matter<00:02:27.850> what<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.240> use<00:02:28.420> as

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
actually doesn't matter what you use as

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.820 
actually doesn't matter what you use as
long<00:02:28.840> as<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.020> understand<00:02:29.410> it<00:02:29.440> yourself<00:02:29.560> it

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
long as you understand it yourself it

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.870 
long as you understand it yourself it
doesn't<00:02:30.010> matter<00:02:30.130> if<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.310> have<00:02:30.340> rabbits<00:02:30.730> or

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
doesn't matter if you have rabbits or

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.670 
doesn't matter if you have rabbits or
horses<00:02:31.150> in<00:02:31.240> your<00:02:31.360> notes<00:02:31.540> as<00:02:32.170> long<00:02:32.380> it's<00:02:32.560> almost

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
horses in your notes as long it's almost

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.170 
horses in your notes as long it's almost
the<00:02:32.860> same<00:02:33.010> but<00:02:33.250> I'm<00:02:33.430> describing

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
the same but I'm describing

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.090 
the same but I'm describing
we've<00:02:34.660> got<00:02:34.840> maritime<00:02:35.200> cuts<00:02:35.500> nothing<00:02:35.950> like

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
we've got maritime cuts nothing like

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.860 
we've got maritime cuts nothing like
that<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.490> just<00:02:36.640> go<00:02:36.970> there<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.210> I<00:02:37.390> see<00:02:37.630> what's

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
that I just go there and I see what's

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.570 
that I just go there and I see what's
coming<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.350> then<00:02:38.470> that's<00:02:38.920> enough<00:02:39.160> there's

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
coming and then that's enough there's

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.240 
coming and then that's enough there's
nothing<00:02:39.910> really<00:02:40.780> hiding<00:02:41.320> there<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.770> don't<00:02:42.100> put

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
nothing really hiding there I don't put

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.160 
nothing really hiding there I don't put
it<00:02:42.340> in<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.490> note<00:02:42.670> it's<00:02:43.060> if<00:02:43.270> I<00:02:43.360> can<00:02:43.390> see<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:43.900> then

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
it in a note it's if I can see it then

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.900 
it in a note it's if I can see it then
for<00:02:44.500> me<00:02:44.620> that's<00:02:44.800> enough<00:02:44.920> explain<00:02:45.550> what<00:02:45.760> this

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
for me that's enough explain what this

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.500 
for me that's enough explain what this
sense<00:02:46.470> for<00:02:47.470> me<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.740> means<00:02:48.160> 100<00:02:48.640> meter<00:02:49.030> and

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
sense for me that means 100 meter and

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:56.040 
sense for me that means 100 meter and
that's<00:02:51.060> right<00:02:52.060> right<00:02:53.040> 130<00:02:54.040> -<00:02:54.490> so<00:02:54.700> that's<00:02:55.090> for

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
that's right right 130 - so that's for

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.830 
that's right right 130 - so that's for
me<00:02:56.230> an<00:02:56.500> anger<00:02:56.890> I<00:02:57.220> use<00:02:57.880> only

me an anger I use only
from<00:02:59.680> 10<00:02:59.920> to<00:03:00.150> 150<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.690> then<00:03:01.810> within<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.170> you

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
from 10 to 150 and then within that you

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.900 
from 10 to 150 and then within that you
have<00:03:02.530> -<00:03:03.099> yeah<00:03:03.819> I<00:03:04.060> have<00:03:04.330> -<00:03:04.780> this<00:03:05.560> Christmas<00:03:06.040> both

have - yeah I have - this Christmas both
so<00:03:07.540> another<00:03:07.870> one<00:03:08.050> okay<00:03:08.800> that<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.700> put<00:03:10.030> in<00:03:10.360> the

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
so another one okay that I put in the

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.140 
so another one okay that I put in the
middle<00:03:10.810> of<00:03:10.900> everything<00:03:11.230> to<00:03:11.530> try<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.550> have<00:03:12.819> as

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
middle of everything to try to have as

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.390 
middle of everything to try to have as
precise<00:03:13.599> notes<00:03:13.870> as<00:03:14.200> possible<00:03:14.560> so<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.220> that's

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
precise notes as possible so and that's

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.660 
precise notes as possible so and that's
all<00:03:15.580> you<00:03:15.940> know<00:03:16.060> every<00:03:16.510> single<00:03:17.280> millisecond<00:03:18.280> is

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
all you know every single millisecond is

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.490 
all you know every single millisecond is
made<00:03:18.910> up<00:03:19.030> with<00:03:19.180> those<00:03:19.300> degrees<00:03:19.709> we<00:03:20.709> have<00:03:20.890> to

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
made up with those degrees we have to

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.020 
made up with those degrees we have to
nowadays<00:03:23.500> you<00:03:23.709> have<00:03:23.739> to<00:03:24.040> be<00:03:24.459> very<00:03:24.640> precise<00:03:25.000> in

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
nowadays you have to be very precise in

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.610 
nowadays you have to be very precise in
the<00:03:25.239> notes<00:03:25.420> because<00:03:25.810> you<00:03:26.140> have<00:03:26.260> only<00:03:26.380> two

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
the notes because you have only two

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.140 
the notes because you have only two
passes<00:03:26.920> in<00:03:27.040> a<00:03:27.099> ratio<00:03:27.280> so<00:03:27.459> it's<00:03:27.580> impossible<00:03:28.030> to

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
passes in a ratio so it's impossible to

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.479 
passes in a ratio so it's impossible to
memorize<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:29.080> stages<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:29.620> so<00:03:29.800> you<00:03:30.160> need<00:03:30.310> to

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
memorize the stages and so you need to

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:37.949 
memorize the stages and so you need to
have<00:03:31.150> very<00:03:31.450> precise<00:03:31.810> notes<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:37.540> that's<00:03:37.750> just

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
have very precise notes and that's just

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.020 
have very precise notes and that's just
one<00:03:38.140> note<00:03:38.410> there<00:03:38.709> can<00:03:38.860> be<00:03:38.980> 15<00:03:39.400> notes<00:03:39.640> on<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:39.819> page

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
one note there can be 15 notes on a page

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.030 
one note there can be 15 notes on a page
and<00:03:40.269> that<00:03:40.390> equates<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:40.810> almost<00:03:40.930> 3,000<00:03:41.860> per

interestingly ken Block had don't cut
obviously<00:04:29.160> there's<00:04:29.940> a<00:04:30.000> massive<00:04:30.240> concrete

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
obviously there's a massive concrete

obviously there's a massive concrete
culvert<00:04:31.170> on<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.380> inside<00:04:31.710> of<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.860> corner<00:04:32.010> so

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
culvert on the inside of the corner so

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.190 
culvert on the inside of the corner so
if<00:04:32.550> you<00:04:32.640> do<00:04:32.820> cut<00:04:33.030> it<00:04:33.150> too<00:04:33.330> much<00:04:33.510> it's<00:04:33.900> crunch

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
if you do cut it too much it's crunch

crash splash but the others don't have

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.420 
crash splash but the others don't have
that<00:04:36.780> because<00:04:37.230> they<00:04:37.410> can<00:04:37.620> see<00:04:37.860> that<00:04:38.250> it's

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
that because they can see that it's

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.520 
that because they can see that it's
there<00:04:38.730> so<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.480> driver<00:04:39.690> can<00:04:39.840> process<00:04:40.260> that

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
there so the driver can process that

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.870 
there so the driver can process that
information<00:04:41.010> before<00:04:41.160> he<00:04:41.400> gets<00:04:41.640> to<00:04:41.790> this

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880
