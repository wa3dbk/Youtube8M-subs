steelix

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.930 
steelix
so<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.409> can<00:02:07.560> set<00:02:07.680> up<00:02:07.710> stealth<00:02:08.129> rocks<00:02:08.399> basically

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
so I can set up stealth rocks basically

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.180 
so I can set up stealth rocks basically
and<00:02:09.209> he<00:02:09.539> goes<00:02:09.690> toxic<00:02:10.200> spikes<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:10.770> he<00:02:11.039> has<00:02:11.160> a

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
and he goes toxic spikes so he has a

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.080 
and he goes toxic spikes so he has a
layer<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.640> them<00:02:11.790> on<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.090> field

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
layer of them on the field

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.030 
layer of them on the field
which<00:02:13.150> is<00:02:13.269> kind<00:02:13.629> of<00:02:13.690> cool<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:13.900> guess<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.920> I'm

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
which is kind of cool I guess so I'm

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.160 
which is kind of cool I guess so I'm
just<00:02:15.160> gonna<00:02:15.280> set<00:02:15.519> up<00:02:15.610> stealth<00:02:16.269> rocks<00:02:16.510> now<00:02:16.720> just

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
to set them up they're pretty useful so

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.960

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.290 
to wheezing and I have to switch I go on
a<00:02:23.890> houndoom<00:02:24.310> figuring<00:02:24.819> he'll<00:02:25.030> either

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
a houndoom figuring he'll either

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.960 
a houndoom figuring he'll either
will-o-wisp<00:02:25.870> or<00:02:26.370> flamethrower<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.640> he<00:02:27.700> does

will-o-wisp or flamethrower and he does

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.789 
will-o-wisp or flamethrower and he does
go<00:02:28.180> flamethrower<00:02:28.720> which<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.019> awesome<00:02:29.680> because

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
go flamethrower which is awesome because

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.800 
go flamethrower which is awesome because
that<00:02:29.950> gives<00:02:30.160> me<00:02:30.220> flash<00:02:30.549> fire<00:02:30.849> so<00:02:31.599> I'm<00:02:31.720> just

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
that gives me flash fire so I'm just

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.240 
that gives me flash fire so I'm just
gonna<00:02:31.900> go<00:02:32.140> for<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.319> flamethrower<00:02:32.769> get<00:02:33.099> the

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
gonna go for the flamethrower get the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.640 
gonna go for the flamethrower get the
free<00:02:33.549> like<00:02:33.879> damage<00:02:34.480> on<00:02:34.660> anything<00:02:34.959> basically

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
free like damage on anything basically

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.100 
free like damage on anything basically
because<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.280> flash<00:02:36.519> fire<00:02:36.849> boost<00:02:37.239> so<00:02:37.870> I<00:02:37.900> go

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
because of the flash fire boost so I go

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.479 
because of the flash fire boost so I go
for<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.349> flamethrower<00:02:38.830> he<00:02:39.069> goes<00:02:39.250> out<00:02:39.370> into

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
for the flamethrower he goes out into

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.210 
for the flamethrower he goes out into
drapion<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:40.480> is<00:02:40.629> going<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.900> be<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.140> KO<00:02:41.590> so

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
drapion and that is going to be a KO so

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.020 
drapion and that is going to be a KO so
that's<00:02:42.459> awesome

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
that's awesome

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.050

on the nez zoom error would have been

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.500 
on the nez zoom error would have been

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
hound doom nice prediction and I see

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.430 
hound doom nice prediction and I see
it's<00:03:00.879> now<00:03:01.030> leftovers<00:03:01.690> not<00:03:01.900> choice<00:03:02.140> banded

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
it's now leftovers not choice banded

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.440 
it's now leftovers not choice banded
like<00:03:02.739> I<00:03:02.829> thought<00:03:03.069> and<00:03:03.310> I'm<00:03:03.400> like<00:03:03.579> oh<00:03:03.760> okay

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
like I thought and I'm like oh okay

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.089 
like I thought and I'm like oh okay
so<00:03:04.840> I<00:03:04.870> go<00:03:05.049> out<00:03:05.170> in<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.319> beginning<00:03:05.440> him<00:03:05.709> now<00:03:05.860> and

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
so I go out in the beginning him now and

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.559 
so I go out in the beginning him now and
now<00:03:06.250> he<00:03:06.310> goes<00:03:06.579> eyes<00:03:06.730> punch<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.299> I<00:03:07.360> make

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
now he goes eyes punch and I make

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.600 
now he goes eyes punch and I make
another<00:03:07.900> pad<00:03:08.260> play<00:03:08.560> I<00:03:08.769> go<00:03:08.950> for<00:03:09.099> the<00:03:09.160> lead<00:03:09.340> sheet

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
another pad play I go for the lead sheet

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.970 
another pad play I go for the lead sheet
thinking<00:03:10.030> he'll<00:03:10.150> switch<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:11.440> I<00:03:11.500> even<00:03:11.620> miss

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
thinking he'll switch and I even miss

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.039 
thinking he'll switch and I even miss
which<00:03:12.190> kind<00:03:12.430> of<00:03:12.489> sucks<00:03:12.819> I<00:03:13.090> might<00:03:13.870> have<00:03:13.959> been

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
which kind of sucks I might have been

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.780 
which kind of sucks I might have been
able<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.319> buy<00:03:14.500> me<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.680> turn<00:03:15.010> with<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.579> leech

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
able to buy me a turn with the leech

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.210 
able to buy me a turn with the leech
seed<00:03:16.030> up<00:03:16.269> but<00:03:16.599> I<00:03:16.629> don't<00:03:16.750> know<00:03:17.019> so<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:17.889> sucks

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
seed up but I don't know so that sucks

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.390

so<00:03:18.549> I'm<00:03:18.910> going<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:19.299> go<00:03:19.510> for<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.250> energy<00:03:21.250> ball

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
so I'm going to go for the energy ball

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.849 
so I'm going to go for the energy ball
now<00:03:21.639> not<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:22.209> like<00:03:22.359> over<00:03:22.660> predict<00:03:23.049> anymore<00:03:23.560> and

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
now not to like over predict anymore and

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.860 
now not to like over predict anymore and
I'm<00:03:24.040> just<00:03:24.190> gonna<00:03:24.370> try<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.700> do<00:03:24.940> damages<00:03:25.569> as<00:03:25.720> you

I'm just gonna try to do damages as you

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.660 
I'm just gonna try to do damages as you
Merrill<00:03:26.230> he<00:03:26.739> goes<00:03:26.920> for<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.190> double<00:03:27.519> edge

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
Merrill he goes for the double edge

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.460 
Merrill he goes for the double edge
which<00:03:27.970> doesn't<00:03:28.389> quite<00:03:28.569> kill<00:03:28.840> me<00:03:28.989> which<00:03:29.349> is

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
which doesn't quite kill me which is

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.379 
which doesn't quite kill me which is
good<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:30.220> just<00:03:30.430> get<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.639> energy<00:03:30.970> ball<00:03:31.150> off

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
good and I just get the energy ball off

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:32.879 
good and I just get the energy ball off
so<00:03:31.660> that's<00:03:31.900> going<00:03:32.170> to<00:03:32.319> hit<00:03:32.410> his<00:03:32.560> as<00:03:32.680> you

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
so that's going to hit his as you

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.069 
so that's going to hit his as you
Merrill<00:03:33.190> down<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.790> pretty<00:03:34.239> low<00:03:34.450> levels<00:03:34.870> which

Merrill down to pretty low levels which
is<00:03:35.230> nice<00:03:35.670> but<00:03:36.670> it<00:03:36.790> doesn't<00:03:37.030> kill<00:03:37.180> him<00:03:37.329> because

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
is nice but it doesn't kill him because

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.059 
is nice but it doesn't kill him because

gonna go out into yes I go on the
Feraligatr<00:03:51.849> I'm<00:03:52.359> just<00:03:52.540> gonna<00:03:52.630> go<00:03:52.810> for<00:03:52.930> the

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
Feraligatr I'm just gonna go for the

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.659 
Feraligatr I'm just gonna go for the
earthquake<00:03:53.530> hoping<00:03:53.859> I<00:03:53.919> can<00:03:53.980> carry<00:03:54.340> this<00:03:54.489> as

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669 
earthquake hoping I can carry this as

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.159 
earthquake hoping I can carry this as
you<00:03:54.819> Merrill<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:55.239> then<00:03:55.389> the<00:03:55.480> most<00:03:55.630> awesome

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
you Merrill and then the most awesome

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.509 
you Merrill and then the most awesome
thing<00:03:56.380> happens<00:03:56.769> to<00:03:56.829> me<00:03:56.889> he<00:03:57.130> switched<00:03:57.340> it<00:03:57.370> down

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
thing happens to me he switched it down

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.479 
thing happens to me he switched it down
to<00:03:57.609> electrode<00:03:58.239> on<00:03:58.510> my<00:03:59.079> earthquake<00:03:59.680> which<00:04:00.370> is

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
to electrode on my earthquake which is

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.729 
to electrode on my earthquake which is
awesome<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.329> guess<00:04:02.109> he<00:04:02.200> was<00:04:02.290> predicting<00:04:02.470> like

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
awesome I guess he was predicting like

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.190 
awesome I guess he was predicting like
dragon<00:04:03.220> dance<00:04:03.430> I<00:04:03.730> don't<00:04:03.910> even<00:04:04.060> know<00:04:04.359> but<00:04:04.630> he

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
dragon dance I don't even know but he

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.569 
dragon dance I don't even know but he
switched<00:04:05.410> onto<00:04:05.590> electrode<00:04:06.130> on<00:04:06.310> my<00:04:06.430> earthquake

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
switched onto electrode on my earthquake

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.640 
switched onto electrode on my earthquake
and<00:04:07.090> that's<00:04:07.239> gonna<00:04:07.450> like<00:04:07.630> completely<00:04:08.319> destroy

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
and that's gonna like completely destroy

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.839 
and that's gonna like completely destroy
it<00:04:08.859> that<00:04:09.099> was<00:04:09.220> like<00:04:09.370> awesome

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
it that was like awesome

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.909 
it that was like awesome
so<00:04:10.359> electrode<00:04:10.870> goes<00:04:11.079> down<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.560> that's<00:04:11.680> pretty

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:11.919 
so electrode goes down and that's pretty

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.970 
so electrode goes down and that's pretty
cool<00:04:12.099> for<00:04:12.310> my<00:04:12.459> Feraligatr<00:04:12.940> um<00:04:13.540> so<00:04:14.530> he<00:04:14.709> goes<00:04:14.829> out

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
cool for my Feraligatr um so he goes out

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.920 
cool for my Feraligatr um so he goes out
into<00:04:15.130> it<00:04:15.280> Torterra<00:04:15.669> now<00:04:15.940> I'm<00:04:16.180> thinking<00:04:16.539> okay<00:04:16.900> I

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
into it Torterra now I'm thinking okay I

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.870 
into it Torterra now I'm thinking okay I
should<00:04:17.380> be<00:04:17.500> able<00:04:17.650> to<00:04:17.709> kill<00:04:17.859> this<00:04:17.950> with<00:04:18.099> ice<00:04:18.250> ice

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
should be able to kill this with ice ice

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.300 
should be able to kill this with ice ice
punch<00:04:19.329> right<00:04:19.660> so<00:04:20.349> I<00:04:20.380> go<00:04:20.650> over<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.889> ice<00:04:21.010> punch

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
punch right so I go over the ice punch

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.409 
punch right so I go over the ice punch
and<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:22.690> thing<00:04:22.990> doesn't<00:04:23.770> die<00:04:24.490> I'm<00:04:25.240> like

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
and the thing doesn't die I'm like

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:26.910 
and the thing doesn't die I'm like
that's<00:04:25.570> x4<00:04:26.169> super<00:04:26.530> effect

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
that's x4 super effect

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.220 
that's x4 super effect
even<00:04:27.100> survives<00:04:27.520> with<00:04:27.880> like<00:04:28.120> just<00:04:28.630> a<00:04:28.720> few<00:04:29.110> hit

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
even survives with like just a few hit

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.080 
even survives with like just a few hit
points<00:04:29.590> and<00:04:29.650> wood<00:04:29.890> hammers<00:04:30.220> me<00:04:30.430> so<00:04:30.640> I<00:04:30.700> lose<00:04:30.940> my

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
points and wood hammers me so I lose my

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.530 
points and wood hammers me so I lose my
Feraligatr<00:04:31.360> and<00:04:31.960> I'm<00:04:32.470> sad<00:04:32.800> so<00:04:33.210> that's<00:04:34.210> not<00:04:34.330> so

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
Feraligatr and I'm sad so that's not so

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.660 
Feraligatr and I'm sad so that's not so
bad<00:04:34.720> though<00:04:34.930> because<00:04:34.960> we<00:04:35.380> both<00:04:35.530> died<00:04:35.800> so<00:04:36.550> at

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
bad though because we both died so at

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.330 
bad though because we both died so at
least<00:04:36.760> like<00:04:37.350> yeah<00:04:38.350> we<00:04:38.530> both<00:04:38.680> died<00:04:38.950> and<00:04:39.220> not

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
least like yeah we both died and not

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.420 
least like yeah we both died and not
just<00:04:39.610> me<00:04:40.020> whatever<00:04:41.020> so<00:04:41.680> I<00:04:41.710> got<00:04:41.920> a<00:04:41.950> Dustbuster

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
just me whatever so I got a Dustbuster

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.340 
just me whatever so I got a Dustbuster
thinking<00:04:43.270> he<00:04:43.450> might<00:04:43.630> go<00:04:43.750> out<00:04:43.870> into<00:04:44.080> a<00:04:44.110> zoo

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
thinking he might go out into a zoo

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.960 
thinking he might go out into a zoo
Merrill<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:44.860> I<00:04:45.010> know<00:04:45.070> dustbusters<00:04:45.730> probably

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
Merrill and I know dustbusters probably

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.430 
Merrill and I know dustbusters probably
my<00:04:46.060> best<00:04:46.240> chance<00:04:46.480> to<00:04:46.600> kill<00:04:46.780> it<00:04:46.900> as<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:47.050> Merrill

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
my best chance to kill it as a Merrill

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.500 
my best chance to kill it as a Merrill
now<00:04:47.590> but<00:04:48.190> he<00:04:48.250> goes<00:04:48.370> down<00:04:48.520> to<00:04:48.670> a<00:04:48.700> wheezing<00:04:49.150> so<00:04:49.480> I

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
now but he goes down to a wheezing so I

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.780 
now but he goes down to a wheezing so I
go<00:04:49.750> out<00:04:49.870> to<00:04:49.990> Typhlosion<00:04:50.290> I'm<00:04:51.160> figuring<00:04:51.670> he's

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
go out to Typhlosion I'm figuring he's

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.580 
go out to Typhlosion I'm figuring he's
gonna<00:04:51.910> flamethrower<00:04:52.630> me<00:04:52.810> again<00:04:53.050> and<00:04:53.200> I<00:04:53.260> resist

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
gonna flamethrower me again and I resist

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.710 
gonna flamethrower me again and I resist
that<00:04:53.770> and<00:04:54.040> not<00:04:54.370> to<00:04:54.490> mention<00:04:54.640> wheezing<00:04:55.360> is

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
that and not to mention wheezing is

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.900 
that and not to mention wheezing is
usually<00:04:56.080> like<00:04:56.230> a<00:04:56.260> physical<00:04:57.160> wall<00:04:57.340> so<00:04:57.760> I'm

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
usually like a physical wall so I'm

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:58.950 
usually like a physical wall so I'm
thinking<00:04:58.240> you<00:04:58.330> know<00:04:58.450> I'll<00:04:58.570> hit<00:04:58.750> it<00:04:58.780> with<00:04:58.870> a

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
thinking you know I'll hit it with a

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.010 
thinking you know I'll hit it with a
special<00:04:59.380> attack<00:04:59.790> which<00:05:00.790> is<00:05:00.910> cool<00:05:01.090> so<00:05:01.810> I'm<00:05:01.930> just

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
special attack which is cool so I'm just

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.390 
special attack which is cool so I'm just
gonna<00:05:02.170> go<00:05:02.290> for<00:05:02.440> the<00:05:02.500> eruption<00:05:02.890> I<00:05:03.040> probably

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
gonna go for the eruption I probably

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.250 
gonna go for the eruption I probably
should<00:05:03.700> have<00:05:03.730> just<00:05:03.820> went<00:05:04.150> for<00:05:04.390> the<00:05:04.480> overheat

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
should have just went for the overheat

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.960 
should have just went for the overheat
but<00:05:05.830> I<00:05:05.860> figure<00:05:06.160> you<00:05:06.190> know<00:05:06.400> if<00:05:06.520> I<00:05:06.580> have<00:05:06.730> to<00:05:06.850> do

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
but I figure you know if I have to do

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.850 
but I figure you know if I have to do
this<00:05:07.150> two<00:05:07.300> times<00:05:07.510> in<00:05:07.690> a<00:05:07.780> row<00:05:07.960> or<00:05:08.200> option<00:05:08.620> might

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
this two times in a row or option might

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.860 
this two times in a row or option might
be<00:05:08.890> stronger<00:05:09.580> but<00:05:10.270> then<00:05:10.630> he<00:05:10.720> just

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
be stronger but then he just

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.180 
be stronger but then he just
flamethrowers<00:05:11.320> me<00:05:11.470> again<00:05:11.710> so<00:05:11.830> I'm<00:05:11.920> at<00:05:12.010> half

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
flamethrowers me again so I'm at half

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.940 
flamethrowers me again so I'm at half
health<00:05:12.430> so<00:05:12.820> that's<00:05:13.300> like<00:05:13.540> 75<00:05:14.230> face<00:05:14.440> power<00:05:14.680> the

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
health so that's like 75 face power the

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.040 
health so that's like 75 face power the
rupture<00:05:15.280> so<00:05:15.610> I<00:05:15.880> don't<00:05:16.420> know<00:05:16.510> I<00:05:16.750> don't<00:05:16.900> know

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
rupture so I don't know I don't know

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.430 
rupture so I don't know I don't know
which<00:05:17.200> was<00:05:17.350> better<00:05:17.530> but<00:05:18.090> eruption<00:05:19.090> or

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
which was better but eruption or

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.930 
which was better but eruption or
overheat<00:05:20.440> doesn't<00:05:20.860> really<00:05:20.980> matter<00:05:21.190> because<00:05:21.700> I

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
overheat doesn't really matter because I

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.480 
overheat doesn't really matter because I
fail<00:05:22.510> to<00:05:22.630> kill<00:05:22.780> it<00:05:22.840> with<00:05:22.900> eruption<00:05:23.410> and<00:05:24.370> he's

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
fail to kill it with eruption and he's

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.310 
fail to kill it with eruption and he's
gonna<00:05:24.700> explode<00:05:25.210> now<00:05:25.510> so<00:05:25.780> that's<00:05:25.960> gonna<00:05:26.140> take

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
gonna explode now so that's gonna take

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.000 
gonna explode now so that's gonna take
down<00:05:26.470> my<00:05:26.710> Typhlosion<00:05:27.160> so<00:05:27.850> that<00:05:28.000> sucks<00:05:28.620> but<00:05:29.620> he

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
down my Typhlosion so that sucks but he

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.070 
down my Typhlosion so that sucks but he
the<00:05:30.250> only<00:05:30.400> Pokemon<00:05:30.760> he<00:05:30.820> has<00:05:30.970> left<00:05:31.330> is<00:05:31.570> a<00:05:31.600> Zoomer

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
the only Pokemon he has left is a Zoomer

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.560 
the only Pokemon he has left is a Zoomer
