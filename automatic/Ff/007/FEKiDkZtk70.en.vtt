some doors for the truck then think

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.249 
some doors for the truck then think
about<00:00:09.450> exactly<00:00:09.990> like<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.139> ones<00:00:10.440> as<00:00:10.860> usual<00:00:11.429> but<00:00:11.820> I

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259 
about exactly like a ones as usual but I

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:18.650 
about exactly like a ones as usual but I
got<00:00:13.259> primitive<00:00:13.679> tools<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:15.949> you<00:00:16.949> know<00:00:17.660> we're

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
got primitive tools and you know we're

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.120 
got primitive tools and you know we're
doing<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.020> man<00:00:19.170> yeah<00:00:20.070> it's<00:00:20.310> got<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> command

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.859 

hitches<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.869> stock<00:00:27.869> door<00:00:28.080> bracket<00:00:29.869> 2-inch

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
hitches to the stock door bracket 2-inch

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.139 
hitches to the stock door bracket 2-inch
square<00:00:31.109> 2<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.309> would<00:00:32.430> match<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.820> bumper

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
square 2 so that would match the bumper

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:42.889 
square 2 so that would match the bumper
I<00:00:38.030> had<00:00:39.030> some<00:00:39.270> different<00:00:39.660> ideas<00:00:41.420> but<00:00:42.420> two<00:00:42.600> cuts

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
I had some different ideas but two cuts

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.740 
I had some different ideas but two cuts
uh<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.649> cut<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.040> tubes<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:44.969> they<00:00:45.239> line<00:00:45.510> up

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
uh to cut the tubes so that they line up

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.720 
uh to cut the tubes so that they line up
man<00:00:46.079> that's<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.469> weird<00:00:46.739> thing<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> tried<00:00:47.610> to

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
man that's a weird thing so I tried to

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:56.090 
man that's a weird thing so I tried to
stick<00:00:47.910> with<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.300> 45<00:00:48.680> and<00:00:53.300> not<00:00:54.300> too<00:00:54.480> bad<00:00:55.100> so

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
stick with just 45 and not too bad so

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.950 
stick with just 45 and not too bad so
we're<00:00:56.219> gonna<00:00:57.530> we're<00:00:58.530> gonna<00:00:58.620> latch<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.960> there's

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
we're gonna we're gonna latch it there's

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.039 
we're gonna we're gonna latch it there's
just<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.379> regular<00:01:01.739> old<00:01:03.229> you<00:01:04.229> know<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:05.840> guess<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
just a regular old you know I guess the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.440 
just a regular old you know I guess the
deadbolt<00:01:07.490> for<00:01:08.490> your<00:01:08.610> door<00:01:08.820> there's<00:01:09.210> gonna

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
deadbolt for your door there's gonna

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.039 
deadbolt for your door there's gonna
slide<00:01:09.689> like<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.049> go<00:01:10.500> into<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:12.920> go<00:01:13.920> into<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
slide like that go into that go into the

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.370 
slide like that go into that go into the
into<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.140> body<00:01:16.380> there<00:01:17.119> I<00:01:18.140> think<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.229> should

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
into the body there I think it should

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.810 
into the body there I think it should
work<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.650> don't<00:01:19.799> think<00:01:19.830> bouncing<00:01:20.400> around<00:01:20.490> a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
work I don't think bouncing around a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.179 
work I don't think bouncing around a
single<00:01:21.380> onion<00:01:22.380> do<00:01:23.390> if<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.840> does<00:01:25.380> end<00:01:25.680> up<00:01:25.860> doing

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
single onion do if it does end up doing

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.940 
single onion do if it does end up doing
that<00:01:26.400> then<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:29.570> know<00:01:30.570> maybe<00:01:30.869> hang<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.560> onto<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
that then I know maybe hang it onto the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.010 
that then I know maybe hang it onto the
inside<00:01:32.460> maybe<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.210> don't<00:01:33.420> know<00:01:33.740> but<00:01:36.020> learning

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
inside maybe I don't know but learning

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.899 
inside maybe I don't know but learning
little<00:01:37.560> by<00:01:37.590> little<00:01:39.290> tack<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.500> first<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.310> then

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
little by little tack it first and then

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.429 
little by little tack it first and then
come<00:01:42.390> back<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.810> do<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.320> again<00:01:44.060> okay<00:01:45.090> don't<00:01:45.840> lay
