00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.700
 how do you actually explain as 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.410
 I saw that my mojito what is made 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.260
 in any turtle helmets 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.360
 beach and ben on your ps4 console has it 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.490
 not market because it was a problem 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.960
 even setting it's not I'm 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.250
 really sorry but now 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.210
 normally it should work 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.630
 so that's it then I'll explain 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.650
 how to connect your headphones 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.420
 normally all turtle helmets 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.150
 beach you have ben here is your helmet 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.610
 already the bulk of the purchase I'm at 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.200
 300 mg no I advise you to buy 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.010
 he frankly he really nice 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.530
 pixels of play face rents very well 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.380
 p2 it's a helmet imagine very well 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.880
 so that's normally you have something 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.909
 like that made a case you can 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:09.020
 change his master mute and all the 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.310
 brothel like that so for them then 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.900
 it's very simple I saw videos in 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.830
 the Americans and there were none in 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.960
 France so now I'm you 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.940
 present well how to do on your 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.670
 console it's very simple when done at 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.710
 start normally you have the red thread 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.479
 and white normally you plug it in 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.630
 do that spell in red and white for this 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:30.710
 they have the ps4 the xbox one and that's it 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.530
 but that and so that's how it is to 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.330
 plug in the small red plugs and 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.430
 white behind your TV that's it without 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.340
 you unplug it you take your key 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.810
 usb and normally that for those who are 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.799
 a little far from peace like me 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.619
 you plug you break you break 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.259
 salah to have both types or 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.090
 normally or Norman they are glued 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.430
 I took scissors you will follow two and 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.960
 cut you in the middle there could pull 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.420
 as much of what you want from both sons 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.060
 so it's really helpful to then for 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.119
 them to make it simple actually you have to 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.759
 just got in the bath the jack plug and the 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.000
 jack in your ps 4 controller you 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.730
 press to place the jack like that 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.220
 and well there is 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.720
 sorry excuse me the usb key for 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.540
 plug in art your console which is 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.569
 just there the usb key in the power supply 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.760
 well here's the people think it's 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.700
 everything I want to show parameters of 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.530
 this case but as parameters for 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.629
 that it works well for it to work 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.879
 better the parameters that to do in 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:38.269

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.640
