00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
sort of made it seem like it was going

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.370 
sort of made it seem like it was going
to<00:00:23.400> be<00:00:23.460> focusing<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:24.029> just<00:00:24.180> one<00:00:24.510> character<00:00:24.990> but

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
to be focusing on just one character but

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.570 
to be focusing on just one character but
no<00:00:25.529> there<00:00:25.710> was<00:00:25.800> actually<00:00:26.070> something<00:00:26.279> much

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
no there was actually something much

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.370

bigger<00:00:26.880> going<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.750> pillar<00:00:27.990> something

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
bigger going on in this pillar something

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.019 
bigger going on in this pillar something
that<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.590> felt<00:00:28.769> like<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.010> creators<00:00:29.910> were

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
that it felt like the creators were

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.339 
that it felt like the creators were
actually<00:00:30.390> putting<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.689> little<00:00:30.869> thought<00:00:31.140> into

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
actually putting a little thought into

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.630 
actually putting a little thought into
it<00:00:31.529> looks<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:31.890> they<00:00:32.009> actually<00:00:32.130> put<00:00:32.489> some

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
it looks like they actually put some

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.970 
it looks like they actually put some
heart<00:00:32.940> into<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.450> filler<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.050> that's<00:00:34.829> not

this<00:01:39.810> really<00:01:40.229> awesome<00:01:40.439> sealing<00:01:41.159> jutsu<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
this really awesome sealing jutsu in the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.609 
this really awesome sealing jutsu in the
past<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.479> apparently<00:01:42.840> Danzo<00:01:43.259> taught<00:01:43.470> him

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
past that apparently Danzo taught him

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.840 
past that apparently Danzo taught him
and<00:01:43.740> apparently<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.130> was<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.460> secret

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
and apparently it was like the secret

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.580 
and apparently it was like the secret
ceiling<00:01:45.210> technique<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.170> foundation

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
ceiling technique that the foundation

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.550 
ceiling technique that the foundation
created<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.810> basically<00:01:48.810> they<00:01:49.110> build<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.470> up

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
created and basically they build it up

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.200 
created and basically they build it up
all<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:49.979> time<00:01:50.189> what<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.640> amounts<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:51.030> is

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
all this time what it amounts to is

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.609 
all this time what it amounts to is
essentially<00:01:51.750> one<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:51.990> sighs<00:01:52.170> techniques

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
essentially one of sighs techniques

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.859 
essentially one of sighs techniques
where<00:01:52.799> he<00:01:52.890> draws<00:01:53.130> an<00:01:53.310> animal<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.750> is

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
where he draws an animal and this is

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.090 
where he draws an animal and this is
like<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> sealing<00:01:55.470> version<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:55.950> and

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
like a sealing version of it and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.709 
like a sealing version of it and
basically<00:01:56.250> he<00:01:56.579> just<00:01:56.610> draws<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.390> big

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
basically he just draws this like big

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.139 
basically he just draws this like big
ass<00:01:57.930> tiger<00:01:58.500> that's<00:01:59.009> able<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.369> grab<00:01:59.640> people<00:02:00.030> and
