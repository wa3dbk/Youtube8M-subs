00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
really easy there's not much of a

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.919 
really easy there's not much of a
strategy<00:00:14.849> just<00:00:15.059> kind<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.299> move<00:00:15.450> back<00:00:15.719> and

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929

Steve<00:00:41.519> Martin's<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.239> ran<00:00:45.050> it's<00:00:46.050> pretty<00:00:46.230> funny

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.520 
that's suggest running man check it out
hilarious<00:01:01.520> it's<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> little<00:01:02.760> old-school<00:01:02.940> but

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
hilarious it's a little old-school but

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.300 
hilarious it's a little old-school but
definitely<00:01:04.530> worth<00:01:04.619> running

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.280 

so<00:01:09.909> I<00:01:09.940> was<00:01:10.060> using<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.330> big<00:01:10.570> gun<00:01:10.780> here<00:01:11.020> on<00:01:11.170> this

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
so I was using the big gun here on this

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.170 
so I was using the big gun here on this
one<00:01:11.530> I<00:01:12.310> thought<00:01:12.670> it<00:01:12.790> would<00:01:12.880> do<00:01:12.940> the<00:01:13.060> most

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
one I thought it would do the most

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.850 
one I thought it would do the most
damage<00:01:13.360> it's<00:01:14.260> really<00:01:14.560> not<00:01:14.680> doing<00:01:14.860> too<00:01:15.130> much

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.620 

so<00:01:18.730> I<00:01:18.790> had<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:18.940> use<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.090> different<00:01:19.180> type<00:01:19.570> of

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
so I had to use a different type of

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.940 
so I had to use a different type of
strategy<00:01:20.230> because<00:01:20.770> it's<00:01:22.680> working<00:01:23.680> out<00:01:23.770> as

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
strategy because it's working out as

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.600 
strategy because it's working out as
well<00:01:24.160> as<00:01:24.310> I<00:01:24.400> hoped<00:01:24.580> it<00:01:24.790> would<00:01:24.820> have<00:01:25.030> been

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.800 

so<00:01:31.180> I<00:01:31.210> let<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:32.490> cutscenes<00:01:33.490> play<00:01:33.790> so<00:01:34.570> you<00:01:34.600> guys

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
so I let the cutscenes play so you guys

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.560 
so I let the cutscenes play so you guys
can<00:01:35.020> see<00:01:35.170> it<00:01:35.260> check<00:01:35.710> it<00:01:35.860> out

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.870 

so<00:01:40.570> yeah<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:42.340> was<00:01:42.460> pretty<00:01:42.549> self-explanatory

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
so yeah it was pretty self-explanatory

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.840 
so yeah it was pretty self-explanatory
just<00:01:43.570> basically<00:01:43.869> hit<00:01:44.110> him<00:01:44.229> in<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.640> spots<00:01:45.640> that

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
just basically hit him in the spots that

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:56.250 
just basically hit him in the spots that
glow

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.160 

on<00:01:57.070> the<00:01:57.250> last

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
on the last

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.760 
on the last
you<00:01:59.650> give<00:01:59.799> you<00:01:59.890> plenty<00:02:00.130> of<00:02:00.250> help<00:02:00.490> too<00:02:00.759> so<00:02:01.770> it's

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
you give you plenty of help too so it's

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:15.380 
you give you plenty of help too so it's
not<00:02:04.710> too<00:02:05.710> terribly<00:02:06.040> tough

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.590 

maybe<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.320> should<00:02:16.470> keep<00:02:16.590> firing<00:02:16.920> away<00:02:17.040> at<00:02:17.160> the

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
maybe I should keep firing away at the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:26.460 
maybe I should keep firing away at the
same<00:02:18.600> spot

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.140 

so<00:02:27.010> usually<00:02:27.160> when<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.460> get<00:02:27.580> to<00:02:27.640> that<00:02:27.730> cutscene

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
so usually when you get to that cutscene

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:36.310 
so usually when you get to that cutscene
or<00:02:28.180> means<00:02:28.660> you're<00:02:28.810> almost<00:02:28.960> done

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.440 

so<00:02:37.320> that<00:02:37.500> part<00:02:37.880> actually<00:02:38.880> cut<00:02:39.060> out<00:02:39.090> on<00:02:39.360> the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
so that part actually cut out on the

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.750 
so that part actually cut out on the
video<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.750> actually<00:02:40.020> died<00:02:40.410> if<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.710> believe<00:02:41.670> it

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
video I actually died if you believe it

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.460 
video I actually died if you believe it
or<00:02:41.820> not<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.600> I<00:02:42.630> went<00:02:42.840> back<00:02:42.990> to<00:02:43.140> using<00:02:43.320> the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
or not so I went back to using the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.590 
or not so I went back to using the
original<00:02:44.250> pistol<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:46.680> was<00:02:46.770> probably<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.070> best

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
original pistol it was probably the best

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.190 
original pistol it was probably the best
weapon<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.630> use<00:02:48.840> on<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:50.450> didn't<00:02:51.450> leave<00:02:52.110> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
weapon to use on this I didn't leave the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.360 
weapon to use on this I didn't leave the
cutscenes<00:02:52.560> on<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:52.800> as<00:02:52.950> well<00:02:53.070> because<00:02:53.310> I

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
cutscenes on this as well because I

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
pistol it worked out the best one for me

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.750 
pistol it worked out the best one for me
shoots<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.650> little<00:03:04.739> slower<00:03:05.130> but<00:03:05.459> it's<00:03:05.610> more

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
shoots a little slower but it's more

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.650 
shoots a little slower but it's more
powerful<00:03:06.410> so<00:03:07.410> it's<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.590> lot<00:03:07.709> easier<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:08.660> kill

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
powerful so it's a lot easier to kill
