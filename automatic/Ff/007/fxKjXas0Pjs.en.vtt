00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
played surely at the beginning read that

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.700 
played surely at the beginning read that
one<00:01:33.030> need<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.270> play<00:01:33.450> more<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:33.869> he<00:01:34.110> was<00:01:34.380> always

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
one need to play more but he was always

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.469 
one need to play more but he was always
injured<00:01:36.740> would<00:01:37.740> have<00:01:37.890> done<00:01:38.390> differently<00:01:39.390> I

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
injured would have done differently I

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.390 
injured would have done differently I
mean<00:01:39.659> we<00:01:39.869> we<00:01:40.409> had<00:01:40.530> more<00:01:40.710> than<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.920> point<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
mean we we had more than a point the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.120 
mean we we had more than a point the
game<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.630> think<00:01:43.290> we<00:01:43.500> weren't<00:01:43.649> course<00:01:43.920> on

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
game and I think we weren't course on

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.940 
game and I think we weren't course on
target<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:44.640> were<00:01:44.759> confident<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.829> and<00:01:46.829> I

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
target and we were confident so and I

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.370 
target and we were confident so and I
think<00:01:47.189> we<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.399> need<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.850> winner<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.259> one

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
think we just need a winner so the one

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.899 
think we just need a winner so the one
