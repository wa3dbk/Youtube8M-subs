title focus is heavily on platforming
and<00:03:33.510> puzzle-solving<00:03:34.400> ratchet<00:03:35.400> has<00:03:35.580> a<00:03:35.850> new

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
and puzzle-solving ratchet has a new

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.300 
and puzzle-solving ratchet has a new
wrench<00:03:36.360> and<00:03:36.630> this<00:03:36.989> wrench<00:03:37.290> allows<00:03:37.680> him<00:03:38.070> to

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.890 
obstacles and platforms and basically
maneuver<00:03:47.310> them<00:03:47.459> around<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.820> environment<00:03:48.360> now

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
maneuver them around the environment now

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.390 
maneuver them around the environment now
a<00:03:48.930> lot<00:03:49.140> of<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.290> puzzle<00:03:49.650> is<00:03:49.709> required<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.310> know

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
a lot of the puzzle is required you know

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.949 
a lot of the puzzle is required you know
just<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.700> move<00:03:50.850> things<00:03:51.090> around<00:03:51.299> form

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
just to move things around form

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.289 
just to move things around form
different<00:03:52.200> shapes<00:03:52.590> things<00:03:52.920> like<00:03:53.070> that<00:03:53.250> but<00:03:54.180> it

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
different shapes things like that but it

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.150 
different shapes things like that but it
gets<00:03:54.360> really<00:03:54.660> interesting<00:03:54.950> in<00:03:55.950> the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
gets really interesting in the

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.800 
gets really interesting in the
platforming<00:03:56.790> stages<00:03:56.910> where<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.660> can

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
platforming stages where you can

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.080 
platforming stages where you can
basically<00:03:57.959> turn<00:03:58.830> different<00:03:59.160> platforms<00:03:59.760> jump

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
basically turn different platforms jump

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.729 
basically turn different platforms jump
around<00:04:00.360> and<00:04:00.690> just<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:01.110> don't<00:04:01.350> know<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.709> just

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
around and just I don't know it just

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.800 
around and just I don't know it just
gives<00:04:02.070> you<00:04:02.160> that<00:04:02.280> feeling<00:04:02.610> of<00:04:03.030> more

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
gives you that feeling of more

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.900 
gives you that feeling of more
interaction<00:04:04.620> in<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.830> environments<00:04:05.489> compared

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
interaction in the environments compared

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.030 
interaction in the environments compared
to<00:04:06.060> any<00:04:06.269> of<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.540> others<00:04:06.810> in<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.049> series<00:04:07.230> which

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
to any of the others in the series which

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.819 
to any of the others in the series which
basically<00:04:09.000> blast<00:04:09.450> this<00:04:09.780> game<00:04:10.079> straight<00:04:10.739> to

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
basically blast this game straight to

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.660 
basically blast this game straight to
the<00:04:10.919> stratosphere<00:04:11.579> as<00:04:11.700> far<00:04:11.880> as<00:04:12.000> I'm<00:04:12.120> concerned

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
the stratosphere as far as I'm concerned

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.460 
the stratosphere as far as I'm concerned
it<00:04:13.030> was<00:04:13.180> just<00:04:13.390> a<00:04:13.599> such<00:04:13.840> a<00:04:13.870> well-rounded

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
it was just a such a well-rounded

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.090 
it was just a such a well-rounded
experience<00:04:15.030> now<00:04:16.030> as<00:04:16.419> for<00:04:16.720> action<00:04:17.290> it's<00:04:17.919> pretty

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
experience now as for action it's pretty

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.039 
experience now as for action it's pretty
well<00:04:18.250> exactly<00:04:18.489> what<00:04:18.730> you<00:04:18.850> expect<00:04:19.180> okay<00:04:19.450> I<00:04:19.630> know

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
well exactly what you expect okay I know

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.780 
well exactly what you expect okay I know
a<00:04:20.079> lot<00:04:20.440> of<00:04:20.769> people<00:04:21.010> are<00:04:21.459> going<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:21.700> be

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
a lot of people are going to be

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.909 
a lot of people are going to be
disappointed<00:04:22.419> with<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.810> weapons<00:04:23.230> because

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
disappointed with the weapons because

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.100 
disappointed with the weapons because
weapons<00:04:24.430> are<00:04:24.550> all<00:04:24.730> from<00:04:25.360> tools<00:04:25.960> of

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
weapons are all from tools of

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.890 
weapons are all from tools of
destruction<00:04:26.230> they<00:04:26.889> all<00:04:27.070> start<00:04:27.490> at<00:04:27.760> about<00:04:27.900> I

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
destruction they all start at about I

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.930 
destruction they all start at about I
think<00:04:29.110> it's<00:04:29.230> level<00:04:29.470> 2<00:04:29.620> or<00:04:29.650> level<00:04:29.830> 3<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:30.460> you

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
think it's level 2 or level 3 and you

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.730 
think it's level 2 or level 3 and you
can<00:04:31.150> get<00:04:31.330> them<00:04:31.540> up<00:04:31.660> to<00:04:31.690> level<00:04:31.990> 5<00:04:32.260> but<00:04:32.560> that's

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
can get them up to level 5 but that's

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.980 
can get them up to level 5 but that's
essentially<00:04:33.280> all<00:04:33.910> right<00:04:34.060> after<00:04:34.450> that<00:04:34.630> that's

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
essentially all right after that that's

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.960 
essentially all right after that that's
you<00:04:35.470> know<00:04:35.560> that's<00:04:35.590> all<00:04:35.889> she<00:04:36.010> wrote<00:04:36.040> nothing

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
you know that's all she wrote nothing

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.960 
you know that's all she wrote nothing
new<00:04:37.120> and<00:04:37.270> exciting<00:04:37.780> in<00:04:37.900> terms<00:04:37.930> of<00:04:38.410> weapons<00:04:39.220> but

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
new and exciting in terms of weapons but

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.170 
new and exciting in terms of weapons but
again<00:04:40.290> they<00:04:41.290> sort<00:04:41.680> of<00:04:41.740> counteract<00:04:42.430> this<00:04:42.850> by

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
again they sort of counteract this by

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.600 
again they sort of counteract this by
introducing<00:04:43.930> another<00:04:44.230> new<00:04:44.380> feature<00:04:45.010> besides

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
introducing another new feature besides

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.340 
introducing another new feature besides
the<00:04:45.790> wrench<00:04:46.030> and<00:04:46.300> this<00:04:46.720> is<00:04:46.870> in<00:04:47.020> some<00:04:47.200> of<00:04:47.260> the

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580

hoping<00:05:19.030> that<00:05:19.180> these<00:05:19.300> new<00:05:19.539> gameplay<00:05:19.960> elements

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
hoping that these new gameplay elements

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.200 
hoping that these new gameplay elements
make<00:05:20.620> their<00:05:20.800> way<00:05:20.890> into<00:05:21.039> the<00:05:21.220> game<00:05:21.400> because

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
make their way into the game because

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.510 
make their way into the game because
they<00:05:22.390> really<00:05:22.870> work<00:05:23.169> it<00:05:23.560> sensationally<00:05:24.280> well

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
they really work it sensationally well

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.840 
they really work it sensationally well
so<00:05:25.390> long<00:05:25.600> as<00:05:25.660> you<00:05:26.080> know<00:05:26.680> what<00:05:27.100> to<00:05:27.280> expect<00:05:27.729> from
