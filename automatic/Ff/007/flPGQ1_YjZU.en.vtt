00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.320 
let's see how it slides because it
sticks<00:04:29.680> onto<00:04:30.220> my<00:04:30.550> map<00:04:32.729> so<00:04:33.729> it's<00:04:33.880> better<00:04:34.030> to<00:04:34.210> use

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
sticks onto my map so it's better to use

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:46.890 
sticks onto my map so it's better to use
a<00:04:34.360> rolling<00:04:44.729> the<00:04:45.729> only<00:04:46.030> thing<00:04:46.240> I<00:04:46.330> notice<00:04:46.660> is<00:04:46.750> you

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
a rolling the only thing I notice is you

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.900 
a rolling the only thing I notice is you
have<00:04:47.080> to<00:04:47.260> let<00:04:47.410> it<00:04:47.470> sit<00:04:47.800> in<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:47.919> freezer<00:04:48.310> so<00:04:48.729> if

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
have to let it sit in the freezer so if

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.050 
have to let it sit in the freezer so if
you<00:04:49.060> don't<00:04:49.360> do<00:04:49.840> a<00:04:50.289> whole<00:04:50.620> sheet<00:04:51.460> of<00:04:51.520> cookie

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
you don't do a whole sheet of cookie

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:59.159 
you don't do a whole sheet of cookie
dough<00:04:53.220> then<00:04:54.220> you<00:04:54.430> need<00:04:54.669> to<00:04:56.340> have<00:04:57.340> more<00:04:57.580> mats<00:04:58.169> so

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169
