shouts<00:02:30.950> -<00:02:31.160> OH

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
shouts - OH

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.569 
shouts - OH
don't<00:02:32.599> break<00:02:32.900> your<00:02:32.930> way<00:02:33.260> oh<00:02:36.190> ok<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:37.370> guy<00:02:37.549> is

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
don't break your way oh ok this guy is

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.759 
don't break your way oh ok this guy is
very<00:02:37.730> bad<00:02:38.090> at<00:02:38.209> physics<00:02:38.569> alright<00:02:39.230> I<00:02:39.260> think<00:02:39.379> the

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
very bad at physics alright I think the

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.949 
very bad at physics alright I think the
most<00:02:39.980> unlogical<00:02:40.790> thing<00:02:41.299> would<00:02:41.480> be<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.690> chair

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
most unlogical thing would be the chair

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.630 
most unlogical thing would be the chair
so<00:02:42.319> therefore<00:02:42.829> the<00:02:43.010> chairs<00:02:43.250> probably<00:02:43.549> gonna

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
so therefore the chairs probably gonna

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.300 
so therefore the chairs probably gonna
cut<00:02:43.879> it<00:02:44.000> so<00:02:44.180> let's<00:02:44.360> get<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:44.510> shot<00:02:44.750> into<00:02:44.959> it<00:02:45.310> or

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
cut it so let's get a shot into it or

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.080 
cut it so let's get a shot into it or
