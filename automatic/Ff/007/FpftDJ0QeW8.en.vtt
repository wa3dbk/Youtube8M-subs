I've got my high-speed camera set up

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.800 
I've got my high-speed camera set up
I've<00:01:46.530> got<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.770> lights<00:01:47.009> set<00:01:47.430> up<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.540> block

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
I've got the lights set up and the block

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.069 
I've got the lights set up and the block
ready<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.290> go<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.740> typed<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.280> my<00:01:50.549> g<00:01:50.970> code<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.450> Mach

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.350 
ready to go I typed in my g code in Mach
3<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.619> I'll<00:01:52.680> hit<00:01:52.890> go<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.700> let's<00:01:53.880> take<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> look

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
3 and I'll hit go and let's take a look

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:31.280 
3 and I'll hit go and let's take a look
at<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.720> high-speed<00:01:55.200> footage

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.780 

okay<00:02:32.290> now<00:02:32.650> let's<00:02:32.950> take<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.310> look<00:02:33.610> at<00:02:33.700> that

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
okay now let's take a look at that

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.000 
okay now let's take a look at that

it's<00:02:40.570> not<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:41.170> rougher<00:02:41.760> one-inch<00:02:42.760> depth<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.390> cut

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
it's not a rougher one-inch depth of cut

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.980 
it's not a rougher one-inch depth of cut
but<00:02:44.080> only<00:02:44.200> 30,000

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
but only 30,000

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.410 
but only 30,000
and<00:02:46.990> we<00:02:47.110> don't<00:02:47.290> care<00:02:47.530> about<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.950> RPM

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
and we don't care about the RPM

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.550 
and we don't care about the RPM
limitation<00:02:49.420> because<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.900> horsepower<00:02:50.260> will

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
limitation because the horsepower will

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.800 
limitation because the horsepower will
be<00:02:50.710> quite<00:02:50.980> low<00:02:51.160> for<00:02:51.190> this<00:02:51.490> type<00:02:51.700> of<00:02:51.730> cut<00:02:52.090> so<00:02:52.690> we

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
be quite low for this type of cut so we

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.870 
be quite low for this type of cut so we
will<00:02:52.960> want<00:02:53.110> to<00:02:53.170> run<00:02:53.350> into<00:02:53.590> high<00:02:53.890> rpm<00:02:54.400> as<00:02:54.520> we<00:02:54.640> can

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
will want to run into high rpm as we can

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.900 
will want to run into high rpm as we can
which<00:02:55.180> in<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.450> tormach<00:02:55.780> is<00:02:55.959> 5100<00:02:56.709> and<00:02:56.860> if<00:02:57.820> we

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
which in the tormach is 5100 and if we

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.090 
which in the tormach is 5100 and if we
look<00:02:58.090> at<00:02:58.270> where<00:02:58.480> we<00:02:58.600> are<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:59.440> looks<00:02:59.860> like<00:03:00.040> a

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
look at where we are this looks like a

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.870 
look at where we are this looks like a
15<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:01.180> 22<00:03:02.110> inch<00:03:02.560> inch<00:03:03.220> permanent

15 to 22 inch inch permanent

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.360 
15 to 22 inch inch permanent
recommendation<00:03:04.480> from<00:03:04.840> G<00:03:05.560> wizard<00:03:05.920> it's

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
recommendation from G wizard it's

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.890 
recommendation from G wizard it's
recommending<00:03:06.790> that<00:03:06.880> we<00:03:07.000> climb<00:03:07.330> mil<00:03:07.600> as<00:03:07.750> well

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
recommending that we climb mil as well

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.920 
recommending that we climb mil as well
that<00:03:08.230> is<00:03:08.380> important<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:10.180> while<00:03:10.570> not<00:03:10.750> the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
that is important and while not the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.690 
that is important and while not the
point<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.290> this<00:03:11.380> video<00:03:11.620> something<00:03:12.580> to

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
point of this video something to

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.670 
point of this video something to
consider<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.420> if<00:03:13.720> you're<00:03:13.989> looking<00:03:14.320> to<00:03:14.410> push

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
consider is if you're looking to push

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.130 
consider is if you're looking to push
material<00:03:15.430> removal<00:03:15.850> rates<00:03:16.120> cutting<00:03:16.930> with<00:03:17.020> a

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
high depth of cut in a shallower width

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.570 
high depth of cut in a shallower width
of<00:03:19.660> cut<00:03:19.870> can<00:03:20.440> not<00:03:20.560> only<00:03:20.709> have<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.310> more

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
of cut can not only have a more

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.160 
of cut can not only have a more
efficient<00:03:21.970> use<00:03:22.000> of<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.390> machines<00:03:22.690> horsepower

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
efficient use of the machines horsepower

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.229 
efficient use of the machines horsepower
but<00:03:23.800> it<00:03:23.890> can<00:03:24.010> extend<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.580> life<00:03:24.790> because<00:03:25.120> you're

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
but it can extend to life because you're

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.940 
but it can extend to life because you're
using<00:03:25.420> a<00:03:25.570> much<00:03:25.750> greater<00:03:26.050> percentage<00:03:26.590> of<00:03:26.800> the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
using a much greater percentage of the

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
end mill itself finally and I'm very

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.759 
end mill itself finally and I'm very
important<00:03:30.580> when<00:03:31.030> you're<00:03:31.180> cutting<00:03:31.500> so<00:03:32.500> deep

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
important when you're cutting so deep

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.890 
important when you're cutting so deep
with<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:33.100> relatively<00:03:33.610> thin<00:03:33.850> end<00:03:34.090> mill<00:03:34.330> is<00:03:34.540> to

with a relatively thin end mill is to

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.180 
with a relatively thin end mill is to
look<00:03:34.989> at<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.230> deflection<00:03:35.739> to<00:03:36.010> ten

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
look at the deflection to ten

00:03:36.190 --> 00:04:08.540 
look at the deflection to ten
thousandths<00:03:36.700> of<00:03:36.760> an<00:03:36.880> inch<00:03:36.970> is<00:03:37.239> fine

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.740 

that's<00:04:09.550> all<00:04:09.760> for<00:04:09.970> this<00:04:10.060> week<00:04:10.300> folks
