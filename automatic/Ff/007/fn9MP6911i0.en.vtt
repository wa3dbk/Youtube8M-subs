00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 we are back here in 13 sports 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.790
 up to date 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.380
 the moment to listen to agustín manzo 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.710
 sports director vice president 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:14.340
 sporting blue cross around what 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:19.890
 did not want to advance what has 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:22.160
 mentioned the subject is the subject that 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.899
 compare with america we'll hear it 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.390
 these are complicated issues when 

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:29.579
 talks about one of a team that maybe 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.070
 it is not in tune with some others 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.180
 let's listen to what they say meek the day of 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.800
 today after yesterday the best 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.900
 only one reinforcement was going to arrive 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.060
 that was the unifiquen opinó sa and 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.370
 while we try to calm down but 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.000
 good on run and pedrosa this said has 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.000
 liked 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.100
 of a good rhythm that is competitive 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.070
 have one that we qualify very well 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.769
 and that we are fighting the leadership that 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.870
 we are fighting the championship the 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.699
 results at the end are analyzed and 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.949
 then it is decided now we can not 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.930
 talk about that situation we can not 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.090
 qualify nothing because it is very 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.460
 early the first semester like everything 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.899
 was very slow out of the best team 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.909
 unfortunately the second was not what 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.130
 that we wanted all three this tournaments 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.250
 that we had was not really very bad 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.200
 but this opportunity is fine 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.539
 that take advantage of that is what we have 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.369
 that everyone be very attentive so that 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.460
 we can take the team forward then 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.220
 it has always been a directive that leads 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.770
 a guideline be according to you 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.840
 they always know trying to finish the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.720
 contracts with the people with whom you 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.900
 they sign and so 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.310
 and always carry an order very very 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.470
 important for the team and for the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.780
 institution that order and that situation 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.230
 that makes a serious company of course 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.240
 we have to work in a tournament where 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.910
 we have to do everything to be able to this 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.130
 highlight the thorn we have to nail 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.770
 to everyone in this what happened in this 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.410
 season these six months that was not 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.660
 good as I repeat and we need to do 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.730
 a good season in the championship I 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.500
 I think it's pretty good 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.850
 strengthened as well as america is also 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.800
 he has behaved very well so he will be 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.600
 that the championship looks very good 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.430
 It looks very competitive and that makes 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.670
 there is this interest in him for the tournament 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.670
 wta 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.960
 the other of it seems to me that we are going 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.910
 parts of what makes an analysis a balance 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.090
 of the tournament with all reason but the 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.740
 short box I differ a little that the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.100
 previous shift the first semester 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.530
 of the year was excelently also not what 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.180
 it was because they were not champions the 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.510
 actually they had something but as well as 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.790
 excelentísimo is to be with the same 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.610
 thorn that you had done during the 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.470
 last years you practically reach the 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.620
 liguilla and in the end does not end 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.180
 be completed in the need that the 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.790
 blue cross team that there is nothing else 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.790
 to be a tournament champion 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.870
 wait because how many years ago are 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.790
 champions why are you excelentísimo not 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.320
 has won nothing the truth and if a cup 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.300
 nothing more but good but in league is not 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.500
 so clear the other topic that calls me 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.870
 the attention and I wanted to what 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.680
 will hear is it says blue cross 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:27.470
 it's pretty good that he's strengthened 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.900
 just as America is still 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.430
 in one of the best forwards in the 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.950
 previous tournament with 9 goals was 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:39.050
 benedetto in america asked one of the 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.210
 best flyers for right in mexico 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:47.750
 Darwin Quintero took him to America 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:49.940
 whom he wore blue cross was one of the 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.040
 best contentions in mexico is 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.800
 cristian pellerano took it the 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.970
 America who took blue cross good 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.320
 well then strengthened than america 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.730
 excuse me good, it is also 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.650
 contradictors and complained that the 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.750
 draft was not injured or is not had is 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.790
 a little late cited is that also late 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.780
 cited you notice that it was the draft not now 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.970
 yes I forgive you but I think you are 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.950
 trying to cover a lot with the arrival 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.720
 roque santacruz that has not been the 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.519
 hit as mediatic as he did 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.590
 ronaldinho with querétaro or as 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.450
 I was waiting for the blue cross team today 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.760
 the arrival of roque santacruz is 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.040
 important yes but it is only one 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.830
 for everything that ends up being and 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.510
 It seems to me that the topic of 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.830
 right because it is only 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.860
 common saw and flowers 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.190
 reference for this German team is a 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.080
 player who is not approved in Mexico and 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.210
 what of the run and therefore is a player who 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.310
 he has not been able to stay in the 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.930
 first division as expected is not 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.920
 that is a bad player but is not 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.350
 reaching a level only by hand from 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.300
 three and yes they are offended the case of 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.360
 running pedrosa is the same as a 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.820
 moment that isaac romo is the same as 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.070
 villarreal and what cow they came to 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.930
 cross action are players who should not 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.970
 of being in blue cross are not reinforcements 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.190
 for blue cross you can not compare what 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.200
 that makes the maryland and pedrosa is not 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.390
 reinforcement so that although they get angry is 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.480
 reinforcement for Chiapas where it is and what 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.370
 They ran the reinforcement for Morelia that 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.920
 already played in morelia also and what 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.660
 they ran the reinforcement to populate the 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.760
 reinforcement for the ascent with everything 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.310
 respect would be an extraordinary reinforcement 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.320
 for roadrunners for wolves 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.460
 bags for miners because miners 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.890
 want to access good I do not know if to 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.990
 Roadrunner is not a player for cross 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.150
 blue with all respect only it seems to me that 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.790
 there is a vendetta de Roque Santacruz as 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.200
 if it had been a big hiring of 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.910
 something that we also do not know if it's going to 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.640
 paste with this team blue cross for 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.320
 fear this boy from the front if 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.200
 you can have better forward in case 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.580
 They do not have balls but lost 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.590
 now that they check the numbers of 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:06:00.500
 santacruz how many of america also what 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.990
 that says meek is let's try to 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.670
 complement what the contract is 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.290
 they will notice antenna is giving them a 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.540
 important support for what will be 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.120
 the next tournament I do not know if it's going to 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.370
 reach but also there seems to be no 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.410
 an obligation for that championship when 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.630
 is what people really care about 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.330
 with this blue cross team the one 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:23.690
 come out and say that the championship could 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:26.480
 to stay or not seems very complicated to me 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:30.500
 You can now if anything this semester 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.580
 plus the great blue cross reinforcement for 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.950
 that tournament 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.160
 roque santa cruz yes they can spain 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:39.730
 Can Málaga have scored goals in 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.980
 this tournament because they bring it for that not 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:46.700
 to score the battering ram in the bitter 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:51.470
 see since the tournament started in August 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:53.080
 past has scored two goals to the grenade to 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.070
 pomegranate 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.400
 in the league 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:07:00.710
 quickly marked the athletic one of madrid 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.200
 he marked Real Madrid good in his 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.150
 account and in the cup of the king to the sports 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.490
 from la coruña two goals I do not know if I 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.850
 go to work blue cross team 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.850
 but
