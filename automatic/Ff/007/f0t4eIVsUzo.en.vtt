00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.320 
that's all that matters you can figure
out<00:03:40.890> how<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.310> do<00:03:41.460> all<00:03:41.640> this<00:03:41.670> stuff<00:03:41.820> on<00:03:42.120> your<00:03:42.270> own

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
out how to do all this stuff on your own

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.150 
out how to do all this stuff on your own
because<00:03:42.840> I<00:03:43.200> still<00:03:43.620> haven't<00:03:43.740> figured<00:03:43.920> out<00:03:44.100> all

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
because I still haven't figured out all

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.680 
because I still haven't figured out all
the<00:03:44.340> stuff<00:03:44.700> i<00:03:44.850> know<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:45.180> it's<00:03:45.270> awesome

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
the stuff i know that it's awesome

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.830 
the stuff i know that it's awesome
though<00:03:45.810> because<00:03:45.959> when<00:03:46.200> i<00:03:46.230> spawn<00:03:47.220> on<00:03:47.810> when<00:03:48.810> i

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
though because when i spawn on when i

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.600 
though because when i spawn on when i
spawned<00:03:49.230> like<00:03:49.470> purple<00:03:49.890> people<00:03:50.070> then<00:03:50.400> they'll

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
spawned like purple people then they'll

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.980 
spawned like purple people then they'll
start<00:03:50.730> fighting<00:03:51.240> so

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.230 

yes<00:03:58.990> so<00:03:59.500> as<00:03:59.650> you<00:03:59.770> can<00:03:59.860> see<00:04:00.040> they're<00:04:00.250> like

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
yes so as you can see they're like

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.000 
yes so as you can see they're like
fighting<00:04:01.720> right<00:04:01.870> now<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.230> once<00:04:02.530> they<00:04:02.740> die<00:04:02.950> you

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
fighting right now and once they die you

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.610 
fighting right now and once they die you
can<00:04:03.520> see<00:04:03.760> that<00:04:03.790> they<00:04:04.210> even<00:04:05.140> come<00:04:05.290> back<00:04:05.380> to<00:04:05.530> the

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
can see that they even come back to the

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.110 
can see that they even come back to the
droppable<00:04:05.980> so<00:04:06.280> it's<00:04:06.430> awesome<00:04:06.760> you<00:04:06.880> don't<00:04:07.030> have

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
droppable so it's awesome you don't have

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.720 
droppable so it's awesome you don't have
to<00:04:07.240> keep<00:04:07.390> making<00:04:07.810> multiple<00:04:08.080> people<00:04:08.890> so<00:04:09.490> that's

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
to keep making multiple people so that's

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.110 
to keep making multiple people so that's
pretty<00:04:09.940> cool<00:04:10.560> but<00:04:11.560> yeah<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.430> mall<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.910> mods
