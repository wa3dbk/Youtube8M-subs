00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.490
 fully call and welcome two minutes 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.170
 special originally was not planned 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.849
 Video games with more to turn and war 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.500
 was and still is considered a substitute for 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.510
 However, today's edition will serve you 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.010
 say as an exception to the given occasion 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.689
 and this is called differently he goes 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.220
 Fulfilled the game was full of full 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.050
 to be mythical and some of them live 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.550
 by diligent fans we already discovered 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.740
 funny and interesting ii stakes like 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.720
 eg the playboy mansion picture boots or 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.399
 the so-called giant ball one of 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.660
 it should be able to decouple a building 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.550
 others give it too 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.630
 Spooky I am you guys my 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.040
 personal top three of the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.719
 he is five minutes more interesting 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.280
 But there is no action 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.920
 gold so do not worry 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.510
 it's top 3, they've been over since 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.070
 Game outside is some fans report 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.050
 of various allusions to aliens 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.399
 or flood even claim that the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.020
 actually called things in the game 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.670
 happen and not as 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.320
 hallucination of the protagonist already 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.820
 there should be a possibility in the prologue 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.500
 to look at aliens and at one 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.180
 frozen river under a drawbridge 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.439
 At one point you have one 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.610
 possibility to look through the water where 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.890
 I literally ice cold 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.560
 Surprise awaits a frozen one 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.090
 extraterrestrial roddick that is still 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.380
 not even everything appeared at the northernmost point 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.880
 point of the card into the water and you 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.159
 will find something else and that 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.689
 a crashed ufo is like that 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.490
 the ufo would have been there for a longer time than from 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.770
 seaweed is wrapped and the shore the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.009
 Frozen alien belongs more to what 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.119
 Politics, they both have one thing in common 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.170
 submerged another ufo should am 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.100
 be found sky 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.930
 have you ever been over the area 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.939
 show kuno parachuting 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.810
 tried it from the UFO or they say from 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.009
 nothing on 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.900
 as soon as you try to leave it 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.880
 solves the ding has effect on the recoil 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.930
 and you lose yours wrong 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.180
 subsequent landings fall 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.130
 literally tough out pretty 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.380
 asked what do you think about the whole 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.360
 thing is more behind telekom 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.570
 Clear down we get too already 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.369
 top 2 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.780
 the Illuminati what to do with those 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.490
 Allusions are everywhere in the game too 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.950
 find the so-called seeing eye 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.210
 I am here here and here 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.240
 maybe even eat on my hand 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.850
 or eight times it is everywhere 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.290
 whole game has an eye on that 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.119
 interesting is your whole thing 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.649
 this illustration here the plate 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.819
 namely on the highest mountain of the map 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.109
 and chili 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.909
 It could be an allusion to the idea 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.650
 data pyramid is more like here 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.239
 it's probably going to start a bear too 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.950
 the mount killias is a certain 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.269
 fact even corroborates the theory 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.040
 on the other side on the back 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.870
 Berg finds her son small wooden pier 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.950
 the highest point in the whole game 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.079
 the boardwalk I would stay here once 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.670
 such a symbol what looks like the eye 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.799
 then there would be another thing 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.590
 There is something engraved on the wood and indeed 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.180
 comeback stories comes waits some fans 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.069
 claim that not only the story is enough 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.629
 play through you have the 300 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.489
 reach and then there will be at three o'clock 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:45.569
 Something happens in the morning 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:48.209

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.370

 to have actually seen a ghost 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.250
 northeast of the map she misses a mountain 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.799
 where the ghost appears in front of a cliff 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.419
 should she look at you holly fink 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.699

 internet of gtf in paper one 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.340
 possibility to find out on any 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.099
 You can find a section of a website 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.900
 from an old newspaper article from 1978 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.540
 is about the wife of a person named 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.009

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:43.650
 his former wife is from the 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.299
 Cliff fell and became source 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.859
 suspected to have done, however 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.629
 he denied the act and came even 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.189
 through I am convinced that the 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.840
 Ghost is his wife and he is her 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:53.579
