where I want it to be select the camera
and<00:00:36.570> then<00:00:37.290> go<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.469> game<00:00:37.770> object<00:00:37.940> align<00:00:38.940> with

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
and then go to game object align with

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.010 
and then go to game object align with
view<00:00:40.460> that<00:00:41.460> places<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.030> camera<00:00:42.420> exactly

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
view that places the camera exactly

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.619

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.450 

often<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.780> games<00:00:48.960> cameras<00:00:49.800> are<00:00:49.920> attached<00:00:50.250> to

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
often in games cameras are attached to

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.639 
often in games cameras are attached to
objects<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.090> order<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.719> make<00:00:51.899> them<00:00:52.170> move

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
objects in order to make them move

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.760 
objects in order to make them move
around<00:00:53.010> for<00:00:53.340> example<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:54.000> game<00:00:54.539> object<00:00:55.020> such<00:00:55.739> as

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
around for example a game object such as

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.299 
around for example a game object such as
a<00:00:56.129> cat<00:00:56.460> character<00:00:57.059> might<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.770> having<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.949> camera

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
a cat character might be having a camera

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.849 
a cat character might be having a camera
attached<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.059> or<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.899> car<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.469> racing<00:01:01.829> game

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
attached to it or a car in a racing game

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.009 
attached to it or a car in a racing game
might<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> camera<00:01:02.910> attached<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.870> back

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
might have a camera attached to the back

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.050 
might have a camera attached to the back
of<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:05.070> either<00:01:05.250> make<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.729> child

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
of it you can either make it a child

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.179 
of it you can either make it a child
object<00:01:06.270> or<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.140> write<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.530> script<00:01:07.740> that

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
object or you can write a script that

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.940 
object or you can write a script that
makes<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.000> camera<00:01:09.240> follow<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.229> transform<00:01:10.799> of

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
makes the camera follow the transform of

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.060 
makes the camera follow the transform of
another<00:01:11.310> object<00:01:11.659> for<00:01:12.659> example<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.409> scene

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
another object for example in this scene

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.210 
another object for example in this scene
I<00:01:14.280> have<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> game<00:01:14.760> object<00:01:14.970> with<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> script<00:01:16.530> which

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
I have a game object with a script which

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.550 
I have a game object with a script which
allows<00:01:17.610> me<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.000> move<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.450> using<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:20.009> keys<00:01:21.560> like

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
allows me to move it using the keys like

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.370 
allows me to move it using the keys like
this<00:01:22.799> if<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:24.119> wanted<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.630> camera<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.350> be

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
this if I wanted the camera to be

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.219 
this if I wanted the camera to be
attached<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.430> could<00:01:27.360> drag<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.840> camera

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
attached to that I could drag the camera

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.230 
attached to that I could drag the camera
onto<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.770> game<00:01:28.979> object<00:01:29.159> making<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.000> child

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
onto that game object making it a child

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.569 
onto that game object making it a child
object<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:31.619> camera<00:01:31.979> will<00:01:32.159> then<00:01:32.310> follow

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
object the camera will then follow

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.420 
object the camera will then follow
wherever<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.570> object<00:01:34.020> moves<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:35.100> now<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.340> I

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
wherever that object moves so now if I

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.200 
wherever that object moves so now if I
press<00:01:35.640> play<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.409> use<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.590> keys<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.790> camera

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
press play and use the keys the camera

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.980 
press play and use the keys the camera
is<00:01:39.390> moved<00:01:39.780> along<00:01:40.380> with<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:44.329> often<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.479> games<00:01:45.689> if

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
is moved along with it often in games if

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.569 
is moved along with it often in games if
you<00:01:46.020> wanted<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.500> use<00:01:46.680> more<00:01:46.920> than<00:01:47.070> one<00:01:47.280> camera

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
you wanted to use more than one camera

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.700 
you wanted to use more than one camera
angle<00:01:47.790> you'd<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.659> more<00:01:48.930> than<00:01:49.110> one<00:01:49.259> camera<00:01:49.530> in

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
angle you'd have more than one camera in

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.249 
angle you'd have more than one camera in
the<00:01:49.829> scene<00:01:50.100> but<00:01:50.759> make<00:01:51.000> sure<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.780> camera

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
the scene but make sure that that camera

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.289 
the scene but make sure that that camera
is<00:01:52.350> switched<00:01:52.500> off<00:01:52.890> otherwise<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.119> get<00:01:54.270> a

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
is switched off otherwise you can get a

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.870 
is switched off otherwise you can get a
conflict<00:01:54.869> between<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.350> two<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:56.399> only<00:01:56.579> want

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
conflict between the two you only want

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.440 
conflict between the two you only want
one<00:01:57.090> camera<00:01:57.659> active<00:01:58.049> at<00:01:58.170> any<00:01:58.320> given<00:01:58.649> time<00:01:59.450> the

will be quieter to this other camera so

you see if I disable this camera the

with<00:02:40.959> most<00:02:41.140> things<00:02:41.470> you<00:02:41.560> can<00:02:41.799> use<00:02:41.830> scripting

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
disabling one and enabling another so

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.510 
disabling one and enabling another so
