00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:03.889
 16 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:05.780
 well 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.780
 3 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:13.669
 they also have to sell 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:34.319
 until now 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.730
 we hope it continues to progress 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.740
 I heard it since I was in the womb 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.380
 after these first days the days 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.340
 neither me nor god in life 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.100
 Monsanto minutes long 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.579
 and it was not what his father did and I was to put classical music 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.249
 well he remembered that in mediocries 

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:03.149
 Minister as a former lover who bought me to spend the night in the Marquise Salzgitter 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.149
 Dinner 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.120
 but you have to see 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.140
 and alludes to the people of Madrid 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.909
 warning 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.360
 there are no less than one year licenses 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.350
 and in which a start was my mom 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.450
 and then I will 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.030
 eleven of them started this Friday 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.340
 some instrument was desired to study music according to the initiative not 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.960
 do not even take them at that correct time 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.750
 danny is majestic really awesome 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.820
 pickets of the instruments more 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.960
 more powerful and you join a person who arrives and who has to interpret 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.990
 one piece 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.260
 who have in mind 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.870
 It is awesome to have to sit in front of 1 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.740
 but it was always difficult 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.740
 but where so to detonate 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.010
 I made them with the three years of 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.320
 propaedeutic who also school in schools at three in the afternoon and 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.140
 the four that already had classes 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.269
 intel also the consortium sometimes put us 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:10.499
 I got to do the homework 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:14.129
 the pledge but sometimes you have to play piano rock does not have much time because 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.709
 it was night time 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.909
 the stage of the holidays and 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.029
 and the colonies 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:21.789
 that then madrid - no 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:26.909
 and yet I did not do any of that generally very little time for 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.009
 dedicate them because if we need 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:33.539
 a lot of time study hours the amount of years we have been nothing 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:34.959
 music 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.470
 the day today of the health of any meat 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.199
 was that one 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:44.519
 a period really very very difficult for me after studying hard I took 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.499
 one year I work piÃ±ana 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.499
 the regional parliament 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.560
 if one writes indigenous and global virgil indicated many facilities but 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.560
 I think the hardest part with her I ask 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.099
 who believes it 

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:43.319
 music 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.759
 and my way of life 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:45.849
 pension 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.119
 with the music decreased 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:50.449
 liszt and learned 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:53.269
 by the way is suffered 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.269
 then in mind for me it is all my world 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.629
 any feeling that you always have is always in the music and 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.629
 and I will have been able to relieve it there as well as it reminds me 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.439
 because even pain or existence is 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.979
 it's a pleasure with music 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.979
 and in that time it's my way of escapism 

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:17.029
 but peace 

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:18.129
 if so 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:20.049
 the piece very 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.049
 very deep and because 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.349
 very strong common 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.370
 Well, it leads me to think about this 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.199
 something 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.249
 there is a lot of passion 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:31.740
 the bad thing is that to me 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.080
 make me feel this is and that when I touch it, it can be expressed that the 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.080
 people who listen to me union sources 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:47.889
 gilbert 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.460
 the readings of contact with a large number of artistic productions in 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.120
 August a lot of dancing 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.919
 I like going to the cinema 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.050
 I really like to hear the mass 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.940
 more than half are listened to and it makes me feel something and maybe it's because 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.870
 it has very latin rhythms we have come has something is very warm is very good 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.870
 If she is very sensual she likes titan very much 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:14.379
 Cuban salsa 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:18.199
 the sauce to the train and it is a text that is a crime castro ojeda 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:19.509
 none of that is going 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.960
 I am really like many types of music music 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:26.560
 fascinates me I love its bigger slope 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.270
 I liked it very much, I'm afraid that 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.229
 moser all all have birds but all at the same time are different 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:38.300
 agencies - the Chinese tennis player Korea Mexico is very young of origin aspects 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.819
 of tradition and music 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:43.889
 and then I think we should also exploit it out there 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:46.719
 for what is ours 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:49.719
 that could grow 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.970
 I already decided to live 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.640
 what I want to attend and enjoy the leisure I know where you want to reach your 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.990
 patient take it to 0 to do things 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.699
 if I see myself in the future 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:14.419
 giving recitals that call me for projects all but I want to sign 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.819
 or to my own this project I hope you will create I want to create some 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:41.619
 also in Iraq on the train left the government stands out and you that 

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:44.619
 minetti practice that you insist that demands 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.499
 you are right 

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:49.330
 6 end 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.330
 16 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.680
 3 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.930
