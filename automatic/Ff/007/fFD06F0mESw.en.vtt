the panel and then as it's going in

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.889 
the panel and then as it's going in
it'll<00:00:59.609> actually<00:00:59.760> hit<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.149> child<00:01:00.390> restraint

it'll actually hit the child restraint

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.630 
it'll actually hit the child restraint
and<00:01:01.050> then<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.469> child<00:01:01.649> restraint<00:01:02.160> with<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
and eventually hit me the test that we

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.580 
and eventually hit me the test that we

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
the collision it really can replicate

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.160 
the collision it really can replicate
what<00:01:29.159> we<00:01:29.189> see<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.759> field<00:01:30.119> we're<00:01:31.049> not

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
what we see in the field we're not

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.350 
what we see in the field we're not
gaining<00:01:31.409> any<00:01:31.650> more<00:01:31.860> space<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.939> we<00:01:33.090> need<00:01:33.240> to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
gaining any more space so we need to

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.780 
gaining any more space so we need to
develop<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.930> design<00:01:34.049> mechanisms<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:35.220> will

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
develop and design mechanisms that will

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.120 
develop and design mechanisms that will
cushion<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.720> blow<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.290> transfer<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.009> energy

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
cushion the blow and transfer the energy

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.770 
cushion the blow and transfer the energy
away<00:01:38.549> from<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.880> occupant<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> best<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.720> we

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
away from the occupant the best that we

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.020 
away from the occupant the best that we
can<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.560> what<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.579> air<00:01:41.670> protect

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
can so what we have in the air protect

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.940 
can so what we have in the air protect
technology<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.990> we<00:01:43.140> have<00:01:43.290> two<00:01:43.470> chambers

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
technology is is we have two chambers

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.039 
technology is is we have two chambers
and<00:01:44.399> what<00:01:44.549> actually<00:01:44.939> happens<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.810> air

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
and what actually happens is the air

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.039 
and what actually happens is the air
comes<00:01:46.950> out<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.280> two<00:01:47.430> ports<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.720> not<00:01:48.869> an

comes out of two ports it's not an

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
trauma or risk of injury is that to the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
head and neck how does watch head

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.620 
head and neck how does watch head
rotation<00:02:02.159> as<00:02:02.850> we<00:02:03.060> have<00:02:03.210> here

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
rotation as we have here

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.380 
rotation as we have here
so<00:02:04.259> if<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.469> have<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.979> up<00:02:05.430> by<00:02:05.700> your<00:02:05.850> head<00:02:06.060> and

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
so if you have this up by your head and

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.900 
so if you have this up by your head and
as<00:02:07.170> I'm<00:02:07.409> hitting<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.950> it's<00:02:08.489> going<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.759> be

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
as I'm hitting it it's going to be

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.270 
as I'm hitting it it's going to be
