00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
I saw a guy come on to hardcore server

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.130 
I saw a guy come on to hardcore server
using<00:00:23.760> notches<00:00:24.150> account<00:00:24.480> but<00:00:24.810> since<00:00:25.050> he

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
using notches account but since he

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.769 
using notches account but since he
didn't<00:00:25.350> type<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.680> gold<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.340> wasn't<00:00:27.060> notch<00:00:27.359> but

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
still that means that somebody had

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.930

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
didn't realize it at the time but that

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.520 
didn't realize it at the time but that
was<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:36.739> sign<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.890> worse<00:00:38.250> things<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.879> come

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
was a sign of worse things to come

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.270 
to me Mojang had a vulnerability in
their<00:00:47.670> authentication<00:00:48.570> system<00:00:49.050> wherein<00:00:49.890> if

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
their authentication system wherein if

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.450 
their authentication system wherein if
an<00:00:50.700> account<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:51.149> migrated<00:00:51.949> the<00:00:52.949> hackers<00:00:53.309> had

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
an account was migrated the hackers had

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.400 
an account was migrated the hackers had
figured<00:00:53.670> out<00:00:53.850> how<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> login<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:54.930> basically

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
figured out how to login as basically

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.330 
figured out how to login as basically
that<00:00:56.039> player<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:57.360> while<00:00:57.809> bypassing<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:59.039> need

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
that player and while bypassing the need

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.369 
that player and while bypassing the need
for<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> password<00:00:59.850> completely<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.989> that's<00:01:01.170> that

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
for a password completely so that's that

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.840 
for a password completely so that's that
they<00:01:01.680> had<00:01:01.800> kind<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.160> come<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.460> as<00:01:02.609> notch

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
they had kind of come on as notch

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.600 
they had kind of come on as notch
notches<00:01:03.329> account<00:01:03.600> had<00:01:03.780> been<00:01:03.809> migrated<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:04.920> BAM

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
notches account had been migrated so BAM

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.030 
notches account had been migrated so BAM
there<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.540> going<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.110> random<00:01:07.409> server<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:07.950> if

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
there is going on to random server so if

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.289 
there is going on to random server so if
you<00:01:08.159> saw<00:01:08.400> him<00:01:08.580> out<00:01:08.700> there<00:01:08.880> might<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.180> been

hacking and I quote we'll just have to

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.160 
hacking and I quote we'll just have to
see<00:02:34.400> what<00:02:34.700> exploits<00:02:35.269> they<00:02:35.599> have<00:02:35.810> in<00:02:36.019> 1.3<00:02:36.530> a

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
see what exploits they have in 1.3 a

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.809 
see what exploits they have in 1.3 a
little<00:02:39.170> bit<00:02:39.260> grim<00:02:39.620> really<00:02:40.010> but<00:02:40.250> when<00:02:40.549> it<00:02:40.640> comes

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
little bit grim really but when it comes

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.970 
little bit grim really but when it comes
to<00:02:41.030> griefers<00:02:41.569> that<00:02:42.049> is<00:02:42.290> really<00:02:42.709> where<00:02:42.890> they

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
to griefers that is really where they

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.710 
to griefers that is really where they
get<00:02:43.099> their<00:02:43.220> fun<00:02:43.459> in<00:02:43.549> the<00:02:43.640> game<00:02:43.819> at<00:02:44.090> ruining<00:02:44.510> the

experience<00:02:44.870> for<00:02:45.440> everyone<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.950> thought<00:02:46.340> I'd

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
experience for everyone I thought I'd

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.119

about it because that makes it look like

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.910 
about it because that makes it look like
they're<00:02:58.670> vulnerable<00:02:59.230> in<00:03:00.230> this<00:03:00.409> case<00:03:00.620> though

they're vulnerable in this case though
this<00:03:01.370> is<00:03:01.549> a<00:03:01.579> serious<00:03:02.150> exploit<00:03:02.659> that<00:03:02.900> I'm<00:03:03.440> sure

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
this is a serious exploit that I'm sure

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.050 
this is a serious exploit that I'm sure
a<00:03:03.680> lot<00:03:03.799> of<00:03:03.980> other<00:03:04.159> servers<00:03:04.640> out<00:03:04.760> there<00:03:04.819> were

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
a lot of other servers out there were

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.910 
a lot of other servers out there were
possibly<00:03:05.569> hit<00:03:05.780> by<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.140> I'd<00:03:06.230> kind<00:03:06.650> of<00:03:06.709> like<00:03:06.769> to

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
possibly hit by and I'd kind of like to

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.190 
possibly hit by and I'd kind of like to
wonder<00:03:07.250> if<00:03:08.090> they<00:03:08.299> could<00:03:08.480> put<00:03:08.629> up<00:03:08.720> some<00:03:08.870> videos

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
wonder if they could put up some videos

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.259 
wonder if they could put up some videos
of<00:03:09.379> what<00:03:09.470> that<00:03:09.650> was<00:03:09.799> like<00:03:09.829> to<00:03:12.909> but<00:03:13.909> at<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.090> same

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
of what that was like to but at the same

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.349 
of what that was like to but at the same
time<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:16.010> know<00:03:16.130> we<00:03:16.340> are<00:03:16.489> kind<00:03:16.819> of<00:03:16.940> safe<00:03:17.120> for

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
time you know we are kind of safe for

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.720 
time you know we are kind of safe for
now<00:03:17.480> but<00:03:17.750> is<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:18.650> bit<00:03:18.859> of<00:03:18.950> a<00:03:19.010> darker<00:03:19.310> side<00:03:19.340> that

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
now but is a bit of a darker side that

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.400 
now but is a bit of a darker side that
if<00:03:19.790> you<00:03:19.880> did<00:03:20.060> see<00:03:20.239> notch<00:03:20.480> wandering<00:03:21.049> around<00:03:21.139> on

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
if you did see notch wandering around on

if you did see notch wandering around on
your<00:03:21.500> server<00:03:21.769> this<00:03:22.040> thing<00:03:22.660> could<00:03:23.660> have

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
your server this thing could have

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.940 
your server this thing could have

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
games out there I think we all need to

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.360 
games out there I think we all need to
take<00:03:38.510> a<00:03:38.629> moment<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:39.200> just<00:03:39.349> realize<00:03:39.889> that<00:03:39.919> there

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
take a moment to just realize that there

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.750 
take a moment to just realize that there

are people behind these screens people

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.250 
are people behind these screens people
with<00:03:43.879> feelings<00:03:44.090> that<00:03:44.480> care<00:03:44.720> about<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:45.049> things

that<00:03:45.349> they<00:03:45.590> do<00:03:45.650> I<00:03:46.569> mean<00:03:47.569> I<00:03:47.750> know<00:03:47.870> hacking<00:03:48.590> and

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
that they do I mean I know hacking and
