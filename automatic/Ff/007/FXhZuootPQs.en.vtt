00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
because turmeric tends to splatter so

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.540 
because turmeric tends to splatter so
why<00:01:37.410> stir<00:01:38.410> it<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.650> whole<00:01:38.830> time

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
why stir it the whole time

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.410 
why stir it the whole time
I<00:01:39.580> keep<00:01:40.240> a<00:01:40.390> damp<00:01:40.660> rag<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:42.430> case<00:01:42.640> it<00:01:42.850> jumps

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
I keep a damp rag and in case it jumps

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.030 
I keep a damp rag and in case it jumps
out<00:01:43.570> of<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.720> pot<00:01:43.930> which<00:01:44.110> is<00:01:44.140> when<00:01:44.440> using<00:01:44.770> a

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
out of the pot which is when using a

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.540 
out of the pot which is when using a
little<00:01:45.310> larger<00:01:45.940> pot<00:01:46.210> here<00:01:50.190> this<00:01:51.190> makes<00:01:51.430> about

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
little larger pot here this makes about

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:59.380 
little larger pot here this makes about
8<00:01:51.910> ounces<00:01:52.390> when<00:01:52.600> it's<00:01:52.750> all<00:01:53.130> done

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.490 

let's<00:02:00.140> right<00:02:00.320> now<00:02:00.470> I<00:02:01.450> have<00:02:02.450> this<00:02:02.660> on<00:02:02.900> medium

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
let's right now I have this on medium

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.680 
let's right now I have this on medium
medium-high<00:02:03.980> Justin<00:02:04.820> so<00:02:05.000> starts<00:02:05.390> to<00:02:05.510> bubble

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
medium-high Justin so starts to bubble

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.690 
medium-high Justin so starts to bubble
and<00:02:06.050> I'll<00:02:06.140> turn<00:02:06.350> down<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.800> low<00:02:07.929> and<00:02:08.929> I<00:02:08.990> do<00:02:09.170> that

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
and I'll turn down to low and I do that

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.470 
and I'll turn down to low and I do that
so<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.910> turmeric<00:02:11.630> doesn't<00:02:12.080> jump<00:02:12.260> out<00:02:12.440> of<00:02:13.480> this

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
so the turmeric doesn't jump out of this

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:43.360 
so the turmeric doesn't jump out of this
pot

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.920
