gentleman science and this block is a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.540 
gentleman science and this block is a
really<00:00:48.270> really<00:00:48.450> strange<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.800> doesn't

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
really really strange that doesn't

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.029 
really really strange that doesn't

configure normally to the block block
sizes<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.640> Minecraft<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.300> two<00:00:54.690> blocks<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.230> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
sizes of Minecraft it's two blocks and a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.610 
sizes of Minecraft it's two blocks and a
bit<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:56.610> really<00:00:57.149> weird<00:00:57.390> here's<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.320> third

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
bit it's really weird here's a third

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.590 
bit it's really weird here's a third
block<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.579> really<00:00:59.850> cool<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.420> can

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
block and it's really cool that you can

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.810 
block and it's really cool that you can
see<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.140> sort<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.350> overextends<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
see that it's sort of overextends on the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.299 
see that it's sort of overextends on the
clock<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.420> inventory<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.949> sort<00:01:05.250> of

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
clock in the inventory and it sort of

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.890 
clock in the inventory and it sort of
sticks<00:01:05.760> out<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.240> if<00:01:06.360> you're<00:01:06.510> holding<00:01:06.780> it

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
sticks out and if you're holding it

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.090 
sticks out and if you're holding it
looks<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.229> you're<00:01:07.350> holding<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.740> nice<00:01:07.890> little

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
looks like you're holding a nice little

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.390 
looks like you're holding a nice little
postcard<00:01:08.700> or<00:01:08.880> something<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:09.900> here<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> nice

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
postcard or something but here is a nice

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.390 
postcard or something but here is a nice
little<00:01:11.670> stick<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.570> cane<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.500> where<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.250> do

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
little stick a cane and where you can do

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.210 
little stick a cane and where you can do
is<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.909> actually<00:01:15.420> amazing<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.470> we<00:01:17.040> can

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
is this is actually amazing and we can

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.609 
is this is actually amazing and we can
do<00:01:17.369> see<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.150> spinning<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:18.840> eventually<00:01:19.320> it

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
do see it spinning but eventually it

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.890 
do see it spinning but eventually it
spins<00:01:19.950> faster<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.640> faster<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.210> faster<00:01:21.390> and

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
spins faster and faster and faster and

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.230 
spins faster and faster and faster and
once<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.950> spin<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.310> fast<00:01:23.580> enough<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.970> can

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
once you spin it fast enough you can

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.120 
once you spin it fast enough you can
actually<00:01:24.420> travel<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> destination<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:26.070> if

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
actually travel to the destination so if

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.219 
actually travel to the destination so if
I<00:01:26.220> spin<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.580> slowly<00:01:26.970> you'll<00:01:27.479> only<00:01:27.689> travel<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
I spin it slowly you'll only travel a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.960 
I spin it slowly you'll only travel a
shorter<00:01:28.650> distance<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.130> if<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.340> spin<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:29.939> a

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
shorter distance so if you spin it for a

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.149 
shorter distance so if you spin it for a
while<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.360> 45<00:01:30.780> minutes<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.409> do<00:01:31.650> believe<00:01:31.860> it's

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
while like 45 minutes I do believe it's

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.340 
while like 45 minutes I do believe it's
capped<00:01:32.490> off<00:01:32.670> at<00:01:32.880> some<00:01:33.090> point<00:01:33.360> but<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:34.200> can

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
capped off at some point but you can

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.899 
capped off at some point but you can
walk<00:01:34.530> slowly<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.220> it's<00:01:35.369> sort<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.610> like<00:01:35.729> your

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
walk slowly so it's sort of like your

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.760 
walk slowly so it's sort of like your
shift<00:01:36.210> walking<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:36.900> see<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.110> you

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
shift walking and you can see that you

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.609 
shift walking and you can see that you
get<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.950> some<00:01:38.460> stage<00:01:38.759> like<00:01:39.390> now<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.079> it's<00:01:40.439> just

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
get to some stage like now and it's just

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.410 
get to some stage like now and it's just
going<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.130> fast<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:41.909> travel<00:01:42.150> anywhere

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
going so fast you can travel anywhere

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.679 
going so fast you can travel anywhere
that<00:01:43.200> say<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:43.560> flat<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.399> if<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.700> travel<00:01:45.450> over

should be I do believe it's the void
actually<00:02:42.230> messing<00:02:42.680> messing<00:02:43.550> around<00:02:43.670> because

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
actually messing messing around because

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.050 
actually messing messing around because
we're<00:02:44.390> so<00:02:44.600> low<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:45.680> this<00:02:46.280> one<00:02:46.489> is<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.730> liquid

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
we're so low and this one is a liquid

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.960 
we're so low and this one is a liquid
nitrogen<00:02:47.630> you<00:02:47.840> can<00:02:48.050> craft<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.470> like<00:02:48.650> this<00:02:48.860> and

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
nitrogen you can craft it like this and

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.060 
nitrogen you can craft it like this and
liquid<00:02:49.970> nitrogen<00:02:50.330> and<00:02:50.660> mystery<00:02:51.260> pod<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.860> the

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
liquid nitrogen and mystery pod and the

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.979 
liquid nitrogen and mystery pod and the
liquid<00:02:52.220> nitrogen<00:02:52.790> just<00:02:53.120> freezes<00:02:53.720> everything

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
liquid nitrogen just freezes everything

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.500 
liquid nitrogen just freezes everything
which<00:02:54.380> is<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:54.620> quite<00:02:55.370> bad<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.880> just<00:02:55.910> stutters

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
which is a quite bad it just stutters

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.610 
which is a quite bad it just stutters
everything<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:57.050> just<00:02:57.080> going<00:02:57.320> to<00:02:57.380> place

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
everything so just going to place

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.590 
everything so just going to place
another<00:02:58.280> one<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:58.760> what<00:02:58.850> can<00:02:58.940> I<00:02:59.030> place<00:02:59.269> it<00:02:59.450> and

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
another one and what can I place it and

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.660 
another one and what can I place it and
just<00:03:00.140> freezes<00:03:00.769> you<00:03:00.890> which<00:03:01.070> is<00:03:01.100> that<00:03:01.400> quite

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
just freezes you which is that quite

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.820 
just freezes you which is that quite
annoying<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:02.239> this<00:03:02.540> is<00:03:02.690> this<00:03:02.989> effect<00:03:03.410> is<00:03:03.500> also

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
annoying and this is this effect is also

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.509 
annoying and this is this effect is also
annoying<00:03:04.070> so<00:03:04.790> I<00:03:05.380> let's<00:03:06.380> see<00:03:06.620> where<00:03:06.800> frozen<00:03:07.340> and

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
annoying so I let's see where frozen and

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.130 
annoying so I let's see where frozen and
we<00:03:07.610> can't<00:03:07.880> move<00:03:08.090> any<00:03:08.330> way<00:03:08.450> you<00:03:08.510> can<00:03:08.690> see<00:03:08.930> that

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
we can't move any way you can see that

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.430 
we can't move any way you can see that
there<00:03:09.380> is<00:03:09.530> a<00:03:09.680> sort<00:03:09.980> of<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.130> a<00:03:10.310> IC<00:03:11.120> IC<00:03:11.360> skin<00:03:12.170> to<00:03:12.320> us

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
there is a sort of a a IC IC skin to us

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.380 
there is a sort of a a IC IC skin to us
and<00:03:12.709> then<00:03:12.830> we<00:03:12.950> can't<00:03:13.190> move<00:03:13.340> anywhere<00:03:13.640> we're

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
and then we can't move anywhere we're

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.990 
and then we can't move anywhere we're
stuck<00:03:14.750> I'm<00:03:14.989> and<00:03:15.290> jumping<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:16.070> moving<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.640> I'm

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
stuck I'm and jumping a moving and I'm

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.750 
stuck I'm and jumping a moving and I'm
stuck<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:17.900> i<00:03:17.930> spawned<00:03:18.470> multiple<00:03:19.190> clocks<00:03:19.519> and

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
stuck so i spawned multiple clocks and

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.580 
stuck so i spawned multiple clocks and
you<00:03:19.820> can<00:03:19.940> see<00:03:20.150> that<00:03:20.180> they<00:03:20.870> all<00:03:20.900> work<00:03:21.290> at<00:03:21.470> the

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
you can see that they all work at the

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.020 
you can see that they all work at the
same<00:03:21.769> time<00:03:22.010> because<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:22.340> know<00:03:22.519> that<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.730> lot<00:03:22.820> of

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
same time because I know that a lot of

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.340 
same time because I know that a lot of
people<00:03:23.120> will<00:03:23.450> be<00:03:23.540> asking<00:03:23.690> can<00:03:24.079> you<00:03:24.110> spawn

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
people will be asking can you spawn

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.800 
people will be asking can you spawn
multiple<00:03:24.860> clocks<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.430> yes<00:03:25.640> you<00:03:25.790> can<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.299> I

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
multiple clocks and yes you can and I
