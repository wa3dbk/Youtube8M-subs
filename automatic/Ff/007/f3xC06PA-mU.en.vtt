00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
can steal Barry's powers I like the fact

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.770 
can steal Barry's powers I like the fact
that<00:03:31.709> Grodd<00:03:32.010> called<00:03:32.459> Wells<00:03:32.609> father<00:03:33.150> as<00:03:33.480> if

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
that Grodd called Wells father as if

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.000 
that Grodd called Wells father as if
it's<00:03:33.900> like<00:03:33.989> some<00:03:34.170> sort<00:03:34.319> of<00:03:34.379> Frankenstein<00:03:34.980> or

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
it's like some sort of Frankenstein or

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.550 
it's like some sort of Frankenstein or
island<00:03:35.670> of<00:03:35.760> dr.<00:03:36.060> Moreau<00:03:36.299> type<00:03:36.569> thing<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:37.019> think

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
island of dr. Moreau type thing I think

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.899 
island of dr. Moreau type thing I think
it<00:03:37.650> would<00:03:37.739> be<00:03:37.769> closer<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.159> island<00:03:38.519> of<00:03:38.609> dr.

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
it would be closer to island of dr.

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:40.429 
it would be closer to island of dr.
Moreau<00:03:39.090> because<00:03:39.569> Grodd<00:03:39.810> wasn't<00:03:40.200> dead<00:03:40.409> to

Moreau because Grodd wasn't dead to
begin<00:03:40.650> with<00:03:40.889> it<00:03:41.040> wasn't<00:03:41.250> like<00:03:41.340> he<00:03:41.489> brought

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
begin with it wasn't like he brought

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
model of Grodd I I think he looks

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.770 
model of Grodd I I think he looks
amazing<00:03:59.069> for<00:03:59.280> a<00:03:59.340> TV<00:03:59.609> budget<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.569> good<00:04:00.750> thing

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
amazing for a TV budget the good thing

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.539 
amazing for a TV budget the good thing
the<00:04:01.200> really<00:04:01.500> good<00:04:01.620> thing<00:04:01.829> about<00:04:01.980> this<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.459> that

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
the really good thing about this is that

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.240 
the really good thing about this is that
as<00:04:02.939> we<00:04:03.480> get<00:04:03.629> on<00:04:03.840> in<00:04:04.049> years<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.530> gets<00:04:04.769> cheaper

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
as we get on in years it gets cheaper

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.920 
as we get on in years it gets cheaper
and<00:04:05.459> cheaper<00:04:05.519> to<00:04:05.970> do<00:04:06.090> digital<00:04:06.299> effects<00:04:06.720> like

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
and cheaper to do digital effects like

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.240 
and cheaper to do digital effects like
this<00:04:07.139> it's<00:04:07.439> just<00:04:07.500> easier<00:04:07.829> and<00:04:07.950> easier<00:04:07.980> for

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
this it's just easier and easier for

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.440 
this it's just easier and easier for
them<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.370> do<00:04:08.519> it<00:04:08.609> so<00:04:08.909> by<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.060> time<00:04:09.209> we<00:04:09.329> get<00:04:09.389> to

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
them to do it so by the time we get to

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.539 
them to do it so by the time we get to
like<00:04:09.629> flash<00:04:09.959> season<00:04:10.230> 5<00:04:10.590> it'll<00:04:11.159> be<00:04:11.250> way<00:04:11.519> cheaper

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
like flash season 5 it'll be way cheaper

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.789 
like flash season 5 it'll be way cheaper
for<00:04:12.120> them<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.329> use<00:04:12.480> Grodd<00:04:12.780> so<00:04:13.530> if<00:04:13.590> you<00:04:13.650> ever

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
for them to use Grodd so if you ever

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:14.990 
for them to use Grodd so if you ever
wondered<00:04:13.919> if<00:04:14.400> we're<00:04:14.549> going<00:04:14.639> to<00:04:14.699> get<00:04:14.849> to

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
wondered if we're going to get to

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.729 
wondered if we're going to get to
gorilla<00:04:15.299> City<00:04:15.599> or<00:04:15.870> anything<00:04:16.199> crazy<00:04:16.380> like<00:04:16.590> that

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
gorilla City or anything crazy like that

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.640 
gorilla City or anything crazy like that
or<00:04:17.070> so<00:04:17.280> lavar<00:04:17.609> think<00:04:18.150> season<00:04:18.479> 3<00:04:18.750> 4<00:04:18.989> 5<00:04:19.199> it<00:04:19.500> just

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
or so lavar think season 3 4 5 it just

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.199 
or so lavar think season 3 4 5 it just
gets<00:04:19.799> way<00:04:20.010> easier<00:04:20.370> way<00:04:20.519> cheaper<00:04:20.849> for<00:04:21.000> them<00:04:21.030> to

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
gets way easier way cheaper for them to

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.149 
gets way easier way cheaper for them to
do<00:04:21.329> it<00:04:21.449> and<00:04:21.630> for<00:04:22.199> those<00:04:22.260> asking<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.949> same

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
do it and for those asking the same

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.250 
do it and for those asking the same
actor<00:04:23.610> that's<00:04:23.820> voicing<00:04:24.389> Grodd<00:04:24.599> is<00:04:24.780> also

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
actor that's voicing Grodd is also

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.930 
actor that's voicing Grodd is also
voicing<00:04:25.710> Drax<00:04:26.039> the<00:04:26.190> destroyer<00:04:26.280> in<00:04:26.880> the

the episode will run long so they ought

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:55.790 
the episode will run long so they ought
to<00:04:53.940> just<00:04:54.030> cut<00:04:54.360> stuff<00:04:54.659> so<00:04:55.260> we<00:04:55.320> might<00:04:55.440> see<00:04:55.590> a<00:04:55.620> lot

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
to just cut stuff so we might see a lot

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.950

what<00:04:58.650> I'm<00:04:58.740> hoping<00:04:58.889> is<00:04:59.130> is<00:04:59.190> that<00:04:59.460> a<00:04:59.490> lot<00:04:59.880> of

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
what I'm hoping is is that a lot of

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.189 
what I'm hoping is is that a lot of
times<00:05:00.180> they<00:05:00.389> end<00:05:00.479> up<00:05:00.570> cutting<00:05:00.750> scenes<00:05:01.050> like

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
times they end up cutting scenes like

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.020 
times they end up cutting scenes like
that<00:05:01.409> they'll<00:05:01.770> just<00:05:01.919> release<00:05:02.250> them<00:05:02.430> as<00:05:02.610> clips

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
that they'll just release them as clips

that they'll just release them as clips

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
case scenario we'll just have to wait

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.750 
case scenario we'll just have to wait
like<00:05:35.180> a<00:05:35.360> year<00:05:35.420> to<00:05:36.230> see<00:05:36.410> Supergirl<00:05:36.890> because

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
they finish the pilot what I'm really

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.510 
they finish the pilot what I'm really
hoping<00:05:39.440> though<00:05:39.590> is<00:05:39.770> that<00:05:39.830> they'll<00:05:40.130> air<00:05:40.340> to

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
hoping though is that they'll air to

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.800 
hoping though is that they'll air to
comic-con<00:05:40.850> but<00:05:41.240> they<00:05:41.330> haven't<00:05:41.480> confirmed

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
comic-con but they haven't confirmed

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.080 
comic-con but they haven't confirmed
anything<00:05:42.160> comic-con<00:05:43.160> is<00:05:43.460> at<00:05:43.610> the<00:05:43.700> beginning

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
anything comic-con is at the beginning

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.730 
anything comic-con is at the beginning
of<00:05:44.150> July<00:05:44.360> so<00:05:44.570> they<00:05:44.690> might<00:05:45.020> say<00:05:45.260> something<00:05:45.620> then

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
of July so they might say something then

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.130 
of July so they might say something then
but<00:05:46.070> if<00:05:46.280> it's<00:05:46.640> so<00:05:46.880> far<00:05:47.300> out<00:05:47.330> they<00:05:47.840> might<00:05:48.020> not

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
but if it's so far out they might not

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.630 
but if it's so far out they might not
spend<00:05:48.440> a<00:05:48.530> whole<00:05:48.620> lot<00:05:48.680> of<00:05:48.860> energy<00:05:48.980> promoting

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
spend a whole lot of energy promoting

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.830 
spend a whole lot of energy promoting
Supergirl<00:05:50.090> they<00:05:50.210> might<00:05:50.330> wait<00:05:50.480> till<00:05:50.660> next

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840
