00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
venturing out of their den and in that

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.550 
venturing out of their den and in that
time<00:02:05.300> they<00:02:05.659> can<00:02:05.720> become<00:02:06.110> separated<00:02:06.470> from

their<00:02:06.740> mom<00:02:06.830> as<00:02:07.070> well<00:02:07.149> becoming<00:02:08.149> orphans<00:02:08.540> so<00:02:09.200> it

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
their mom as well becoming orphans so it

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.190 
their mom as well becoming orphans so it
is<00:02:09.530> otter<00:02:09.890> season<00:02:10.459> right<00:02:10.729> now<00:02:10.760> and<00:02:11.269> clear<00:02:11.930> army

from<00:02:25.019> CMA<00:02:25.650> these<00:02:26.040> two<00:02:26.280> animals<00:02:26.730> were<00:02:26.879> very

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
from CMA these two animals were very

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.630 
from CMA these two animals were very
young<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.510> by<00:02:27.660> themselves<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.769> we<00:02:29.220> went<00:02:29.519> ahead

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
young and by themselves so we went ahead

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.850 
young and by themselves so we went ahead
and<00:02:30.090> got<00:02:30.660> her<00:02:30.780> supplies<00:02:31.110> together<00:02:31.290> went<00:02:31.769> out

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
and got her supplies together went out

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.820 
and got her supplies together went out
to<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.160> scene<00:02:32.400> by<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.209> time<00:02:33.420> we<00:02:33.660> arrived<00:02:34.590> both

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
to the scene by the time we arrived both

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.820 
to the scene by the time we arrived both
animals<00:02:35.250> had<00:02:35.459> moved<00:02:35.790> not<00:02:36.690> very<00:02:36.900> far<00:02:36.989> but<00:02:37.560> to

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
animals had moved not very far but to

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.339 
animals had moved not very far but to
the<00:02:38.099> nearest<00:02:38.280> vehicle<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.290> they<00:02:40.290> were

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
the nearest vehicle and they were

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.530 
the nearest vehicle and they were
basically<00:02:40.739> hovering<00:02:41.580> under<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.090> vehicle

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
basically hovering under that vehicle

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.020 
basically hovering under that vehicle
not<00:02:42.750> really<00:02:43.049> moving<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:44.400> we<00:02:44.519> were<00:02:44.610> able<00:02:44.640> to

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
not really moving so we were able to

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.580 
not really moving so we were able to
check<00:02:45.239> glucose<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:46.110> do<00:02:46.769> a<00:02:47.150> minimal

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
check glucose and do a minimal

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.250 
check glucose and do a minimal
non-invasive<00:02:49.590> physical<00:02:50.129> and<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.370> animal<00:02:50.730> and

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
non-invasive physical and the animal and

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
non-invasive physical and the animal and
provide<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.410> with<00:02:52.440> fluids<00:02:52.860> before<00:02:53.040> we

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
provide it with fluids before we

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.910 
provide it with fluids before we
transported<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:54.750> upon<00:02:55.200> arrival<00:02:55.620> here<00:02:55.829> at

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
transported it so upon arrival here at

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.569 
transported it so upon arrival here at
CMA<00:02:56.400> we<00:02:56.610> did<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.819> more<00:02:57.150> extensive<00:02:57.569> physical

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
CMA we did a more extensive physical

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.770 
CMA we did a more extensive physical
examination<00:02:59.579> and<00:02:59.790> that<00:03:00.060> was<00:03:00.239> studded<00:03:00.599> with

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
examination and that was studded with

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.979 
examination and that was studded with
our<00:03:00.959> veterinarian<00:03:01.500> dr.<00:03:02.280> craig<00:03:02.700> pelton<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.390> he

our veterinarian dr. craig pelton and he
also<00:03:04.380> at<00:03:04.920> that<00:03:05.099> point<00:03:05.370> took<00:03:05.610> blood<00:03:05.910> samples

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
also at that point took blood samples

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.330 
also at that point took blood samples
from<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:06.720> animals<00:03:07.140> we<00:03:07.920> went<00:03:08.129> ahead<00:03:08.190> and

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
from the animals we went ahead and

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.640 
from the animals we went ahead and
weighed<00:03:08.610> them<00:03:08.879> they're<00:03:09.180> weighing<00:03:09.480> in<00:03:09.750> close

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
weighed them they're weighing in close

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.259 
weighed them they're weighing in close
to<00:03:10.829> three<00:03:11.069> pounds<00:03:11.549> and<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.730> other<00:03:11.849> one<00:03:12.030> was

about three and a half pounds and their

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.670 
about three and a half pounds and their
weight<00:03:14.640> is<00:03:14.790> very<00:03:15.120> critical<00:03:15.329> especially<00:03:15.780> at

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
weight is very critical especially at

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.530 
weight is very critical especially at
that<00:03:16.829> age<00:03:19.099> also<00:03:20.099> at<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.549> point<00:03:20.910> we<00:03:21.000> began<00:03:21.480> our

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
overnights anytime we get an otter kit

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.930 
overnights anytime we get an otter kit
in<00:03:24.360> it<00:03:24.660> is<00:03:24.810> 24-7<00:03:25.799> with<00:03:26.069> those<00:03:26.250> animals<00:03:26.760> they
