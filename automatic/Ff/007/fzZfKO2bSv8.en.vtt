00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
and not all of them are fast but

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.299 
and not all of them are fast but
depending<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.110> what<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.380> use<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.800> can<00:00:52.829> really

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
depending on what you use you can really

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.119 
depending on what you use you can really
get<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.030> down<00:00:54.059> there<00:00:54.329> quickly<00:00:54.950> this<00:00:55.950> was

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
get it down there quickly this was

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.069 
get it down there quickly this was
actually<00:00:56.340> quite<00:00:56.610> amusing<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.300> was<00:00:57.420> backing<00:00:57.899> up

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
actually quite amusing I was backing up

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.680 
actually quite amusing I was backing up
because<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.350> saw<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.620> guy<00:00:58.770> over<00:00:58.890> there<00:00:59.040> and

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
because I saw the guy over there and

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.060 
because I saw the guy over there and
crate<00:01:00.719> smashed<00:01:01.140> into<00:01:01.379> me<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.829> gotta<00:01:01.980> be

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
crate smashed into me so you gotta be

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.219 
crate smashed into me so you gotta be
careful<00:01:02.280> when<00:01:02.579> people<00:01:02.940> haven't<00:01:03.239> exited<00:01:04.050> yet

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
careful when people haven't exited yet

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.020 
careful when people haven't exited yet
you<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.470> still<00:01:04.589> get<00:01:04.830> hit<00:01:05.070> as<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.759> can<00:01:05.850> see<00:01:05.940> you

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
you can still get hit as you can see you

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.440 
you can still get hit as you can see you
got<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.270> roll<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.600> down<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.930> fastest<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.450> you

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
got to roll it down the fastest and you

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.560 
got to roll it down the fastest and you
know<00:01:09.570> laser<00:01:10.200> gun<00:01:10.770> sniper<00:01:11.280> rifle<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.000> DMR

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
know laser gun sniper rifle and DMR

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.350 
know laser gun sniper rifle and DMR
seems<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.410> be<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.649> fastest<00:01:14.160> though<00:01:14.399> I've<00:01:14.580> won

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
seems to be the fastest though I've won

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.060 
seems to be the fastest though I've won
a<00:01:15.390> few<00:01:15.630> times<00:01:15.930> using<00:01:16.170> machine<00:01:16.680> gun<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
a few times using machine gun the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.940 
a few times using machine gun the
assault<00:01:17.340> rifle<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:18.080> you<00:01:19.080> know<00:01:19.200> laser<00:01:19.470> rifle

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
assault rifle but you know laser rifle

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.380 
assault rifle but you know laser rifle
seems<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.520> preferred<00:01:20.880> just<00:01:21.210> because

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
seems to be the preferred just because

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.899 
seems to be the preferred just because
it<00:01:21.510> looks<00:01:21.689> awesome<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:23.280> first<00:01:23.460> person<00:01:23.880> to

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
it looks awesome but the first person to

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.539 
it looks awesome but the first person to
get<00:01:24.119> down<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.869> bottom<00:01:25.080> wins<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:26.280> if<00:01:26.400> you

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
get down to the bottom wins but if you

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.609 
get down to the bottom wins but if you
end<00:01:26.760> up<00:01:26.909> tying<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.049> fight<00:01:28.380> to

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
end up tying you have to have a fight to

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.000 
end up tying you have to have a fight to
the<00:01:28.650> death

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
the death

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.219 
the death
so<00:01:29.250> here's<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.610> options<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.119> get<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.479> I

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
labeled them depending on the characters

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.789 
labeled them depending on the characters
that<00:01:33.270> actually<00:01:33.570> use<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> campaign

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799
