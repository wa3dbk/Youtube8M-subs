00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.460
 you 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.320
 very good girls very good guys today 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.570
 I face and we are in a new 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.969
 playstation 4 news of playstation 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.520
 vita and from microsoft I have spoken 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.130
 many times of the remote game they have 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.439
 said that is going to be the characteristic that 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.810
 the definitive boom to the playstation vita 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.320
 the power to play playstation 4 games 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.860
 in Sony's laptop is going to be 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.200
 really the bombshell I think that of the 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.510
 generation produced in some way already 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.820
 I know you could do something similar by 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.820
 other consoles but not in this capacity 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.859
 graphic and has even recorded from 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.530
 microsoft has spoken major nelson has 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.809
 praised to playstation 4 and playstation 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.300
 vita with this option and believe that the game 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.379
 Remote between the view and the playstation 4 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.030
 It's a great feature you already know 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.010
 the microsoft 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.550
 it's not that you intend to do marketing 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:06.170
 sony is that more number are in a 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.390
 interview was blunt and said a trista 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.130
 last said that the players do not 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.060
 like to have the same reduced game in 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.229
 a small screen referring in a 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.409
 beginning to the remote game have 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.090
 precision half and playstation 4 already 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.580
 you know nelson after reviewing these 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.920
 statements and doctor about them has 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.680
 decided to qualify and has said what 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.750
 next well I recognize that maybe in 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.450
 absolute terms was not what 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.960
 I meant to actually say the game 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.610
 remote 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.009
 I think some great feature 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.080
 although I have not had time to try it 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.140
 because I'm too busy for the 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.909
 launch of xbox the truth is that the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.759
 rival company praises 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.469
 your product and attention because I believe 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.399
 that this feature the rebound play 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:55.950
 it's going to be so I say again something that 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.740
 characterizes very precisely the precise half and 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.479
 the precision 4 since being in any 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.750
 site here the least is touched like this 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.490
 play by wifi to any game of 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.330
 accuracy 4 that you have installed in the 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.360
 hard drive because I think an old one 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.920
 last really one pass we will see 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.370
 how it works how it ends up working 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.890
 but you've seen the tests at very many 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.709
 kilometers of the kids and that this time 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.579
 I was looking for playing the bear he won 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:29.519
 almost 16 kilometers from his house and it was a 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:32.370
 last as it went of fluid so already 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.890
 you know microsoft praises sony with his 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.180
 remote play like and favorites see you 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.299
 in the next 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.299
 bye
