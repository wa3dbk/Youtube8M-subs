00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.120
 welcome back to a video tutorial 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.010
 of the dotcom nightmare website 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.320
 we are learning to play the bagpipe 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.060
 traditional Galician and we are with the 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.930
 Exercise number four 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:22.190
 Exercise number 4 is still what 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.460
 which is the development of the scale and 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:30.750
 learn to move your fingers this 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.650
 exercise is very interesting because we 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.740
 will allow to speed up what is the 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.130
 movement of the fingers must be repeated 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.130
 the 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.360
 as much as possible 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.750
 always getting the most sound 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.020
 clean possible and in this case if it is 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.640
 interesting to learn to perform the 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.730
 exercise 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.150
 a certain speed 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.450
 the stated exercise would consist 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.940
 of the first part which is the one we're going 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.640
 to do now in which we are going to 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.880
 develop the scale again but in 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:15.270
 Place your fingers up 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.740
 and download them what we are going to do is upload 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.189
 fingers and lower two to get the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.740
 same scale but a little bit with a little 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.289
 more a bit longer the sound 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.250
 what is achieved with this would be that 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.250
 this 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.050
 with me we are going to try to do it three 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.920
 times 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.340
 and try to repeat what is 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.340
 I'm playing 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.760
 it would be this 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.320
 i 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.230
 plus 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.250
 in this exercise as you see is a little 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.410
 more complicated than the previous ones 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.780
 if you have done in the others 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.030
 exercises like 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.200
 it must be with patience and with time 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.140
 you will find that this exercise does not 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.860
 it becomes very complicated this is the step 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.680
 prior to realizing what is a 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.150
 a song because I have to remind you that 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.519
 the 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.120
 songs are not scales but they are 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:59.930
 random movements of the fingers what 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.019
 what are we going to achieve with this is to catch 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.000
 a little agility in the movement 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:08.060
 sautÃ©ed from the fingers that then 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.609
 we will apply to the subject of doing what 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.000
 which is our first song with 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.210
 flute 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.930
 the second part of this of this scale 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:23.690
 or the second exercise with this scale 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.690
 of exercise 4 would be to perform 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.440
 the movement up and down 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.840
 that you can go including as it will be 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.970
 so then in the next video 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.320
 let's check to see if you have a bit of 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:42.650
 initiative and you can think or get to 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:47.090
 decipher how it can be what is the 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:50.410
 scale down this exercise what 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.410
 we will see in the next video
