00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
pedestal it flips upside down then you

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.480 
pedestal it flips upside down then you
take<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> top<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> cake<00:01:46.890> stand<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.340> it

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
this isn't something that I designed it

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.130 
this isn't something that I designed it
actually<00:01:53.790> was<00:01:53.909> made<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.299> do<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.049> if

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140

freeze when the ice block forms and will

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.030 
freeze when the ice block forms and will
create<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.480> really<00:02:49.810> nice<00:02:50.140> decorative<00:02:50.590> effect

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
shining through the ice once it's

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.010 
shining through the ice once it's
actually<00:03:03.580> formed<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.209> then<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:04.810> can<00:03:04.900> also

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
actually formed and then you can also

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.490 
actually formed and then you can also
throw<00:03:05.260> in<00:03:05.320> about<00:03:05.800> 5<00:03:06.130> to<00:03:06.340> 6<00:03:06.489> fresh<00:03:06.850> raspberries

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
and at this point this is all gonna be

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.160 
and at this point this is all gonna be
floating<00:03:10.180> around<00:03:10.270> and<00:03:10.540> looks<00:03:10.720> like<00:03:10.780> kind<00:03:11.020> of<00:03:11.080> a

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
floating around and looks like kind of a

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.990 
floating around and looks like kind of a
mask<00:03:11.410> that<00:03:11.530> is<00:03:11.709> okay<00:03:12.220> because<00:03:12.670> we<00:03:12.760> were<00:03:12.910> gonna

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
mask that is okay because we were gonna

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.880 
mask that is okay because we were gonna
take<00:03:13.239> this<00:03:13.420> whole<00:03:13.600> thing<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.050> pop<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.680> in<00:03:14.770> our

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
take this whole thing and pop it in our

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.740 
take this whole thing and pop it in our
freezer<00:03:15.220> then<00:03:15.670> once<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.150> get<00:03:16.360> it<00:03:16.540> in<00:03:16.660> the

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
freezer then once you get it in the

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.180 
freezer then once you get it in the
freezer<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.350> juice<00:03:17.560> sort<00:03:17.830> of<00:03:17.920> settles

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
freezer and the juice sort of settles

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.039 
freezer and the juice sort of settles
down<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:18.700> nothing's<00:03:19.000> moving<00:03:19.239> anymore<00:03:19.540> you

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
down and nothing's moving anymore you

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.420 
down and nothing's moving anymore you
can<00:03:20.170> go<00:03:20.320> in<00:03:20.440> with<00:03:20.470> your<00:03:20.680> hands<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.250> just

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
can go in with your hands and just

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.430 
can go in with your hands and just
reposition<00:03:22.299> the<00:03:22.420> fruit<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.840> herbs<00:03:23.019> just

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
reposition the fruit and the herbs just

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.990 
reposition the fruit and the herbs just
to<00:03:23.560> make<00:03:23.709> sure<00:03:23.830> that<00:03:23.950> it's<00:03:24.100> well<00:03:24.340> distributed

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
to make sure that it's well distributed

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.460 
to make sure that it's well distributed
because<00:03:25.269> remember<00:03:25.600> it's<00:03:25.870> going<00:03:26.049> to<00:03:26.170> freeze

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
because remember it's going to freeze

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.050 
because remember it's going to freeze
this<00:03:26.739> way<00:03:26.950> so<00:03:27.280> if<00:03:27.400> everything<00:03:27.610> starts<00:03:28.000> to

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
this way so if everything starts to

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.789 
this way so if everything starts to
gather<00:03:28.299> on<00:03:28.570> one<00:03:28.720> side<00:03:28.959> you're<00:03:29.350> gonna<00:03:29.440> end<00:03:29.680> up

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
gather on one side you're gonna end up

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:30.930 
gather on one side you're gonna end up
with<00:03:29.920> an<00:03:30.070> ice<00:03:30.160> block<00:03:30.310> with<00:03:30.580> a<00:03:30.610> bunch<00:03:30.760> of<00:03:30.820> fruit

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
with an ice block with a bunch of fruit

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.640 
with an ice block with a bunch of fruit
on<00:03:31.060> one<00:03:31.180> side<00:03:31.360> so<00:03:31.750> just<00:03:31.780> go<00:03:32.019> ahead<00:03:32.140> and<00:03:32.440> spread

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
on one side so just go ahead and spread

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.220 
on one side so just go ahead and spread
it<00:03:32.799> out<00:03:32.890> evenly<00:03:33.299> now<00:03:34.299> this<00:03:34.510> does<00:03:34.780> need<00:03:35.110> to

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
it out evenly now this does need to

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.860 
it out evenly now this does need to
freeze<00:03:35.530> overnight<00:03:36.040> so<00:03:36.640> you<00:03:36.700> do<00:03:37.060> need<00:03:37.390> to<00:03:37.600> plan

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
freeze overnight so you do need to plan

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.259 
freeze overnight so you do need to plan
ahead<00:03:38.200> this<00:03:38.920> is<00:03:38.980> a<00:03:39.130> big<00:03:39.400> block<00:03:39.610> of<00:03:39.640> ice<00:03:39.910> and

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
ahead this is a big block of ice and

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.300 
ahead this is a big block of ice and
it's<00:03:40.390> just<00:03:40.720> gonna<00:03:40.900> take<00:03:41.170> at<00:03:41.380> least<00:03:41.410> 8<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.010> 10

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
it's just gonna take at least 8 to 10

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.550 
it's just gonna take at least 8 to 10
hours<00:03:42.489> so<00:03:42.880> you're<00:03:43.269> better<00:03:43.480> off<00:03:43.540> doing<00:03:43.900> it<00:03:44.200> the

you to release this juice block it's

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.380 
you to release this juice block it's
gonna<00:04:14.799> be<00:04:14.950> a<00:04:14.980> lot<00:04:15.130> easier<00:04:15.519> to<00:04:15.700> actually<00:04:15.730> remove

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
gonna be a lot easier to actually remove

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.509 
gonna be a lot easier to actually remove
it<00:04:16.600> if<00:04:16.900> it's<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:17.169> little<00:04:17.200> bit<00:04:17.470> loose<00:04:17.680> then<00:04:18.489> you

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
it if it's a little bit loose then you

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.520 
it if it's a little bit loose then you
can<00:04:18.700> go<00:04:18.790> ahead<00:04:18.880> and<00:04:19.060> remove<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.780> ice<00:04:19.810> ring<00:04:20.260> out
