00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
tutorial on how to beat the CTF or

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.329 
tutorial on how to beat the CTF or
capture<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:04.259> flag<00:00:04.500> mission<00:00:04.830> in<00:00:04.920> Assassin's

capture the flag mission in Assassin's

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.000 
capture the flag mission in Assassin's
Creed<00:00:05.490> 2<00:00:06.140> so<00:00:07.140> this<00:00:07.259> was<00:00:07.410> really<00:00:07.589> knowing<00:00:07.859> if

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
Creed 2 so this was really knowing if

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.280 
Creed 2 so this was really knowing if
you<00:00:08.069> don't<00:00:08.250> know<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.460> way<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.610> go<00:00:08.849> but<00:00:09.450> in<00:00:10.050> this

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
you don't know the way to go but in this

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.919 
you don't know the way to go but in this
video<00:00:10.530> I'll<00:00:10.650> show<00:00:10.830> you<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.980> really<00:00:11.219> good<00:00:11.429> path

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:11.929 
video I'll show you a really good path

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.079 
video I'll show you a really good path
that<00:00:12.929> it's<00:00:13.440> really<00:00:13.710> hard<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.950> pull<00:00:14.130> off<00:00:14.280> so

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
that it's really hard to pull off so

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.820 
that it's really hard to pull off so
before<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.450> do<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:15.719> make<00:00:15.960> sure<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.350> stock<00:00:16.650> up

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
before you do this make sure to stock up

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.269 
before you do this make sure to stock up
on<00:00:16.980> some<00:00:17.220> medicine<00:00:18.529> because<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.920> will<00:00:20.130> be

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
on some medicine because you will be

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:30.560 
on some medicine because you will be
taking<00:00:20.550> some<00:00:20.699> fall<00:00:20.820> damage<00:00:29.150> so<00:00:30.150> as<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.449> can

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
taking some fall damage so as you can

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.060 
taking some fall damage so as you can
see<00:00:30.779> in<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.929> video<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.199> don't<00:00:31.349> actually<00:00:31.830> have

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
see in the video I don't actually have

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.209 
see in the video I don't actually have
that<00:00:32.309> much<00:00:32.369> health<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.600> it's<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.620> bit<00:00:34.739> safer<00:00:35.130> if

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
that much health so it's a bit safer if

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.970 
that much health so it's a bit safer if
you<00:00:35.280> had<00:00:35.460> some<00:00:35.670> armor<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.120> but<00:00:36.620> with<00:00:37.620> my<00:00:37.770> health

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
you had some armor on but with my health

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.040 
you had some armor on but with my health
I<00:00:38.129> did<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.399> no<00:00:38.520> problem<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.390> just<00:00:39.690> follow<00:00:39.930> this

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
I did it no problem so just follow this

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.340 
I did it no problem so just follow this
path<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:41.000> jump<00:00:42.000> just<00:00:42.540> before<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.960> reach<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
path and jump just before you reach the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.740 
path and jump just before you reach the
ledge<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.800> way<00:00:43.950> you'll<00:00:44.100> end<00:00:44.850> up<00:00:45.300> right<00:00:45.539> in

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
ledge that way you'll end up right in

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.400 
ledge that way you'll end up right in
front<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.050> flag<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.940> then<00:00:47.960> at<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.140> point

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
front of the flag and then at this point

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.369 
front of the flag and then at this point
I<00:00:49.649> would<00:00:49.980> use<00:00:50.910> my<00:00:50.940> medicine<00:00:51.510> as<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:52.230> hit<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
I would use my medicine as you hit the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.110 
I would use my medicine as you hit the
barrier<00:00:52.680> because<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.520> kind<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.730> slows<00:00:53.940> down

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
barrier because it kind of slows down

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.470 
barrier because it kind of slows down
time<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.840> gives<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.649> time<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.270> get<00:00:57.270> some

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
time so gives you time to get some

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.020 
time so gives you time to get some
medicine<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.989> then<00:00:58.770> climb<00:00:59.399> up<00:01:01.550> be<00:01:02.550> careful<00:01:02.940> at

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
medicine and then climb up be careful at

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.219 
medicine and then climb up be careful at
this<00:01:03.149> point<00:01:03.449> because<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.780> might<00:01:03.930> end<00:01:04.080> up

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
this point because you might end up

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.780 
this point because you might end up
falling<00:01:04.769> off<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.189> building<00:01:05.970> completely

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
falling off the building completely

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.609 
falling off the building completely
that's<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> end<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.210> first<00:01:09.479> round<00:01:12.619> all

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
that's the end of the first round all

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.990 
that's the end of the first round all
right<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.130> second<00:01:14.520> round<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:14.880> do

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
right so for the second round just do

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.520 
right so for the second round just do
the<00:01:15.119> exact<00:01:15.540> same<00:01:15.810> thing

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.249 

follow<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> path<00:01:19.799> follow<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> path

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.960 

so<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.439> path<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.830> really<00:01:26.400> easy<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.790> do

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
so this path is really easy to do

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.050 
so this path is really easy to do
because<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.869> doesn't<00:01:28.140> involve<00:01:28.670> being<00:01:29.670> chased

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
because it doesn't involve being chased

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.050 
because it doesn't involve being chased
by<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.390> guard<00:01:30.689> because<00:01:31.530> he<00:01:31.979> sometimes<00:01:32.670> they

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
by the guard because he sometimes they

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.880 
by the guard because he sometimes they
actually<00:01:33.450> run<00:01:33.600> faster<00:01:34.049> than<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.740> can

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
actually run faster than you so it can

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:43.380 
actually run faster than you so it can
be<00:01:34.979> really<00:01:35.130> annoying

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.709 

and<00:01:44.390> second<00:01:45.320> round<00:01:45.530> is<00:01:45.860> done<00:01:46.149> easy-peasy

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
and second round is done easy-peasy

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:49.810 
and second round is done easy-peasy
all<00:01:48.500> right<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:48.710> for<00:01:48.829> the<00:01:48.950> third<00:01:49.280> round<00:01:49.520> the

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
all right so for the third round the

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.899 
all right so for the third round the
third<00:01:50.000> round<00:01:50.210> is<00:01:50.360> actually<00:01:50.600> pretty<00:01:50.750> tricky

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
third round is actually pretty tricky

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.859 
third round is actually pretty tricky
because<00:01:52.909> for<00:01:53.210> some<00:01:53.360> reason<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:53.720> God

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
because for some reason that God

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.480 
because for some reason that God
actually<00:01:54.110> spawns<00:01:54.649> a<00:01:54.799> little<00:01:54.950> bit<00:01:55.039> closer<00:01:55.280> to

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
actually spawns a little bit closer to

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.529 
actually spawns a little bit closer to
the<00:01:55.579> flag<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.890> in<00:01:57.890> this<00:01:58.250> video<00:01:58.549> I<00:01:58.610> actually<00:01:58.880> get

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
the flag so in this video I actually get

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.429 
the flag so in this video I actually get
to<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.110> flag<00:02:00.380> before<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:00.979> guard<00:02:02.079> but<00:02:03.079> if<00:02:03.289> he

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
to the flag before the guard but if he

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:04.719 
to the flag before the guard but if he
gets<00:02:03.619> there<00:02:03.770> before<00:02:03.920> you<00:02:04.220> let<00:02:04.399> him<00:02:04.490> have<00:02:04.670> it

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
gets there before you let him have it

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.229 
gets there before you let him have it
and<00:02:05.979> for<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.069> next<00:02:07.310> round<00:02:07.460> he<00:02:07.700> should<00:02:08.179> spawn

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
and for the next round he should spawn

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.180 
and for the next round he should spawn
he<00:02:11.239> should<00:02:11.420> end<00:02:11.840> up<00:02:11.989> spawning<00:02:12.319> what<00:02:12.739> should<00:02:13.010> be

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
he should end up spawning what should be

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.770 
he should end up spawning what should be
so<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:13.790> can<00:02:14.080> easily<00:02:15.080> do<00:02:15.470> this<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:19.690> that<00:02:20.690> is

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
so you can easily do this and that is

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.670 
so you can easily do this and that is
basically<00:02:21.019> how<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.380> beat<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.190> CTF<00:02:22.790> mission

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.280 

thanks<00:02:27.680> for<00:02:27.890> watching
