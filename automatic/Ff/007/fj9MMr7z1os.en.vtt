00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.510 
with dr. Bridgman and see if my hip is
out<00:01:30.000> which<00:01:30.240> pretty<00:01:31.020> sure<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.830> we're

pops<00:01:35.429> it<00:01:35.549> back<00:01:35.580> in<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.560> here<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.619> go

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
pops it back in so here we go

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.980 
pops it back in so here we go
let's<00:01:38.970> take<00:01:39.179> a<00:01:39.209> look<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.539> the<00:01:39.630> first<00:01:39.840> thing

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
let's take a look so the first thing

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.510 
let's take a look so the first thing
we're<00:01:40.110> gonna<00:01:40.170> do<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.440> see<00:01:40.830> if<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.250> hip<00:01:41.399> is

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
we're gonna do is see if the hip is

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.070 
we're gonna do is see if the hip is
actually<00:01:41.970> out<00:01:43.069> many<00:01:44.069> people<00:01:44.399> confuse<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
actually out many people confuse the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.510 
actually out many people confuse the
lumbosacral<00:01:46.080> joint<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.709> SI<00:01:47.039> joints<00:01:47.429> with

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
lumbosacral joint and the SI joints with

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.850 
lumbosacral joint and the SI joints with
the<00:01:47.640> hip<00:01:47.879> we're<00:01:48.509> talking<00:01:48.780> about<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.170> hip<00:01:49.379> and

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
the hip we're talking about the hip and

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.609 
the hip we're talking about the hip and
the<00:01:50.069> hip<00:01:50.220> joint<00:01:50.459> itself<00:01:50.789> okay<00:01:51.660> so<00:01:51.720> first

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
the hip joint itself okay so first

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.240 
the hip joint itself okay so first
things<00:01:52.890> first

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
things first

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.910 
things first
face<00:01:53.670> down<00:01:53.879> Zack<00:01:54.300> we're<00:01:55.289> gonna<00:01:55.379> start<00:01:55.679> with<00:01:55.770> an

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
face down Zack we're gonna start with an

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.389 
face down Zack we're gonna start with an
l5<00:01:56.340> then<00:01:56.970> this<00:01:57.179> knee<00:01:57.390> hold<00:01:58.319> good<00:01:58.890> bend<00:01:59.250> this

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
l5 then this knee hold good bend this

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.029 
l5 then this knee hold good bend this
knee<00:01:59.459> hold<00:02:00.390> very<00:02:00.869> good<00:02:01.110> let's<00:02:01.349> go<00:02:01.500> if<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.679> SI

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
knee hold very good let's go if the SI

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.999 
knee hold very good let's go if the SI
joint<00:02:02.310> raise<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.849> leg<00:02:03.090> up<00:02:03.300> hold<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.979> that

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
joint raise this leg up hold so that

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.820 
joint raise this leg up hold so that
one's<00:02:05.519> out<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:06.060> one<00:02:06.269> up<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.629> hold<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:07.739> the

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
one's out this one up and hold and the

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.949 
one's out this one up and hold and the
right<00:02:08.009> outside<00:02:08.340> joint<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:09.360> in<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:09.810> we're<00:02:09.899> gonna

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
right outside joint is in so we're gonna

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.790 
right outside joint is in so we're gonna
correct<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.530> left<00:02:10.739> SI<00:02:11.129> joint<00:02:12.440> will<00:02:13.440> go<00:02:13.560> right

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
correct the left SI joint will go right

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.650 
correct the left SI joint will go right
in<00:02:13.920> here<00:02:16.280> just<00:02:17.280> like<00:02:17.519> that<00:02:17.580> raise<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.330> leg<00:02:18.480> up

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
in here just like that raise the leg up

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.630 
in here just like that raise the leg up
hold<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.950> she's<00:02:20.190> strong<00:02:20.550> okay<00:02:21.180> next<00:02:22.640> there's

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
hold and she's strong okay next there's

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.979 
hold and she's strong okay next there's
a<00:02:23.730> couple<00:02:23.940> different<00:02:24.030> ways<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.450> test<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.840> hip

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
a couple different ways to test the hip

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.960 
a couple different ways to test the hip
I<00:02:25.349> prefer<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.190> do<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.400> with<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.580> patient<00:02:26.760> on

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
I prefer to do it with the patient on

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.170 
I prefer to do it with the patient on
their<00:02:27.150> back<00:02:27.360> on<00:02:27.629> your<00:02:27.900> back<00:02:27.989> place

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.530 

all<00:02:34.180> right

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
all right

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.559 
all right
so<00:02:34.720> let's<00:02:34.959> test<00:02:35.319> this<00:02:35.739> right<00:02:36.010> hip<00:02:36.189> raise<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.239> up

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
so let's test this right hip raise it up

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.949 
so let's test this right hip raise it up
hold<00:02:38.019> hold<00:02:38.950> say<00:02:39.760> he's<00:02:39.939> out<00:02:40.120> on<00:02:40.329> the<00:02:40.480> right<00:02:40.629> and

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
hold hold say he's out on the right and

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.500 
hold hold say he's out on the right and
the<00:02:41.379> hole<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:42.189> he's<00:02:42.640> out<00:02:42.819> on<00:02:42.849> back<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.360> he's

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
the hole and he's out on back so he's

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.199 
the hole and he's out on back so he's
got<00:02:43.629> a<00:02:43.659> double<00:02:44.049> hip<00:02:44.230> sub<00:02:44.530> luxe<00:02:44.769> we're<00:02:45.700> gonna<00:02:45.790> go

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
got a double hip sub luxe we're gonna go

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.500 
got a double hip sub luxe we're gonna go
ahead<00:02:46.299> and<00:02:46.450> adjust<00:02:47.730> boom<00:02:48.730> got<00:02:49.120> it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
ahead and adjust boom got it

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.559 
ahead and adjust boom got it
let's<00:02:50.319> go<00:02:50.470> right<00:02:50.650> back<00:02:50.680> in<00:02:51.069> here<00:02:52.140> down<00:02:53.140> both

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
let's go right back in here down both

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.460 
let's go right back in here down both
essentially<00:02:55.569> what<00:02:55.690> happens<00:02:56.109> on<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.319> hip

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
essentially what happens on the hip

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.250 
essentially what happens on the hip
testy<00:02:56.950> gets<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.760> hips<00:02:57.970> ball-and-socket<00:02:58.930> gets

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
testy gets the hips ball-and-socket gets

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.289 
testy gets the hips ball-and-socket gets
damage<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.829> joint<00:03:00.010> so<00:03:00.939> we<00:03:01.060> need<00:03:01.209> to

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
damage to the joint so we need to

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.970 
damage to the joint so we need to
release<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.319> it<00:03:02.409> can<00:03:02.500> move<00:03:02.680> freely

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
release it so that it can move freely

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.670 
release it so that it can move freely
within<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.430> joint<00:03:03.609> socket<00:03:03.959> post<00:03:04.959> check<00:03:05.200> hold

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
within the joint socket post check hold

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:16.200 
within the joint socket post check hold
nice<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.370> strong<00:03:06.790> this<00:03:07.120> one<00:03:07.329> up<00:03:07.510> hold

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210
