00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
have it in the bowl and literally just

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.789 
have it in the bowl and literally just
mixing<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:38.269> it<00:02:39.269> becomes<00:02:39.540> like<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:39.810> like<00:02:40.560> a

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
mixing it it becomes like this like a

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:48.080 
mixing it it becomes like this like a
nice<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:45.890> that's<00:02:46.890> pretty<00:02:47.099> much<00:02:47.220> all<00:02:47.489> i<00:02:47.819> do<00:02:47.940> is

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
nice and that's pretty much all i do is

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.539 
nice and that's pretty much all i do is
just<00:02:48.420> i<00:02:48.720> would<00:02:49.379> say<00:02:50.299> you<00:02:51.299> some<00:02:51.569> gloves

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
just i would say you some gloves

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.979 
just i would say you some gloves
depending<00:02:53.549> on<00:02:53.549> how<00:02:54.090> much<00:02:54.269> hair<00:02:54.510> you're<00:02:54.720> doing

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
depending on how much hair you're doing

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.619 
depending on how much hair you're doing
if<00:02:55.109> you're<00:02:55.139> doing<00:02:55.440> your<00:02:55.590> whole<00:02:55.769> head<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:56.069> hair

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
if you're doing your whole head of hair

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.520 
if you're doing your whole head of hair
obviously<00:02:57.629> just<00:02:57.840> put<00:02:58.019> some<00:02:58.139> gloves<00:02:58.290> on

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
obviously just put some gloves on

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.180 
obviously just put some gloves on
because<00:02:58.920> even<00:02:59.549> though<00:02:59.639> it's<00:02:59.790> natural<00:03:00.389> but

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
because even though it's natural but

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.780 
because even though it's natural but
you're<00:03:02.190> activating<00:03:02.639> different<00:03:04.549> chemicals<00:03:05.549> in

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
you're activating different chemicals in

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.879 
you're activating different chemicals in
these<00:03:06.209> ingredients<00:03:06.569> to<00:03:07.470> lighten<00:03:07.739> your<00:03:07.829> hair

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
these ingredients to lighten your hair

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.940 
these ingredients to lighten your hair
so<00:03:08.459> if<00:03:09.389> your<00:03:09.599> hand<00:03:09.870> has<00:03:10.079> a<00:03:10.109> lot<00:03:10.349> of<00:03:10.379> exposure<00:03:10.769> to

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
so if your hand has a lot of exposure to

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
so if your hand has a lot of exposure to
it<00:03:11.190> i<00:03:11.220> don't<00:03:11.459> know<00:03:11.840> if<00:03:12.840> that's<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.139> good<00:03:13.170> thing

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
it i don't know if that's a good thing

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.710 
it i don't know if that's a good thing
since<00:03:14.970> i'm<00:03:15.150> only<00:03:15.329> using<00:03:15.599> a<00:03:17.150> small<00:03:18.150> amount<00:03:18.450> i

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
since i'm only using a small amount i

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.680 
since i'm only using a small amount i
used<00:03:19.230> my<00:03:19.440> bare<00:03:19.769> hands<00:03:20.160> i<00:03:20.840> get<00:03:21.840> in<00:03:21.959> there<00:03:22.250> okay

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
so let's see

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.449 
so let's see
so<00:03:27.610> I<00:03:27.670> literally<00:03:28.060> just<00:03:28.590> take<00:03:29.590> parts<00:03:30.220> of<00:03:30.370> my

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
so I literally just take parts of my

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:38.970 
so I literally just take parts of my
hair<00:03:31.530> put<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:32.620> in<00:03:33.269> put<00:03:34.269> it<00:03:34.330> in<00:03:34.629> I<00:03:37.590> know<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.739> best

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
hair put it in put it in I know the best

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:47.110 
hair put it in put it in I know the best
tutorial<00:03:39.849> for<00:03:40.180> this

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.300 

an<00:03:47.629> excuse<00:03:48.019> like<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.349> 12<00:03:48.590> year<00:03:48.769> old<00:03:48.920> sharing

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
an excuse like the 12 year old sharing

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.330 
an excuse like the 12 year old sharing
like<00:03:50.290> I've<00:03:51.290> had<00:03:51.470> this<00:03:51.620> shirt<00:03:51.799> for<00:03:52.010> over<00:03:52.220> now

like I've had this shirt for over now

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.410 
like I've had this shirt for over now
but<00:03:52.970> I<00:03:53.030> figured<00:03:53.420> why<00:03:53.720> not<00:03:53.780> just<00:03:54.200> use<00:03:54.379> it<00:03:54.620> to

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
but I figured why not just use it to

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.090 
but I figured why not just use it to
junkie<00:03:56.420> shirt

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.820

since its up to 20 um I'm safe you have

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.960 
since its up to 20 um I'm safe you have

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
like a brush like one of those like you

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.670 
like a brush like one of those like you
look<00:04:10.210> like<00:04:10.420> brushes<00:04:11.020> it<00:04:11.590> means<00:04:13.440> most<00:04:14.440> like<00:04:14.590> a

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680

paintbrush who's he he's one of those

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.680 
paintbrush who's he he's one of those
I'm<00:04:18.010> just<00:04:18.310> for<00:04:18.550> time<00:04:18.940> sake<00:04:19.239> i'm<00:04:19.480> just

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
I'm just for time sake i'm just

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.580 
I'm just for time sake i'm just
literally<00:04:20.020> just<00:04:20.350> applying<00:04:20.709> this<00:04:21.010> and<00:04:22.320> I<00:04:23.320> leave

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
literally just applying this and I leave

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:31.340 
literally just applying this and I leave
it<00:04:23.800> on<00:04:24.010> for<00:04:28.020> these<00:04:29.490> using<00:04:30.490> this<00:04:30.700> type<00:04:30.940> of

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
it on for these using this type of

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.080 
it on for these using this type of
lightning<00:04:32.350> agent<00:04:32.770> takes<00:04:33.310> a<00:04:33.460> little<00:04:33.670> more<00:04:33.790> time

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
lightning agent takes a little more time

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.440 
lightning agent takes a little more time
than<00:04:34.510> like<00:04:34.900> bleach<00:04:35.230> bleach<00:04:36.070> you<00:04:36.760> get<00:04:36.970> results

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
than like bleach bleach you get results

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.520 
than like bleach bleach you get results
so<00:04:38.350> much<00:04:38.470> faster<00:04:39.780> this<00:04:40.780> takes<00:04:41.020> one<00:04:41.170> more<00:04:41.290> time

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
so much faster this takes one more time

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.810 
so much faster this takes one more time
so<00:04:42.280> usually<00:04:42.430> I<00:04:42.640> see<00:04:43.030> this<00:04:43.210> one<00:04:43.480> for<00:04:44.470> like

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.870
