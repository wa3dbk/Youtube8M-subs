00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.260
 mauro live inaugurated the week of 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.209
 lectures at the monumental stadium 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.190
 saying that finally today they are going to know 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:13.719
 to the rival of semifinals although from now on 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.849
 he said he wants a rematch of the classic 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.460
 and that is taken as something personal by 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.830
 his expulsion in the past duel yes good 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.780
 the truth is that it is quite the time that 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.370
 we had to wait for 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.140
 and we go and we have to keep waiting 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.660
 still because the week has just started 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.240
 so good to see what happens 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.800
 now in the afternoon 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.630
 but the margin of whoever is the rival 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.050
 we prepare in the best way 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.330
 to be able to face the rival game if I 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.940
 I say that the thorn in the nail is 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.670
 after the match we had there 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.350
 but but nothing all the matches are 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.950
 different all the classics are 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.950
 different 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.830
 and first wait to see who is the 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.160
 rival and then good because apart already 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.690
 starting tomorrow we will know and 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.170
 after from there you can 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.630
 speak more accurately of what we're going 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.160
 to make functions besides the pampa 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.750
 stressed that he is happy with his two 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.740
 correct matches before quique and that 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:15.060
 expects to continue upwards 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.909
 which are very important 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.670
 and that kind of goals is very important 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.149
 for one to be able to make them for him for the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.899
 personal confidence for the team 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.009
 also then one puts it well what 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.590
 comfort 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.799
 and good and it gives even more strength to 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.049
 keep on working then 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.610
 obviously that one works with 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.250
 works different one works different 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.380
 when when you see that inside all 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.420
 things come out what comes has healthy 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.270
 and you can make an important goal 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.670
 then that is good is positive and 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.240
 well let's hope it does not get cut we have 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.280
 I look forward to continue doing so this 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.709
 kind of goals that good that comes well 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.630
 for one obviously and for the team 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.729
 because if I would be served enough 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.649
 about the confirmed departure of Miguel 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.819
 Ángel González and Juan Toloza el Surdo 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.500
 He said he did not want to be in his 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.360
 shoes since it's a situation 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.459
 uncomfortable in addition and looking to the future 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.410
 He remembered that it was Pablo Marini who 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.060
 brought to Chile although he avoided referring to 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.160
 a possible arrival of grapefruit to the bank 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.950
 of colo colo although one also like 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.380
 player and partner of them two if you 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.080
 puts on the skin of 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.910
 of them and none would like to 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.690
 example have to train myself knowing 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.860
 that they are not going to take you into account is a 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.860
 complex theme 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.790
 if they are the only ones but 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.640
 but good is also the same as he said 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.230
 just that is they are things that escape 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.720
 our possibilities then we 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.090
 we can not either too much or be 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.760
 obviously that is not comfortable for 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.130
 us and it's because of and being horrible to 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.160
 it the situation being training and of 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.010
 to be very ugly but I speak I know that I 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.050
 he brought chile then then that you 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.960
 I can say I know him well I know him 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.240
 Argentina I made important goals in 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.370
 argentina against for that while it was 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.549
 Chile 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.360
 I know him but then they are all 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.620
 rumors finally the ball was stressed 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.239
 that more than a gift for esteban 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.870
 walls that is once the 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.730
 opening 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.050
 the almost that must be champion as a prize 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.360
 for all 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.250
 we are a gift for each of 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.010
 we obviously are 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.460
 in playoff we pass and kike and the goal 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.460
 to come out champion 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:39.840
 after the gift each one I'll leave 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:42.960
 I'm going to give it to me and everyone has 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.550
 its your arguments to be able 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.010
 give it to yourself 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.650
 Esteban was here a long time and 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.050
 obviously that if you leave now this leave 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.370
 champion would be spectacular for him yo 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.320
 I've been here for a year 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.910
 a lot of things and if I can finish the 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.090
 year being champion would integrate good 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.090
 all right
