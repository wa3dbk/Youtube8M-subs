blendable lip duos I have 800 whisper

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.490 
blendable lip duos I have 800 whisper
and<00:00:17.810> 8-10<00:00:18.810> glimmer<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:20.630> what<00:00:21.630> these<00:00:21.810> are<00:00:22.080> our

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
and 8-10 glimmer and what these are our

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.230 
and 8-10 glimmer and what these are our
double<00:00:23.400> ended<00:00:23.730> flip<00:00:24.720> covers<00:00:25.820> so<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:26.880> have<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
double ended flip covers so you have the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.040 
double ended flip covers so you have the
one<00:00:27.420> end<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:28.789> then<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.910> have<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.630> other<00:00:30.779> end

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
one end and then you have the other end

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.370 
one end and then you have the other end
and<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:32.189> concept<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.820> these<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:34.020> worn

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
and the concept of these is to be worn

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.430 
and the concept of these is to be worn
alone<00:00:34.680> or<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.850> mix<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.660> two<00:00:36.840> shades<00:00:37.140> together

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
alone or to mix the two shades together

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.290 
alone or to mix the two shades together
and<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> way<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.040> create<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.430> custom<00:00:38.879> color<00:00:39.710> now<00:00:40.710> i

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
and a way to create a custom color now i

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.630 
and a way to create a custom color now i
will<00:00:42.300> say<00:00:42.600> i<00:00:42.899> have<00:00:43.020> tried<00:00:43.379> mixing<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.460> two

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
will say i have tried mixing the two

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.299 
will say i have tried mixing the two
colors<00:00:45.059> together<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:46.079> either<00:00:46.320> an<00:00:46.559> ombre<00:00:47.010> lip

the<00:04:38.349> cool<00:04:38.620> side<00:04:38.650> in<00:04:39.069> my<00:04:39.189> opinion<00:04:39.490> it's<00:04:39.789> kind<00:04:39.969> of

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
the cool side in my opinion it's kind of

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:42.189 
more warm but i do think it's a shade

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:45.629 
more warm but i do think it's a shade
that<00:04:42.219> would<00:04:42.490> work<00:04:42.669> for<00:04:42.840> any<00:04:43.840> skin<00:04:44.349> tone<00:04:44.639> and

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
that would work for any skin tone and

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.749 
that would work for any skin tone and
then<00:04:45.789> the<00:04:45.909> other<00:04:45.939> shade<00:04:46.330> is<00:04:46.539> more<00:04:46.750> of<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:47.759> mauve

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 
then the other shade is more of a mauve

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:51.809 
then the other shade is more of a mauve
shade<00:04:49.300> it's<00:04:49.719> purple<00:04:50.370> though<00:04:51.370> it<00:04:51.490> does<00:04:51.610> have<00:04:51.789> a
