00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.399
 hi guys girls teaches you the 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.889
 last purchases that I made of clothes 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:10.070
 and some cosmetic contract that 

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:11.570
 I will also include the products 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.340
 closed because I'm going to teach you are from 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.780
 prime art I bought them the week 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.140
 last, so they will surely follow 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.500
 having the two surely follow him 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.500
 having 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.000
 in the stores worth I bought these 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.070
 pants that are bag style and these 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.720
 that are very comfortable before I did not like 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.360
 but now the truth is that I find 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.470
 super comfortable for work have here 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.870
 in the ankle as an elastic that makes 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.379
 still make them more comfortable since they do not 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.420
 they are wide and good cost me 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.059
 Fifteen euros are a blue tone 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.030
 I have very bad light forgive me I'm 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:55.629
 taking advantage of recording videos on Sunday 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.010
 That's when I can and I bought myself. 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.800
 very well placed I did not like it very much 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.460
 on the hanger for once I tried them 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.070
 I loved them and less bad the next 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.460
 thing that I bought all my problems already 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.549
 they have very good prices 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.310
 I bought this basic white shirt every 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.630
 once for the basics I already have thought 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.300
 several little things also of this style 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:25.110
 that the grace of being in this blouse 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.580
 are the pockets you have with a 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.130
 golden button 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.320
 and it looks great with the pants that you 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.110
 I have taught before they are very good already 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.820
 you know that a white shirt is a 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.770
 basic that you have to have in all 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.720
 cabinets because it is that it fits well with 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.990
 The whole truth with skirts and pants 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.020
 with shorts does not matter and then 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.350
 in this same store I took these 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.479
 leggins pants 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.340
 that I love are how we say 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.270
 normally pants leggins 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.280
 Cowboy style are not usually without being 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.970
 comfortable but at the end I'm finished 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.980
 being 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:08.680
 annoying in the part of the curves or in 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.970
 groin because they always bother me and I 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.520
 they end up hurting but these are 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.350
 comfy really love me if 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.710
 they did not come out very cheap and I took it in 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.710
 black 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.629
 and in gray 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.280
 and it will cost me nine euros are very good 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.180
 of price that yes to find your size 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:36.440
 it costs because they were like scrambled that 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.440
 as clothes and also buy in the 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.560
 balsam for open ends that is 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.690
 so little I wanted to 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.780
 try it because I had heard very good 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.280
 reviews of it say that good not 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.280
 It's wrong but that's not so bad either 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:56.170
 it's a sidewalk that you have to catch very 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.550
 little amount costs about 695 you have 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.620
 that take very little amount what 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.520
 hot in the hands and with the hair 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.860
 well-groomed it is what parts in the 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.480
 tips what rocks and the truth that good 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.140
 that is soft and so, but let's go 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.720
 Mayan goddess but that is not a 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:18.280
 panacea as nothing of what is for the 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.349
 tips and then I went into a store of 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.950
 Moroccans I had before and me 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:27.019
 I love the three that I have thought 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.239
 If I have time to make some 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.519
 video of what I usually do to you or 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.040
 the mixtures that I do because it is that in 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.390
 another another century for sure I would have 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.900
 burned as a witch 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.300
 and well I took a mix the store was 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.200
 called oriental house I got one that is 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:50.280
 mix of the grandmother I had and disqus 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.640
 rose petals in blueberry blackberry smelled 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.430
 very well 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.780
 yes 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.780
 I took a mixture of it 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:04.790
 that this one had cinnamon cardamom clove 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:09.530
 that will be very good for me because I have 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:12.019
 the fatal throat and for those this tea 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.760
 I recommend it with milk because it is 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.090
 terrific is the typical spiced tea 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.090
 Indian 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.859
 I also got to have him sorry 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.710
 rooibos night lighthouse that your 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.889
 ingredients have 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.199
 rooibos of course the cne the strawberry 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.960
 paita those of pink and the truth that is 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:38.639
 very good I already tried it in cold to me 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.210
 usually like the three cold 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.620
 and it 's pretty good 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.569
 and later 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:50.169
 Sesame paste 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:51.849
 raw because the sesame paste to 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.449
 prefer is better raw since the 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:57.399
 Toast tastes a little richer more but 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.929
 the raw has all its vitamins 

00:04:57.399 --> 00:05:03.820
 intact 

00:04:58.929 --> 00:05:06.730
 this has more calcium than milk 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:10.360
 although you see a phrase a bit milk 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:13.300
 I therefore apply to use it 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.470
 especially to make me toast with 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.960
 ideal honey and sesame has many 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.880
 calories that yes and 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.060
 and also used it for smoothies 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.620
 for and for sesame milk and even 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.699
 for cosmetics you can also 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:33.970
 use as a mask since it gives a lot 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:36.190
 juiciness to the face and then it was what 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.699
 I was struck at the beginning of 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.830
 entering the store I bought this with 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:45.460
 Moroccan and I have a Moroccan friend who 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:48.460
 brings me this kohl's style but in 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.740
 gray and this one was black and well told me the 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.349
 woman who was the typical one who did the 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.820
 women of morocco because when you go to 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:57.070
 Morocco or Tunisia or any country 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.340
 Arabic there is an area where they sell you 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:03.520
 tourist cars let's say you do not 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.530
 I recommend for nothing that there are cabbages 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.030
 who buy the women there who are 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.470
 those who are good who do the 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:13.690
 grandmothers or artisanal people 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.130
 handcrafted and are those that deserve the 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.650
 pity because we the truth is that 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.830
 They have a very chubby texture and leaves you 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.909
 the fatal eye you know how good there is a 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.550
 controversy with the antimony that 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:26.700
 they use 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.170
 I think it's antimony for an alcohol 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.480
 that some say is good for the 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.370
 others that is bad and such but good I a 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.950
 I used it for many years and 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.470
 I liked it and I actually bought it 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.840
 I'm going to make a recipe in which I make a 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.960
 call to see if you like I hope it is 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.750
 so we'll see you in the next video this one 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.600
 have been my complete of these of these 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.010
 last weeks I will teach you yesterday that 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.330
 has a lot accumulated I have a 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.300
 lots of orders that I have to 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.930
 come subscribe to like and we 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.930
 we see in the next
