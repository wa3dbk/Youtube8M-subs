00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.690 
I think I suppose if they would have
kept<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.810> font<00:01:55.170> would<00:01:55.500> have<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.920> think<00:01:56.399> it

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
kept the font would have I think it

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.899 
kept the font would have I think it
could<00:01:56.880> have<00:01:56.969> worked<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:58.700> don't<00:01:59.700> know<00:01:59.790> what

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909
