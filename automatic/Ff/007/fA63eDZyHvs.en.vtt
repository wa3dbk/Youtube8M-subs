 Hey youtubers it's Charlie and welcome to a new edition of Anime Club. This one is 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.520
 all about Attack on Titan. Since it has been on Crunchyroll for a long time and now 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.429
 Netflix hopefully most of you have had a chance to see it and I know a lot of you have read 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:13.709
 the act too. 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.410
 Before we start, quickly shout out to the winner of my remaining Evil edition two 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.580
 weeks ago. Congratulations to Chloe Wright you win a twenty dollar Amazon Giftcard and 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.650
 ItsybitsyIrishGirl pick you up at a future topic for Anime Club. I'll be messaging 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.519
 you both on your channels for details. This week I will pick two Random subscribers 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.669
 from the comments for the same prices. 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.640
 So first let's talk about our top 5 Attack on Titan anime moments, then I'll do one 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.399
 in the live action film and season 2 of the anime series. Beware of spoilers 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.680
 if you haven't seen season 1 of the anime yet. Everyone bites your thumbs and let's 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.809
 Doing this! For anyone curious I drink Brainless IPA during this. Hopefully I won't 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.460
 become mindless towards the end. 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.899
 Number 5 - The Colossus Titan In Episode 1. The promotional material already spoiled 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.000
 the titan for non-readers, but just like Game of Thrones Red Wedding, it did everything 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.250
 nothing too boring the shock of seeing the giant titan appear on the wall for the first time. 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.790
 The other titan shifters would appear gradually over the series and they were definitely WTF 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.870
 moments, but after we got used to the shock of the skinned steaming pile of scary. The 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.670
 greatest vibration changed into the mystery of their identity. 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.010
 Isn't it funny that it's one of the first titan shifters we see, but we didn't learn 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.310
 who it was until long after the other titan shifters. 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.530
 Number 4 - The Female Titan Reveal. I didn't read the manga before seeing her for the first time 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.380
 time in episode 17. There were so many red flags over the female titan. Usually the fact 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.270
 that she looked like she was designed to fight in close combat. 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.110
 I really liked the flashbacks we received from Annie later being trained by her father in episode 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.960
 23, so much of the series is this really dark psychological drama. But unless you have read 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.810
 ahead in the manga, she is still stuck in that crystal cocoon. 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.960
 The biggest questions I always had when any of the titan shifters identities were revealed, 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.700
 at least the sinister ones, was a fat fat WHY ?! I think you could call it why. 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.520
 Number 3 - Eren Gets Nom'd by a titan. Worst cliffhanger in the history of cliffhangers. 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.630
 It was such a huge moment that I just screamed in my chair for a week until we found out 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.819
 what happened. This actually brings a small complaint of the series into the intros 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.489
 And the outros make it feel like every episode has little new content. Just like almost half 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.290
 the episode is talked about the previous episode and the next. 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.030
 So this became a meta WTF moment, because what happened to Eren and the giant center 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.180
 they gave us a finger with that cliffhanger. 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.569
 Number 2 - Honor is revealed as a titan shifter. He was the protagonist of the series, so he 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.569
 Somehow had to come back. Before revealing the epic shifter I thought he would just cut it 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.090
 his way out from within. The series is not doing a good job of explaining the Titan's 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.299
 digestive system. 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.019
 In my head I actually thought they were like mini sarlacc pits. Where people usually would 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.310
 just die from the effects of falling down their throats, or they would die of hunger 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.590
 the Titan's not surrendering them back up. 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.650
 Someone has to start an extra credit course at school for Titan Biology. 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.939
 I could do a whole video for Eren, he is not my favorite character. Usually just 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:04.420
 because he seems so reluctant to embrace his new skills. He spends the rest of the season 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.989
 until his fight with the female titan just trying to decide how he feels about it. That 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.170
 is why he's such a terrible fighter when it's time to lay the smack down on Annie. 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.430
 Something that every Anime, Science Fiction and Fantasy series needs is a montage where the 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.689
 hero test their skills and learn how to fight them. I feel like Eren waited one 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.560
 bit too long to do that. It's just like his assembly happened while he got his 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.939
 ass kicked by Annie. 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.709
 I was actually surprised that he was able to beat her. But to be honest he had 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.469
 the help of the survey corps. 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:38.069
 And my number 1 WTF moment - Titan in the wall. This raised as many questions as are 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.989
 all walls made of titans? Is the city just wall to titan wall? Who has them there? 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.549
 and especially why are they there? 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.019
 It seems that now someone has a big plan for all people. They are not the only ones 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.749
 city ​​in existence, so we still have to learn from all these shifters came from another group 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:56.709
 try to subdue the city. So many questions for Season 2. 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.099
 Let me know what your biggest WTF moment of season 1 was and what is the biggest question 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.120
 Want to see you answered in season 2? We all have to go ahead and pour one out for fallen comrades. 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.980
 Here's a short update about the live action movie before we start talking season 2. Right 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.450
 now they are ready to start filming this summer with an expected release date 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.750
 from the summer of 2015. If you saw the Subaru Commercial with CG titanium, the director worked 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.940
 on. But they do not know if the titan in the film will look the same as it does. 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.970
 No cast has been announced, but since were getting so close we need to find out who they are 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.760
 are fairly fast. Now here is an update from Season 2 of the Anime series. 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.160
 The studio that produced series 1, White Studios, is not going to start working on Season 2 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.870
 until either the end of this year or next year. Which means it's going to take a while before we see it. 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.060
 She said that this year they are in fact producing another anime series called Hozuki no 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.600
 Reitetsu. So if you like the animation on Titan you should give it a try. 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.270
 I probably won't wait a full week to post my next anime club video. I want to do a review 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.690
 from Miyakaki's The Wind Rises. It just opened in theaters wide this weekend. So you have to 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.600
 all be able to find somewhere to see where you live. 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.700
 Forget I'll pick two subscribers randomly from the comments this week 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.940
 giveaway winners. I will announce who you are in that review video. I will try to post 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.120
 the Tomorrow Morning. 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.500
 Now click here for my top 5 evil anime characters and click here for my top 5 Miyazaki 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.840
 movies. 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.340
 Thank you for looking, see you tomorrow. High Fives!
