00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
absolutely we did and said it's one of

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.540 
absolutely we did and said it's one of
the<00:02:25.140> reasons<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.590> I've<00:02:26.070> looked<00:02:26.370> at<00:02:26.460> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
the reasons that I've looked at the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.300 
the reasons that I've looked at the
other<00:02:26.670> system<00:02:27.120> because<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.600> would<00:02:28.260> like<00:02:28.620> if<00:02:29.190> I'm

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
other system because I would like if I'm

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.830 
other system because I would like if I'm
honest<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.700> match<00:02:29.880> up<00:02:30.090> against<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.630> better

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
honest to match up against the better

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.050 
honest to match up against the better
teams<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.320> would<00:02:31.500> know<00:02:32.250> very<00:02:32.670> one<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:33.000> the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
teams I would know very one of the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.600 
teams I would know very one of the
better<00:02:33.270> teams<00:02:33.470> but<00:02:34.470> its<00:02:34.770> personnel<00:02:35.340> what<00:02:35.520> the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
better teams but its personnel what the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.640 
better teams but its personnel what the
month<00:02:35.790> we<00:02:35.910> haven't<00:02:36.209> quite<00:02:36.450> got<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.900> personnel

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
month we haven't quite got the personnel

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.060 
month we haven't quite got the personnel
because<00:02:38.070> of<00:02:38.220> injuries<00:02:39.320> we<00:02:40.320> weren't<00:02:40.560> sure<00:02:40.860> what

enough<00:02:44.250> time<00:02:44.459> to<00:02:44.520> work<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.450> within<00:02:45.690> an<00:02:45.870> almost

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
enough time to work it within an almost

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.890 
enough time to work it within an almost

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
know looking at the alternate system

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.699 
know looking at the alternate system
that's<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.670> reason<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.450> we're<00:02:55.440> sort<00:02:55.620> of

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
that's the reason that we're sort of

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.230 
that's the reason that we're sort of
messed<00:02:55.950> about<00:02:56.100> with<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.550> in<00:02:56.640> training<00:02:57.120> and
