00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
reds and the Browns of our face they

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.850 
reds and the Browns of our face they
kind<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.820> give<00:00:21.029> our<00:00:21.150> age<00:00:21.300> away<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:22.260> age<00:00:22.470> spots

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
kind of give our age away the age spots

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.740 
kind of give our age away the age spots
which<00:00:23.250> are<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.460> brown<00:00:23.670> spots<00:00:24.000> because<00:00:24.450> of<00:00:24.570> sun

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
which are the brown spots because of sun

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.220 
which are the brown spots because of sun
damage<00:00:24.779> or<00:00:25.650> perhaps<00:00:26.520> the<00:00:26.970> permanent<00:00:27.780> redness

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
damage or perhaps the permanent redness

that<00:00:28.440> you<00:00:28.560> have<00:00:28.680> on<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.920> nose<00:00:29.100> or<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.910> rosacea

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
that you have on the nose or the rosacea

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.450 
that you have on the nose or the rosacea
on<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> face<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.260> they<00:00:31.800> really<00:00:32.099> give<00:00:32.309> your

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
on the face and they really give your

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.880 
on the face and they really give your
age<00:00:32.610> away<00:00:32.970> and<00:00:33.270> makeup<00:00:34.020> doesn't<00:00:34.290> really<00:00:34.590> quite

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
age away and makeup doesn't really quite

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.880 
age away and makeup doesn't really quite
hide<00:00:35.400> it<00:00:35.580> effectively<00:00:36.120> enough<00:00:36.559> so<00:00:37.559> how<00:00:37.739> do<00:00:37.800> we

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
hide it effectively enough so how do we

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.220 
hide it effectively enough so how do we
get<00:00:38.070> rid<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.910> called<00:00:39.150> the<00:00:39.270> IPL<00:00:39.930> and

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
get rid of it it's called the IPL and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.650 
get rid of it it's called the IPL and
this<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.860> called<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.160> intense<00:00:41.820> pulse<00:00:42.270> light

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
this is called the intense pulse light

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.190 
this is called the intense pulse light
and<00:00:42.989> these<00:00:43.530> are<00:00:43.739> light<00:00:44.250> rays<00:00:45.120> emitted<00:00:45.510> onto

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
and these are light rays emitted onto

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.549 
and these are light rays emitted onto
your<00:00:46.350> skin<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.910> gets<00:00:48.090> absorbed<00:00:48.530> by<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
your skin and it gets absorbed by the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.160 
your skin and it gets absorbed by the
brown<00:00:50.399> pigment<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.120> melanin<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.690> your<00:00:51.840> skin

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
brown pigment the melanin of your skin

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.310 
brown pigment the melanin of your skin
in<00:00:52.500> those<00:00:53.130> cells<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.239> what<00:00:54.360> happens<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.050> is

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
in those cells and what happens is is

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.350 
in those cells and what happens is is
that<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.770> heat<00:00:56.040> generated<00:00:56.730> bursts<00:00:57.210> those

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
that the heat generated bursts those

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.900 
that the heat generated bursts those
cells<00:00:57.630> releases<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> pigment<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.219> then<00:00:59.730> your

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
cells releases the pigment and then your

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.150 
cells releases the pigment and then your
skin<00:01:00.120> actually<00:01:00.570> exfoliates<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.440> out<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.800> you

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
skin actually exfoliates it out and you

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.100 
skin actually exfoliates it out and you
actually<00:01:02.340> get<00:01:02.610> rid<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.790> it<00:01:03.000> same<00:01:03.719> thing<00:01:03.960> with

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
actually get rid of it same thing with

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.930 
actually get rid of it same thing with
the<00:01:04.170> red<00:01:04.680> spots<00:01:05.009> these<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.369> actually<00:01:05.700> fine

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
the red spots these are actually fine

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.480 
the red spots these are actually fine
capillaries<00:01:06.750> these<00:01:06.899> are<00:01:07.050> fragile<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:08.280> light

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
capillaries these are fragile the light

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.430 
capillaries these are fragile the light
gets<00:01:08.640> absorbed<00:01:08.820> by<00:01:09.210> these<00:01:09.360> capillaries<00:01:09.960> they

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
gets absorbed by these capillaries they

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.230 
gets absorbed by these capillaries they
get<00:01:10.680> obstructed<00:01:11.220> there's<00:01:11.610> no<00:01:11.850> more<00:01:12.000> blood

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
get obstructed there's no more blood

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.120 
get obstructed there's no more blood
flow<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.690> there<00:01:12.899> and<00:01:13.140> then<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.649> don't<00:01:13.800> see<00:01:14.009> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
flow in there and then you don't see the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.820 
flow in there and then you don't see the
red<00:01:14.280> spots<00:01:14.550> again<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.270> here's<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.380> essence

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
red spots again and here's the essence

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.710 
red spots again and here's the essence
of<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.100> IP<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.119> advanced

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
technology of facial rejuvenation that

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.000 
technology of facial rejuvenation that
you<00:01:21.450> only<00:01:21.630> really<00:01:21.840> get<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.200> mid<00:01:22.380> spots<00:01:22.680> and

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
you only really get in mid spots and

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.090 
you only really get in mid spots and
only<00:01:23.610> physicians<00:01:24.150> or<00:01:24.590> physician<00:01:25.590> assistants

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
younger you need less makeup the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.690 
younger you need less makeup the
procedures<00:01:40.710> themselves<00:01:41.220> are<00:01:41.310> relatively

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
procedures themselves are relatively

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.780 
procedures themselves are relatively
painless<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:43.470> takes<00:01:43.740> perhaps<00:01:44.130> an<00:01:44.520> hour

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
painless and it takes perhaps an hour

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.510 
painless and it takes perhaps an hour
but<00:01:45.540> here<00:01:45.810> again<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.770> really<00:01:46.979> want<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.340> have<00:01:47.490> a
