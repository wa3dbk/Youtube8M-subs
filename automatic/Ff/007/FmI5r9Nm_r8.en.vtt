00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.600
 rescued 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.530
 the idea of ​​using car students 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.530
 to design arose for the love of Jesus

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.300
 of cleaning the material starts the 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.119
 creative ingenuity do not start to 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.580

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.970
 material and we follow the conformation of the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.440
 I'm designing equipment that is that there is a 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.430
 direct dialogue with the material 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.980
