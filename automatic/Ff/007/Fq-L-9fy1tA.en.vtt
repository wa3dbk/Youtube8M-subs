00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.980
 the famous japanese giant monster 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:12.559
 godzilla is up and running again 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.660
 says the eponymous video game for 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.660
 a powerful destructive orgy 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.230
 quite in this sense, he hears 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.440
 singleplayer mode on the right one 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.470
 term master of destruction and 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.390
 contains a total of 19 levels in several 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.130
 environments 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.830
 next to the obligatory city 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.440
 Scenario, for example, is also available in the 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.670
 harbor area or a mountain landscape the 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.010
 each with different 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.870
 threats to human were 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.820
 Opponents usually intervene 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.510
 helicopters and helicopters 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.220
 armor 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.870
 which are relatively easy 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.120
 can be overcome after a short time 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.860
 time diving in the levels more 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.040
 giant monster on the not particularly 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.050
 good to talk to them 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.570
 that's how this opponent named mega fights 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.790
 kinky dora with hard bandages and 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.729
 the mozilla flashes extremely 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.900
 could put 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.150
 fortunately laid and in the process 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.909
 last moment making defeat before 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.190
 mozillas life energy consumed in the 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.110
 solo mode will be hurt by 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.820
 orange spots on the screen 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.070
 displayed but already after a short 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.050
 breather recovers briefly and 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.400
 can attack again with full force 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.320
 By the way, the levels are through 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.510
 Luminous markings delimited 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.400
 therefore, only the facilities 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.590
 destroyed within the fencing 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.270
 who will lose 100 percent 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.850
 must want to serve that 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.740
 carefully degas around the well 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.210
 last pillar of success successful to 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.310
 jump in each level are located 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.650
 also three generators you 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.620
 make sure to flatten is around 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.120
 next area to change 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.720
 the generators will be alright 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.880
 protected 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.770
 but after some attacks explode 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.649
 the things and put so-called g 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.380
 Energy free with the help of this energy 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.240
 grows godzilla from initially 50 meters 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.310
 at a stately height of 100 meters 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.349
 around 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.550
 Unfortunately, the title can be cooler despite it 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:26.430
 Monster opponents like Motorola or Mozilla 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.160
 not convincing playfully because that 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.080
 combat system is much too slow a 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.300
 is reaction to enemy attacks 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.400
 Hardly possible there will be a half 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.060
 Eternal need is the key commands 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.200
 to be attacked 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.349
 Combination attacks are also rare 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.700
 sown and energy rays stand 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.920
 only cyclically available 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.890
 so not much remains as all 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.870
 to use attacks alternately and at 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.800
 requires a quick stamping attack 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.230
 expel 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.480
 The graphic is not special either 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.790
 nice and annoying with clipping and 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.250
 in places ugly textures on ps2 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.800
 level, after all, the game is in progress 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.140
 solomodus smooth and offers relatively 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.450
 nice light and particle effects in the 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.640
 By the way, online multiplayer mode is allowed 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.680
 up to three participants with their 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.709
 favorite monster from a selection of 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.230
 around 20 beasts compete against each other 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.090
 that sounds funny at first but unfortunately 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.360
 force the extreme slow down 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.980
 in multiplayer mode the fun fast in 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.980
 the knees 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.569
 despite tons of unlockable content 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.060
 godzilla simply does not provide enough for you 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.739
 money because the first passage is after 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.049
 three hours at the latest 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.849
 After that there are some more 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.980
 levels to discover but at the pretty 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.630
 Stupid gameplay change the new ones 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.700
 Unfortunately, there is nothing left 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.349
 For this reason, godzilla is at most for 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.349
 absolute hardcore fans suitable
