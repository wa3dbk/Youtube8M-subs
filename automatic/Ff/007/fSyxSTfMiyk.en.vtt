00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.190 

I've<00:00:11.480> been<00:00:11.660> looking<00:00:11.990> for<00:00:12.230> for<00:00:13.009> a<00:00:13.040> way<00:00:13.280> to

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200 
I've been looking for for a way to

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.769 
I've been looking for for a way to
attach<00:00:15.200> my<00:00:15.910> camera<00:00:16.910> to<00:00:17.090> my<00:00:17.240> mountain<00:00:17.900> bike<00:00:18.110> and

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
attach my camera to my mountain bike and

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.089 
attach my camera to my mountain bike and
you<00:00:20.779> know<00:00:20.900> I<00:00:20.930> don't<00:00:21.109> want<00:00:21.410> to<00:00:21.529> spend<00:00:21.800> a<00:00:21.920> bunch

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
you know I don't want to spend a bunch

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.540 
you know I don't want to spend a bunch
of<00:00:22.220> money<00:00:22.340> and<00:00:22.670> I<00:00:23.289> looked<00:00:24.289> on<00:00:24.500> eBay<00:00:25.009> and<00:00:25.279> they

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
of money and I looked on eBay and they

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.769 
of money and I looked on eBay and they
have<00:00:25.789> flimsy<00:00:26.539> plastic<00:00:26.859> the<00:00:27.859> mounts<00:00:28.849> and<00:00:29.150> those

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
have flimsy plastic the mounts and those

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.760 
have flimsy plastic the mounts and those
are<00:00:29.990> probably<00:00:30.259> okay<00:00:30.859> but<00:00:31.450> you<00:00:32.450> know<00:00:32.540> I<00:00:32.810> I<00:00:33.350> had

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
are probably okay but you know I I had

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.190 
are probably okay but you know I I had
some<00:00:33.980> stuff<00:00:34.250> laying<00:00:35.000> around<00:00:35.240> the<00:00:35.630> house<00:00:35.840> and

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
some stuff laying around the house and

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.630 
some stuff laying around the house and
and<00:00:38.110> so<00:00:39.110> I<00:00:39.140> thought<00:00:39.380> I'd<00:00:39.620> just<00:00:39.830> try<00:00:40.040> to<00:00:40.130> put<00:00:40.460> one

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
and so I thought I'd just try to put one

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.860 
and so I thought I'd just try to put one
together<00:00:40.850> myself

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
together myself

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.000 
together myself
and<00:00:42.440> this<00:00:43.220> is<00:00:43.370> what<00:00:43.580> I<00:00:43.610> came<00:00:43.850> up<00:00:44.120> with<00:00:44.890> and<00:00:45.890> if

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
and this is what I came up with and if

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.010 
and this is what I came up with and if
you<00:00:46.130> have<00:00:46.310> any<00:00:46.520> old<00:00:46.790> mountain<00:00:47.420> bike<00:00:47.600> parts

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
you have any old mountain bike parts

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.680 
you have any old mountain bike parts
just<00:00:48.860> kicking<00:00:49.640> around<00:00:49.730> you<00:00:50.240> could<00:00:50.450> probably

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
just kicking around you could probably

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.840 
just kicking around you could probably
put<00:00:51.020> one<00:00:51.200> together<00:00:51.410> quite<00:00:51.890> easy<00:00:52.220> too

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
put one together quite easy too

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.900 
put one together quite easy too
and<00:00:53.740> I'll<00:00:54.740> just<00:00:54.950> show<00:00:55.190> you<00:00:55.490> it's<00:00:56.150> made<00:00:56.630> with

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
and I'll just show you it's made with

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.340 
and I'll just show you it's made with
one<00:00:58.910> of<00:00:59.060> these<00:01:00.160> these<00:01:01.160> bolts<00:01:01.730> with<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.350> eyelet

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
one of these these bolts with the eyelet

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.370 
one of these these bolts with the eyelet
and<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:03.710> end<00:01:03.860> of<00:01:04.070> it

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.380 
and the end of it

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.940 
and the end of it
you<00:01:06.380> don't<00:01:06.590> really<00:01:06.829> need<00:01:07.159> the<00:01:07.520> eyelet<00:01:08.420> but

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
you don't really need the eyelet but

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.099 
you don't really need the eyelet but
I'll<00:01:09.950> show<00:01:10.280> you<00:01:10.310> why<00:01:10.670> I<00:01:10.700> used<00:01:11.210> it<00:01:11.509> in<00:01:11.659> a<00:01:11.780> minute

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:12.109 
I'll show you why I used it in a minute

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:16.959 
I'll show you why I used it in a minute
and<00:01:12.619> then<00:01:13.520> right<00:01:14.060> here<00:01:14.649> is<00:01:15.649> just<00:01:15.710> a<00:01:16.369> bearing

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969 
and then right here is just a bearing

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:23.889 
and then right here is just a bearing
and<00:01:17.299> I<00:01:18.109> use<00:01:18.350> two<00:01:18.679> of<00:01:18.890> those<00:01:20.259> so<00:01:21.259> anyway<00:01:22.899> I'll

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
and I use two of those so anyway I'll

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.859 
and I use two of those so anyway I'll
just<00:01:24.229> take<00:01:24.469> the<00:01:24.799> camera<00:01:25.340> off<00:01:25.369> as<00:01:26.299> you<00:01:26.539> can<00:01:26.689> see

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
just take the camera off as you can see

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.620 
just take the camera off as you can see
it's<00:01:27.049> got<00:01:27.229> a<00:01:27.259> big<00:01:27.530> big<00:01:28.429> old<00:01:28.670> camera<00:01:29.390> on<00:01:29.450> it

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
it's got a big big old camera on it

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.690 
it's got a big big old camera on it
because<00:01:29.929> I'm<00:01:30.079> using<00:01:30.289> the<00:01:30.499> camera<00:01:31.039> normally

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
because I'm using the camera normally

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.359 
because I'm using the camera normally
use<00:01:31.969> right<00:01:32.359> now<00:01:32.390> so<00:01:34.179> it'll<00:01:35.179> hold<00:01:35.450> a<00:01:36.159> really<00:01:37.159> big

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
use right now so it'll hold a really big

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.249 
use right now so it'll hold a really big
camera<00:01:39.789> so<00:01:40.789> anyway<00:01:41.119> I'll<00:01:41.270> take<00:01:41.569> the<00:01:41.749> camera

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
camera so anyway I'll take the camera

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.660 
camera so anyway I'll take the camera
off<00:01:42.319> and<00:01:42.380> all<00:01:43.030> I'll<00:01:44.030> come<00:01:44.329> back<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:44.960> show<00:01:45.200> you

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.559 
off and all I'll come back and show you
exactly<00:01:46.670> how<00:01:46.969> it's<00:01:47.420> put<00:01:47.990> together

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
exactly how it's put together

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:55.389 
exactly how it's put together
all<00:01:50.569> right<00:01:51.049> back<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:53.649> as<00:01:54.649> you<00:01:54.710> can<00:01:55.009> see<00:01:55.069> it's

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
all right back and as you can see it's

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.340 
all right back and as you can see it's
just<00:01:55.490> a<00:01:56.259> stand<00:01:57.259> mark<00:01:58.389> the<00:01:59.389> neck<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.840> a<00:01:59.929> mountain

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
just a stand mark the neck of a mountain

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.039 
just a stand mark the neck of a mountain
bike<00:02:01.780> it's<00:02:02.780> got<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:03.079> removable<00:02:04.539> plate<00:02:05.539> on<00:02:05.840> the

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
bike it's got a removable plate on the

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.920 
bike it's got a removable plate on the
back<00:02:06.229> that's<00:02:06.740> held<00:02:06.979> on<00:02:07.189> with

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
back that's held on with

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.520 
back that's held on with
on<00:02:07.990> key<00:02:08.290> bolts<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:09.960> that'll<00:02:10.960> make<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:11.170> so<00:02:11.500> I

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
on key bolts and that'll make it so I

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.800 
on key bolts and that'll make it so I
can<00:02:11.650> mount<00:02:12.010> it<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.250> my<00:02:12.550> bike<00:02:13.030> handlebars

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
can mount it to my bike handlebars

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.880 
can mount it to my bike handlebars
really<00:02:14.380> easy<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:18.270> down<00:02:19.270> in<00:02:19.540> there<00:02:19.870> if<00:02:20.650> you

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
really easy and down in there if you

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.530 
really easy and down in there if you
tell<00:02:21.280> but<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:22.600> bearings<00:02:23.110> are<00:02:23.380> down<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.310> that

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
tell but the bearings are down and that

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.770 
tell but the bearings are down and that
so<00:02:25.540> just<00:02:26.170> by<00:02:26.350> luck<00:02:26.770> those<00:02:27.370> bearings<00:02:28.060> happen<00:02:28.630> to

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
so just by luck those bearings happen to

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.690 
so just by luck those bearings happen to
fit<00:02:29.020> right<00:02:29.260> in<00:02:29.530> there<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:32.520> said<00:02:33.520> those

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
fit right in there and said those

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.830 
fit right in there and said those
bearings<00:02:34.270> are<00:02:34.480> just<00:02:35.670> crappy<00:02:36.670> old<00:02:36.840> bearings

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
bearings are just crappy old bearings

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.260 
bearings are just crappy old bearings
out<00:02:38.050> of<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:39.450> old<00:02:40.450> swivel<00:02:41.050> rocker<00:02:41.670> or<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.730> glider

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
out of the old swivel rocker or a glider

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.380 
out of the old swivel rocker or a glider
rocker<00:02:43.690> I<00:02:44.020> guess<00:02:44.320> it<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.620> you<00:02:45.610> don't<00:02:45.760> need<00:02:46.030> this

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
rocker I guess it is you don't need this

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.110 
rocker I guess it is you don't need this
but<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:47.050> put<00:02:47.830> it<00:02:47.950> on<00:02:48.100> there<00:02:48.370> anyway<00:02:48.700> just

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
but I put it on there anyway just

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.800 
but I put it on there anyway just
because<00:02:49.800> ahead<00:02:50.800> of<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:51.100> extra<00:02:51.580> space<00:02:51.910> in

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
because ahead of that extra space in

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.710 
because ahead of that extra space in
there<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:53.620> thought<00:02:53.860> that<00:02:54.160> would<00:02:54.600> you<00:02:55.600> know

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
there and I thought that would you know

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.440 
there and I thought that would you know
help<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.800> camera<00:02:57.310> not<00:02:57.490> get<00:02:57.760> damaged<00:02:58.360> or

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
help the camera not get damaged or

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.310 
help the camera not get damaged or
whatever<00:02:58.810> that's<00:02:59.560> just<00:02:59.800> a<00:02:59.920> piece<00:03:00.130> of<00:03:00.340> rubber<00:03:00.550> I

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
whatever that's just a piece of rubber I

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.730 
whatever that's just a piece of rubber I
just<00:03:02.320> stuck<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:02.770> over<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.160> bolt<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:05.530> then

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
just stuck it over the bolt and then

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.060 
just stuck it over the bolt and then
right<00:03:06.010> here<00:03:06.040> is<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:08.830> brake<00:03:09.160> lever<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.780> you

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
right here is the brake lever and you

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.330 
right here is the brake lever and you
could<00:03:12.070> use<00:03:12.310> one<00:03:12.670> like<00:03:13.180> a<00:03:13.769> metal<00:03:14.769> one<00:03:14.950> that's

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
could use one like a metal one that's

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.030 
could use one like a metal one that's
matches<00:03:16.209> this<00:03:16.480> or<00:03:16.780> whatever<00:03:16.959> but<00:03:17.470> I<00:03:17.709> just

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
matches this or whatever but I just

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.100 
matches this or whatever but I just
chose<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.610> use<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:18.820> because<00:03:19.360> I<00:03:19.390> had<00:03:19.690> one<00:03:20.019> and

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
chose to use that because I had one and

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.920 
chose to use that because I had one and
it's<00:03:23.110> just<00:03:23.410> held<00:03:23.680> on<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.550> eyelet<00:03:25.540> by<00:03:25.900> a

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
it's just held on to the eyelet by a

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
it's just held on to the eyelet by a
bolt<00:03:26.430> going<00:03:27.430> through<00:03:28.080> with<00:03:29.080> a<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:31.680> wing<00:03:32.680> nut<00:03:32.920> on

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
bolt going through with a a wing nut on

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.490 
bolt going through with a a wing nut on
the<00:03:33.310> other<00:03:33.340> side<00:03:33.820> and<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.660> reason<00:03:35.050> I<00:03:35.140> put<00:03:35.320> the

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
the other side and the reason I put the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.840 
the other side and the reason I put the
wing<00:03:35.680> nut<00:03:36.010> on<00:03:36.040> there<00:03:36.580> is<00:03:37.420> because<00:03:37.989> it<00:03:38.730> kind<00:03:39.730> of

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
wing nut on there is because it kind of

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.150 
wing nut on there is because it kind of
presses<00:03:40.330> up<00:03:40.510> against<00:03:40.840> that<00:03:41.140> edge<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:41.860> makes

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
presses up against that edge and makes

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.120 
presses up against that edge and makes
it<00:03:42.400> a<00:03:42.459> little<00:03:42.610> stiffer<00:03:43.300> so<00:03:44.290> that<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.709> camera

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
it a little stiffer so that the camera

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.220 
it a little stiffer so that the camera
doesn't<00:03:45.370> spin<00:03:45.910> around<00:03:46.060> because<00:03:46.840> where<00:03:47.110> it's

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
doesn't spin around because where it's

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.150 
doesn't spin around because where it's
got<00:03:47.440> a<00:03:47.470> bearing<00:03:47.980> in<00:03:48.130> there<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:51.100> all<00:03:51.310> you<00:03:51.459> do<00:03:51.870> is

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
got a bearing in there and all you do is

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.740 
got a bearing in there and all you do is
when<00:03:54.160> you<00:03:54.280> want<00:03:54.489> to<00:03:54.580> move<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:55.030> position<00:03:55.600> of

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
when you want to move the position of

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.809 
when you want to move the position of
the<00:03:55.870> camera<00:03:57.390> you<00:03:58.440> turn

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
the camera you turn

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.170 
the camera you turn
and<00:04:01.900> it's<00:04:02.900> stiff<00:04:03.319> enough<00:04:03.530> that<00:04:04.040> when<00:04:04.250> you<00:04:04.489> have

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
and it's stiff enough that when you have

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.179 
and it's stiff enough that when you have
it<00:04:05.390> in<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.659> position<00:04:06.019> you<00:04:06.409> need<00:04:06.560> it<00:04:06.860> you<00:04:06.980> just

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:07.189 
it in the position you need it you just

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.619 
it in the position you need it you just
leave<00:04:07.489> it<00:04:07.700> there<00:04:07.879> and<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.209> camera<00:04:08.450> won't<00:04:08.840> move

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
leave it there and the camera won't move

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.809 
leave it there and the camera won't move
but<00:04:11.629> I'll<00:04:12.200> put<00:04:12.409> that<00:04:12.590> on<00:04:12.650> there<00:04:13.099> because<00:04:13.549> when

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
but I'll put that on there because when

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.569 
but I'll put that on there because when
you're<00:04:14.000> biking<00:04:14.689> along<00:04:14.959> you<00:04:15.530> can<00:04:15.709> just<00:04:15.980> reach

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
you're biking along you can just reach

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.689 
you're biking along you can just reach
under<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.389> turn<00:04:17.870> on<00:04:18.049> your<00:04:18.139> camera<00:04:18.699> because

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
under and turn on your camera because

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.120 
under and turn on your camera because
obviously<00:04:20.060> once<00:04:20.750> this<00:04:20.989> is<00:04:21.199> on<00:04:21.229> the<00:04:21.500> handlebars

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
obviously once this is on the handlebars

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.590 
obviously once this is on the handlebars
you<00:04:22.340> won't<00:04:22.520> be<00:04:22.699> able<00:04:22.850> to<00:04:23.030> turn<00:04:23.270> that<00:04:23.570> so<00:04:25.600> the

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
you won't be able to turn that so the

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.800 
you won't be able to turn that so the
only<00:04:26.979> downside<00:04:27.979> is<00:04:28.220> you<00:04:28.370> can't<00:04:28.610> tilt<00:04:29.570> the

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
only downside is you can't tilt the

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.969 
only downside is you can't tilt the
camera<00:04:30.220> this<00:04:31.220> way<00:04:31.550> or<00:04:31.789> that<00:04:32.000> way<00:04:32.380> but<00:04:33.380> that's

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
camera this way or that way but that's

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.720 
camera this way or that way but that's
probably<00:04:34.490> not<00:04:34.669> that<00:04:34.970> big<00:04:35.270> a<00:04:35.300> deal
