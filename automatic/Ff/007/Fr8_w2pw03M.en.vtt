go<00:02:18.410> easy<00:02:18.620> on<00:02:18.950> our<00:02:19.040> though<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.460> definitely<00:02:20.090> go

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
go easy on our though that definitely go

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.180 
go easy on our though that definitely go
easy<00:02:20.420> enough<00:02:20.630> though<00:02:20.780> because<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.950> gummy

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
easy enough though because the the gummy

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.270 
easy enough though because the the gummy
bears<00:02:22.460> do<00:02:22.850> hide<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:24.110> alcohol<00:02:24.530> tastes<00:02:25.100> a

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
bears do hide the alcohol tastes a

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.220 
bears do hide the alcohol tastes a
little<00:02:25.400> bit<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:26.120> gun<00:02:26.270> bears<00:02:26.480> taste<00:02:26.810> they

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
little bit the gun bears taste they

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.850 
little bit the gun bears taste they
taste<00:02:27.500> pretty<00:02:28.100> much<00:02:28.310> like<00:02:28.520> a<00:02:28.550> gummy<00:02:28.730> bear<00:02:28.850> but

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
taste pretty much like a gummy bear but

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.730 
taste pretty much like a gummy bear but
with<00:02:30.860> a<00:02:30.890> kick<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.370> guess<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:31.760> could<00:02:31.910> say<00:02:32.740> so

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740
