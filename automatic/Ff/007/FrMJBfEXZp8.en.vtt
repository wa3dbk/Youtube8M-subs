00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.440
 very good to all I'm secrets and we're 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.480
 in mega blond pokemon or alpha sapphire for 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.150
 show you where to get it called 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.420
 sphere that is the object of dialogue the 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.820
 illustrious sphere that is the object of a palca 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.380
 and the gray or sphere that is the object with 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.180
 which we can change shape to tour 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.100
 tub so it's gelatine origin 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.040
 so 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.310
 the objects are hidden underwater and 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.170
 we need to have a pokémon with diving and 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.570
 well do not you think they're hidden as I say 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.000
 and we have to know where they are so 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.310
 Well the first one that we are going to look for is 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.980
 the guide mans fera and we have to go to 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.290
 where is the abyssal cavern worth not 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.720
 they are here eurodom and that you see 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.350
 that is here this is worth we have to 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.350
 give central part 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.820
 and good as you well know and if not what 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.650
 you know I tell you 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.650
 under water you can not use the dowser 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.580
 I think we go 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.310
 if I do not taste it 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.140
 we will be of doubts 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.590
 have not opposed but well I think that 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.909
 you can not then well we are already 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.119
 here under the water we have to go to 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.119
 above 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.470
 if the one who is against one more day 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.000
 go to the table for itself and good that 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.189
 we've already finished there's nothing else so 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.430
 Up we will seek 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.170
 next sphere 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.540
 light three spheres and for this we are going to 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.870
 fly 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.210
 would give the same but good using the route 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.440
 129 vouchers are on three different routes 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.440
 to use dairy 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.600
 we are at 128 we go to 129 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.990
 and then we will arrive to 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.570
 get the illustrious sphere that is the 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:58.020
 object of pal souvenir that increases a 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.670
 20% water and dragon attacks 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.810
 we have to go down a little bit here to 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.070
 the area of this list with diving 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.070
 we get underwater 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.220
 with work 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.540
 and let's go to the part on the right to 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.689
 northeast of the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.420
 of the area of this submarine and there in the 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:23.580
 whiskey does not stay there there is here is 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.120
 we'll see 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.850
 will appear a appear appeared the 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.370
 illustrious sphere is worth as you see it is a little 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.920
 as we have now the movement this in 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.620
 diagonal is a bit more difficult but 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.270
 well at the end, we're leaving for 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.710
 up somewhere where we can 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.480
 come to the surface you know that this 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.050
 it would be that light comes 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.380
 let's look now for the gray sphere that 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.920
 is on route 130 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.050
 resigned again with flight 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.580
 it is faster 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.240
 but as if not because it arrives surfing 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.240
 quietly 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.190
 so let's get the last 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.190
 object 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.439
 it's more down here 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.030
 and it's not over here you have to go, it's worth the other 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.120
 reference is the dotted east of here 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.120
 above 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.410
 it's not the are not celebrated in this little 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.690
 here in this little square 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.810
 ok and if I remember correctly I was by 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.810
 here 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.470
 that's here is the gray and wait 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.350
 so here underwater I'm going to 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.410
 teach the objects will be here 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.470
 down 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.970
 the day more fer to a bright sphere 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.430
 that powers movements of the type 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.350
 steel and dragon must carry the algae if 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.550
 I do not remember your mind badly percent a 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.990
 beautiful sphere that powers the 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.360
 dragon- like movements and water that 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.740
 must carry homeland and a sphere 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.240
 bright that powers the movements 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.200
 of dragon and ghost type must carry the 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.090
 tour tub 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.740
 the circular power of change of 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.200
 form but good iguatemí two powers 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.360
 now while looking doubt so good 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.910
 with these three good objects you can 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.230
 equip yourselves to be yours 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.510
 your algae so that your 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.220
 much stronger cretins I hope that you 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.739
 I really liked the video especially 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.690
 that has served us that if so 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.700
 you want to like and see you in the 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.100
 next video 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.010
 goodbye 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.720
 and you're still sleeping in the kitchen you see 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.930
 does not seem cozy our new 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.930
 home 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.390
 and also picks up what gets dirty is 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.390
