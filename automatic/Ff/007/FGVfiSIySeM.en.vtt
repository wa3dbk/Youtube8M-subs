let's<00:00:31.029> examine<00:00:31.420> this<00:00:31.630> great<00:00:32.020> classic

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
let's examine this great classic

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.500 
let's examine this great classic
boogie-woogie<00:00:33.190> baseline<00:00:33.760> you're<00:00:34.120> doubling

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
boogie-woogie baseline you're doubling

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.690 
boogie-woogie baseline you're doubling
the<00:00:34.660> base<00:00:34.900> with<00:00:35.320> the<00:00:35.470> guitar<00:00:35.620> and<00:00:36.040> it's

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
the base with the guitar and it's

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.640 
the base with the guitar and it's
oriented<00:00:37.180> around<00:00:37.300> a<00:00:37.600> dominant<00:00:38.080> family<00:00:38.379> chord

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
oriented around a dominant family chord

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.530 
oriented around a dominant family chord
so<00:00:38.950> you're<00:00:39.070> playing<00:00:39.250> a<00:00:39.340> shuffle<00:00:39.850> in<00:00:40.030> the<00:00:40.360> key

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
so you're playing a shuffle in the key

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.240 
so you're playing a shuffle in the key
of<00:00:40.570> G<00:00:40.870> so<00:00:41.050> let's<00:00:41.680> look<00:00:41.800> at<00:00:41.950> the<00:00:42.040> first

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
of G so let's look at the first

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.270 
of G so let's look at the first
structure<00:00:42.670> now<00:00:43.510> most<00:00:43.870> guys<00:00:44.110> already<00:00:44.559> know<00:00:44.890> the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
structure now most guys already know the

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.570 
structure now most guys already know the
minor<00:00:45.580> pentatonic<00:00:45.820> scale<00:00:46.540> 1<00:00:46.989> flat<00:00:47.350> 3<00:00:47.410> 4<00:00:47.860> 5<00:00:48.190> flat

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.580 
minor pentatonic scale 1 flat 3 4 5 flat

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.939 
minor pentatonic scale 1 flat 3 4 5 flat
7<00:00:48.850> then<00:00:49.090> it<00:00:49.210> starts<00:00:49.449> over<00:00:49.600> again<00:00:49.830> so<00:00:50.830> you're

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
7 then it starts over again so you're

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.560 
7 then it starts over again so you're
playing<00:00:51.190> over<00:00:51.460> a<00:00:51.489> g7<00:00:51.970> chord

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
playing over a g7 chord

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.450 
playing over a g7 chord
and<00:00:54.050> what<00:00:54.230> you're<00:00:54.380> doing<00:00:54.620> with<00:00:54.739> this<00:00:54.829> baseline

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
and what you're doing with this baseline

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.190 
and what you're doing with this baseline
this<00:00:55.760> guitar<00:00:56.180> lick<00:00:56.420> is<00:00:56.600> that<00:00:56.780> you're<00:00:56.900> playing

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
this guitar lick is that you're playing

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.990 
this guitar lick is that you're playing
the<00:00:57.380> arpeggio<00:00:57.829> of<00:00:58.040> the<00:00:58.250> chord<00:00:58.550> but<00:00:58.820> you're

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
the arpeggio of the chord but you're

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.869 
the arpeggio of the chord but you're
leaving<00:00:59.150> the<00:00:59.690> third<00:01:00.079> out<00:01:00.640> here<00:01:01.640> would<00:01:01.760> be<00:01:01.790> the

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
leaving the third out here would be the

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.800 
leaving the third out here would be the
arpeggio<00:01:02.330> a<00:01:02.510> g7<00:01:02.989> chord<00:01:03.410> is<00:01:03.710> formulated<00:01:04.580> 1<00:01:04.820> 3<00:01:05.390> 5

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
arpeggio a g7 chord is formulated 1 3 5

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.990 
arpeggio a g7 chord is formulated 1 3 5
flat<00:01:06.320> 7<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:06.950> would<00:01:07.040> continue<00:01:07.369> on<00:01:07.670> a<00:01:07.700> cross

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
flat 7 and it would continue on a cross

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.719 
flat 7 and it would continue on a cross
so<00:01:08.810> that<00:01:08.840> would<00:01:09.050> be<00:01:09.080> the<00:01:09.200> arpeggio<00:01:09.610> so<00:01:10.610> the

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
so that would be the arpeggio so the

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.260 
so that would be the arpeggio so the
line<00:01:10.970> is<00:01:11.000> simply<00:01:11.860> 18<00:01:12.860> which<00:01:13.640> is<00:01:13.759> an<00:01:13.880> octave<00:01:14.180> of

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
line is simply 18 which is an octave of

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
line is simply 18 which is an octave of
one<00:01:14.479> flat<00:01:15.350> seven<00:01:15.830> fun<00:01:16.690> if<00:01:17.690> you're<00:01:17.810> not<00:01:17.869> hip<00:01:18.140> on

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
one flat seven fun if you're not hip on

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.810 
one flat seven fun if you're not hip on
these<00:01:18.440> numbers<00:01:18.890> remember<00:01:19.220> that<00:01:19.490> they<00:01:19.550> always

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
these numbers remember that they always

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.670 
these numbers remember that they always
come<00:01:20.030> from<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.300> major<00:01:20.540> scale<00:01:20.780> here<00:01:21.500> would<00:01:21.650> be

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
come from the major scale here would be

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.580 
come from the major scale here would be
a<00:01:21.770> G<00:01:22.040> Major<00:01:22.250> scale<00:01:22.369> to<00:01:22.910> use<00:01:23.090> one<00:01:23.330> a<00:01:23.600> is<00:01:23.869> to<00:01:24.259> B<00:01:24.290> is

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
a G Major scale to use one a is to B is

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.690 
a G Major scale to use one a is to B is
304<00:01:25.460> d<00:01:25.729> is<00:01:25.840> 56<00:01:26.840> F<00:01:27.110> sharp<00:01:27.619> is<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:27.979> natural<00:01:28.160> seven

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
304 d is 56 F sharp is the natural seven

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.389 
304 d is 56 F sharp is the natural seven
so<00:01:29.180> M<00:01:29.450> natural<00:01:30.110> would<00:01:30.350> be<00:01:30.470> a<00:01:30.500> flat<00:01:30.860> 7<00:01:31.310> you

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
so M natural would be a flat 7 you

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:32.710 
so M natural would be a flat 7 you
flattered<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:31.820> seventh<00:01:32.180> no<00:01:32.330> that's<00:01:32.570> what

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
flattered the seventh no that's what

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.749 
flattered the seventh no that's what
giving<00:01:33.020> that's<00:01:33.740> what's<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.070> blues<00:01:34.310> sound<00:01:34.550> all

where<00:04:22.510> there's<00:04:22.690> a<00:04:22.750> G<00:04:22.960> that's<00:04:23.139> the<00:04:23.380> one<00:04:23.530> court

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
where there's a G that's the one court

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.990 
where there's a G that's the one court
remember<00:04:24.010> we're<00:04:24.250> talking<00:04:24.400> about<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.789> major

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
remember we're talking about the major

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.750 
remember we're talking about the major
scale<00:04:25.210> one<00:04:25.630> can<00:04:25.840> dream<00:04:26.020> or<00:04:26.289> so<00:04:26.650> c<00:04:26.919> is<00:04:27.160> the<00:04:27.430> four

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
scale one can dream or so c is the four

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.610 
scale one can dream or so c is the four
so<00:04:28.330> all<00:04:28.479> you<00:04:28.600> have<00:04:28.660> to<00:04:28.780> do<00:04:28.960> is<00:04:29.110> move<00:04:29.289> the<00:04:29.440> lick

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
so all you have to do is move the lick

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.980 
so all you have to do is move the lick
up<00:04:29.800> a<00:04:30.010> fourth<00:04:30.310> now<00:04:31.030> if<00:04:31.300> you<00:04:31.450> have<00:04:31.600> a<00:04:31.630> lick<00:04:31.870> that

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
up a fourth now if you have a lick that

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.980 
up a fourth now if you have a lick that
resides<00:04:32.380> on<00:04:32.650> your<00:04:33.070> bottom<00:04:33.250> four<00:04:33.639> strings<00:04:34.060> it

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
resides on your bottom four strings it

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.659 
resides on your bottom four strings it
isn't<00:04:35.229> going<00:04:35.320> to<00:04:35.410> move<00:04:35.590> all<00:04:36.039> those<00:04:36.340> strings

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
isn't going to move all those strings

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.850 
isn't going to move all those strings
are<00:04:36.850> tuned<00:04:37.330> four<00:04:37.780> or<00:04:37.990> five<00:04:38.169> frets<00:04:38.410> apart<00:04:38.740> a

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
are tuned four or five frets apart a

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.620 
are tuned four or five frets apart a
perfect<00:04:39.039> fourth<00:04:39.430> so<00:04:39.970> when<00:04:40.060> you<00:04:40.150> move<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.450> liq

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
perfect fourth so when you move the liq

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.030 
perfect fourth so when you move the liq
over<00:04:41.100> it<00:04:42.100> won't<00:04:42.280> change

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
over it won't change

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.710 
over it won't change
so<00:04:44.550> you<00:04:44.700> know<00:04:44.760> how<00:04:44.850> to<00:04:44.940> play<00:04:45.090> it<00:04:45.150> Angie<00:04:45.480> you

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
so you know how to play it Angie you

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.880 
so you know how to play it Angie you
know<00:04:45.780> how<00:04:45.870> to<00:04:45.960> play<00:04:46.140> it<00:04:46.230> off<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.470> fifth<00:04:46.710> string

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
know how to play it off the fifth string

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.950 
know how to play it off the fifth string
and<00:04:47.190> that'll<00:04:47.760> take<00:04:47.940> care<00:04:47.970> of<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.420> sea<00:04:48.690> which

really concern yourself with when you're
in<00:04:56.730> position<00:04:56.880> it's<00:04:57.360> easy<00:04:57.660> to<00:04:57.840> be<00:04:58.020> legato<00:05:00.470> just

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
in position it's easy to be legato just

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.840 
in position it's easy to be legato just
walking<00:05:01.920> see<00:05:02.100> I'm<00:05:02.160> just<00:05:02.220> walking<00:05:02.370> with<00:05:02.760> my

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
you're up here on the five chord there's

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.490 
you're up here on the five chord there's
a<00:05:08.610> shift<00:05:09.440> UNG<00:05:11.720> with<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:12.870> D<00:05:13.020> note<00:05:13.260> then<00:05:13.470> you're

a shift UNG with the D note then you're

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.500 
a shift UNG with the D note then you're
gonna<00:05:13.650> have<00:05:13.800> to<00:05:13.920> start<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:14.490> dear<00:05:14.730> if<00:05:14.970> with

your index finger on that note well look

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.590 
your index finger on that note well look
what<00:05:17.040> I've<00:05:17.190> done<00:05:17.220> watch<00:05:17.730> my<00:05:17.940> index<00:05:18.390> finger<00:05:20.600> you

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
what I've done watch my index finger you

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.510 
what I've done watch my index finger you
see<00:05:21.810> how<00:05:21.960> right<00:05:22.410> after<00:05:22.530> I<00:05:22.710> played<00:05:22.890> the<00:05:23.040> d<00:05:23.220> I<00:05:23.250> got

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
see how right after I played the d I got

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.040 
see how right after I played the d I got
it<00:05:23.610> on<00:05:23.700> the<00:05:24.000> fifth<00:05:24.240> string<00:05:24.300> then<00:05:24.690> I<00:05:24.750> can<00:05:24.900> use<00:05:25.020> a

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
it on the fifth string then I can use a

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.750 
it on the fifth string then I can use a
guide<00:05:25.410> finger

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.630 

get<00:05:29.760> a<00:05:29.790> lookout<00:05:30.090> toe<00:05:30.300> shifter<00:05:31.130> now<00:05:32.130> this<00:05:32.460> whole

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
get a lookout toe shifter now this whole

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.930 
get a lookout toe shifter now this whole
principle<00:05:32.970> of<00:05:33.180> shifting<00:05:34.610> you<00:05:35.610> see<00:05:35.760> what<00:05:35.880> I'm

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
principle of shifting you see what I'm

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.740 
principle of shifting you see what I'm
doing<00:05:36.060> I'm<00:05:36.330> when<00:05:36.570> a<00:05:36.600> deal<00:05:36.960> with<00:05:38.750> different

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
doing I'm when a deal with different

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.320 
doing I'm when a deal with different
friend<00:05:40.700> that's<00:05:41.700> a<00:05:41.820> good<00:05:41.970> thing<00:05:42.150> to<00:05:42.210> practice

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
friend that's a good thing to practice

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.760 
friend that's a good thing to practice
because<00:05:42.960> you<00:05:42.990> want<00:05:43.200> to<00:05:43.230> be<00:05:43.290> able<00:05:43.470> to<00:05:43.530> shift

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
because you want to be able to shift

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.740 
because you want to be able to shift
quickly<00:05:44.130> and<00:05:44.520> cleanly<00:05:44.760> and<00:05:45.120> not<00:05:45.450> break<00:05:45.690> your

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
quickly and cleanly and not break your

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.220 
quickly and cleanly and not break your
legato<00:05:46.230> so<00:05:46.650> you're<00:05:46.860> shifting<00:05:47.220> up<00:05:48.110> becomes<00:05:49.110> the

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
legato so you're shifting up becomes the

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.970 
legato so you're shifting up becomes the
need<00:05:49.790> now<00:05:50.790> watch<00:05:51.000> this<00:05:51.350> you<00:05:52.350> got<00:05:52.500> to<00:05:52.590> move<00:05:52.710> real

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
need now watch this you got to move real

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.470 
need now watch this you got to move real
fast<00:05:53.010> right<00:05:53.640> there<00:05:53.880> cuz<00:05:54.120> you<00:05:54.210> don't<00:05:54.330> want<00:05:54.450> a

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:54.480 
fast right there cuz you don't want a

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.970 
fast right there cuz you don't want a
big<00:05:54.600> gap<00:05:54.870> you<00:05:55.050> don't<00:05:55.170> go<00:05:57.650> sticks<00:05:58.650> out<00:05:58.770> like<00:05:58.830> a

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980 
big gap you don't go sticks out like a

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.170 
big gap you don't go sticks out like a
sore<00:05:59.010> thumb<00:05:59.190> so<00:06:01.190> where<00:06:02.190> is<00:06:02.310> your<00:06:02.340> index<00:06:02.760> finger

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
sore thumb so where is your index finger

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.240 
sore thumb so where is your index finger
in<00:06:03.330> advance<00:06:03.930> already<00:06:04.530> on<00:06:04.740> the<00:06:04.770> fifth<00:06:05.190> string

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
in advance already on the fifth string

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.210 
in advance already on the fifth string
then<00:06:05.580> you<00:06:05.640> shift<00:06:05.910> quickly<00:06:06.890> so<00:06:07.890> what<00:06:08.040> I<00:06:08.070> suggest

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
then you shift quickly so what I suggest

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.300 
then you shift quickly so what I suggest
is<00:06:08.790> you<00:06:08.850> practice<00:06:09.360> every<00:06:09.720> connector<00:06:10.320> take<00:06:11.160> the

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
is you practice every connector take the

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.550 
is you practice every connector take the
last<00:06:11.550> note<00:06:11.910> of<00:06:12.120> a<00:06:12.210> G<00:06:12.420> lick<00:06:12.660> connected<00:06:13.380> to<00:06:13.440> the

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
last note of a G lick connected to the

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.770 
last note of a G lick connected to the
first<00:06:13.710> know<00:06:13.980> the<00:06:14.190> sea<00:06:14.370> lick<00:06:14.640> and<00:06:14.880> vice<00:06:15.420> versa

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
first know the sea lick and vice versa

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.840 
first know the sea lick and vice versa
then<00:06:16.380> do<00:06:16.530> that<00:06:16.710> with<00:06:16.830> each<00:06:17.070> of<00:06:17.310> the<00:06:17.580> three

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
then do that with each of the three

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.370 
then do that with each of the three
chords<00:06:18.240> so<00:06:18.390> you<00:06:18.450> have<00:06:18.750> good<00:06:19.020> clear

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
chords so you have good clear

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.320 
chords so you have good clear
connections<00:06:19.890> because<00:06:20.190> the<00:06:20.340> lick<00:06:20.550> itself<00:06:21.000> is

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
connections because the lick itself is

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:29.579 
connections because the lick itself is
not<00:06:21.600> that<00:06:21.810> difficult<00:06:24.500> all<00:06:25.500> right<00:06:25.680> now

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.519 
then on the last measure you play root
