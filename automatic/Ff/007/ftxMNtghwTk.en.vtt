that do this kind of series and stuff
like<00:00:52.589> that<00:00:52.649> but<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.129> all<00:00:53.249> a<00:00:53.309> completely

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
like that but it is all a completely

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:55.520 
like that but it is all a completely
opinionated<00:00:54.690> mind<00:00:55.079> could<00:00:55.260> be<00:00:55.320> completely

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
opinionated mind could be completely

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.930 
opinionated mind could be completely
different<00:00:55.769> from<00:00:56.070> somebody<00:00:56.519> else<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.850> you

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
different from somebody else that you

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.270 
different from somebody else that you
watch<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.719> I'm<00:00:58.019> not<00:00:58.469> really<00:00:58.530> copying<00:00:59.070> anybody

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
watch so I'm not really copying anybody

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.799 
watch so I'm not really copying anybody
it<00:00:59.579> could<00:00:59.609> be<00:00:59.789> completely<00:00:59.999> different<00:01:00.179> like<00:01:00.600> my

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
it could be completely different like my

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.660 
it could be completely different like my
stats<00:01:01.079> could<00:01:01.260> be<00:01:01.319> different<00:01:01.649> from<00:01:01.710> theirs<00:01:02.039> so

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
stats could be different from theirs so

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.850 
stats could be different from theirs so
that<00:01:02.909> is<00:01:02.999> basically<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.500> want<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.710> get

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
that is basically it but I want to get

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.350 
that is basically it but I want to get
on<00:01:04.949> with<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.400> episode<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.970> first<00:01:06.090> part

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
on with the episode the first part

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.810 
on with the episode the first part
actually<00:01:06.510> doing<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> Cristiano<00:01:07.979> Ronaldo

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
actually doing is a Cristiano Ronaldo

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.300 
actually doing is a Cristiano Ronaldo
you've<00:01:09.180> got<00:01:09.299> 55<00:01:09.689> goals<00:01:09.930> last<00:01:10.409> season<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.189> that

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
you've got 55 goals last season so that

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.679 
you've got 55 goals last season so that
is<00:01:11.399> why<00:01:11.520> I've<00:01:11.640> really<00:01:11.880> upgraded<00:01:12.270> his<00:01:12.450> rate

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
is why I've really upgraded his rate

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.149 
is why I've really upgraded his rate
into<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.049> 93<00:01:13.439> ok<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:14.549> pace<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.920> plus<00:01:16.920> one

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
into it 93 ok this pace to a plus one

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.709 
into it 93 ok this pace to a plus one
because<00:01:17.430> i<00:01:17.460> think<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.970> probably<00:01:18.000> will<00:01:18.329> go<00:01:18.570> out

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
because i think it probably will go out

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:20.420 
because i think it probably will go out
probably<00:01:18.960> more<00:01:19.110> likely<00:01:19.590> his<00:01:19.950> sprint<00:01:20.189> speed

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
probably more likely his sprint speed

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.130 
probably more likely his sprint speed
than<00:01:20.640> his<00:01:20.759> acceleration<00:01:21.420> I've<00:01:21.780> left<00:01:21.990> his

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
than his acceleration I've left his

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.389 
than his acceleration I've left his
dribbling<00:01:22.439> at<00:01:22.530> night<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.860> before<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.219> was

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
dribbling at night to before I was

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.330 
dribbling at night to before I was
pretty<00:01:23.610> good<00:01:23.759> shot<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.869> put<00:01:25.049> up<00:01:25.140> by<00:01:25.320> two<00:01:25.380> because

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
pretty good shot I put up by two because

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.580 
pretty good shot I put up by two because
he<00:01:26.460> could<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:26.759> 55<00:01:27.240> goals<00:01:27.509> last<00:01:27.780> season<00:01:27.930> which

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
he could get 55 goals last season which

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.130 
he could get 55 goals last season which
was<00:01:28.619> absolutely<00:01:28.950> saying<00:01:29.719> passing<00:01:30.719> i<00:01:30.810> left<00:01:30.990> at

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
was absolutely saying passing i left at

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.520 
was absolutely saying passing i left at
80<00:01:31.320> heading<00:01:32.250> up<00:01:32.549> 12<00:01:33.149> ACA<00:01:33.539> and<00:01:33.930> defending<00:01:34.409> i

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
80 heading up 12 ACA and defending i

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.010 
80 heading up 12 ACA and defending i
dropped<00:01:34.890> down<00:01:35.070> by<00:01:35.130> minus<00:01:36.090> free<00:01:36.390> because

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
dropped down by minus free because

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.749 
dropped down by minus free because
basically<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.680> know<00:01:37.890> he<00:01:38.219> does<00:01:38.460> get<00:01:38.610> back

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
basically I know he does get back

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.789 
basically I know he does get back
occasionally<00:01:39.060> but<00:01:39.450> he's<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> left<00:01:39.960> winger<00:01:40.350> with

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
occasionally but he's a left winger with

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.620 
occasionally but he's a left winger with
a<00:01:40.829> high<00:01:41.219> attack<00:01:41.490> workrate<00:01:41.789> and<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.390> low

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
a high attack workrate and a low

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.060 
a high attack workrate and a low
defensive<00:01:43.170> workrate<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.770> doesn't<00:01:43.979> really

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
defensive workrate so it doesn't really

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.550 
defensive workrate so it doesn't really
get<00:01:44.280> back<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.700> much<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.450> he's<00:01:45.689> defending<00:01:46.320> is

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
get back that much so he's defending is

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.020 
get back that much so he's defending is
not<00:01:46.950> particularly<00:01:47.340> good<00:01:47.490> but<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.000> just

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
not particularly good but this is just

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.120 
not particularly good but this is just
my<00:01:48.270> prediction<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.320> reckon<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.740> be<00:01:49.829> alike<00:01:50.100> a

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
my prediction I reckon to be alike a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.099 
my prediction I reckon to be alike a
note<00:01:50.430> III<00:01:50.520> rated<00:01:51.000> maybe<00:01:51.390> possibly<00:01:51.780> if

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
note III rated maybe possibly if

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.469 
note III rated maybe possibly if
Messing's<00:01:52.439> 95<00:01:52.950> he<00:01:53.399> could<00:01:53.579> be<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> 94<00:01:54.180> but<00:01:54.359> I've

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
Messing's 95 he could be a 94 but I've

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.490 
Messing's 95 he could be a 94 but I've
poem<00:01:54.780> as<00:01:54.930> 8<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.579> 93<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.570> I've<00:01:57.780> kept<00:01:58.289> him<00:01:58.380> as<00:01:58.469> a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
poem as 8 and 93 so I've kept him as a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.870 
poem as 8 and 93 so I've kept him as a
left<00:01:58.770> winger<00:01:59.280> even<00:01:59.640> though<00:01:59.700> with<00:01:59.850> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
left winger even though with the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.359 
left winger even though with the
introduction<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.780> bail<00:02:01.439> as<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.920> might<00:02:02.159> see

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
introduction of bail as you might see

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.789 
introduction of bail as you might see
here<00:02:02.579> he<00:02:02.700> may<00:02:03.000> go<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.359> Real<00:02:03.719> Madrid<00:02:04.229> not

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
here he may go to Real Madrid not

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.740 
here he may go to Real Madrid not
particularly<00:02:05.070> sure<00:02:05.369> yet<00:02:05.640> he<00:02:05.789> got<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> 21<00:02:06.630> goals

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
particularly sure yet he got a 21 goals

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.830 
particularly sure yet he got a 21 goals
at<00:02:06.990> last<00:02:07.229> season<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.679> four<00:02:08.039> assists<00:02:08.840> upgraded

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
at last season and four assists upgraded

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.980 
at last season and four assists upgraded
his<00:02:09.990> rating<00:02:10.590> by<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.950> free<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.880> an<00:02:12.000> 88<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.510> kept<00:02:12.870> him

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
his rating by a free to an 88 I kept him

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.440 
his rating by a free to an 88 I kept him
as<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.320> left<00:02:13.800> winger<00:02:14.310> again<00:02:14.580> even<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.180> think<00:02:15.240> if

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
as a left winger again even I think if

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.970 
as a left winger again even I think if
he<00:02:15.510> goes<00:02:15.660> around<00:02:15.810> madrid<00:02:16.140> i<00:02:16.320> think<00:02:16.500> he<00:02:16.650> would

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
he goes around madrid i think he would

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.850 
he goes around madrid i think he would
a left-winger<00:02:17.640> his<00:02:18.390> pace<00:02:18.659> i<00:02:18.870> upgraded<00:02:19.170> by<00:02:19.319> 12

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
a left-winger his pace i upgraded by 12

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.530 
a left-winger his pace i upgraded by 12
and<00:02:19.890> 93<00:02:20.730> he's<00:02:21.239> dribbling<00:02:21.569> up<00:02:21.930> by<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:23.000> 287<00:02:24.000> it

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
and 93 he's dribbling up by to 287 it

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.259 
and 93 he's dribbling up by to 287 it
shot<00:02:25.470> up<00:02:25.650> by<00:02:25.769> six<00:02:26.730> from<00:02:27.330> 85<00:02:28.049> to<00:02:28.489> 85<00:02:29.489> it's

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
shot up by six from 85 to 85 it's

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.979 
shot up by six from 85 to 85 it's
passing<00:02:30.780> up<00:02:30.989> by<00:02:31.409> one<00:02:31.909> he's<00:02:32.909> heading<00:02:33.390> up<00:02:33.720> by<00:02:33.930> two

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
passing up by one he's heading up by two

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.900 
passing up by one he's heading up by two
and<00:02:34.410> it's<00:02:34.620> defending<00:02:35.040> again<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.400> dropped<00:02:35.760> him

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
and it's defending again I dropped him

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.059 
and it's defending again I dropped him
down<00:02:36.000> by<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.360> minus<00:02:36.840> four<00:02:37.049> because<00:02:37.349> even<00:02:37.950> though

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
down by a minus four because even though

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.589 
down by a minus four because even though
now<00:02:38.310> he's<00:02:38.549> not<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.760> left-back<00:02:39.150> he<00:02:39.299> still<00:02:39.510> has

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
now he's not a left-back he still has

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.210 
now he's not a left-back he still has
very<00:02:39.750> very<00:02:39.870> good<00:02:40.110> defending<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:40.620> think<00:02:40.709> 70

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
very very good defending so I think 70

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.670 
very very good defending so I think 70
was<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.430> very<00:02:41.700> good<00:02:41.910> like<00:02:42.780> stat<00:02:43.079> for<00:02:43.260> him<00:02:43.410> for

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
was a very good like stat for him for

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.309 
was a very good like stat for him for
being<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:43.920> defender<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.269> around<00:02:45.629> 70<00:02:46.049> because<00:02:46.230> he

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
being a defender so around 70 because he

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.630 
being a defender so around 70 because he
still<00:02:46.530> gets<00:02:46.590> back<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.099> stuff<00:02:47.280> like<00:02:47.430> that<00:02:47.489> I

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
still gets back and stuff like that I

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.250 
still gets back and stuff like that I
still<00:02:47.970> think<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.209> is<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.420> very<00:02:48.599> good<00:02:48.690> stuff<00:02:49.049> in

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
still think that is a very good stuff in

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.170 
still think that is a very good stuff in
certain<00:02:49.980> if<00:02:50.040> we<00:02:50.099> heading<00:02:50.370> which<00:02:50.610> is<00:02:50.819> not<00:02:51.060> too

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
certain if we heading which is not too

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.339 
certain if we heading which is not too
bad<00:02:51.360> because<00:02:51.690> he<00:02:51.840> doesn't<00:02:51.989> really<00:02:52.140> have<00:02:52.230> the

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
bad because he doesn't really have the

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.720 
bad because he doesn't really have the
ball<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.680> much<00:02:52.860> but<00:02:53.010> no<00:02:53.160> III<00:02:53.340> pace<00:02:53.579> is

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
ball that much but no III pace is

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.240 
ball that much but no III pace is
amazing<00:02:53.849> and<00:02:54.360> 87<00:02:55.079> dribbling<00:02:55.379> and<00:02:55.500> 85<00:02:56.010> shot

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
amazing and 87 dribbling and 85 shot

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.099 
amazing and 87 dribbling and 85 shot
definitely<00:02:56.430> because<00:02:57.060> he<00:02:57.180> has<00:02:57.299> got<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.629> very

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
definitely because he has got a very

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.830 
definitely because he has got a very
very<00:02:58.530> nice<00:02:58.829> shot<00:02:59.250> in<00:02:59.489> it<00:02:59.700> d<00:02:59.970> but<00:03:00.750> I'm<00:03:00.810> not

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
very nice shot in it d but I'm not

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.270 
very nice shot in it d but I'm not
really<00:03:01.019> sure<00:03:01.140> yet<00:03:01.379> if<00:03:01.560> he<00:03:01.709> actually<00:03:01.890> will<00:03:02.250> be

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
really sure yet if he actually will be

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.030 
really sure yet if he actually will be
going<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.730> run<00:03:02.849> with<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.150> probably

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
speculations that Run which would

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.970 
speculations that Run which would

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
i'm not particularly sure if that's

this<00:03:18.900> episode<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.470> is<00:03:19.709> a<00:03:19.739> Barcelona's

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
this episode and that is a Barcelona's

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.610 
this episode and that is a Barcelona's
and<00:03:20.790> nimah<00:03:21.090> I'll<00:03:21.840> put<00:03:22.019> him<00:03:22.109> down<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.410> eight<00:03:22.590> a

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
and nimah I'll put him down to eight a

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.170 
and nimah I'll put him down to eight a
left<00:03:22.950> wing<00:03:23.220> because<00:03:23.609> I<00:03:23.730> think<00:03:23.790> with<00:03:24.060> the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
left wing because I think with the

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.520 
left wing because I think with the
introduction<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.750> him<00:03:25.109> bringing<00:03:25.380> to

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
introduction of him bringing to

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.530 
introduction of him bringing to
Barcelona<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.250> think<00:03:26.669> even<00:03:26.790> though<00:03:27.060> message

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
Barcelona I think even though message

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.120 
Barcelona I think even though message
that<00:03:27.720> he<00:03:27.870> lets<00:03:28.139> you<00:03:28.230> still<00:03:28.500> will<00:03:28.680> be<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:28.919> main

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
that he lets you still will be the main

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.770 
that he lets you still will be the main
striker<00:03:29.489> so<00:03:29.730> I<00:03:29.760> think<00:03:29.849> Neymar<00:03:30.180> will<00:03:30.480> be<00:03:30.569> used

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
striker so I think Neymar will be used

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.479 
striker so I think Neymar will be used
as<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:31.049> left<00:03:31.260> winger<00:03:31.500> I've<00:03:31.859> upgrade<00:03:32.190> is<00:03:32.310> right
