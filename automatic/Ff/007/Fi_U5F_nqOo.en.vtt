00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.960
 Then I want to change the sky 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:12.290
 The paint is of Forbein 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:18.730
 Ultramarine dip celerian blue 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.730
 I would like to mix a permanent rose only slightly from the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.350
 In with 8 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:29.520
 It is such a brush for calligraphy 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.520
 You can even these were watercolor of ship 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.360
 There eh 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.360
 This time God is 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.690
 Rank of the pig 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.130
 It is a pad type 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:48.920
 This is how the part type is 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:52.300
 There is no block type It is a block type Please stick to it again 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.840
 Para by sketchbook does not fall apart 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.200
 Here after writing 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.060
 While it says palette do this with something like a paper knife 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.270
 Peel off and use 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:08.010
 You do n't have to stick water if you use this 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.450
 I am using it this time because it is quite easy 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.900
 Gotta 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.190
 It is pretty rough feeling it this 300g 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.190
 so 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.300
 It will be hot 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.300
 But let's do it right away 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.680
 First whole because the sky is that writing 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.680
 Let 's go to the sky 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.940
 Clean water 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.940
 I try not to get wet in places 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.940
 Hmm 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:44.440
 Put one more clean water 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.440
 With Cerulean Blue I showed here a while ago 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.840
 Then ultramarine 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.840
 A mixture of 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:59.439
 But it feels like going 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.439
 Open the white place and momentum opened well I mean the child a little 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.530
 It looks like this 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:25.910
 Mix the permanent rose too 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.910
 Add purplish color 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.250
 You will feel 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.760
 I almost grew up with this I grew up 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.760
 The basic is 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.250
 A little tilt the sparkling hair 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.850
 Sober 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.850
 Five 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.819
 For those who spread 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.859
 Let's say Ijima will go 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.859
 I think it is interesting to go 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.290
 that's all
