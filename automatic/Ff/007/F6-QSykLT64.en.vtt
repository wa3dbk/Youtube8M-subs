to the first problem with this team you

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.810 
to the first problem with this team you
have<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.079> play<00:01:49.259> pretty<00:01:49.890> much<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> left<00:01:50.430> back<00:01:50.610> in

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
have to play pretty much a left back in

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.359 
have to play pretty much a left back in
the<00:01:50.939> right<00:01:51.060> back<00:01:51.240> position<00:01:51.409> because<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
the right back position because the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.219 
the right back position because the
right<00:01:53.579> back<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.030> actual<00:01:54.149> inform<00:01:54.840> work<00:01:55.020> back

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
right back the actual inform work back

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.020 
right back the actual inform work back
the<00:01:56.219> only<00:01:56.460> other<00:01:56.610> one<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:58.369> 46<00:01:59.369> pace<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.759> think<00:01:59.939> it

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
the only other one is 46 pace I think it

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.569 
the only other one is 46 pace I think it
is<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:01.079> can<00:02:01.259> have<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> right<00:02:01.860> back<00:02:02.040> with<00:02:02.159> 46

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
is and you can have a right back with 46

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.880 
is and you can have a right back with 46

give<00:05:12.200> it<00:05:12.320> a<00:05:12.380> four<00:05:12.680> because<00:05:13.220> the<00:05:13.340> defense<00:05:13.640> was

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820
