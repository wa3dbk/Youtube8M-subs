00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.160
 degrees 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.699

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.879

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:48.879

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.230
 the roe deer is the family member 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.540
 make life in eurasia's smallest 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.850
 in adulthood the roe deer has a 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.300
 height on the cross of 76 centimeters as 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.100
 maximum and a weight of up to 35 kilos 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.170
 males shed their horns every year 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.090
 early winter and the new one has 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.080
 finished developing already when 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.510
 spring begins 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.790
 the coat is reddish brown in both sexes 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.670
 during the summer turning grayish 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.980
 In winter, the 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.610
 cries that emit both similar sexes 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.610
 to a bark 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.789
 Antonio locates a deer on the edge of a 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:35.020
 planted and after observing it 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.909
 Paco briefly prepares to shoot him down 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.880
 the distance that separates roe deer and 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.560
 hunter although long is not excessive by 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.689
 what happened will try to get hold of him 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.159
 from there to avoid risking 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.850
 that the animal detects him in the 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.850
 approach 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.170
