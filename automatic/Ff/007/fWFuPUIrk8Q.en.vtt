00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.180
 the greyhound race here in the region is 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.599
 a 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:14.769
 a deeply rooted practice 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:16.539
 many many people chacareros is a 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.420
 widespread practice in the farms in 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.380
 area protect area 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.630
 centenarians 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:27.190
 for the side of rionegro this is a 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.770
 sport is a very nice sport 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.349
 extended nationwide there is always 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.870
 that frame it within what is the 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.120
 animal welfare that's why all these 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.780
 laws or ordinances that have come 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.970
 coming out I think that headed to the head 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.440
 of all this the province of holy faith and 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.960
 what have been done have been doing 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.989
 echos other cities and other provinces 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.699
 there are things that at least I do not 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.739
 I agree I do not think 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:01.920
 I believe I prohibit sport is not the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.989
 way to regularize it if you can 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.390
 regular and it's fine to regulate 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.119
 in everything that has to do justly 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.790
 with animal welfare in fact is a 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.750
 sport and a sport can never be 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.670
 healthy is a healthy sport for 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.740
 the dog that practices it for 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.140
 owner who trains him and for the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.300
 public that attends the races that 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.300
 what happens happens that they die or are 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.890
 Regularized events do not count 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.729
 example with a veterinarian who is 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.310
 charge to control the dogs 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.140
 that are going to run before or after the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.620
 career or during the race in the case 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.250
 of an accident occurring but 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.230
 it is an activity that is valid 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.270
 and I repeat and I do not want to be repetitive what 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.280
 I wanted with animal welfare and that 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.979
 it should be controlled as it 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.420
 controls for example at racetracks 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.450
 is controlled for example it is done 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.010
 anti-doping control to horses because 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.430
 yes of course I do an active that 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.910
 it is not regulated they start to exist 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.410
 clandestine bets begin to exist 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.850
 drugs or drugs that are used 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.350
 to increase performance 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:17.450
 dogs in the race that many times do not 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:20.190
 they do us good to health but to 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.620
 prohibit them I think it's not the way 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.530
 why are we not talking about a 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.989
 bullfight or anything that is that you 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.430
 do wrong to the animal if it is done is a 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.650
 sport and a sport whenever 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.380
 celebrate it and there are many substances 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.330
 that they increase the performance 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.760
 sports as well as there are foods that 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.470
 increase sports performance 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.390
 Of course I fall back on the same thing 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.120
 I say when it comes to doing something that is not 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.470
 regularized we can not talk about 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.360
 substances that are permitted by 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.550
 substances that are not allowed but 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.620
 good if it is regularized 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.610
 can do together with a committee 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.640
 veterinarian on advisory committee with taking 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.480
 taking examples that are used in others 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.940
 countries 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.860
 which drugs would be allowed and 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.950
 which are drugs that make you worse 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.569
 to the animals really and in any case 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:16.049
 should establish a 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.049
 let's say sanctions to those who do not comply 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.260
 yes
