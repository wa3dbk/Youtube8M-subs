storage<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.960> survival<00:00:16.410> equipment<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:17.160> head

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
storage and survival equipment so head

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.130 
storage and survival equipment so head
on<00:00:17.369> over<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.730> family<00:00:18.240> storehouse<00:00:18.600> done<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:18.990> and

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
on over to family storehouse done it and

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.830 
on over to family storehouse done it and
check<00:00:19.350> out<00:00:19.500> what<00:00:19.529> they<00:00:19.680> got<00:00:20.330> so<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.480> complete

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
check out what they got so the complete

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.630 
check out what they got so the complete
water<00:00:22.050> treatment<00:00:22.529> system<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.039> gravity

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
water treatment system is a gravity

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.210 
water treatment system is a gravity
water<00:00:23.880> filtration<00:00:24.359> system<00:00:25.050> Sawyer<00:00:25.890> is

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
water filtration system Sawyer is

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.240 
water filtration system Sawyer is
actually<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.640> pretty<00:00:26.849> well-known<00:00:27.410> brand<00:00:28.410> they

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
actually a pretty well-known brand they

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.939 
actually a pretty well-known brand they
do<00:00:29.310> kidney<00:00:30.210> dialysis<00:00:30.750> models<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.410> addition<00:00:31.830> to

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
do kidney dialysis models in addition to

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.470 
do kidney dialysis models in addition to
their<00:00:32.040> water<00:00:32.250> filtration<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.210> bunch<00:00:33.390> of

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
their water filtration and a bunch of

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.319 
their water filtration and a bunch of
other<00:00:33.690> cool<00:00:33.930> technologies<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.059> so<00:00:36.059> when<00:00:36.210> it

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
other cool technologies and so when it

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.970 
other cool technologies and so when it
really<00:00:36.630> comes<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.170> filtration<00:00:37.800> and

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
really comes to filtration and

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.410 
really comes to filtration and
purification<00:00:38.040> they<00:00:38.820> know<00:00:39.120> what<00:00:39.300> they're

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
purification they know what they're

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.630 
purification they know what they're
talking<00:00:39.450> about<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.680> as<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:41.040> see<00:00:41.250> here

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
talking about so as you can see here

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.459 
talking about so as you can see here
their<00:00:42.090> water<00:00:42.300> filters<00:00:42.719> come<00:00:43.020> with<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> 1

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
their water filters come with a 1

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.220 
their water filters come with a 1
million<00:00:43.860> gallon<00:00:44.280> guarantee<00:00:44.789> which<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.840> haven't

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
million gallon guarantee which I haven't

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.959 
million gallon guarantee which I haven't
seen<00:00:46.440> with<00:00:46.620> any<00:00:46.920> other<00:00:47.129> water<00:00:47.430> filter<00:00:47.820> before

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
seen with any other water filter before

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.630 
seen with any other water filter before
and<00:00:48.510> they<00:00:48.989> can<00:00:49.170> guarantee<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.829> because<00:00:50.309> of

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
and they can guarantee this because of

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.880 
and they can guarantee this because of
the<00:00:50.940> technology<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.899> allows<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.440> clean

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
the technology that allows you to clean

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.069 
the technology that allows you to clean
your<00:00:53.070> filter<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:54.329> being<00:00:54.510> used<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.960> I'll

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
your filter as it's being used and I'll

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.229 
your filter as it's being used and I'll
show<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.440> later<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.910> four

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
show you that later so this is the four

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.840 
show you that later so this is the four
liter<00:00:57.480> capacity<00:00:57.750> model<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.800> also<00:00:59.039> comes<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.699> a

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
liter capacity model it also comes in a

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.490 
liter capacity model it also comes in a
two<00:01:00.059> liter<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:00.629> if<00:01:00.780> you're<00:01:00.930> talking<00:01:01.289> for

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
two liter but if you're talking for

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.160 
two liter but if you're talking for
yourself<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.270> addition<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.570> even<00:01:03.809> one<00:01:03.989> other

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
yourself in addition to even one other

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.960 
yourself in addition to even one other
person<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.860> wouldn't<00:01:05.159> get<00:01:05.250> anything<00:01:05.460> less<00:01:05.790> than

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
person I wouldn't get anything less than

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.969 
person I wouldn't get anything less than
the<00:01:06.030> four<00:01:06.299> liter<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.350> back<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.530> we<00:01:07.830> got

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the four liter on the back here we got

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.850 
the four liter on the back here we got
some<00:01:08.159> instructions<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:09.030> how<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.299> use<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.860> how

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
some instructions on how to use it how

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.710 
some instructions on how to use it how
to<00:01:10.920> backwash<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.000> what's<00:01:12.150> included<00:01:12.330> in

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
to backwash it and what's included in

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.780 
to backwash it and what's included in
the<00:01:12.810> box<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.380> I'm<00:01:13.470> pretty<00:01:13.710> good<00:01:13.890> info<00:01:14.250> probably

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the box so I'm pretty good info probably

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.880 
the box so I'm pretty good info probably
worth<00:01:14.939> saving<00:01:15.390> but<00:01:15.570> let's<00:01:16.560> go<00:01:16.710> ahead<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
worth saving but let's go ahead and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.580 
worth saving but let's go ahead and
check<00:01:17.159> out<00:01:17.340> what's<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.850> box<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:19.320> right<00:01:19.560> off

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
check out what's in the box so right off

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.929 
check out what's in the box so right off
the<00:01:19.710> bat<00:01:19.860> you're<00:01:20.159> going<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.369> notice<00:01:20.580> that

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
the bat you're going to notice that

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.670 
the bat you're going to notice that
everything<00:01:21.210> here<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.720> color-coded<00:01:22.259> which

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
everything here is color-coded which

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.520 
everything here is color-coded which
makes<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.100> super<00:01:23.610> simple<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.060> explain<00:01:24.630> how<00:01:25.470> to

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
makes it super simple to explain how to

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.410 
makes it super simple to explain how to
set<00:01:25.799> up<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.159> remember<00:01:26.549> how<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.729> set<00:01:26.970> up<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.270> so

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
set up to remember how to set up and so

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.990 
set up to remember how to set up and so
forth<00:01:27.829> everything<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.040> either<00:01:29.220> gray<00:01:29.549> or<00:01:29.579> blue

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
forth everything is either gray or blue

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.090 
forth everything is either gray or blue
so<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.479> know<00:01:30.720> what<00:01:30.990> hooks<00:01:31.229> up<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.530> what<00:01:31.770> and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
so you know what hooks up to what and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.340 
so you know what hooks up to what and
it's<00:01:32.880> not<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.210> some<00:01:33.450> other<00:01:33.630> stuff<00:01:33.930> where<00:01:34.200> you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
it's not like some other stuff where you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.380 
it's not like some other stuff where you
use<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.829> once<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.310> learn<00:01:35.520> how<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.759> use<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.240> you

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
use it once you learn how to use it you

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.999 
use it once you learn how to use it you
throw<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.840> your<00:01:36.869> storage<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.650> then<00:01:37.740> six

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
throw it in your storage and then six

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.410 
throw it in your storage and then six
months<00:01:38.070> later<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.640> can't<00:01:38.939> remember<00:01:39.270> how<00:01:39.360> to

working when you need it the most so you

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.020 
working when you need it the most so you

show you how so first this is a gravity
water<00:04:14.500> filtration<00:04:14.890> system<00:04:15.519> so<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:15.910> dirty

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150

filter and into your water bag and then

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.130 
filter and into your water bag and then
you're<00:05:47.000> just<00:05:47.030> going<00:05:47.270> to<00:05:47.360> let<00:05:47.540> gravity<00:05:47.750> do<00:05:48.110> the

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
you're just going to let gravity do the

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.969 
you're just going to let gravity do the
work<00:05:48.310> for<00:05:49.310> this<00:05:49.669> 4<00:05:50.000> liter<00:05:50.180> bladder<00:05:50.900> it<00:05:51.320> did<00:05:51.830> it

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
work for this 4 liter bladder it did it

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.190 
work for this 4 liter bladder it did it
all<00:05:52.130> of<00:05:52.490> it<00:05:52.580> in<00:05:52.760> about<00:05:53.000> five<00:05:53.240> minutes<00:05:53.540> so<00:05:54.169> the

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
all of it in about five minutes so the

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.380 
all of it in about five minutes so the
two<00:05:54.560> liter<00:05:54.770> bladder<00:05:55.040> would<00:05:55.610> probably<00:05:56.120> get<00:05:56.240> you

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
two liter bladder would probably get you

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.620 
two liter bladder would probably get you
done<00:05:56.570> in<00:05:56.870> about<00:05:57.290> two<00:05:57.650> and<00:05:57.680> a<00:05:57.800> half<00:05:57.830> minutes<00:05:58.160> and

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
done in about two and a half minutes and

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.980 
done in about two and a half minutes and
that's<00:05:59.630> pretty<00:05:59.990> fast<00:06:01.240> so<00:06:02.240> another<00:06:02.510> feature<00:06:02.810> I

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
that's pretty fast so another feature I

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.870 
that's pretty fast so another feature I
really<00:06:03.530> love<00:06:03.740> about<00:06:03.890> this<00:06:04.100> filter<00:06:04.490> is<00:06:04.520> its

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
really love about this filter is its

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.050 
really love about this filter is its
pickett<00:06:05.360> it<00:06:05.510> is<00:06:06.110> super<00:06:06.620> easy<00:06:06.650> to<00:06:06.979> use<00:06:07.280> and<00:06:07.640> you

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
pickett it is super easy to use and you

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.520 
pickett it is super easy to use and you
really<00:06:08.390> don't<00:06:08.479> come<00:06:08.720> across<00:06:08.840> many<00:06:09.229> filters

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
really don't come across many filters

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.159 
really don't come across many filters
that<00:06:09.860> have<00:06:10.100> something<00:06:10.580> so<00:06:10.760> intuitive<00:06:11.330> built

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169 
that have something so intuitive built

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.080 
that have something so intuitive built
into<00:06:12.710> the<00:06:12.830> filter<00:06:13.040> most<00:06:13.430> of<00:06:13.580> the<00:06:13.700> time<00:06:13.910> you

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
into the filter most of the time you

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.240 
into the filter most of the time you
have<00:06:14.210> to<00:06:14.390> buy<00:06:14.600> spigots<00:06:15.290> in<00:06:15.530> addition<00:06:15.979> to<00:06:16.130> the

have to buy spigots in addition to the
filter<00:06:16.580> or<00:06:16.910> something<00:06:17.720> like<00:06:17.810> that<00:06:17.870> so<00:06:18.290> let<00:06:18.470> me

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
filter or something like that so let me

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.380 
filter or something like that so let me
show<00:06:18.710> you<00:06:18.770> how<00:06:18.860> it<00:06:19.100> works<00:06:19.340> you<00:06:19.850> just<00:06:20.060> put<00:06:20.270> your

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
show you how it works you just put your

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.840 
show you how it works you just put your
glass<00:06:20.630> underneath<00:06:21.290> the<00:06:21.560> spigot<00:06:21.919> and<00:06:22.070> pull

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
glass underneath the spigot and pull

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.730 
glass underneath the spigot and pull
this<00:06:22.970> down<00:06:23.210> it's<00:06:23.660> trickling<00:06:24.110> right<00:06:24.350> now<00:06:24.530> but

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
this down it's trickling right now but

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.080 
this down it's trickling right now but
you<00:06:24.800> can<00:06:24.919> make<00:06:25.070> it<00:06:25.190> flow<00:06:25.400> as<00:06:25.550> fast<00:06:25.790> as<00:06:25.940> you<00:06:25.970> want

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
you can make it flow as fast as you want

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.020 
you can make it flow as fast as you want
and<00:06:26.600> then<00:06:26.710> just<00:06:27.710> push<00:06:27.919> it<00:06:28.040> back<00:06:28.160> and<00:06:28.460> that's

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
and then just push it back and that's

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.360 
and then just push it back and that's
really<00:06:29.360> as<00:06:29.660> easy<00:06:29.690> as<00:06:30.050> it<00:06:30.200> gets<00:06:30.229> and<00:06:31.130> now<00:06:31.310> you

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
really as easy as it gets and now you

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.940 
really as easy as it gets and now you
have<00:06:31.640> a<00:06:31.700> whole<00:06:32.030> glass<00:06:32.180> of<00:06:32.570> beautiful<00:06:33.380> purified
