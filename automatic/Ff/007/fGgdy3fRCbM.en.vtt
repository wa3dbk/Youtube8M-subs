00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
something but each manufacturer does it

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.119 
something but each manufacturer does it
a<00:00:44.090> little<00:00:44.300> bit<00:00:44.480> differently<00:00:44.930> the<00:00:45.620> next<00:00:45.920> phase

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
a little bit differently the next phase

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.080 
a little bit differently the next phase
to<00:00:46.700> this<00:00:46.820> process<00:00:47.390> is<00:00:47.870> to<00:00:48.140> break<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.710> beads<00:00:49.090> to

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
to this process is to break the beads to

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.940 
to this process is to break the beads to
do<00:00:50.239> so<00:00:50.510> you<00:00:50.780> will<00:00:50.870> require<00:00:51.140> a<00:00:51.260> tool<00:00:51.649> such<00:00:51.920> as

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
do so you will require a tool such as

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.700 
do so you will require a tool such as
this<00:00:52.309> which<00:00:52.820> is<00:00:52.969> a<00:00:53.030> key<00:00:53.210> breaker<00:00:53.480> is<00:00:53.750> referred

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
this which is a key breaker is referred

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.299 
this which is a key breaker is referred

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.620 
will do it so you can break both sides
at<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.670> same<00:01:10.760> time<00:01:12.909> now<00:01:13.909> that<00:01:13.939> we<00:01:14.150> have<00:01:14.450> the

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
at the same time now that we have the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.280 
at the same time now that we have the
beads<00:01:15.320> broken<00:01:16.390> it's<00:01:17.390> time<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:17.780> do<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.020> removal

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
beads broken it's time to do the removal

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.130 
beads broken it's time to do the removal
of<00:01:18.619> the<00:01:18.740> tire<00:01:18.920> itself<00:01:19.420> to<00:01:20.420> do<00:01:20.540> so<00:01:20.750> we<00:01:20.930> put<00:01:21.110> a

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
of the tire itself to do so we put a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.230 
of the tire itself to do so we put a
little<00:01:21.320> bit<00:01:21.409> of<00:01:21.650> spray<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:22.310> it's<00:01:23.090> not

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
little bit of spray so it's not

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.149 
little bit of spray so it's not
recommended<00:01:23.869> to<00:01:23.900> use<00:01:23.990> oil-based<00:01:24.619> lubricants

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
recommended to use oil-based lubricants

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.420 
recommended to use oil-based lubricants
such<00:01:25.189> as<00:01:25.400> wd-40<00:01:26.320> now<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:27.380> first<00:01:27.799> stage<00:01:28.100> this

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
such as wd-40 now the first stage this

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.480 
such as wd-40 now the first stage this
process<00:01:28.939> is<00:01:29.479> to<00:01:29.720> push<00:01:29.960> down<00:01:30.200> on<00:01:30.500> a<00:01:30.560> part<00:01:31.369> of<00:01:31.400> the

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
process is to push down on a part of the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.300 
process is to push down on a part of the
tire<00:01:31.700> so<00:01:32.259> that<00:01:33.259> it<00:01:33.380> looks<00:01:33.650> as<00:01:33.829> though

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.550 

half<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.450> tire<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.810> flat<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.260> other<00:01:40.410> is

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
half the tire is flat and the other is

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.030 
half the tire is flat and the other is
now<00:01:41.450> from<00:01:42.450> there<00:01:42.660> we<00:01:43.260> go<00:01:43.410> to<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.560> other<00:01:43.770> side

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
now from there we go to the other side

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.160 
now from there we go to the other side
and<00:01:44.640> we<00:01:45.120> push<00:01:46.070> this<00:01:47.070> lip<00:01:47.510> so<00:01:48.510> it<00:01:48.540> hangs<00:01:48.870> over

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
and we push this lip so it hangs over

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.400 
and we push this lip so it hangs over
the<00:01:49.290> edge<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.620> the<00:01:49.710> rim<00:01:49.920> ups<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.280> little<00:01:50.670> bit<00:01:51.410> by

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
the edge of the rim ups a little bit by

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.630 
the edge of the rim ups a little bit by
doing<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:53.750> we<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:54.780> get<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.890> tire<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.490> come

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
doing that we can get the tire to come

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.300 
doing that we can get the tire to come
over<00:01:57.000> top<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.450> rim<00:01:57.770> so<00:01:58.770> we'll<00:01:59.070> take<00:01:59.190> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
over top of the rim so we'll take the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.719 
over top of the rim so we'll take the
tire<00:01:59.550> and<00:01:59.910> the<00:02:00.210> wheel<00:02:00.290> like<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.560> press<00:02:02.310> down

on<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.060> rim<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.500> over<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.710> out<00:02:05.240> with<00:02:06.240> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
on the rim and over and out with the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.699 
on the rim and over and out with the
tire<00:02:07.369> once<00:02:08.369> you've<00:02:08.550> done<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:09.110> you<00:02:10.110> just<00:02:10.380> pull

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709

now<00:02:12.690> you're<00:02:12.900> going<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.080> your<00:02:13.380> left<00:02:13.530> pull<00:02:13.770> the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
now you're going to your left pull the

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.720 
now you're going to your left pull the
rim<00:02:14.430> inside<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.820> tire<00:02:15.030> like<00:02:15.239> this<00:02:16.459> we<00:02:17.459> do<00:02:17.610> the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
rim inside the tire like this we do the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.520 
rim inside the tire like this we do the
same<00:02:17.910> process<00:02:18.180> again<00:02:18.540> where<00:02:18.930> we<00:02:19.020> push<00:02:19.290> down

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
same process again where we push down

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.080 
same process again where we push down
one<00:02:19.770> side<00:02:21.410> we<00:02:22.410> pull<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.890> rim<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.459> top<00:02:24.320> and

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
one side we pull the rim to the top and

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.449 
one side we pull the rim to the top and
then<00:02:27.090> push<00:02:27.630> down<00:02:27.660> on<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.230> rim<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.620> over<00:02:29.310> with

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
then push down on the rim and over with

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:36.740 
then push down on the rim and over with
the<00:02:29.489> tire<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.950> next<00:02:35.250> phase<00:02:35.489> to<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.150> process

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
the tire the next phase to this process

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.220 
the tire the next phase to this process
is<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.500> break<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.040> beads<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:39.420> do<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:40.140> will

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
is to break the beads to do so you will

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.380 
is to break the beads to do so you will

process is to push down on a part of the

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.440 
process is to push down on a part of the
tire<00:03:23.360> so<00:03:24.360> that<00:03:24.540> it<00:03:24.660> looks<00:03:24.900> as<00:03:25.110> though<00:03:26.239> half<00:03:27.239> the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
tire so that it looks as though half the

tire is flat and the other isn't now
from<00:03:30.450> there<00:03:30.690> we<00:03:31.290> go<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.620> other<00:03:31.739> side<00:03:32.070> and

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
from there we go to the other side and

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.280 
from there we go to the other side and
we<00:03:33.150> push<00:03:34.100> this<00:03:35.100> lip<00:03:35.510> so<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.540> hangs<00:03:36.840> over<00:03:37.170> the

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
we push this lip so it hangs over the

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.410 
we push this lip so it hangs over the
edge<00:03:37.320> of<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.739> rim<00:03:37.920> Oh

edge of the rim Oh
by<00:03:40.420> doing<00:03:40.480> that<00:03:40.810> we<00:03:41.970> can<00:03:42.970> get<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.900> tire<00:03:44.140> to

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
by doing that we can get the tire to

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.190 
by doing that we can get the tire to
come<00:03:44.650> over<00:03:45.010> top<00:03:45.190> of<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.459> ramp<00:03:45.670> so<00:03:46.080> we'll<00:03:47.080> take

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
come over top of the ramp so we'll take

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.339 
come over top of the ramp so we'll take
the<00:03:47.319> tire<00:03:47.560> in<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.220> wheel<00:03:48.400> like<00:03:49.269> this<00:03:49.349> press

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
the tire in the wheel like this press

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.240 
the tire in the wheel like this press
down<00:03:50.739> on<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.069> rim<00:03:51.250> and<00:03:51.510> over<00:03:52.510> and<00:03:52.720> out<00:03:53.250> with

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
down on the rim and over and out with

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.380 
down on the rim and over and out with
the<00:03:54.370> tire<00:03:55.380> once<00:03:56.380> you've<00:03:56.530> done<00:03:56.709> that<00:03:57.090> you<00:03:58.090> just

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
the tire once you've done that you just

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.990 
the tire once you've done that you just
pull<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:58.840> tire<00:03:59.050> off<00:03:59.290> of<00:03:59.530> it<00:03:59.700> now<00:04:00.700> you're

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
pull the tire off of it now you're

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.030 
pull the tire off of it now you're
you're<00:04:01.390> left<00:04:01.599> with<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:01.959> rim<00:04:02.440> inside<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:02.830> tire

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
you're left with the rim inside the tire

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.539 
you're left with the rim inside the tire
like<00:04:03.250> this<00:04:04.470> we<00:04:05.470> do<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.739> same<00:04:05.920> process<00:04:06.190> again

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
like this we do the same process again

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.890 
like this we do the same process again
where<00:04:06.940> we<00:04:07.030> push<00:04:07.299> down<00:04:07.330> one<00:04:07.780> side<00:04:09.420> we<00:04:10.420> pull<00:04:10.690> the

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
where we push down one side we pull the

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.229 
where we push down one side we pull the
rim<00:04:11.080> to<00:04:11.349> the<00:04:11.380> top<00:04:12.360> and<00:04:14.099> then<00:04:15.099> push<00:04:15.640> down<00:04:15.670> on<00:04:15.970> the

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
rim to the top and then push down on the

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:26.190 
rim to the top and then push down on the
rim<00:04:16.419> and<00:04:16.660> over<00:04:17.320> with<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.530> tire<00:04:24.870> some<00:04:25.870> are<00:04:26.169> a

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
rim and over with the tire some are a

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.719 
rim and over with the tire some are a
little<00:04:26.350> bit<00:04:26.590> more<00:04:26.620> stubborn<00:04:27.010> than<00:04:27.160> others<00:04:29.729> now

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
little bit more stubborn than others now

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.610 
little bit more stubborn than others now
to<00:04:30.790> do<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.330> reverse<00:04:31.690> process<00:04:32.050> and<00:04:32.500> actually

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
to do the reverse process and actually

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.570 
to do the reverse process and actually
mount<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.370> tire<00:04:33.660> that<00:04:34.660> is<00:04:34.720> a<00:04:35.340> not<00:04:36.340> so

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
mount the tire that is a not so

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.080 
mount the tire that is a not so
difficult<00:04:36.790> task<00:04:37.350> however<00:04:38.350> it<00:04:38.790> takes<00:04:39.790> a<00:04:39.940> little

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
difficult task however it takes a little

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.140 
difficult task however it takes a little
bit<00:04:40.240> of<00:04:40.300> technique<00:04:40.720> as<00:04:40.900> well<00:04:41.790> first<00:04:42.790> thing<00:04:43.030> you

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
bit of technique as well first thing you

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.420 
bit of technique as well first thing you
want<00:04:43.360> to<00:04:43.450> do<00:04:43.630> here<00:04:44.050> is<00:04:44.830> you<00:04:45.010> want<00:04:45.130> to<00:04:45.280> make<00:04:45.400> sure

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
want to do here is you want to make sure

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.430 
want to do here is you want to make sure
that<00:04:45.910> you<00:04:46.060> use<00:04:46.270> a<00:04:46.300> little<00:04:46.450> bit<00:04:46.570> more<00:04:46.660> soap<00:04:47.229> on

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
that you use a little bit more soap on

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.779 
that you use a little bit more soap on
the<00:04:48.010> tire<00:04:48.250> for<00:04:48.850> several<00:04:49.210> reasons<00:04:49.570> mainly<00:04:50.470> to

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
the tire for several reasons mainly to

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.010 
the tire for several reasons mainly to
lubricate<00:04:51.789> and<00:04:52.000> to<00:04:52.360> make<00:04:52.510> the<00:04:52.600> process<00:04:52.750> a

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
lubricate and to make the process a

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.560 
lubricate and to make the process a
little<00:04:53.169> bit<00:04:53.440> more<00:04:53.830> simple<00:04:54.100> but<00:04:54.880> also<00:04:55.060> to<00:04:55.240> avoid

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
little bit more simple but also to avoid

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.540 
little bit more simple but also to avoid
destroying<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.590> carcass<00:04:56.950> of<00:04:57.100> the<00:04:57.130> tire<00:04:57.340> or

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
destroying the carcass of the tire or

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.790 
destroying the carcass of the tire or
the<00:04:57.639> sidewall<00:04:58.090> or<00:04:58.690> preventing<00:04:59.200> any<00:04:59.320> leaves

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.840 

again<00:05:02.800> using<00:05:03.130> soap<00:05:04.200> loop<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:05.350> bead<00:05:05.700> now<00:05:06.700> we'll

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
again using soap loop the bead now we'll

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.930 
again using soap loop the bead now we'll
take<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:07.180> rim<00:05:08.160> and<00:05:09.160> make<00:05:09.340> sure<00:05:09.490> you<00:05:09.639> check<00:05:09.820> the

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
take the rim and make sure you check the

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.790 
take the rim and make sure you check the
direction<00:05:10.120> of<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.690> tire<00:05:10.900> there<00:05:11.410> will<00:05:11.560> be<00:05:11.590> an

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
direction of the tire there will be an

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.800 
direction of the tire there will be an
arrow<00:05:12.039> on<00:05:12.310> the<00:05:12.400> tire<00:05:12.639> which<00:05:13.300> needs<00:05:13.539> to<00:05:13.660> face

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
arrow on the tire which needs to face

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.050 
arrow on the tire which needs to face
forward<00:05:14.110> on<00:05:14.320> most<00:05:14.500> manufacturers<00:05:15.220> check<00:05:15.910> with

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
forward on most manufacturers check with

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.529 
forward on most manufacturers check with
your<00:05:16.150> manufacturer<00:05:16.870> first<00:05:18.180> applying<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:19.360> rim

side of the tire start rolling down and
it's<00:06:08.999> on<00:06:11.809> from<00:06:12.809> there<00:06:12.990> all<00:06:13.199> that<00:06:13.349> we<00:06:13.469> have<00:06:13.619> left

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
it's on from there all that we have left

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.949 
it's on from there all that we have left
to<00:06:13.889> do<00:06:14.069> is<00:06:14.279> put<00:06:14.699> air<00:06:14.849> in<00:06:14.939> the<00:06:14.969> tires<00:06:15.029> and<00:06:15.449> repeat

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:15.959 
to do is put air in the tires and repeat

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:19.159 
to do is put air in the tires and repeat
them<00:06:16.139> now<00:06:16.520> to<00:06:17.520> beat<00:06:17.789> the<00:06:17.939> tires<00:06:18.180> we<00:06:18.869> check

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
them now to beat the tires we check

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:20.839 
them now to beat the tires we check
first<00:06:19.439> of<00:06:19.589> all<00:06:19.709> check<00:06:19.949> our<00:06:20.099> bead<00:06:20.279> locks<00:06:20.520> and

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849 
first of all check our bead locks and

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:22.760 
first of all check our bead locks and
make<00:06:21.029> sure<00:06:21.180> that<00:06:21.360> they<00:06:21.479> are<00:06:21.629> not<00:06:21.809> protruding

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
make sure that they are not protruding

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.649 
make sure that they are not protruding
through<00:06:22.800> the<00:06:23.069> rim<00:06:23.369> because<00:06:24.089> if<00:06:24.209> we<00:06:24.330> do<00:06:24.479> that

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:24.659 
through the rim because if we do that

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:26.899 
through the rim because if we do that
and<00:06:24.930> we<00:06:25.289> put<00:06:25.499> air<00:06:25.680> in<00:06:25.770> them<00:06:25.889> they<00:06:26.399> could<00:06:26.639> slice

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:26.909 
and we put air in them they could slice

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:30.290 
and we put air in them they could slice
the<00:06:27.089> tire<00:06:27.300> and<00:06:27.479> create<00:06:27.779> a<00:06:27.809> leak<00:06:28.249> so<00:06:29.249> make<00:06:30.119> sure

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
the tire and create a leak so make sure

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.510 
the tire and create a leak so make sure
the<00:06:30.389> tires<00:06:30.599> look<00:06:32.149> round<00:06:33.319> take<00:06:34.319> our<00:06:34.499> soap<00:06:34.979> again

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
the tires look round take our soap again

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:42.529 
the tires look round take our soap again
do<00:06:36.089> not<00:06:36.119> use<00:06:36.270> the<00:06:36.539> oils<00:06:41.209> loop<00:06:42.209> up<00:06:42.389> the

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:42.539 
do not use the oils loop up the

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:49.869 
do not use the oils loop up the
sidewalls<00:06:45.889> and<00:06:46.889> we<00:06:46.979> just<00:06:47.159> take<00:06:47.309> an<00:06:47.459> air<00:06:47.639> check

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:49.879 
sidewalls and we just take an air check

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:54.790 
sidewalls and we just take an air check
and<00:06:50.879> this<00:06:51.029> part<00:06:51.300> can<00:06:51.539> get<00:06:51.689> a<00:06:51.719> little<00:06:52.189> noisy

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
and this part can get a little noisy

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.739 
and this part can get a little noisy
once<00:06:55.800> you've<00:06:55.949> heard<00:06:56.069> the<00:06:56.219> two<00:06:56.399> bangs<00:06:56.719> you<00:06:57.719> can

00:06:57.739 --> 00:06:57.749 
once you've heard the two bangs you can

00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:59.540 
once you've heard the two bangs you can
see<00:06:58.139> that<00:06:58.349> the<00:06:58.409> tire<00:06:58.649> is<00:06:58.830> now<00:06:59.009> mounted<00:06:59.430> to<00:06:59.490> the

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550 
see that the tire is now mounted to the

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.819 
see that the tire is now mounted to the
sidewall<00:06:59.969> of<00:06:59.999> the<00:07:00.089> tire<00:07:00.379> all<00:07:01.379> there<00:07:01.709> is<00:07:01.800> left

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:01.829 
sidewall of the tire all there is left

00:07:01.829 --> 00:07:06.429 
sidewall of the tire all there is left
to<00:07:02.129> do<00:07:02.839> let's<00:07:03.839> tighten<00:07:04.289> down<00:07:04.319> our<00:07:04.499> bead<00:07:04.889> locks

00:07:06.429 --> 00:07:06.439 
to do let's tighten down our bead locks

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:08.629 
to do let's tighten down our bead locks
when<00:07:07.439> you're<00:07:07.589> tightening<00:07:07.800> be<00:07:08.129> locks<00:07:08.399> it's

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 
when you're tightening be locks it's

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:10.969 
when you're tightening be locks it's
important<00:07:09.149> to<00:07:09.300> realize<00:07:09.599> that<00:07:09.979> they're

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:10.979 
important to realize that they're

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:12.829 
important to realize that they're
basically<00:07:11.399> just<00:07:11.699> screws<00:07:11.969> with<00:07:12.180> an<00:07:12.300> o-ring<00:07:12.449> on

00:07:12.829 --> 00:07:12.839 
basically just screws with an o-ring on

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:15.769 
basically just screws with an o-ring on
them<00:07:12.990> so<00:07:13.409> they<00:07:13.709> don't<00:07:13.740> need<00:07:14.129> to<00:07:14.399> be<00:07:14.779> tightened

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:15.779 
them so they don't need to be tightened

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:18.670 
them so they don't need to be tightened
down<00:07:16.050> super<00:07:16.769> tight<00:07:17.039> they<00:07:17.550> just<00:07:17.759> need<00:07:17.909> to<00:07:18.029> be

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680 
down super tight they just need to be

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.239 
down super tight they just need to be
screwed<00:07:19.680> down<00:07:19.860> to<00:07:20.069> touch<00:07:20.309> and<00:07:20.669> then<00:07:21.029> given<00:07:21.419> you

00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:22.249 
screwed down to touch and then given you

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:27.920 
screwed down to touch and then given you
know<00:07:23.249> a<00:07:23.279> light<00:07:23.610> sort<00:07:23.969> of<00:07:25.009> one<00:07:26.930> revolution

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:27.930 
know a light sort of one revolution

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.829 
know a light sort of one revolution
after<00:07:28.050> that<00:07:28.439> maybe<00:07:29.339> so<00:07:30.119> that<00:07:30.149> the<00:07:30.389> screw<00:07:30.629> won't

00:07:30.829 --> 00:07:30.839 
after that maybe so that the screw won't

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:33.920 
after that maybe so that the screw won't
back<00:07:31.050> out<00:07:31.289> while<00:07:31.559> you're<00:07:31.740> driving<00:07:32.659> from<00:07:33.659> there

00:07:37.609 --> 00:07:37.619 
the best thing to do a little bit air in

00:07:37.619 --> 00:07:39.200 
the best thing to do a little bit air in
there

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.210 
there

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.860 
there
usually<00:07:39.870> about<00:07:39.930> 10<00:07:40.320> psi<00:07:41.510> spray<00:07:42.510> some<00:07:42.720> that

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:42.870 
usually about 10 psi spray some that

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.470 
usually about 10 psi spray some that
soap<00:07:43.140> water<00:07:43.380> around<00:07:43.830> the<00:07:43.950> bead<00:07:44.130> locks<00:07:44.480> check

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:45.480 
soap water around the bead locks check

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.790 
soap water around the bead locks check
and<00:07:45.690> see<00:07:45.840> if<00:07:45.900> there's<00:07:46.080> any<00:07:46.230> bubbling

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 
and see if there's any bubbling

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.450 
and see if there's any bubbling
happening<00:07:47.300> there's<00:07:48.300> no<00:07:48.450> bubbling<00:07:48.870> there<00:07:49.460> no
