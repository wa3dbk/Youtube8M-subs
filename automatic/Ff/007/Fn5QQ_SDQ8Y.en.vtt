00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
hi this is just a quick video wanted to

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.200 
hi this is just a quick video wanted to
show<00:00:05.009> you<00:00:05.040> guys<00:00:05.250> think<00:00:05.670> about<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:06.029> new

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
show you guys think about the new

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.400 
show you guys think about the new
Pistons<00:00:07.580> and<00:00:08.580> also<00:00:08.910> how<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.179> find<00:00:09.960> those<00:00:10.110> lines

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
Pistons and also how to find those lines

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.020 
Pistons and also how to find those lines
for<00:00:10.920> their<00:00:11.040> balls<00:00:12.110> this<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.980> repeater<00:00:14.700> I've

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
for their balls this is a repeater I've

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.310 
for their balls this is a repeater I've
managed<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.839> make<00:00:16.199> with<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.800> new<00:00:17.400> piston<00:00:18.320> it

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
managed to make with the new piston it

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.779 
managed to make with the new piston it
cuts<00:00:19.859> us<00:00:20.039> off<00:00:20.220> own<00:00:20.580> power<00:00:21.539> supply<00:00:21.990> off<00:00:22.789> which

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
cuts us off own power supply off which

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.050 
cuts us off own power supply off which
then<00:00:24.029> retracts<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.410> then<00:00:25.939> pushes<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.029> back

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
then retracts it and then pushes it back

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.429 
then retracts it and then pushes it back
out<00:00:27.300> again<00:00:27.449> quite<00:00:28.019> fast<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.529> can<00:00:28.650> see<00:00:28.800> that

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
out again quite fast you can see that

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.220 
out again quite fast you can see that
all<00:00:31.439> it's<00:00:32.369> quite<00:00:32.790> noisy<00:00:33.059> though<00:00:33.480> that's<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
all it's quite noisy though that's the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.350 
all it's quite noisy though that's the
only<00:00:34.440> downside<00:00:34.770> but<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.160> very<00:00:35.399> small<00:00:36.000> so

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
only downside but it is very small so

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.229 
only downside but it is very small so
I'm<00:00:37.050> not<00:00:37.290> sure<00:00:37.350> if<00:00:37.850> that's<00:00:38.850> going<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.090> be

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
I'm not sure if that's going to be

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.680 
I'm not sure if that's going to be
useful<00:00:39.660> or<00:00:41.059> may<00:00:42.059> not<00:00:42.090> be<00:00:43.820> but<00:00:44.820> here's<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.390> little

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
useful or may not be but here's a little

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.459 
useful or may not be but here's a little
machine<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.110> made<00:00:46.469> with<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.989> this<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.260> very

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
machine I made with it this is very

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.779 
machine I made with it this is very
noisy<00:00:49.950> that's<00:00:50.460> kind<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> point<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.149> guess

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
noisy that's kind of the point I guess

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.500 
noisy that's kind of the point I guess
here<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:53.850> go

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
here we go

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.090 
here we go
as<00:00:55.989> you<00:00:56.140> can<00:00:56.260> see<00:00:56.469> it's<00:00:57.030> really<00:00:58.030> quite<00:00:58.179> noisy

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
as you can see it's really quite noisy

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.670 
as you can see it's really quite noisy
especially<00:01:00.100> if<00:01:00.190> I<00:01:00.339> may<00:01:00.789> do<00:01:00.910> this<00:01:01.059> as<00:01:01.149> well

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
especially if I may do this as well

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.399 
especially if I may do this as well
first<00:01:02.680> firing<00:01:02.949> rocks<00:01:03.219> Allah<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:04.600> guess<00:01:05.110> this<00:01:05.229> is

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
first firing rocks Allah I guess this is

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:13.940 
first firing rocks Allah I guess this is
just<00:01:05.439> a<00:01:06.030> crazy<00:01:07.439> crazy<00:01:08.439> machine<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:11.710> yeah<00:01:11.920> also

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
just a crazy crazy machine but yeah also

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.070 
just a crazy crazy machine but yeah also
another<00:01:14.950> thing<00:01:15.100> is<00:01:15.430> how<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:15.909> get<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.479> visa

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
another thing is how to get the visa

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.870 
another thing is how to get the visa
rule<00:01:17.380> because<00:01:17.740> these<00:01:17.860> these<00:01:18.130> Pistons<00:01:18.580> they're

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
rule because these these Pistons they're

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.350 
rule because these these Pistons they're
all<00:01:19.619> they're<00:01:20.619> all<00:01:20.649> sticky<00:01:21.159> pistons<00:01:21.549> if<00:01:21.789> I<00:01:22.240> get

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
all they're all sticky pistons if I get

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.730 
all they're all sticky pistons if I get
rid<00:01:22.479> of<00:01:22.539> this<00:01:22.600> bit<00:01:22.810> you<00:01:23.229> can<00:01:23.409> see<00:01:23.530> there<00:01:23.680> were

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
rid of this bit you can see there were

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.340 
rid of this bit you can see there were
there<00:01:23.920> all<00:01:24.070> sticky<00:01:24.340> pistons<00:01:24.820> and<00:01:25.539> that<00:01:26.140> quite

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
massive room it's the entire chunk

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.220 
massive room it's the entire chunk
actually<00:02:20.250> it's<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.310> entire<00:02:21.700> chunk<00:02:22.000> from<00:02:22.269> work

actually it's the entire chunk from work
starts<00:02:23.620> over<00:02:23.769> here<00:02:25.349> and<00:02:26.349> see<00:02:26.560> this<00:02:26.590> is<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.330> 48-0

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
starts over here and see this is a 48-0

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.540 
starts over here and see this is a 48-0
and<00:02:29.290> like<00:02:29.560> over<00:02:29.890> there<00:02:30.010> is<00:02:30.190> like<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.430> other

and like over there is like the other

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.180 
and like over there is like the other
side<00:02:30.730> of<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.849> junk<00:02:31.200> there's<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.290> program<00:02:32.650> that

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
side of the junk there's a program that

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.470 
side of the junk there's a program that
I'll<00:02:33.760> link<00:02:35.040> which<00:02:36.040> lets<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:36.489> find<00:02:37.000> which

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
I'll link which lets you find which

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.990 
I'll link which lets you find which
chunks<00:02:38.110> can<00:02:38.470> have<00:02:38.769> signed<00:02:39.069> in<00:02:39.220> them<00:02:39.400> some<00:02:39.640> some

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
chunks can have signed in them some some

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.479 
chunks can have signed in them some some
chunks<00:02:40.440> won't<00:02:41.440> have<00:02:41.709> signs<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.129> can<00:02:42.250> build<00:02:42.459> a

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
chunks won't have signs you can build a

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.030 
chunks won't have signs you can build a
room<00:02:42.640> as<00:02:42.760> big<00:02:42.909> as<00:02:43.000> this<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.510> they<00:02:44.200> still<00:02:44.650> want

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
room as big as this and they still want

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.830 
room as big as this and they still want
actually<00:02:45.849> spawn<00:02:47.909> that<00:02:48.909> repeater<00:02:49.390> I'll<00:02:49.599> just

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
actually spawn that repeater I'll just

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.070 
actually spawn that repeater I'll just
go<00:02:50.110> back<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.500> quickly<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:52.780> would<00:02:53.050> take

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
go back to it quickly so you would take

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.940 
go back to it quickly so you would take
a<00:02:53.640> piston

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
a piston

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.940 
a piston
a<00:02:56.040> slimeball<00:02:56.970> on<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.300> that's<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.440> sticky

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
a slimeball on it that's the sticky

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.860 
a slimeball on it that's the sticky
piston<00:02:59.310> just<00:03:00.150> roll<00:03:00.269> over<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:02.450> this<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.690> just

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
piston just roll over and this is just

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.320 
piston just roll over and this is just
quite<00:03:04.080> simple<00:03:04.500> it's<00:03:04.590> just<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.610> this<00:03:06.000> redstone

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
quite simple it's just the this redstone

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.080 
quite simple it's just the this redstone
here<00:03:06.660> this<00:03:06.989> wire<00:03:07.230> gets<00:03:07.920> broken<00:03:08.340> when<00:03:08.550> this

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
here this wire gets broken when this

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.290 
here this wire gets broken when this
comes<00:03:09.750> four<00:03:10.260> words<00:03:10.700> on<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:11.970> sticky<00:03:12.569> piston

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
comes four words on this sticky piston

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.210 
comes four words on this sticky piston
so<00:03:15.300> this<00:03:15.480> one<00:03:15.660> will<00:03:15.810> pull<00:03:16.080> push<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.470> across<00:03:16.590> and

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
so this one will pull push it across and

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.040 
so this one will pull push it across and
that<00:03:17.970> kind<00:03:18.120> of<00:03:18.150> breaks<00:03:18.330> it<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.870> cool

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
that kind of breaks it and the cool

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.509 
that kind of breaks it and the cool
thing<00:03:19.260> about<00:03:19.349> it<00:03:19.680> is<00:03:20.510> it's<00:03:21.510> very<00:03:21.660> fast<00:03:22.370> but<00:03:23.370> it

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
thing about it is it's very fast but it

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.860 
thing about it is it's very fast but it
doesn't<00:03:24.110> it<00:03:25.110> doesn't<00:03:25.260> break<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.870> sometimes

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
doesn't it doesn't break the sometimes

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.600 
doesn't it doesn't break the sometimes
we<00:03:27.959> refresh<00:03:28.349> or<00:03:28.470> beta<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:28.860> kind<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.190> like<00:03:29.310> burns

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
we refresh or beta it kind of like burns

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.610 
we refresh or beta it kind of like burns
out<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.660> should<00:03:30.840> be<00:03:30.930> quite<00:03:31.080> annoying<00:03:31.319> but

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
out you should be quite annoying but

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.339 
out you should be quite annoying but
this<00:03:32.160> doesn't<00:03:32.549> do<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:33.269> goes<00:03:33.750> very<00:03:34.019> fast

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
this doesn't do it this goes very fast

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.100 
this doesn't do it this goes very fast
and<00:03:35.480> it<00:03:36.480> doesn't<00:03:36.870> burn<00:03:36.959> out<00:03:37.170> so<00:03:37.650> that's<00:03:37.890> cool

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
and it doesn't burn out so that's cool

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.180 
and it doesn't burn out so that's cool
anyway<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.140> don't<00:03:40.410> know<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:41.690> don't<00:03:42.690> know<00:03:43.190> what

anyway I don't know I don't know what

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.680 
anyway I don't know I don't know what
