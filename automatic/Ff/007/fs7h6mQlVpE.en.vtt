q4 and ultimately q5 if you can yeah and
the<00:00:38.430> q4<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.180> was<00:00:39.329> just<00:00:39.540> trying<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.170> make<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
the q4 I was just trying to make the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.709 
the q4 I was just trying to make the
same<00:00:41.430> as<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.730> did<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.090> first<00:00:42.300> one<00:00:42.480> yesterday

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
same as I did in the first one yesterday

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.779 
same as I did in the first one yesterday
because<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.320> know<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.829> tracking<00:00:44.219> was<00:00:44.430> gonna<00:00:44.610> be

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
because I know the tracking was gonna be

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.250 
because I know the tracking was gonna be
up<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> little<00:00:45.180> bit<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.660> maybe<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.930> little<00:00:46.110> bit

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
up a little bit and maybe a little bit

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.130 
up a little bit and maybe a little bit
more<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.559> dundee<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.039> an<00:00:47.250> afternoon<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:48.140> just

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
more in dundee in an afternoon I just

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.770 
more in dundee in an afternoon I just
kept<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> same<00:00:50.100> tires<00:00:50.370> as<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.879> used<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> q3

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
kept the same tires as I used in the q3

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.319 
kept the same tires as I used in the q3
I<00:00:52.020> think<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.829> was<00:00:52.949> maybe<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.699> bad<00:00:54.090> choice

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
I think that was maybe a bad choice

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.779 
I think that was maybe a bad choice
because<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:55.110> was<00:00:55.350> almost<00:00:55.620> lakes<00:00:56.010> now<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.550> I

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
because it was almost lakes now and I

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.939 
because it was almost lakes now and I
was<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> little<00:00:57.300> bit<00:00:57.390> understeer<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:57.870> not<00:00:58.770> so

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
was a little bit understeer and not so

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.610 
was a little bit understeer and not so
much<00:00:58.980> fraction<00:00:59.550> anymore<00:01:00.350> so<00:01:01.350> for<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.590> last

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
much fraction anymore so for the last

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.759 
much fraction anymore so for the last
one<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.730> changed<00:01:03.359> new<00:01:03.570> tires<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.589> was

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
one I changed new tires and that was

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.130 
one I changed new tires and that was
basically<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.339> only<00:01:05.760> thing<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.119> did<00:01:06.330> change

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
basically the only thing I did change

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.980 
basically the only thing I did change
said<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.890> used<00:01:08.430> tires<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.240> 2-minute

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
said I used tires in the 2-minute

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.780 
said I used tires in the 2-minute
practice<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.470> morning<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.400> was<00:01:11.520> also

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
practice in the morning and it was also

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.109 
practice in the morning and it was also
just<00:01:12.360> breaking<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.520> it<00:01:14.520> was<00:01:14.549> much<00:01:14.909> better

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
just breaking in and it was much better

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.660 
just breaking in and it was much better
good<00:01:15.509> traction<00:01:15.810> good<00:01:16.380> steering<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.400> think

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
good traction good steering and I think

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.789 
good traction good steering and I think
everyone<00:01:18.030> everything<00:01:18.600> went<00:01:18.750> well<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.650> was

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
everyone everything went well so it was

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.280 
everyone everything went well so it was
a<00:01:19.830> good<00:01:20.040> decision<00:01:20.509> going<00:01:21.509> into<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.900> last

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
a good decision going into the last

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.140 
a good decision going into the last
round<00:01:22.470> obviously<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.159> heat<00:01:23.340> orders<00:01:23.759> reversed

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
round obviously the heat orders reversed

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.899 
round obviously the heat orders reversed
so<00:01:24.780> technically<00:01:25.200> you're<00:01:25.500> already<00:01:25.740> seen<00:01:26.100> Rena

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
so technically you're already seen Rena

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.270 
so technically you're already seen Rena
Robert<00:01:27.509> had<00:01:27.750> maybe<00:01:28.080> not<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> best<00:01:28.500> rounds<00:01:29.159> and

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
Robert had maybe not the best rounds and

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.520 
Robert had maybe not the best rounds and
then<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.240> didn't<00:01:30.540> affect<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.960> did<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.350> change

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
then it didn't affect you did I change

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.800 
then it didn't affect you did I change

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
actually I was aiming for to better my

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.840 
actually I was aiming for to better my
19<00:02:00.780> front<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.290> first<00:02:01.469> one<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.920> tried<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.759> I

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
19 front in the first one I tried and I

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.700 
19 front in the first one I tried and I
think<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.119> was<00:02:03.240> pretty<00:02:03.540> close<00:02:03.810> until<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.229> was<00:02:04.680> a

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
think it was pretty close until I was a

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.620 
think it was pretty close until I was a
front<00:02:05.310> wheeling<00:02:05.579> over<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.850> wood<00:02:06.000> section<00:02:06.390> I

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
front wheeling over the wood section I

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.900 
front wheeling over the wood section I
lost<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.590> second<00:02:07.950> there<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.640> would<00:02:08.789> have

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
lost to second there so it would have

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.360 
lost to second there so it would have
been<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.060> 19<00:02:09.690> or<00:02:09.720> something<00:02:09.989> but<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.800> was<00:02:10.979> all

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
been like 19 or something but it was all

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.930 
been like 19 or something but it was all
over<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.760> was<00:02:11.940> good

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
over it was good

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.100 
over it was good
yeah<00:02:13.150> we<00:02:13.300> were<00:02:13.390> going<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.570> ask<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:13.900> about<00:02:13.990> that

I might use it in the semi and even the

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.740 
I might use it in the semi and even the
final<00:03:07.960> if<00:03:08.080> I<00:03:08.170> get<00:03:08.320> there<00:03:08.910> but<00:03:09.910> we<00:03:10.390> have<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.540> good
