for<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:25.130> working<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.430> yourself<00:00:26.910> could<00:00:27.090> be

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
for it working on this yourself could be

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.790 
for it working on this yourself could be
pretty<00:00:27.480> tough<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.900> have<00:00:28.019> written<00:00:28.230> articles

here you want to unscrew this and you

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.569 
here you want to unscrew this and you
could<00:00:34.020> tape<00:00:34.260> right<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.770> there's<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.370> couple

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
could tape right that there's a couple

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.190 
could tape right that there's a couple
different<00:00:36.000> ways<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.360> could<00:00:36.540> do<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.719> though

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
different ways you could do this though

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.280 
different ways you could do this though
that<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.579> harder<00:00:39.030> way<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.629> also<00:00:39.840> is

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
that is the harder way and it also is

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.990 
that is the harder way and it also is
the<00:00:40.680> way<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.980> can<00:00:41.160> leak<00:00:41.370> later<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the way that can leak later in the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.819 
the way that can leak later in the
future<00:00:42.360> if<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.570> don't<00:00:42.750> seal<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.260> cover<00:00:43.649> on

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
future if you don't seal the cover on

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.310 
future if you don't seal the cover on
properly<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.030> if<00:00:45.149> you're<00:00:45.270> not<00:00:45.480> very<00:00:45.809> handy

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
properly so if you're not very handy

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.130 
properly so if you're not very handy
this<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.550> way<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.730> would<00:00:47.879> say<00:00:48.120> not<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.840> do<00:00:48.989> it

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
this is the way I would say not to do it

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.330 
this is the way I would say not to do it
I<00:00:49.260> would<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.739> way<00:00:49.860> I'm<00:00:49.950> going<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.190> teach

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
I would do it the way I'm going to teach

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.560 
I would do it the way I'm going to teach
it<00:00:50.520> today

down the top vent or the overflow the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.420 
down the top vent or the overflow the
next<00:01:11.729> one<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.939> gonna<00:01:12.060> need<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> standard

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
plunger this one could be used for

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.289 
plunger this one could be used for
toilets<00:01:16.799> or<00:01:17.220> could<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.490> used<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:17.729> tubs<00:01:18.060> and

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
toilets or could be used for tubs and

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.120 
toilets or could be used for tubs and
this<00:01:19.290> one<00:01:19.470> right<00:01:19.560> here<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.830> want<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.040> make

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
this one right here you want to make

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.560 
this one right here you want to make
sure<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.310> shoehorn<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.909> pushed<00:01:21.180> all<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.450> way

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.249 
sure to shoehorn is pushed all the way
in<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.680> reason<00:01:23.009> why<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.700> because<00:01:24.259> it

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
in and the reason why is because it

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.640 
in and the reason why is because it
won't<00:01:25.500> fit<00:01:25.590> flush<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.430> bottom<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.939> tub

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.570 
so you want a hot hot water and you have
a<00:05:50.930> very<00:05:51.229> good<00:05:51.440> chance<00:05:51.500> of<00:05:51.889> getting<00:05:52.099> rid<00:05:52.340> of<00:05:52.400> all

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
a very good chance of getting rid of all

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.529 
a very good chance of getting rid of all
the<00:05:52.760> soap<00:05:52.970> scum<00:05:53.270> as<00:05:53.599> you<00:05:53.990> could<00:05:54.169> see<00:05:55.270> on<00:05:56.270> the

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539 
the soap scum as you could see on the

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.570 
the soap scum as you could see on the
bottom<00:05:56.870> of<00:05:56.960> the<00:05:57.050> tub<00:05:57.229> that's<00:05:58.130> what<00:05:58.280> we've<00:05:58.400> got

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
bottom of the tub that's what we've got

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.279 
bottom of the tub that's what we've got
so<00:05:58.849> this<00:05:59.120> is<00:05:59.300> this<00:05:59.479> is<00:05:59.659> going<00:05:59.780> to<00:05:59.870> happen<00:06:00.199> in

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
so this is this is going to happen in

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:01.930 
so this is this is going to happen in
any<00:06:00.440> home<00:06:00.710> I<00:06:00.979> don't<00:06:01.220> care<00:06:01.460> if<00:06:01.610> you've<00:06:01.760> got<00:06:01.909> a

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
any home I don't care if you've got a

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.620 
any home I don't care if you've got a
p-trap<00:06:02.389> or<00:06:02.720> a<00:06:02.750> drum<00:06:03.080> trap<00:06:03.490> in<00:06:04.490> this<00:06:05.120> case<00:06:05.389> right

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
p-trap or a drum trap in this case right

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.879 
p-trap or a drum trap in this case right
here<00:06:05.690> it<00:06:05.960> makes<00:06:06.169> a<00:06:06.260> little<00:06:06.349> bit<00:06:06.500> easier

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889 
here it makes a little bit easier

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.430 
here it makes a little bit easier
because<00:06:07.039> of<00:06:07.340> the<00:06:07.430> hair<00:06:07.669> the<00:06:07.909> hair<00:06:08.000> helps<00:06:08.570> gives

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
because of the hair the hair helps gives

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.379 
because of the hair the hair helps gives
it<00:06:09.530> an<00:06:09.650> area<00:06:09.979> to<00:06:10.099> solidify<00:06:10.639> and<00:06:10.880> it's

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
it an area to solidify and it's

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.480 
it an area to solidify and it's
solidifying<00:06:11.900> and<00:06:12.139> this<00:06:12.560> portion<00:06:13.310> of<00:06:13.430> the

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
solidifying and this portion of the

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.730 
solidifying and this portion of the
piping<00:06:13.990> so<00:06:14.990> we're<00:06:15.139> almost<00:06:15.320> completely

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
piping so we're almost completely

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.430 
piping so we're almost completely
drained<00:06:16.460> down<00:06:16.669> as<00:06:17.060> you<00:06:17.330> can<00:06:17.450> see<00:06:17.659> and<00:06:17.930> this<00:06:18.289> is

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
drained down as you can see and this is

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.969 
drained down as you can see and this is
awesome

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:18.979 
awesome

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:22.089 
awesome
so<00:06:19.780> again<00:06:20.780> we<00:06:20.960> probably<00:06:21.229> saved<00:06:21.590> the

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:22.099 
so again we probably saved the

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:22.810 
so again we probably saved the
homeowners

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820
