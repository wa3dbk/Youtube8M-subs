but<00:01:00.050> again<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:00.530> pattern<00:01:01.010> will<00:01:01.160> D<00:01:01.399> amplify<00:01:02.149> in

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
but again the pattern will D amplify in

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.240 
but again the pattern will D amplify in
the<00:01:02.630> days<00:01:02.840> ahead<00:01:03.079> and<00:01:03.380> that<00:01:03.470> means<00:01:03.710> a<00:01:03.829> warming

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
the days ahead and that means a warming

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.959 
the days ahead and that means a warming
trend<00:01:04.280> but<00:01:04.729> not<00:01:04.939> today<00:01:06.250> those<00:01:07.250> numbers<00:01:07.640> as<00:01:07.790> low

this<00:03:30.290> is<00:03:30.470> where<00:03:30.620> rain<00:03:30.859> begins<00:03:31.189> to<00:03:31.340> break<00:03:31.489> out

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:31.729 
this is where rain begins to break out

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:33.399 
this is where rain begins to break out
west<00:03:32.030> of<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.329> state<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:32.720> Thursday<00:03:33.079> morning

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:33.409 
west of the state and Thursday morning

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:34.629 
west of the state and Thursday morning
there<00:03:33.500> might<00:03:33.620> be<00:03:33.769> a<00:03:33.799> touch<00:03:34.040> of<00:03:34.189> freezing<00:03:34.609> rain

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
there might be a touch of freezing rain

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.780 
there might be a touch of freezing rain
over<00:03:35.090> maybe<00:03:35.239> parts<00:03:35.629> of<00:03:35.750> Arkansas<00:03:36.019> in<00:03:36.409> Missouri

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
over maybe parts of Arkansas in Missouri

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.369 
over maybe parts of Arkansas in Missouri
but<00:03:37.790> not<00:03:37.970> here<00:03:38.269> we<00:03:38.419> think<00:03:38.689> the<00:03:38.810> day<00:03:39.169> Thursday

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
but not here we think the day Thursday

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.949 
but not here we think the day Thursday
will<00:03:39.769> be<00:03:39.889> dry<00:03:39.919> and<00:03:40.459> a<00:03:40.849> good<00:03:41.030> chance<00:03:41.239> we<00:03:41.449> see<00:03:41.659> low

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
will be dry and a good chance we see low

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.869 
will be dry and a good chance we see low
50s<00:03:42.560> and<00:03:42.769> that's<00:03:42.949> where<00:03:43.159> we<00:03:43.280> should<00:03:43.340> be<00:03:43.699> for

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
50s and that's where we should be for

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.539 
50s and that's where we should be for
January<00:03:44.479> and<00:03:44.720> this<00:03:45.590> is<00:03:45.739> Friday<00:03:46.040> again<00:03:46.400> that

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
January and this is Friday again that

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.429 
January and this is Friday again that
looks<00:03:46.699> like<00:03:46.909> a<00:03:46.939> dry<00:03:47.299> day

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 
looks like a dry day

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.679 
looks like a dry day
upper<00:03:49.159> 50s<00:03:49.400> are<00:03:49.790> likely<00:03:50.150> as<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.389> thickness

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:50.689 
upper 50s are likely as the thickness

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.149 
upper 50s are likely as the thickness
values<00:03:51.079> keep<00:03:51.259> coming<00:03:51.620> up<00:03:51.709> and<00:03:51.859> the<00:03:51.979> rain

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
values keep coming up and the rain

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.219 
values keep coming up and the rain
should<00:03:52.370> be<00:03:52.519> west<00:03:52.790> of<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.090> state<00:03:53.299> but<00:03:53.569> as<00:03:54.079> you

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:54.229 
should be west of the state but as you

to be pretty wet this is Saturday you
can<00:03:57.680> see<00:03:57.859> troughing<00:03:58.189> off<00:03:58.489> to<00:03:58.639> the<00:03:58.759> west<00:03:58.970> and

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
can see troughing off to the west and

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.969 
can see troughing off to the west and
down<00:03:59.419> below<00:03:59.720> that<00:03:59.900> a<00:03:59.930> pretty<00:04:00.199> good<00:04:00.379> rain<00:04:00.620> event

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:00.979 
down below that a pretty good rain event

down below that a pretty good rain event
that<00:04:01.549> rain<00:04:01.819> might<00:04:02.090> begin<00:04:02.449> after<00:04:02.689> midnight

Friday<00:04:03.590> night<00:04:03.949> and<00:04:04.359> this<00:04:05.359> is<00:04:05.479> suggesting<00:04:05.689> the

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
Friday night and this is suggesting the

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:07.719 
Friday night and this is suggesting the
rain<00:04:06.349> will<00:04:06.560> linger<00:04:06.709> into<00:04:07.129> at<00:04:07.250> least<00:04:07.280> Saturday

morning maybe Saturday afternoon

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.499 
morning maybe Saturday afternoon
temperatures<00:04:10.669> should<00:04:10.879> be<00:04:11.000> warmer<00:04:11.329> with<00:04:11.479> highs

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:11.509 
temperatures should be warmer with highs

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:14.679 
temperatures should be warmer with highs
in<00:04:11.930> the<00:04:11.959> 60s<00:04:12.530> in<00:04:12.709> fact<00:04:12.919> the<00:04:13.040> GFS<00:04:13.579> is<00:04:13.759> showing<00:04:14.060> 68

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:14.689 
in the 60s in fact the GFS is showing 68

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.599 
in the 60s in fact the GFS is showing 68
and<00:04:14.959> I<00:04:15.409> found<00:04:15.650> this<00:04:15.769> interesting<00:04:16.009> look<00:04:16.519> at

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
and I found this interesting look at

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.459 
and I found this interesting look at
that<00:04:16.820> there's<00:04:17.120> some<00:04:17.299> instability<00:04:17.719> here<00:04:18.320> in

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:18.469 
that there's some instability here in

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:20.529 
that there's some instability here in
fact<00:04:19.310> down<00:04:19.519> in<00:04:19.639> South<00:04:19.880> Alabama<00:04:20.060> the

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
fact down in South Alabama the

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.290 
fact down in South Alabama the
instability<00:04:21.109> exceeds

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
instability exceeds

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.999 
instability exceeds
750<00:04:23.300> joules<00:04:23.599> per<00:04:23.750> kilogram<00:04:23.990> so<00:04:24.680> there<00:04:24.860> could

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:25.009 
750 joules per kilogram so there could

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.730 
750 joules per kilogram so there could
be<00:04:25.039> some<00:04:25.370> thunder<00:04:26.320> especially<00:04:27.320> over<00:04:27.529> South

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
be some thunder especially over South

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.720 
be some thunder especially over South
Alabama<00:04:28.039> with<00:04:28.400> this<00:04:28.520> thing<00:04:28.699> on<00:04:28.849> Saturday

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
Alabama with this thing on Saturday

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.420 
Alabama with this thing on Saturday
go<00:04:30.450> from<00:04:30.750> single<00:04:31.260> digit<00:04:31.710> lows<00:04:31.920> to<00:04:32.130> having<00:04:32.370> a

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
go from single digit lows to having a

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.510 
go from single digit lows to having a
chance<00:04:32.700> of<00:04:32.850> thunder<00:04:33.240> here<00:04:33.420> in<00:04:33.480> a<00:04:33.540> few<00:04:33.690> days<00:04:33.930> and

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
chance of thunder here in a few days and

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.830 
chance of thunder here in a few days and
then<00:04:35.520> Saturday<00:04:35.970> night<00:04:36.150> there's<00:04:36.360> probably<00:04:36.750> a

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
then Saturday night there's probably a

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.140 
then Saturday night there's probably a
break<00:04:37.140> in<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:37.410> rain<00:04:37.440> but<00:04:37.830> now<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.250> GFS

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
break in the rain but now the GFS

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.090 
break in the rain but now the GFS
develops<00:04:39.630> another<00:04:40.020> low<00:04:40.290> back<00:04:40.560> off<00:04:40.830> to<00:04:40.980> the

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
develops another low back off to the

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.680 
develops another low back off to the
west<00:04:41.310> with<00:04:41.520> more<00:04:41.820> rain<00:04:42.060> moving<00:04:42.450> in<00:04:42.570> here

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
west with more rain moving in here

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.390 
west with more rain moving in here
Sunday<00:04:43.080> morning<00:04:43.440> this<00:04:43.560> is<00:04:43.710> Sunday<00:04:43.950> at<00:04:44.160> noon

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
Sunday morning this is Sunday at noon

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.610 
Sunday morning this is Sunday at noon
and<00:04:44.640> this<00:04:45.240> is<00:04:45.360> Sunday<00:04:45.570> at<00:04:45.780> 6<00:04:46.050> p.m.<00:04:46.410> that

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
and this is Sunday at 6 p.m. that

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.280 
and this is Sunday at 6 p.m. that
surface<00:04:47.010> low<00:04:47.190> is<00:04:47.340> right<00:04:47.640> on<00:04:47.850> top<00:04:48.210> of<00:04:48.240> us<00:04:48.660> so<00:04:49.020> if

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
surface low is right on top of us so if

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.050 
surface low is right on top of us so if
this<00:04:49.590> happens<00:04:50.040> to<00:04:50.190> be<00:04:50.220> correct<00:04:50.520> we'll<00:04:50.910> have

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
this happens to be correct we'll have

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.590 
this happens to be correct we'll have
another<00:04:51.720> soaking<00:04:52.230> rain<00:04:53.000> Sunday<00:04:54.000> maybe

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
another soaking rain Sunday maybe

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.210 
another soaking rain Sunday maybe
through<00:04:54.840> Sunday<00:04:55.200> night<00:04:55.380> so<00:04:55.710> this<00:04:55.860> is<00:04:56.010> why<00:04:56.160> you

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
through Sunday night so this is why you

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.370 
through Sunday night so this is why you
can<00:04:56.520> see<00:04:56.730> with<00:04:57.300> this<00:04:57.420> double-barrel<00:04:58.140> type

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
can see with this double-barrel type

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.870 
can see with this double-barrel type
system<00:04:58.830> there<00:04:58.980> could<00:04:59.070> be<00:04:59.130> some<00:04:59.430> big<00:04:59.580> rains

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
system there could be some big rains

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.210 
system there could be some big rains
however<00:05:00.450> the<00:05:00.690> confidence<00:05:01.260> is<00:05:01.440> not<00:05:01.650> high<00:05:01.920> in

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
however the confidence is not high in

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.790 
however the confidence is not high in
this<00:05:02.400> solution<00:05:02.760> because<00:05:03.090> every<00:05:03.690> run<00:05:03.960> is<00:05:04.200> look

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
this solution because every run is look

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.740 
this solution because every run is look
different<00:05:05.280> we<00:05:05.370> have<00:05:05.490> seen<00:05:05.730> other<00:05:05.970> runs<00:05:06.300> that

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
different we have seen other runs that

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.860 
different we have seen other runs that
are<00:05:06.900> dry<00:05:07.290> on<00:05:07.320> Sunday<00:05:08.240> but<00:05:09.240> for<00:05:09.420> now<00:05:09.540> we'll<00:05:09.720> lean

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
are dry on Sunday but for now we'll lean

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.330 
are dry on Sunday but for now we'll lean
toward<00:05:10.140> the<00:05:10.230> wetter<00:05:10.410> solution<00:05:10.980> and<00:05:11.100> this<00:05:11.190> is

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
toward the wetter solution and this is

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.610 
toward the wetter solution and this is
Monday<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.820> rain<00:05:11.850> is<00:05:12.180> gone<00:05:12.390> weather<00:05:13.260> turns<00:05:13.500> a

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
Monday the rain is gone weather turns a

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.440 
Monday the rain is gone weather turns a
little<00:05:13.710> cooler<00:05:14.130> but<00:05:14.250> not<00:05:14.310> much<00:05:14.670> highs<00:05:15.030> drop<00:05:15.300> in

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
little cooler but not much highs drop in

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.450 
little cooler but not much highs drop in
the<00:05:15.540> 50s<00:05:15.930> and<00:05:16.080> this<00:05:16.230> is<00:05:16.410> a<00:05:16.680> week<00:05:16.950> from<00:05:17.160> today

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
the 50s and this is a week from today

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.130 
the 50s and this is a week from today
I'd<00:05:18.000> say<00:05:18.210> temperatures<00:05:18.660> where<00:05:18.810> they<00:05:18.930> should

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
I'd say temperatures where they should

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.450 
I'd say temperatures where they should
be<00:05:19.260> for<00:05:19.440> this<00:05:19.470> time<00:05:19.590> of<00:05:19.800> the<00:05:19.950> year<00:05:20.040> with<00:05:20.250> highs

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
be for this time of the year with highs

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.780 
be for this time of the year with highs
the<00:05:20.670> 50s<00:05:21.060> lows<00:05:21.570> in<00:05:21.750> the<00:05:21.840> 30s<00:05:21.870> and<00:05:22.350> we're<00:05:22.500> dry<00:05:22.790> go

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
the 50s lows in the 30s and we're dry go

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.040 
the 50s lows in the 30s and we're dry go
out<00:05:23.850> there<00:05:24.030> later<00:05:24.240> in<00:05:24.420> the<00:05:24.450> month<00:05:24.630> this<00:05:24.810> is<00:05:24.960> the

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
out there later in the month this is the

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.230 
out there later in the month this is the
17th<00:05:25.560> of<00:05:25.680> January<00:05:25.920> and<00:05:26.490> again<00:05:26.730> this<00:05:26.910> is<00:05:27.090> where

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
17th of January and again this is where

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.420 
17th of January and again this is where
another<00:05:27.480> 10:46<00:05:28.380> high<00:05:28.590> comes<00:05:28.890> down<00:05:29.070> across<00:05:29.310> the

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
another 10:46 high comes down across the

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.640 
another 10:46 high comes down across the
pike<00:05:30.000> very<00:05:30.240> cold<00:05:30.540> up<00:05:30.690> north<00:05:30.720> and<00:05:31.200> we're

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
pike very cold up north and we're

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.990 
pike very cold up north and we're
catching<00:05:31.980> some<00:05:32.190> of<00:05:32.220> the<00:05:32.370> cold<00:05:32.580> air<00:05:32.730> and<00:05:32.790> this

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
catching some of the cold air and this

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.240 
catching some of the cold air and this
is<00:05:33.180> hinting<00:05:33.630> there<00:05:34.080> might<00:05:34.260> be<00:05:34.290> some<00:05:34.650> snow<00:05:34.950> here

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
is hinting there might be some snow here

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.820 
is hinting there might be some snow here
maybe<00:05:35.400> from<00:05:35.640> Nashville<00:05:36.150> up<00:05:36.750> toward<00:05:37.110> Lexington

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
maybe from Nashville up toward Lexington

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.520 
maybe from Nashville up toward Lexington
and<00:05:38.310> Louisville<00:05:38.490> Kentucky<00:05:39.090> and<00:05:39.500> rain<00:05:40.500> showers

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
and Louisville Kentucky and rain showers

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.860 
and Louisville Kentucky and rain showers
here<00:05:41.190> and<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.940> following<00:05:42.270> day<00:05:42.510> this<00:05:42.690> is<00:05:42.840> the

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
here and the following day this is the

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:43.550 
here and the following day this is the
18th

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
18th

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.260 
18th
another<00:05:43.920> nice<00:05:44.100> trough<00:05:44.460> over<00:05:44.640> the<00:05:44.790> east<00:05:45.030> and

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
another nice trough over the east and

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.200 
another nice trough over the east and
more<00:05:45.420> cold<00:05:45.720> air<00:05:45.900> nothing<00:05:46.170> like<00:05:46.590> this<00:05:47.030> but<00:05:48.030> that

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
more cold air nothing like this but that

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.150 
more cold air nothing like this but that
would<00:05:48.330> be<00:05:48.360> colder<00:05:48.780> that's<00:05:48.960> a<00:05:49.050> 1048<00:05:49.710> millibar

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
would be colder that's a 1048 millibar

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.430 
would be colder that's a 1048 millibar
high<00:05:50.400> so<00:05:50.790> evidence<00:05:51.540> it<00:05:51.660> may<00:05:51.780> be<00:05:51.840> another<00:05:52.080> cold

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
high so evidence it may be another cold

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.390 
high so evidence it may be another cold
shot<00:05:52.530> around<00:05:53.430> the<00:05:53.690> 17th<00:05:54.690> or<00:05:54.840> 18th<00:05:55.250> but<00:05:56.250> then

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
shot around the 17th or 18th but then

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.880 
shot around the 17th or 18th but then
look<00:05:56.580> at<00:05:56.670> the<00:05:56.820> 22nd<00:05:57.600> of<00:05:57.840> January

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
look at the 22nd of January

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.610 
look at the 22nd of January
we've<00:05:59.640> got<00:05:59.790> ridging<00:06:00.360> here<00:06:00.690> and<00:06:00.840> down<00:06:01.590> below

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
we've got ridging here and down below

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.830 
we've got ridging here and down below
that<00:06:02.040> a<00:06:02.070> big<00:06:02.490> warm-up<00:06:02.970> as<00:06:03.150> temperatures<00:06:03.600> go

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
that a big warm-up as temperatures go

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.040 
that a big warm-up as temperatures go
very<00:06:04.320> mild<00:06:04.650> for<00:06:04.920> this<00:06:05.010> time<00:06:05.070> of<00:06:05.280> the<00:06:05.430> year

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
very mild for this time of the year

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.130 
very mild for this time of the year
would<00:06:07.050> not<00:06:07.080> be<00:06:07.350> nice<00:06:07.560> and<00:06:07.860> this<00:06:07.950> is<00:06:08.010> the<00:06:09.140> Arctic

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
would not be nice and this is the Arctic

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.290 
would not be nice and this is the Arctic
Oscillation<00:06:10.260> we<00:06:10.950> had<00:06:11.250> one<00:06:11.490> control<00:06:12.090> run

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
Oscillation we had one control run

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.530 
Oscillation we had one control run
yesterday<00:06:12.780> that<00:06:12.960> really<00:06:12.990> spiked<00:06:13.650> the<00:06:13.800> ao+<00:06:14.540> out

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
yesterday that really spiked the ao+ out

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.390 
yesterday that really spiked the ao+ out
there<00:06:15.780> toward<00:06:16.140> this<00:06:16.260> period<00:06:16.740> but<00:06:16.860> other<00:06:17.070> runs

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
there toward this period but other runs

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.640 
there toward this period but other runs
are<00:06:18.090> not<00:06:18.270> as<00:06:18.420> bullish<00:06:18.840> and<00:06:18.990> if<00:06:19.080> the<00:06:19.170> AO<00:06:19.320> goes

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
are not as bullish and if the AO goes

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.170 
are not as bullish and if the AO goes
positive<00:06:20.220> it<00:06:20.310> kind<00:06:20.490> of<00:06:20.550> shuts<00:06:20.790> down<00:06:20.940> the

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
positive it kind of shuts down the

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.610 
positive it kind of shuts down the
ability<00:06:21.570> for<00:06:21.750> the<00:06:21.840> source<00:06:22.140> region<00:06:22.380> to

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
ability for the source region to

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.580 
ability for the source region to
generate<00:06:23.010> cold<00:06:23.280> air<00:06:23.460> down<00:06:23.640> and<00:06:23.820> through<00:06:23.940> here

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
generate cold air down and through here

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.080 
generate cold air down and through here
but<00:06:25.590> again<00:06:25.800> just<00:06:26.040> evidence<00:06:26.400> that<00:06:26.670> just<00:06:26.820> maybe

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
but again just evidence that just maybe

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.760 
but again just evidence that just maybe
we'll<00:06:27.330> see<00:06:27.540> a<00:06:27.570> nice<00:06:27.810> stretch<00:06:28.110> of<00:06:28.140> mild<00:06:28.500> weather

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
we'll see a nice stretch of mild weather

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.940 
we'll see a nice stretch of mild weather
in<00:06:29.640> late<00:06:29.970> January<00:06:30.630> but<00:06:30.900> the<00:06:30.930> winter<00:06:31.350> is<00:06:31.530> far

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 
in late January but the winter is far

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.560 
in late January but the winter is far
from<00:06:32.220> over<00:06:32.550> it's<00:06:32.700> just<00:06:32.760> getting<00:06:33.150> cranked<00:06:33.480> up

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:33.570 
from over it's just getting cranked up

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.590 
from over it's just getting cranked up
so<00:06:33.870> I<00:06:34.080> fully<00:06:34.710> expect<00:06:35.190> more<00:06:35.640> decent<00:06:36.120> Colts<00:06:36.420> now

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
so I fully expect more decent Colts now

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.750 
so I fully expect more decent Colts now
it<00:06:36.660> snaps<00:06:36.990> into<00:06:37.200> February<00:06:37.440> and<00:06:37.800> March<00:06:38.340> we<00:06:38.610> also

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
it snaps into February and March we also

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.760 
it snaps into February and March we also
know<00:06:39.120> some<00:06:39.330> of<00:06:39.420> the<00:06:39.480> bigger<00:06:39.690> winter<00:06:40.560> weather
