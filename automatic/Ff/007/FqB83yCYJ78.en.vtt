00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.049
 then we watched without the support 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.840

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.130
 during a special sequel to the victory 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.280

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.459
 show you and then I told you do 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.410
 are dsr so here it works well 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.630
 you really camouflage what 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.310
 so I showed you that two or three 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.980
 examples because you will understand that 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.319
 works well it's not fake so 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.269
 take hurry to go see I 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.580
 maybe think that's going to be removed 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.230
 this stuff the end I do not know if if 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.299
 it's okay because maybe it's a 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:38.610
 hack from those who put it 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:40.349
 so now I want to put the the 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.010

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:46.920

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.470
 so you choose the apple pack here 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.959
 and then I show you that these two 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.519
 examples there because me it's useless 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.530
 and camouflage I think you have them 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:10.560
 already all seen so that's so I wanted to 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.989
 thank the hackers or people 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.220
 who put that because it's really 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.840
 not bad like that thanks 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.430
 thanks to them we will be able to see the 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.400
 camouflage on on the ps3 so that's 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.880
 not bad so here I serve it will be 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.250

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.819

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.819
 camouflage 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.640
 and so that's the camouflage the 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.380
 camouflage not that apple I see you 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.300

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.790
 so for the other four camouflage 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.580
