00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.480
 Of course, there are other ways to fillet fish 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.000
 if you took the fish home, it went so far 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.740
 prepared with exception 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.009
 just like the one who paid for the cleaning up 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.989
 You can also help yourself with the electric one though 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:16.499
 Many believe that such an electric knife 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.380
 simply because it's from the east appearance 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.970
 so are too good 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.069
 that is a fallacy 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:26.840
 When it comes to electric it is so that the two Schleiden work the countries 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.890
 and I get my gut feeling the fresh cut 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.350
 the Ulm deployment 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.629
 completely naked under 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.700
 then later to process 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.410
 I want to serve now 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.500
 this is done with the Latvian knife 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.500
 the riding club 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.630
 now he is sworn in 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.080
 Unfortunately 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.080
 on the us pga tour 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.539
 and you can recognize 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.730
 Here, too, there is such a beautiful 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.600
 so I did not know much and the special feature is now here 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.460
 you can see that here on the Filius very strong here you have no stakes 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.570
 if you cut with a knife still to create because the two 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.229
 Schneiders elliptical knife working against countries here is a ship 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.340
 I already said that 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.050
 it really appetite percent if it is so finely cut 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.149
 a success the other side of life 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.030
 to come through the table 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.030
 have also dragged themselves here again 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.640
 and unfortunately on the Re 2 Re again 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.540
 but also become 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.480
 so and here too that we cut nicely under 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.119
 the initial percent longer 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.029
 next steps ZÃ¼ndler as well
