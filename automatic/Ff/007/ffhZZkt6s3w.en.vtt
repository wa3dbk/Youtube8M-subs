00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
weight but my doctor says that it's not

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.750 
weight but my doctor says that it's not
very<00:05:51.780> much<00:05:51.960> and<00:05:52.230> it's<00:05:52.440> fine<00:05:52.680> like<00:05:53.100> it's<00:05:53.340> the

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
very much and it's fine like it's the

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.460 
very much and it's fine like it's the
right<00:05:53.880> amount<00:05:55.940> just<00:05:56.940> a<00:05:57.030> little<00:05:57.210> bit<00:05:57.330> so<00:05:57.600> it's

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
right amount just a little bit so it's

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:05.480 
right amount just a little bit so it's
okay<00:05:58.770> but<00:06:02.540> like<00:06:03.540> I<00:06:03.780> just<00:06:04.620> thought<00:06:04.770> perhaps<00:06:05.220> I

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
okay but like I just thought perhaps I

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.840 
okay but like I just thought perhaps I
should<00:06:05.669> record<00:06:05.910> this<00:06:06.150> because<00:06:07.080> I<00:06:07.680> know<00:06:08.430> I<00:06:08.520> talk

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
should record this because I know I talk
