mouse wheel if you want to replace

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.150 
mouse wheel if you want to replace
something<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.300> just<00:00:57.329> stomp<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.809> and

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
something you can just stomp it and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.619 
something you can just stomp it and
there's<00:00:59.160> about<00:00:59.219> 400<00:00:59.550> parts<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> editor

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
there's about 400 parts in the editor

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.270 
there's about 400 parts in the editor
base<00:01:00.809> paths<00:01:01.109> which<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> really<00:01:01.770> big<00:01:02.160> number

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
base paths which is a really big number

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.229 
base paths which is a really big number
to<00:01:02.460> start<00:01:02.550> with<00:01:02.789> but<00:01:03.000> they<00:01:03.090> all<00:01:03.210> have

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
to start with but they all have

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.969 
to start with but they all have
different<00:01:03.390> morphs<00:01:03.989> channels<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.739> all<00:01:04.830> these

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
different morphs channels and all these

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.140 
different morphs channels and all these
more<00:01:05.189> channels<00:01:05.430> mean<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.820> there's<00:01:05.970> actually

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
more channels mean that there's actually

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.149 
more channels mean that there's actually
virtually<00:01:06.990> an<00:01:07.080> infinite<00:01:07.500> amount<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.830> content

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
virtually an infinite amount of content

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.260 
virtually an infinite amount of content
you<00:01:08.280> can<00:01:08.340> get<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.610> there<00:01:08.729> because<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.119> put

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
you can get in there because you can put

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.609 
you can get in there because you can put
these<00:01:09.390> parts<00:01:09.689> wherever<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.500> can

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
these parts wherever you like you can

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.500 
these parts wherever you like you can
scale<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.189> move<00:01:11.340> them<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.790> know<00:01:11.880> rotate<00:01:12.299> them

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
scale and move them you know rotate them

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.140 
scale and move them you know rotate them
more<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.049> them<00:01:13.260> all<00:01:13.409> over<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.619> place<00:01:14.150> what

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
more of them all over the place what

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.999 
more of them all over the place what
other<00:01:15.270> cool<00:01:15.420> thing<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.689> lots<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.560> games<00:01:16.770> make

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
say here's the right way to play it and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.429 
say here's the right way to play it and
if<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.330> don't<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.659> exactly<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.380> way

and the gate itself even the legs now it

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.259 
and the gate itself even the legs now it
is<00:02:41.220> too<00:02:41.370> funky<00:02:41.550> legs<00:02:41.849> he's<00:02:42.000> still<00:02:42.150> getting
