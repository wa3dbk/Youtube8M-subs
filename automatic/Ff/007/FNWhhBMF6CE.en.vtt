00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 good morning to all the guys who are 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.420
 been www.lexbook.it on facebook page 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.330
 of the description and we are here with the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.429
 player review by lewandowski team of the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.719
 season second version fit for 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.639
 this player this year has 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.730
 received only an iv version 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.449
 so it went from being 87 to 88 e 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.619
 will have 94 more 6 overall for him 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.240
 beautiful thing that they put more 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.430
 headquarters or the most approximately 6 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.500
 statistics has so many players why 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.090
 who knows type tevez higuain or players 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.880
 that have done well in series to what 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.010
 could arrive however 87 of 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.960
 speed for him 93 withdrawal more 9 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.790
 compared to the version does not inform that it is 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.260
 a very good version I see many 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.700
 players who use it and many players 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.730
 they always do ass when they use 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.850
 lewandowski does not inform the passage 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.390
 a good a feature 94 of of 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.010
 books in 45 of defense and 87 of physique more 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.989
 9 compared to the version of the informa 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.760
 this is also a player who is me 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.149
 very liked that is the three I have 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.550
 tried so far ie miur de broin e 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.019
 lewandowski team of the season is that 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.909
 which I liked best is also good 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.580
 the one I played the most with because 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.830
 I played for him basically though he is 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.990
 a very good price range player 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.600
 playstation move is as prohibitive as al 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.930
 usually one million and 53 million while 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.400
 for xbox 250 500 thousand that I think is 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.920
 a very good price is a 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.880
 I like the striker a lot 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.280
 many goals 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.080
 however, he has some flaws too 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.900
 so let's get the stone right away 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.350
 from the shoe and we talk about the passage 81 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.610
 on paper I liked yes but more 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.310
 for the long passages that it does not make for i 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.170
 short passes this player to 71 of 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.549
 long passages and 91 short passages 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.220
 let alone be the paradox 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.259
 short passages more than sometimes 12 o 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.790
 crude the first steps he has 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.310
 wrong many and more than sometimes 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.680
 I also lost the long pass brackets 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.799
 especially those high passages 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.829
 I really liked high filtering devices there 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.450
 or bitched many times and muller 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.070
 I also have bruni who went to 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.930
 fit in and those are very me 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.659
 so liked 81 passing that yes 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.090
 divides into 85 division 68 of large that 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.099
 this good characteristic in short 68 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.140
 I when I read the features I have 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.569
 said wow i thought he had a lot more 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.060
 because the cross is good semi-automatic 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.010
 even the statistics help you and also 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.959
 the controller we say helps you though 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.550
 however he always did good crosses 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.260
 and more than once if he had talk 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.490
 he and he was too wide putting in 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.250
 half and new york also arrived 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.050
 header then we said 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.420
 only in the long passages 91 of 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.060
 short passages 84 with an effect minus 84 of 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.770
 effect for passages ok for shooting 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.200
 I didn't like this either, i 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.310
 throws are the weakest shots of 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.890
 this player 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.170
 even here I pull on the card I have 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.239
 said well it will have a very good look I look at 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.340
 the statistics are really good 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.019
 because 93 is a very high value but me 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.390
 I even expected more 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.730
 for what made me on the field 90 the 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.590
 96 of optimal positioning that is when 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.480
 make a cross in the area or anyway when 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.769
 you have to look for him for the throws he is always 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.630
 in the right place and it is something that is me 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.239
 very liked 96 of finalization 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.670
 we thought s 99 but still a 96 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.500
 very high value the very good 93 of 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.239
 shooting power is the value that is me 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.370
 liked most of all because pull 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.590
 from the edge of the area it's really almost 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.470
 a launch security 89 this 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.810
 I thought I really had a lot more 91 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.549
 of viola role ok 85 of rigoni 74 di 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.900
 fine punishment well though 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.579
 that effect those throws around 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.060
 especially when you are in front of the 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.470
 goalkeeper 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.780
 I was wrong look right 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.670
 that was the case one more case 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.709
 lampanti that brings empty lowered 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.060
 that he stepped over the door for a moment 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.950
 threw it on the pole 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.579
 I often missed those types of shots 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.700
 for charity, obviously in 9 out of 12 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.320
 however, in any case, it is sometimes 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.150
 arrive in front of the door also a 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.610
 blow to the safe and made a mistake 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.620
 a nice shot then there is the 94 dribble 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.019
 because among the pros and I put the speed 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.299
 it's also the 87 speed dribble 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.130
 on the card 86 acceleration 87 level 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.269
 city ​​shot good to me it also seemed 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.920
 much more because I have not found 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.380
 no difficulty in launching this 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.940
 player against any defense for 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.560
 charity at times of physical fatality 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.260
 he always lost with boateng but produced 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.239
 boateng in this game has a tone but e 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.190
 speed against any defense is me 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.620
 very liked this is really a great one 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.269
 excellent speed the 94 of dribbling 4 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.030
 excellent star skills for an attacker 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.590
 of the genus that has 88 of strength and 98 of 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.090
 balance then also the binomial strength 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.830
 I put more balance into physics 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.670
 quietly among the pros because you have 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.290
 seen 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.360
 one of the first goals I showed I have 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.590
 all the men of the 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.910
 opposing team but certainly point that me 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.200
 They arrived on the 4 I have 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.090
 pushed to be left but he is 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.980
 always remained still then four 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.500
 stars skills and help a lot 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.600
 and there is also that 97 of ref. 96 of 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.000
 93 dribbling ball control e 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.310
 we said 88 parents a 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.870
 very good player really is me 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.970
 really I liked it so long since I do 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.500
 the more then take mine too 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.420
 affirmations with pliers because it was 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.920
 also for a while since I didn't play with 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.110
 in short, I did a few games but 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.520
 play with opi players and try them out 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.920
 first time was a long time since not 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.800
 I did it but it is a player that is me 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.810
 liked so if you are on xbox you have 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.450
 250 to 500 thousand I tell you buy it 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.280
 on playstation eggs and credits and if 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.010
 no I don't win go get the credits 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.440
 to buy it because it's me now 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.450
 price points did I miss a bit the 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.670
 But that still values the players 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:24.420
 there are so many alternatives to a lot 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:26.340
 I think less and then there is the physical 87 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.290
 of leap 96 precision shot of 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.820
 head of resistance 84 good value 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.910
 in short, it is not that he was so tired 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.950
 often 90 89 of aggressiveness and workers 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.660
 medium high walker medium medium good 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.090
 value but above all and header 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.070
 I said positioning me in the air 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.170
 great then put it in the middle and him 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.070
 often headers of that summer of head 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.200
 which are exceptional 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.880
 anyway, for a long time the video 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.380
 I like this player again 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.330
 a review that I hope will have at least the 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.690
 half the quality they had 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.940
 before I stop reviewing that I will try 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.710
 to bring at least those of muller and de 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.510
 bruyne will try quietly at the door 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.820
 I'll bring it to you, but I won't make it 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.740
 make or many videos that is I will make one every 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.110
 especially because you are missing the 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.640
 want to edit videos especially 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.290
 in any case, I hope there is a review 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.950
 like if you tried to themes 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.330
 as always 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.490
 what do you think of this player 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.290
 tell me if you think it's worth it 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.130
 buy it for those who don't have it or don't have it 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.130
 found in packages e
