00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
ten years old so it's definitely not a

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.660 
ten years old so it's definitely not a
newly<00:00:17.010> made<00:00:17.250> custom<00:00:18.000> knife<00:00:19.220> as<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.369> can<00:00:20.490> see

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
it has a silver twill g10 handle which

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.250 
it has a silver twill g10 handle which
gives<00:00:26.699> off<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.939> very<00:00:27.150> cool<00:00:27.779> appearance<00:00:28.490> it<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.550> a

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:29.750 
early lock up even though it's ten years
old<00:02:21.980> maybe<00:02:23.780> probably<00:02:24.780> 11<00:02:25.020> by<00:02:25.290> now<00:02:25.470> honestly<00:02:28.760> so

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
old maybe probably 11 by now honestly so

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.230 
old maybe probably 11 by now honestly so
look<00:02:29.910> at<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.090> detent<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:32.730> could<00:02:32.850> hear<00:02:33.090> that

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
look at the detent you could hear that

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:42.260 
look at the detent you could hear that
even<00:02:36.020> so<00:02:37.880> very<00:02:38.880> fast<00:02:39.150> deployment<00:02:41.000> locks<00:02:42.000> up

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
even so very fast deployment locks up

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:50.449 
even so very fast deployment locks up
very<00:02:42.510> solidly<00:02:42.989> as<00:02:43.260> well

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.759 

piece<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.180> dust<00:02:51.390> is<00:02:51.599> bothering<00:02:52.049> me<00:02:52.079> there<00:02:52.620> we

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
piece of dust is bothering me there we

00:02:52.769 --> 00:03:00.100 
piece of dust is bothering me there we
go

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.870 

not<00:03:00.680> exactly<00:03:01.430> sure<00:03:01.550> if<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:02.360> blade<00:03:03.320> size<00:03:04.130> looks

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
not exactly sure if the blade size looks

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.390 
not exactly sure if the blade size looks
around<00:03:05.620> between<00:03:07.510> 3.2<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:08.720> 3.5<00:03:09.290> I'm<00:03:09.920> guessing

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
around between 3.2 and 3.5 I'm guessing

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:18.520 
around between 3.2 and 3.5 I'm guessing
so<00:03:11.180> let's<00:03:11.560> compare<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:12.800> this<00:03:17.350> I'm<00:03:18.350> guessing

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
so let's compare it to this I'm guessing

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.060 
so let's compare it to this I'm guessing
that's<00:03:18.740> a<00:03:18.890> 3.2<00:03:19.520> inch<00:03:19.700> blade<00:03:20.890> don't<00:03:21.890> have

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
that's a 3.2 inch blade don't have

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.550 
that's a 3.2 inch blade don't have
anything<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.490> measure<00:03:22.670> it<00:03:22.880> currently<00:03:23.560> and

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
anything to measure it currently and

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.280 
anything to measure it currently and
that<00:03:25.100> was<00:03:25.250> a<00:03:25.550> Hendricks<00:03:26.180> I'm<00:03:26.330> 18<00:03:26.690> 3<00:03:26.960> by<00:03:27.080> 5

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
that was a Hendricks I'm 18 3 by 5

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:39.080 
that was a Hendricks I'm 18 3 by 5
inches<00:03:29.830> yeah

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:51.040 

I<00:03:39.180> need<00:03:39.959> some<00:03:40.260> studs
