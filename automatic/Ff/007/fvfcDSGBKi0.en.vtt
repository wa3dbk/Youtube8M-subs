 I carry on 40 watt bulb here 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.440

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.100
 here 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:44.360
 This is the normal of colleagues 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.160
 gone to be normal led lamp cradle 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.980
 can because clean over it made 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:01:03.020
 that the leds do not go well and we 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:01:06.350

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.119
 now already activated wants to have 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.649
 do not need so that is now 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:14.439
 a normal operation here I can go to 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:18.590
 leave deep and divorce 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:22.789
 spread deep inside and I will 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.850
 let's see how long that lasts in the 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:28.069
 so compare this normal then can 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.859
 It is a matter of blaming the threads 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:35.270
 the others make talk 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:38.689
 and let's see how long the whole thing 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:44.749
 take a calendar to see 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:49.069
 So ready to speak, only one has 

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:52.759
 just between the flashlights in 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:54.380
 The kind of guilty then becomes 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.590
 already over that carry with that 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.380
 you do 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:05.179
 yamauchi piece and you have to 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:09.170
 winner is the one who appreciates the 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.789
 normal country's politics 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.660
 so far no one can do that okay 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.230
 yes, how long 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.890
 That's why we do that 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:21.019
 How long does it last without me being guilty 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.459
 switch poor down there 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.700
 i'll go and have a calendar 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.640
 were from the czar or he also recognizes the 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.420
 time with write down that time not 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.000
 So say coach has his mum 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.769
 the park if there are really three four 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.930
 people are had the Arab pitch then 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.269
 at half past four four people but one 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.980
 bedside lamp more looked nice if so 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:50.069
 then it is logical that his 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.859
 shower the voucher gives away the stop 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:58.890
 So no matter her professional is the normal 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:05.629
 flashlight with three batteries here 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.629
