00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.390
 and I liked them a lot because it's like a 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.110
 metallic so I wanted to make a mix 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.140

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.969
 description to be seen 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.880
 The first thing I'm going to put on is this 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:13.689
 diamond this already keeps me I buy it 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:15.390
 in Mexico it's like a pink / pink color and 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.420
 purple 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.570
 this one is going to put a quarter 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.570
 teaspoonful 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.620
 this is teaspoons jasmine gave me 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.540
 and I liked them a lot 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:33.000
 also in the same tone I will put the 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.000
 glitter a little bit less 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.180
 I'm going to put this glitter that is 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.640
 organic that is called a cure that is a 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.760
 Very nice blue 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.690
 the organic books are very very 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.710
 Shiny and very finite and also cute 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:55.850
 I'm going to put this mermaid tail 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.850
 silver is bought by frames 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.780
 but I really like the brightness that it has 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.640
 and do not miss 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.030
 of this if it is to put a little 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.030
 plus 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.560
 Now I'm going to put a little bit of tail 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.450
 of mermaid 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.310
 white or good is lucid 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.980
 a little bit more 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.420
 and now I'm going to put the decoration that 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.890
 I told them 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.380
 this is how the angel looks like the 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.700
 I really do not know I can not describe it but 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.160
 seems to dance or maybe if it is 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.420
 in very small pieces it is purple 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.420
 very nice metallic 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.740
 and I'm going to put the mermaid tail 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.740
 big 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.580
 listen out 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.959
 so let's load the time to see if 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.959
 they lack something 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.940
 I like how it looks but it's missing 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.620
 other color 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.920
 I'm going to find another color we can 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.920
 put 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.470
 I'm going to put some butterflies 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.890
 silver of these I already have them in my 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.890
 store 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.209
 and I'm going to put some golden diamonds 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.420
 now we are going to see how we are doing 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.420
 well what a pretty shines 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.490
 I'm going to add a little more of this 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.450
 the angel 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.450
 I think it 's 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.330
 I'm going to put a little more 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:08.459
 I could add the acrylic 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.459
 and sing it in a pot 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.650
 look how pretty it shines 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.920
 I will add acrylic that are 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:31.580
 remember that as I always tell you 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:35.510
 always add more acrylic than 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.730
 they put the mixture because if not never 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.000
 will hit them I remember that when 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:45.350
 I just started doing 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.170
 my inventions were not not and with nails I 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.610
 I started the first thing that I bought for 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.310
 make a 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.250
 I wanted to put my nails in good 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.849
 started to put on really nasty nails do not create 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.740
 that were beautiful and very ugly and I 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:06.010
 I bought a little boat from an attack 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:09.560
 I remember the rose of that rose 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:12.020
 transparent and 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.840
 the mix and I put the vote on that you do not 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.000
 you feel like 5 grams and I put a 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.810
 little acrylic and I was there as 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.810
 that wanting me to stick on the nail 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.510
 and never stop addiction and I try -ha 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.820
 well treated and battle gives a lot but I 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.520
 I started doing my inventions like 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.120
 four years almost four years I'm going to 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.520
 comply 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.160
 and I do not have a weight do not know and when 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.000
 I started I started alone and then already 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.000
 I studied but 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.520
 I wanted him to stick without acrylic and 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.030
 expression I realized that I had to put 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.530
 more acrylic and had to see a mixture 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:53.860
 not just the angel's wing with the 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:56.110
 acrylic if when I was going to hit but that 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.020
 it was an anecdote maybe afterwards 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:02.320
 I spoke many more I had already left the 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:05.730
 the mixture with the acrylic and nothing else 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.730
 I'm going to check on a nail 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.870
 and I really liked this mix 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.360
 very happy 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:29.029
 and very bright that is what we like 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:29.029
 much shine much much 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:36.169
 we're just going to let it dry 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:40.540
 a little bit to see how it looks 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:44.400
 Well, dry, see how beautiful it shines 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.400
 I'm going to put the gel to see how 

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:54.549
 I loved the result of this mixture 

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:54.549
 I hope you like it too 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:02.320
 that beautiful 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.830
 Now I put a little bit of this 

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.660
 mix in this little boat 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.480
 and I would like to give it to one of 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.409

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.770
 do is

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:30.460
