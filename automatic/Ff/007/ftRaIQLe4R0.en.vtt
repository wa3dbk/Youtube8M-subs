00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
about it and I'm hoping there's four

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.450 
about it and I'm hoping there's four
batteries<00:01:33.610> already<00:01:33.850> in<00:01:34.090> here<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:35.320> I'm<00:01:35.830> you

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
batteries already in here so I'm you

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:47.130

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:54.160 

there<00:01:48.140> we<00:01:48.230> go<00:01:49.030> close<00:01:51.430> so<00:01:52.430> when<00:01:53.390> you<00:01:53.540> slug<00:01:54.050> it

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
there we go close so when you slug it

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.420 
there we go close so when you slug it
open<00:01:54.880> straight<00:01:55.880> away<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:56.360> see<00:01:57.310> keyboard<00:01:58.310> them

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
open straight away you see keyboard them

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.190 
open straight away you see keyboard them
and<00:01:58.550> you<00:01:58.610> can<00:01:58.730> see<00:01:58.940> there<00:01:59.150> doesn't<00:02:00.080> actually

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
and you can see there doesn't actually

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.100 
and you can see there doesn't actually
have<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:01.090> extended<00:02:02.090> section<00:02:02.270> for<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.660> member

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
have the extended section for the member

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.410 
have the extended section for the member
pad<00:02:03.320> so<00:02:03.890> it's<00:02:03.980> got<00:02:04.130> all<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.420> up-down

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
three batters which is quite yet I know

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.630 
three batters which is quite yet I know
you<00:02:24.830> get<00:02:26.740> it<00:02:27.740> may<00:02:27.860> actually<00:02:27.950> give<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.459> some

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
good quality ones so they give you

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.110 
good quality ones so they give you
energizer<00:02:30.709> batteries<00:02:31.130> rather<00:02:31.580> than<00:02:31.700> just<00:02:32.030> the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
energizer batteries rather than just the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.550 
energizer batteries rather than just the
crappy<00:02:32.480> rechargeable<00:02:33.080> as<00:02:33.170> they<00:02:33.260> usually

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
crappy rechargeable as they usually

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.620 
crappy rechargeable as they usually
provide<00:02:33.890> that's<00:02:34.670> good<00:02:34.850> so<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:35.090> takes<00:02:35.240> three

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
provide that's good so it takes three

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.530 
provide that's good so it takes three
double<00:02:36.020> a<00:02:36.200> batteries<00:02:36.740> and<00:02:37.150> so<00:02:38.150> we'll<00:02:38.330> see<00:02:38.510> how

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
double a batteries and so we'll see how

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:49.170 
double a batteries and so we'll see how
long<00:02:38.870> they<00:02:39.110> last<00:02:40.360> take<00:02:41.739> like<00:02:42.739> a<00:02:42.770> profit<00:02:46.780> what

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
long they last take like a profit what

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.880 
long they last take like a profit what
so<00:02:50.180> without<00:02:50.570> the<00:02:50.780> battery<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.140> very<00:02:51.350> very

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
so without the battery is very very

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.580 
so without the battery is very very
light<00:02:52.070> it's<00:02:52.940> because<00:02:53.480> of<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.810> shape<00:02:54.080> so<00:02:54.500> if

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
light it's because of the shape so if

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.240 
light it's because of the shape so if
you<00:02:54.680> see<00:02:54.800> on<00:02:55.010> there<00:02:55.220> it's<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:56.030> slot<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:57.350> put

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
you see on there it's the slot to put

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.860 
you see on there it's the slot to put
the<00:02:58.370> batteries<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.269> think<00:02:59.510> it's<00:02:59.660> either

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
the batteries and I think it's either

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.710 
the batteries and I think it's either
they're<00:03:00.050> not<00:03:00.380> sure<00:03:00.560> what<00:03:00.680> this<00:03:00.769> is<00:03:00.830> for<00:03:01.130> I

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
they're not sure what this is for I

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.030 
they're not sure what this is for I
think<00:03:02.720> it's<00:03:02.840> just<00:03:03.080> so<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.500> Bluetooth<00:03:03.830> see

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
think it's just so the Bluetooth see

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.770 
think it's just so the Bluetooth see
what<00:03:04.190> comes<00:03:04.370> up<00:03:04.519> and<00:03:04.730> then<00:03:05.180> I<00:03:05.299> think<00:03:05.540> what<00:03:05.690> you

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
what comes up and then I think what you

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.050 
what comes up and then I think what you
do<00:03:05.900> is<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.049> twist<00:03:06.320> this<00:03:06.700> with<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.730> coin<00:03:08.030> and

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
do is you twist this with a coin and

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.600 
do is you twist this with a coin and
then<00:03:08.360> put<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.750> battery<00:03:09.019> down<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:10.400> as<00:03:10.459> you<00:03:10.519> can

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
then put the battery down so as you can

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.759 
then put the battery down so as you can
see<00:03:10.760> around<00:03:10.850> that<00:03:11.180> very<00:03:11.959> slim<00:03:12.350> very<00:03:12.530> low

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
see around that very slim very low

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.610 
see around that very slim very low
profile<00:03:13.280> as<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.360> rests<00:03:14.600> on<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.049> desk<00:03:15.290> it'll

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
profile as it rests on the desk it'll

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.960 
profile as it rests on the desk it'll
kind<00:03:15.799> of<00:03:15.890> give<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.190> little<00:03:16.220> angle<00:03:16.760> when<00:03:16.880> you

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
kind of give it a little angle when you

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.150 
kind of give it a little angle when you
type<00:03:17.150> in<00:03:17.330> so<00:03:18.080> that's<00:03:18.170> good<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:18.709> obviously

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
type in so that's good and obviously

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.520 
type in so that's good and obviously
around<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.610> other<00:03:19.700> end<00:03:20.080> it's<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.200> power

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
around the other end it's the power

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.970 
around the other end it's the power
button<00:03:21.769> you<00:03:22.070> can<00:03:22.250> see<00:03:22.459> that<00:03:22.670> I<00:03:23.650> might<00:03:24.650> wanna<00:03:24.860> be

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
button you can see that I might wanna be

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.729 
button you can see that I might wanna be
from<00:03:25.160> under<00:03:25.310> it<00:03:25.660> when<00:03:26.660> you<00:03:26.780> get<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.110> apple
