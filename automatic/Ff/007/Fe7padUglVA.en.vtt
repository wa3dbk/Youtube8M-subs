want to do is kick down on your back
foot<00:00:28.880> so<00:00:29.480> that<00:00:29.510> just<00:00:29.810> snaps<00:00:30.020> the<00:00:30.199> tail<00:00:30.410> down

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
foot so that just snaps the tail down

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.860 
foot so that just snaps the tail down
and<00:00:30.920> as<00:00:31.340> your<00:00:31.640> board<00:00:31.970> comes<00:00:32.180> up<00:00:32.360> you<00:00:32.509> slide

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
and as your board comes up you slide

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.479 
and as your board comes up you slide
your<00:00:33.230> front<00:00:33.440> foot<00:00:33.530> forward<00:00:33.860> in<00:00:34.100> a<00:00:34.160> rolling

forward towards the nose in a rolling

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.219 
forward towards the nose in a rolling
motion<00:00:54.909> as<00:00:55.909> the<00:00:56.059> board<00:00:56.269> gets<00:00:56.449> airborne<00:00:56.780> bend

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:57.229 
motion as the board gets airborne bend

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:59.319 
motion as the board gets airborne bend
your<00:00:57.350> back<00:00:57.559> knees<00:00:57.829> to<00:00:58.069> the<00:00:58.190> levels<00:00:58.519> out<00:00:58.699> once

your back knees to the levels out once

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:00.819 
your back knees to the levels out once
the<00:00:59.479> board<00:00:59.690> is<00:00:59.809> flat<00:01:00.139> and<00:01:00.379> at<00:01:00.620> its<00:01:00.769> peak

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
the board is flat and at its peak

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.489 
the board is flat and at its peak
straighten<00:01:01.699> both<00:01:01.850> legs<00:01:01.909> simultaneously

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:02.499 
straighten both legs simultaneously

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:04.780 
straighten both legs simultaneously
keeping<00:01:03.499> pressure<00:01:03.739> on<00:01:03.949> your<00:01:04.040> board<00:01:04.280> until<00:01:04.670> it

keeping pressure on your board until it

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.520 
keeping pressure on your board until it
lands<00:01:06.729> good<00:01:07.729> way<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:07.940> learn<00:01:08.090> it<00:01:08.530> stationary

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
lands good way to learn it stationary

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.219 
lands good way to learn it stationary
you<00:01:10.039> can<00:01:10.189> do<00:01:10.280> it<00:01:10.369> in<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.909> grass<00:01:11.119> or<00:01:11.600> on<00:01:11.630> the

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
you can do it in the grass or on the

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.789 
you can do it in the grass or on the
carpet<00:01:12.649> and<00:01:12.770> you<00:01:14.049> will<00:01:15.049> fall<00:01:15.259> trying<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.680> learn

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
carpet and you will fall trying to learn

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.160 
carpet and you will fall trying to learn
it<00:01:15.979> you<00:01:16.100> know<00:01:16.219> so<00:01:16.460> get<00:01:17.090> comfortable<00:01:17.689> doing<00:01:17.869> it

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
it you know so get comfortable doing it

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.779 
it you know so get comfortable doing it
stationary<00:01:18.710> on<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:18.920> rubber<00:01:19.070> grass<00:01:19.369> yeah

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
stationary on the rubber grass yeah

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.279 
stationary on the rubber grass yeah
there's<00:01:19.939> no<00:01:20.060> motion<00:01:20.450> there<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:20.780> when<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.049> land

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
there's no motion there so when you land

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:22.599 
there's no motion there so when you land
you're<00:01:21.439> not<00:01:21.560> going<00:01:21.680> to<00:01:21.740> be<00:01:21.829> shooting<00:01:22.039> out<00:01:22.310> the

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:22.609 
you're not going to be shooting out the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:25.270 
you're not going to be shooting out the
all<00:01:22.880> is<00:01:23.119> all<00:01:23.359> about<00:01:23.600> practice<00:01:24.049> I<00:01:24.229> mean<00:01:24.530> you<00:01:25.130> can

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
all is all about practice I mean you can

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.310 
all is all about practice I mean you can
do<00:01:25.430> it<00:01:25.549> for<00:01:25.880> years<00:01:26.329> and<00:01:26.630> years<00:01:26.810> you<00:01:26.990> can<00:01:27.109> keep

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
do it for years and years you can keep

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.649 
do it for years and years you can keep
improving<00:01:27.469> on<00:01:27.950> it<00:01:28.100> but<00:01:28.250> it's<00:01:28.369> frustrating<00:01:28.659> you

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
improving on it but it's frustrating you

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.149 
improving on it but it's frustrating you
just<00:01:29.810> got<00:01:29.930> to<00:01:30.020> keep<00:01:30.140> at<00:01:30.320> it<00:01:30.350> yeah<00:01:30.859> it's<00:01:31.009> one<00:01:31.130> of

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
just got to keep at it yeah it's one of

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.499 
just got to keep at it yeah it's one of
the<00:01:31.280> hardest<00:01:31.430> tricks<00:01:31.729> to<00:01:31.820> learn<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.180> once<00:01:32.359> you

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
the hardest tricks to learn and once you

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.599 
the hardest tricks to learn and once you
get<00:01:32.689> it<00:01:32.840> you'll<00:01:33.380> be<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:33.740> happy<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:34.219> you<00:01:34.280> use<00:01:34.460> it

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609 
get it you'll be so happy and you use it

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:39.940 
get it you'll be so happy and you use it
in<00:01:34.700> everything<00:01:38.200> make<00:01:39.200> sure<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.469> keep<00:01:39.619> leaning

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
in everything make sure to keep leaning

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.440 
in everything make sure to keep leaning
forward<00:01:40.399> whenever<00:01:40.609> you<00:01:40.789> do<00:01:40.909> an<00:01:41.030> ollie<00:01:41.179> in

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
forward whenever you do an ollie in

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.270 
forward whenever you do an ollie in
motion<00:01:41.869> to<00:01:42.140> prevent<00:01:42.409> landing<00:01:42.799> in<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:42.950> wheelie

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
motion to prevent landing in a wheelie

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.300 
motion to prevent landing in a wheelie
and<00:01:43.429> flying<00:01:43.759> backwards<00:01:45.039> once<00:01:46.039> you<00:01:46.219> have

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
and flying backwards once you have

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.160 
and flying backwards once you have
learned<00:01:46.640> Ollie<00:01:46.820> try<00:01:47.359> it<00:01:47.420> over<00:01:47.780> various
