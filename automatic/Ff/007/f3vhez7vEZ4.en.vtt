 redo another shared folder 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.280

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:01.480
 the 6 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.710
 r of course you put your 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.560
 console you put it you put on 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.510
 a usb key and you put it on the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.210
 right port of your console + put 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.870
 up to date by support and you will see in 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.430
 the hand if your console displays 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.070
 less than 3 72 that is to say you 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.340
 can not there jailbroken and his mark 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.140
 Graco is what is behind other 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.490
 thing 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:35.009
 I might have other cd be a 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.330
 other game there were those ci sees that's that 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.400
 it works by the quinta I put it in 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.229
 here is a demo mode I did not know how to drown 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.240
 what it is I think yes 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.759
 it worked trick when you put 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.479
 in fact if it displays installed pack file 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.979
 his indexes I believe me it's a fish not 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.450
 they do not settle down he tells me that 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.030
 installation error 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.190
 so here is the worst I will do a 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.649

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.380

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.390
