today<00:00:01.199> we're<00:00:01.380> changing<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:01.979> rear<00:00:02.490> latch<00:00:02.550> on<00:00:03.540> a

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
today we're changing a rear latch on a

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.070 
today we're changing a rear latch on a
96<00:00:04.380> Ford<00:00:04.470> Explorer<00:00:05.359> in<00:00:06.359> this<00:00:06.600> step<00:00:06.839> I'm<00:00:06.960> going

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
96 Ford Explorer in this step I'm going

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.839 
96 Ford Explorer in this step I'm going
to<00:00:07.140> demonstrate<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.859> proper<00:00:08.099> procedure<00:00:08.700> for

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
to demonstrate the proper procedure for

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.419 
to demonstrate the proper procedure for
cleaning<00:00:09.420> up<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.750> reassembling<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.710> our

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
cleaning up and reassembling of our

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.459 
cleaning up and reassembling of our
latch<00:00:11.820> mechanism<00:00:12.120> now<00:00:12.870> if<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.019> purchase<00:00:13.349> the

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
latch mechanism now if you purchase the

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.839 
latch mechanism now if you purchase the
new<00:00:13.590> latch<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:14.009> don't<00:00:14.160> necessarily<00:00:14.670> need<00:00:14.790> to

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
new latch you don't necessarily need to

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.060 
new latch you don't necessarily need to
do<00:00:15.089> this<00:00:15.240> step<00:00:15.540> but<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:16.049> got<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> used<00:00:16.529> one<00:00:16.830> just

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
do this step but we got a used one just

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.029 
do this step but we got a used one just
to<00:00:17.580> save<00:00:17.820> some<00:00:18.029> money<00:00:18.150> as<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:19.170> can<00:00:19.320> see<00:00:19.500> inside

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
to save some money as you can see inside

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.580 
to save some money as you can see inside
the<00:00:20.279> mechanism<00:00:20.430> it's<00:00:20.939> all<00:00:21.090> crusty<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.109> nasty

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
the mechanism it's all crusty and nasty

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.380 
the mechanism it's all crusty and nasty
and<00:00:22.710> dirty<00:00:22.859> we're<00:00:23.640> going<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.820> take<00:00:24.000> some<00:00:24.150> brake

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
and dirty we're going to take some brake

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.000 
and dirty we're going to take some brake
clean<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.019> wire<00:00:25.230> brush<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.740> take<00:00:25.859> and

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
clean and a wire brush and take and

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.130 
clean and a wire brush and take and
clean<00:00:26.189> out<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.730> mechanism<00:00:27.269> as<00:00:27.420> good<00:00:27.869> as<00:00:27.990> we

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
clean out the mechanism as good as we

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.320 
clean out the mechanism as good as we
can<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.710> really<00:00:28.980> your<00:00:29.130> one<00:00:29.429> shot<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:30.060> prep

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
can this is really your one shot to prep

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.880 
can this is really your one shot to prep
this<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.750> try<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.929> get<00:00:31.109> as<00:00:31.170> much<00:00:31.349> life<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.769> it

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
this and try to get as much life of it

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.250 
this and try to get as much life of it
out<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.700> as<00:00:32.850> possible<00:00:33.540> we're<00:00:34.050> going<00:00:34.110> to

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
out of it as possible we're going to

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.389 
out of it as possible we're going to
take<00:00:34.350> our<00:00:34.469> brake<00:00:34.649> clean<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.040> spray<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.280> down

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
take our brake clean and spray it down

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:47.380 
take our brake clean and spray it down
inside<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.700> mechanism

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.729 

it's<00:00:48.390> like<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:48.750> we're<00:00:49.230> going<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.440> give<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.680> a

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
it's like so we're going to give it a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.590 
it's like so we're going to give it a
second<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.250> sit<00:00:50.519> and<00:00:50.730> taking<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.329> on<00:00:51.570> that

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
second to sit and taking to on that

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.829 
second to sit and taking to on that
grind<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.559> break<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.370> down<00:00:53.399> once<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.420> let<00:00:54.690> it

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
grind and break it down once we let it

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:57.380 
grind and break it down once we let it
sit<00:00:55.460> we're<00:00:56.460> going<00:00:56.609> to<00:00:56.670> take<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.000> use<00:00:57.089> our<00:00:57.180> wire

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
sit we're going to take and use our wire

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.240 
sit we're going to take and use our wire
brush<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.750> clean<00:00:57.960> up<00:00:58.320> all<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.589> contacts<00:00:59.129> as

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
brush and clean up all the contacts as

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.009 
brush and clean up all the contacts as
good<00:00:59.399> as<00:00:59.519> we<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.149> we're<00:01:00.719> going<00:01:00.839> to<00:01:00.899> use

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
good as we can and we're going to use

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.139 
good as we can and we're going to use
some<00:01:01.229> heavy-duty<00:01:01.500> silicon<00:01:02.219> spray<00:01:02.640> to

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
some heavy-duty silicon spray to

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.450 
some heavy-duty silicon spray to
lubricate<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.659> we're<00:01:04.379> going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.530> wait<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.949> let

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
lubricate it we're going to wait and let

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.420 
lubricate it we're going to wait and let
this<00:01:05.610> break<00:01:05.880> clean<00:01:06.119> totally<00:01:06.450> dry<00:01:06.659> out<00:01:06.840> and

then<00:01:08.430> continue<00:01:08.850> cleaning<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.299> now<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.380> we've

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
then continue cleaning it now that we've

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.039 
then continue cleaning it now that we've
let<00:01:10.649> it<00:01:10.710> sit<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.280> completely<00:01:11.970> dry<00:01:12.360> what<00:01:12.869> we're

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
let it sit and completely dry what we're

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.300 
let it sit and completely dry what we're
going<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.200> do<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.470> take<00:01:13.649> our<00:01:13.799> wire<00:01:13.979> brush<00:01:14.280> and

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
going to do is take our wire brush and

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.700 
going to do is take our wire brush and
clean<00:01:14.580> up<00:01:14.970> as<00:01:15.180> much<00:01:15.539> as<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.780> moving<00:01:16.110> parts<00:01:16.470> as

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
clean up as much as the moving parts as

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:35.680 
clean up as much as the moving parts as
we<00:01:16.920> can

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.090
