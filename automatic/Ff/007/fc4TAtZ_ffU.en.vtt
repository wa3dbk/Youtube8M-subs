00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
different principle of bonding than it

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.279 
different principle of bonding than it
is<00:05:49.720> to<00:05:49.960> enamel<00:05:50.590> but<00:05:51.340> we're<00:05:51.610> able<00:05:52.030> successfully

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
is to enamel but we're able successfully

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.040 
is to enamel but we're able successfully
today<00:05:53.289> to<00:05:53.890> get<00:05:54.039> bonding<00:05:54.640> to<00:05:54.789> this<00:05:54.970> tissue<00:05:55.270> to

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
today to get bonding to this tissue to
