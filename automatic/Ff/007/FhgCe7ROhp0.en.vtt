00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.440
 there is a problem here like I do not 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.719
 ladies with dyed hair from black to 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.320
 light blond and they are now very much 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.240
 damaged 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.130
 Honestly, you need to feed them now. 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.050
 I constantly have this line 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.109

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.820

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.460
 shampoo foams nice has a nice 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.529
 aroma and he is very soft mask gently 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.730
 hair slips through hair instantly 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.890
 become silky 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.140
 but this is not all the difference of this series in 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.850
 that there is still a spray for hair 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.340
 spray it is an indelible conditioner 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.980
 which additionally nourishes the hair and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.500
 after making the hair can be considered 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.300
 very easy the spray itself represents 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.070
 White water has a very convenient 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.620
 sprayer i use sprays of three 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.739
 cases first is after washing your head 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.510
 hair becomes more obedient and it 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.879
 extra food before dry 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.830
 air blow dryer second case put on 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.560
 already gilded hair in the evening for 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.810
 so in the morning after sleeping them immediately easy 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.689
 comb and the third secret way 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.580
 spray on sea hair after 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.110
 each bath so the hair will 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.570
 constantly feed and not 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.070
 I dry out already washed and dried 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.710
 hair now I want to show 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.960
 easy laying for every day with an element 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.580
 weaving before any thermal 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.430
 exposure to hair i always 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.000
 I use a thermoprotectant this is my 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.549
 masthead 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.409
 I have such a tony junior so for 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.350
 order to make our easy styling 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.540
 we wrap all our hair back and 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.479
 separate the small order 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.460
 behind the ear behind the right and left as you 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.470
 it is more convenient for me more comfortable to throw hair and 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.840
 immediately weave from this side after 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.000
 how we did some weaving in 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.649
 each order we begin to add by 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.649
 loose hair strands 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.140
 we are trying to achieve this effect 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.420
 bezel i.e. bezel due to pigtails but 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.080
 while we at the end only you get 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.080
 carelessly 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.950
 and after we sailed a piece of hair 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.099
 from about temple to temple we just 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.720
 do not fly a pigtail to the end no longer fly 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.720
 in her free hide and seek 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.420
 let's get special pretty careless we 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.870
 support hide and seek can not directly 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.790
 fear and pull out very much 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.180
 rags to braid turned 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.540
 maximum air and so now 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.030
 I pin up that is, well, what's the tail 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.470
 get long enough for me not 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.540
 really like when here in this place 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.340
 my hair is so beautiful 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.330
 I wander when they stand 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.680
 firm enough 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.080
 just for this you can use 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.570
 dry shampoo even if you just 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.960
 I washed my hair here such an approach from 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.960
 tiji 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.380
 brought dry shampoo 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.790
 now you need to wait 30 20 seconds and 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.790
 beat in bundles 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.210
 this way we kill two at once 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.430
 hares firstly do not climb hair in 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.260
 eyes second all the same it looks 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.190
 a little more interesting than just 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.560
 loose hair 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.590
 we can leave this braid just 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.570
 so here is hanging in the total mass of hair 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.650
 and can and and secure with pins 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:41.820
 just behind 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:48.730
 that is, remove it back and fix 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:50.710
 in such a way more to me 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.050
 I like it when a pigtail just hangs out 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.910
 and in order for all this magnificence to 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.260
 I didn't break up in half an hour 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.730
 sure to fix varnish 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.920
 I have such a young man there 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.900
 called extreme hall this varnish 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.440
 superstrong fixing nothing exactly 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.440
 will fall apart 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.400
 write surely under what roller 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.230
 hairstyle you would like to see or your 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.960
