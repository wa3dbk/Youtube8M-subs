hours apply it to the horse's leg if you

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.450 
hours apply it to the horse's leg if you
were<00:00:53.020> using<00:00:53.200> the<00:00:53.350> boot<00:00:53.500> to<00:00:53.680> warm<00:00:53.920> up<00:00:54.070> then<00:00:54.340> you

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
were using the boot to warm up then you

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.740 
were using the boot to warm up then you
wouldn't<00:00:54.699> obviously<00:00:55.059> be<00:00:55.180> using<00:00:55.449> the<00:00:55.540> cold

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
wouldn't obviously be using the cold

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.299 
wouldn't obviously be using the cold
pack<00:00:55.960> but<00:00:56.230> in<00:00:56.350> this<00:00:56.470> circumstance<00:00:56.650> we're

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
pack but in this circumstance we're

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.010 
pack but in this circumstance we're
treating<00:00:57.610> it<00:00:57.670> as<00:00:57.820> using<00:00:58.059> it<00:00:58.180> after<00:00:58.390> exercise

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
treating it as using it after exercise

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.189 
treating it as using it after exercise
so<00:00:59.770> we<00:00:59.800> use<00:01:00.010> it<00:01:00.040> with<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.340> cold<00:01:00.550> pack<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:02.020> help

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199
