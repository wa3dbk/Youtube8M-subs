 winter looks like this year and 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.900
 That's why we drive into the winter 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.250
 I intend this beautiful car trailers 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.230
 presented some time ago 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.580
 a certain that and of course 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.199
 I do it for very different reasons 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.820
 Once again, especially in terms of things 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.010
 transport security something else 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.300
 have changed and go 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.010
 Schwuppdiwupp there we have the winter 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.570
 some of you are this way 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.490
 should know grimms fairy tale 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.869
 it says snow yes and around this 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.090
 there is a trailer today he will definitely 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.650
 Made in Germany and indeed in 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.200
 Grossenhain is located near Dresden 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.630
 The name of the company is an abbreviation 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.399
 from the past and fully pronounced punch 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.989
 and her work is always the meantime 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.540
 company theme Germany's market leader 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.460
 in the car trailer construction and rightly so 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.890
 i think i have this hunger im in 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.660
 he bought it today 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.550
 just under 630 euros 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.370
 And the best of the shipment about the house 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.840
 a theme forwarding is free and 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.430
 after a week he was at the door 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.309
 Of course you can also hang in the trailer 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.969
 your obi branch r are too short now 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.859
 the data 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.510
 He is an unchecked trailer with one 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.600
 permissible total weight of 750 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.750
 kilogram payload so what's he going to 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.670
 long can be 6 109 kilograms and 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.680
 he manages to play that inside is the 2 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.240
 meter and 1 in long is the 1 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.530
 meter 8 long and high in 38 cm 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.540
 It is equipped with a support wheel 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.740
 that's really practical and practical 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.080
 I do not want to miss it anymore 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.390
 also in front is the red patented nose 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.030
 This cover is extremely useful 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.439
 from really thick so kind of rubber and when 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.340
 attach for example if the trailer 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.350
 is fully loaded 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.270
 You alone can be slow 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.990
 against driving a car is no scratch 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.520
 and everything is so easy here 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.130
 also always produced again in 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.320
 Germany has big 13 inch wheels 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.200
 So no toys and there must be good 3 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.180
 bar pressure on the trailer is dekra 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.009
 checked and the loading hatch can be 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.579
 again with a patented closure 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.960
 very easy to open and close shows 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.049
 that same soon 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.869
 go here with your thumb press this 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:10.310
 Leave something behind and pick it up 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:13.350
 Now again and this lax there 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.750
 jump back and everything is secured 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.000
 super thing license plate I have to 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.459
 film degraded bracket for this with the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.319
 Application is inclusive nice thing 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.300
 not only for the optics is the 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.670
 circulating reding does the whole thing 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.709
 more stable these are strictly here's 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.600
 no longer have we solved that differently 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.610
 the after that and these hangers here 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.730
 are worth gold you can charge that 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.739
 you hardly believe the fenders are here 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.650
 not plastic but off 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.940
 hot dip galvanized sheet very stable 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.100
 the suspension took over was this 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.200
 Variant a knott quality to yours 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.940
 axle with independent suspension of in 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.220
 bonn is a multi-layer waterproof 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.780
 Nevertheless, I would like glued wooden floor 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.560
 the trailer is not unnecessary to the weather 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.870
 expose 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.180
 He also has one on each corner 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.470
 additional delay point but you can 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.780
 also easily break down again 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.150
 In addition, on the outer walls are such 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.239
 small mini bracket grown and there 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.160
 you can fix the plane 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.610
 battle plate costs in the accessories trade 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.590
 70 euros a borgward tower 52 euro and 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.920
 the- high plan set with a drum and 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.860
 tuned 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.410
 140 euro then suddenly had 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.090
 an anti-theft device that became 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.650
 just put it in and with one 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.720
 small key locked 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.030
 but the whole works only if the 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.769
 trailer attached to the trailer hitch 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.840
 yes, and they were all already 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.280
 important data now it's time to load 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.350
 I would like to show you how resilient 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.450
 the trailer really is 45 of such trees 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.860
 in the background come on it and now 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.600
 so that the board walls do no harm 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.640
 take a simple drill line here 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.260
 for the homemade built to do so 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.260
 you need four pieces completely normal 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.600
 Roof lath 4 x 6 km meters long four 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.840
 treetops 77 about one meter fifty 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.320
 long and two such hot piles 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.060
 help 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.980
 they still have to be shared on 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.989
 best with a flex so it then 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.790
 Four parts are these stack helps 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.500
 you get in the hardware store or on the internet 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.840
 The roof slats will then be in this 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.300
 Pile helps put in and 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.890
 bolted 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.510
 two holes are already available that 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.100
 whole is not put with the 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.800
 wooden floor of the trailer bolted and 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.020
 even the thicker squares are only 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.430
 not more is the frame 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.380
 does not manufacture more people 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.610
 just what you have to pay attention 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.010
 should be the distance between 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.870
 Square timber and wall of charge quietly bit 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.730
 more than too little the higher the wood 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.770
 is stacked the stronger is the 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.780
 pressure on the squares and thus becomes 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.270
 the distance to the board wall automatically 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.280
 less so now that can be loaded 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.930
 of course that starts my friend 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.910
 sorrow then he lived mostly in the 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.290
 forest and this is where his started 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.450
 unbelieveable story 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.610
 trouble has already been the trees 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.650
 like and always the same length pieces 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.940
 sawn so it can be loaded better 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.680
 and also process later 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.240
 is only loaded until halfway 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.990
 and there's everything else 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.290
 be secured 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.420
 just let go if that happened 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.580
 we lie there chains and on it 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.170
 then come the other tribes through the 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.820
 pressure of these logs on the chains 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.130
 The square woods are left and right 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.350
 automatically tightened up a bit and 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.670
 The side panel is not touched instead 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.280
 chains can you also exciting 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.680
 Good take is just as good with shopping 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.290
 the time through now the rest 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.030
 logs on and it was here we 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.340
 I show that for the transport 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.690
 in other places but what zorro so 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.169
 if I'm not careful 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.750
 see here quite great to have peace 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.860
 you made really great because 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.230
 at least a really nice one again 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.480
 drove together for a short time 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.580
 jump another winter and so we secure 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.590
 Today we have this on the back 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.450
 Fixing ironing is quite normal 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.220
 car tow with such a snap 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.780
 locks fastened in the middle 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.240
 he hangs off a page of that 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.680
 Tension offered and here at the 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.350
 drawbar in the strut the 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.810
 span of well attached and then 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.630
 put on the whole really tight and 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.520
 no fear there nothing happens after 100 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.620
 Watts with the ride controls that 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.740
 normal and so secure you can all 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.090
 public roads use that yes 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.440
 it was for today we drive now 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.180
 reject everything back 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.100
 we are very happy with this 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.080
 trailer can only recommend this 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.730
 and one more completely forgotten so full 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.160
 laden is synonymous with no car only with 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.590
 Support bike super balanced the whole thing 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.990
 yes , you have to be fine until next time 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:20.880
 fits as always nicely on the hold 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.880
 ears stiff with chips and look
