00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.204
 Hello, dear friends. Hereís another edition of Na`Vi tactics. This time weíll speak about Overpass. 

00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:24.830
 Of all the new maps, ie Cache, Cobblestone, Na`Vi. And it is great. 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:33.785
 It is a study of how it moved. 

00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:42.682
 The players had only Tec-9 were applied, 1-2 armors, and the minimum amount of nades (only a couple of smokes and flashbangs + Molotov). 

00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:48.029
 It is rather simple. Smokes should be thrown at the Sniper's Nest. 

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:51.267
 It is recommended to throw cocktails behind the yellow barrels. 

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:56.733
 Btw, this time Na`Vi missed as they threw cocktail. However, they showed great individual performance. 

00:00:56.733 --> 00:01:00.186
 Enjoy the video! Thumbs up!
