00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
red I got a new spark plug because I'm

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.969 
red I got a new spark plug because I'm
on<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.189> warehouse<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.930> bought<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.380> racing

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
on the warehouse I bought this racing

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.090 
on the warehouse I bought this racing
spark<00:01:32.310> plug<00:01:32.549> from<00:01:32.850> them<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:34.020> both<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.920> my

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
spark plug from them and on both of my

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.859 
spark plug from them and on both of my
men<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.490> it's<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> exact<00:01:36.150> same<00:01:36.180> problem<00:01:36.600> -

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
men but it's the exact same problem -

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.539 
men but it's the exact same problem -
they<00:01:37.860> both<00:01:38.070> ran<00:01:38.460> for<00:01:39.240> about<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> week<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.549> then

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
they both ran for about a week and then

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.800 
they both ran for about a week and then
like<00:01:42.200> they<00:01:43.460> wouldn't<00:01:44.460> start<00:01:44.880> up<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.509> spark

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
like they wouldn't start up in the spark

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.550 
like they wouldn't start up in the spark
plug<00:01:46.079> he's<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.250> not<00:01:47.850> very<00:01:47.880> good<00:01:48.240> quality<00:01:48.560> but

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
plug he's just not very good quality but

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.160 
plug he's just not very good quality but
yeah<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.000> had<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.270> get<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> new<00:01:51.509> spark

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
yeah and so I had to get a new spark

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.819 
yeah and so I had to get a new spark
plug<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.680> also<00:01:53.420> my<00:01:54.420> spark<00:01:54.990> plug<00:01:55.049> cap<00:01:55.229> right

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
plug and also my spark plug cap right

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.850 
plug and also my spark plug cap right
here<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.689> had<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.780> get<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> new<00:01:58.140> one<00:01:58.290> because<00:01:58.500> my

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
here I had to get a new one because my

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.260 
here I had to get a new one because my
other<00:01:59.040> one<00:01:59.250> got<00:01:59.369> all<00:01:59.490> chewed<00:01:59.790> up<00:01:59.909> on<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
gonna get a smaller sprocket so that'd

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.610 
gonna get a smaller sprocket so that'd
be<00:02:30.540> cool<00:02:30.720> if<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:30.930> guys<00:02:31.050> would<00:02:31.260> leave<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.560> in

better I know I'm gonna be losing like

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.150 
better I know I'm gonna be losing like
my<00:02:36.210> wheelie<00:02:36.600> power<00:02:36.870> from<00:02:37.530> changing<00:02:38.010> it

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
my wheelie power from changing it

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.490 
my wheelie power from changing it
smaller<00:02:38.820> but<00:02:39.450> I'm<00:02:39.570> gonna<00:02:39.690> either<00:02:39.900> go<00:02:40.080> with<00:02:40.290> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
smaller but I'm gonna either go with the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.450 
smaller but I'm gonna either go with the
60<00:02:41.040> or<00:02:41.250> 65<00:02:41.880> too<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:43.080> let<00:02:43.440> me<00:02:43.470> know<00:02:43.800> what<00:02:44.370> you

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
think I should go with and also I'm

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.240 
think I should go with and also I'm
gonna<00:02:51.180> get<00:02:51.360> some<00:02:51.630> new<00:02:51.780> tires<00:02:51.810> some<00:02:52.800> street

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
gonna get some new tires some street

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.330 
gonna get some new tires some street
tires<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:57.080> possibly<00:02:58.080> some<00:02:58.350> 18<00:02:58.740> pound<00:02:58.980> Springs

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
tires and possibly some 18 pound Springs

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.380 
tires and possibly some 18 pound Springs
but<00:03:00.270> we'll<00:03:00.450> see<00:03:00.690> how<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:01.440> runs<00:03:02.070> when<00:03:03.060> I<00:03:03.120> get<00:03:03.300> the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
but we'll see how it runs when I get the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:14.030 
but we'll see how it runs when I get the
