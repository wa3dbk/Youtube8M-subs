we're<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:02.760> going<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.940> blend<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.630> high

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
we're just going to blend this on high

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:13.040 
we're just going to blend this on high
until<00:02:05.040> it's<00:02:05.250> pre<00:02:05.580> smooth<00:02:11.270> as<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.330> can<00:02:12.600> see<00:02:12.810> the
