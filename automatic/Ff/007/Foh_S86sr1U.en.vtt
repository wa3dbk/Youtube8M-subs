00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
co-host and the glove in my opinion

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.830 
co-host and the glove in my opinion
feels<00:00:34.170> very<00:00:34.530> similar<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> 590<00:00:35.790> now<00:00:36.570> the

a<00:00:59.789> pretty<00:01:00.210> easy<00:01:00.539> win<00:01:01.260> but<00:01:02.070> at<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> same<00:01:02.399> time<00:01:02.640> I

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
a pretty easy win but at the same time I

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.860 
a pretty easy win but at the same time I
let<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.059> couple<00:01:03.329> stinkers<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.780> I've

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
let in a couple stinkers that I've

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.660 
let in a couple stinkers that I've
actually<00:01:04.049> taken<00:01:04.530> out<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.890> game<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.339> sorry

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
actually taken out of the game so sorry

00:01:05.670 --> 00:03:09.660 
actually taken out of the game so sorry
about<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.659> can<00:01:06.810> get<00:01:06.900> started

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.700 

so<00:03:10.630> as<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:10.810> can<00:03:10.930> see<00:03:10.990> that<00:03:11.290> wasn't<00:03:11.650> exactly

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
so as you can see that wasn't exactly

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.950 
so as you can see that wasn't exactly
the<00:03:12.040> most<00:03:12.100> challenging<00:03:12.760> win<00:03:12.970> but<00:03:13.360> anytime

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
the most challenging win but anytime

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.540 
the most challenging win but anytime
you're<00:03:14.230> using<00:03:14.290> new<00:03:14.590> pads<00:03:14.860> it's<00:03:15.130> going<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.430> be<00:03:15.520> a

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
you're using new pads it's going to be a

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.430 
you're using new pads it's going to be a
fun<00:03:15.910> time<00:03:16.120> out<00:03:16.300> there<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:17.140> we<00:03:17.230> ended<00:03:17.350> up

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
fun time out there and we ended up

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.960 
fun time out there and we ended up
getting<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.710> W<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:18.250> like<00:03:18.520> I<00:03:18.610> always<00:03:18.760> say

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
getting the W and like I always say

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.790 
getting the W and like I always say
that's<00:03:19.180> what<00:03:19.480> it's<00:03:19.630> about<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.470> looking

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800
