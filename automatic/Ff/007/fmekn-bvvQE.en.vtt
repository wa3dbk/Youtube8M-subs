00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
very end I won't do a whole one because

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.410 
very end I won't do a whole one because
it<00:00:45.180> takes<00:00:45.390> quite<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.719> while<00:00:46.879> this<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.090> end

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.049 
it takes quite a while this is the end
product<00:00:49.039> you<00:00:50.039> then<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:50.640> fold<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.539> over<00:00:53.059> all

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
product you then just fold it over all

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.180 
product you then just fold it over all
the<00:00:54.120> way<00:00:54.329> along<00:00:54.690> just<00:00:55.199> like<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.410> fan<00:00:55.770> when

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
the way along just like a fan when

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.250 
the way along just like a fan when
you're<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> little<00:00:56.489> girl<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.120> give<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.230> a

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
you're a little girl and give it a

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.790 
you're a little girl and give it a
really<00:00:58.680> tight<00:00:58.980> squeeze<00:00:59.960> then<00:01:00.960> what<00:01:01.140> we<00:01:01.289> do<00:01:01.530> is

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
really tight squeeze then what we do is

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.990 
really tight squeeze then what we do is
we<00:01:02.100> bring<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.430> around

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
we bring it around

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.190 
we bring it around
and<00:01:03.170> you<00:01:04.170> need<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:05.060> finish<00:01:06.060> with<00:01:06.810> one

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
and you need to have finish with one

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.649 
and you need to have finish with one
going<00:01:07.470> up<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.770> one<00:01:08.040> going<00:01:08.790> down<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.390> if<00:01:09.479> they

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
going up and one going down and if they

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.920 
going up and one going down and if they
don't<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.380> snip<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:10.920> off<00:01:11.420> okay<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.479> you

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
don't you just snip one off okay so you

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.590 
don't you just snip one off okay so you
can<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.350> see<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:14.090> they<00:01:15.090> join<00:01:15.360> together

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
can just see this they join together

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.620 
can just see this they join together
like<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.500> what<00:01:16.619> I'm<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.070> do<00:01:17.280> is

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
like this so what I'm going to do is

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.390 
like this so what I'm going to do is
just<00:01:18.630> take<00:01:18.900> off<00:01:19.110> some<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.590> edge<00:01:19.920> because

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
just take off some of that edge because

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.310 
just take off some of that edge because
there<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> little<00:01:20.909> bit<00:01:21.119> too<00:01:21.330> much<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.840> there

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
little bit of a deceive just to join the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.620 
little bit of a deceive just to join the
two<00:01:35.130> ends<00:01:35.490> together

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630

need much to hold it at all just join
these<00:01:46.490> two<00:01:46.790> ends<00:01:46.970> together<00:01:48.790> nice<00:01:49.790> and<00:01:50.090> neatly

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360

yeah<00:01:53.360> and<00:01:53.990> we've<00:01:54.140> created<00:01:54.350> a<00:01:55.509> circle<00:01:56.509> now<00:01:56.660> what

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810

so we just need to play with it a little
bit<00:02:00.830> and<00:02:01.400> I<00:02:01.820> find<00:02:02.180> just<00:02:02.420> pushing<00:02:02.840> it<00:02:02.930> in<00:02:03.080> like

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
bit and I find just pushing it in like

bit and I find just pushing it in like
this<00:02:03.670> let's<00:02:04.670> be<00:02:04.940> thusly<00:02:06.159> okay<00:02:07.159> so<00:02:07.220> there's<00:02:07.580> a

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
this let's be thusly okay so there's a

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.170 
this let's be thusly okay so there's a
little<00:02:07.759> trick<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.479> turn<00:02:09.140> it<00:02:09.259> into<00:02:10.150> one<00:02:11.150> of

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
little trick to turn it into one of

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.729 
little trick to turn it into one of
these<00:02:11.890> so<00:02:12.890> all<00:02:13.310> we<00:02:13.580> do<00:02:13.820> is<00:02:14.120> we<00:02:14.840> squeeze<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.320> top

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
these so all we do is we squeeze the top

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:23.860 
these so all we do is we squeeze the top
in<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:17.230> we<00:02:21.220> push<00:02:22.220> down<00:02:22.519> so<00:02:23.360> it's<00:02:23.480> not<00:02:23.630> going<00:02:23.780> to

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
in and we push down so it's not going to

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.240 
in and we push down so it's not going to
do<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:23.989> on<00:02:24.110> my<00:02:24.140> mat<00:02:24.410> I'll<00:02:24.590> just<00:02:24.709> leave<00:02:24.890> my<00:02:25.040> match

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
do it on my mat I'll just leave my match

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.630 
do it on my mat I'll just leave my match
out<00:02:25.459> of<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.640> way<00:02:26.769> need<00:02:27.769> to<00:02:28.010> be<00:02:28.130> nice<00:02:28.340> and

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
out of the way need to be nice and

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.509 
out of the way need to be nice and
smooth<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:29.269> we<00:02:29.989> bring<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.290> in<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:30.739> then<00:02:31.370> we

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
smooth so we bring it in and then we

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.509 
smooth so we bring it in and then we
push<00:02:31.820> down<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:32.510> as<00:02:32.690> you<00:02:32.780> can<00:02:33.019> see<00:02:33.080> this<00:02:33.950> forms

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
push down and as you can see this forms

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.759 
push down and as you can see this forms
a<00:02:34.760> beautiful<00:02:36.940> circle<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:38.600> how<00:02:38.989> do<00:02:39.050> you<00:02:39.590> get

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
that to stick antique you're wondering

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
that to stick antique you're wondering
so<00:02:42.560> what<00:02:42.709> I've<00:02:42.830> done<00:02:43.070> I've<00:02:43.310> used<00:02:43.700> my<00:02:44.950> circle

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
so what I've done I've used my circle

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.910 
so what I've done I've used my circle
punch<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.579> I've<00:02:47.360> cut<00:02:47.570> myself<00:02:47.750> out<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.500> couple

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
punch and I've cut myself out a couple

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.560 
punch and I've cut myself out a couple
of<00:02:49.040> discs<00:02:49.600> and<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.650> first<00:02:51.950> one<00:02:52.220> is<00:02:53.180> going<00:02:53.450> to

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
of discs and the first one is going to

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.979 
of discs and the first one is going to
go<00:02:53.900> on<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.739> back<00:02:54.950> so<00:02:55.400> it's<00:02:56.030> not<00:02:56.180> going<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.810> line

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
go on the back so it's not going to line

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.620 
go on the back so it's not going to line
up<00:02:57.019> necessarily<00:02:57.890> perfectly<00:02:58.430> because<00:02:59.390> it<00:02:59.510> is

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
up necessarily perfectly because it is

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.580 
up necessarily perfectly because it is
going<00:02:59.900> on<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.290> back<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:01.720> it's<00:03:02.720> not<00:03:03.079> going<00:03:03.410> to

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
going on the back so it's not going to

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.250 
going on the back so it's not going to
be<00:03:03.709> seen<00:03:03.980> so<00:03:04.220> all<00:03:04.880> we<00:03:05.030> do<00:03:05.209> is<00:03:05.450> we<00:03:05.600> come<00:03:05.810> directly

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
be seen so all we do is we come directly

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.060 
be seen so all we do is we come directly
over<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.739> top<00:03:06.769> and<00:03:07.220> we<00:03:07.970> push<00:03:08.360> down<00:03:09.040> onto<00:03:10.040> it

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
over the top and we push down onto it

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.449 
over the top and we push down onto it
and<00:03:10.930> hold<00:03:11.930> it<00:03:12.049> nice<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.260> still<00:03:12.769> just<00:03:13.040> pressing

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
and hold it nice and still just pressing

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.150 
and hold it nice and still just pressing
down<00:03:13.489> and<00:03:14.030> then<00:03:14.989> I've<00:03:15.110> made<00:03:15.320> a<00:03:15.380> second<00:03:15.920> disc

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
down and then I've made a second disc

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.250 
down and then I've made a second disc
which<00:03:16.610> I've<00:03:16.820> put<00:03:17.090> some<00:03:17.299> precision<00:03:18.079> point

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
which I've put some precision point

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.699 
which I've put some precision point
adhesive<00:03:18.769> on<00:03:18.920> pop<00:03:19.880> that<00:03:20.120> on<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.390> top<00:03:20.630> and<00:03:20.959> I'm

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
adhesive on pop that on the top and I'm

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.620 
adhesive on pop that on the top and I'm
lining<00:03:21.980> it<00:03:22.250> up<00:03:22.310> a<00:03:22.549> lot<00:03:22.790> more<00:03:23.030> carefully

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
lining it up a lot more carefully

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.449 
lining it up a lot more carefully
because<00:03:23.780> that's<00:03:24.110> going<00:03:24.380> to<00:03:24.500> be<00:03:24.590> in<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:25.010> center

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
because that's going to be in the center

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.140 
because that's going to be in the center
and<00:03:25.610> that's<00:03:25.700> going<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.150> be<00:03:26.269> on<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.510> front<00:03:26.810> and

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
and that's going to be on the front and

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.300 
and that's going to be on the front and
then<00:03:29.150> I'm<00:03:29.329> also<00:03:29.600> going<00:03:30.019> to<00:03:30.140> add<00:03:30.410> a<00:03:30.829> lovely

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
then I'm also going to add a lovely

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.750 
then I'm also going to add a lovely
cheerful<00:03:31.940> button<00:03:32.920> just<00:03:33.920> to<00:03:34.070> hide<00:03:34.250> that<00:03:34.549> disc

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
cheerful button just to hide that disc

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.339 
cheerful button just to hide that disc
and<00:03:37.760> it<00:03:37.849> does<00:03:38.120> want<00:03:38.420> to<00:03:38.569> move<00:03:38.780> until<00:03:39.200> it's

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
and it does want to move until it's

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.770 
and it does want to move until it's
stuck<00:03:39.739> nice<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:40.579> firmly<00:03:40.849> it<00:03:41.209> will<00:03:41.420> want<00:03:41.689> to

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
stuck nice and firmly it will want to

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.699 
stuck nice and firmly it will want to
move<00:03:42.159> and<00:03:43.159> so<00:03:44.060> I'm<00:03:44.180> going<00:03:44.390> to<00:03:44.450> place<00:03:44.780> a<00:03:45.140> punch

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
move and so I'm going to place a punch

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.890 
move and so I'm going to place a punch
on<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:45.950> top<00:03:46.220> of<00:03:46.370> that<00:03:46.549> just<00:03:47.329> put<00:03:47.510> it<00:03:47.599> to<00:03:47.750> one

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
on the top of that just put it to one

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.690 
on the top of that just put it to one
side<00:03:47.959> to<00:03:48.439> dry<00:03:48.709> and<00:03:49.989> I'll<00:03:50.989> just<00:03:51.200> explain<00:03:51.620> how<00:03:52.370> I

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
side to dry and I'll just explain how I

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.250 
side to dry and I'll just explain how I
did<00:03:53.829> so<00:03:54.829> this<00:03:54.980> was<00:03:55.189> just<00:03:55.459> a<00:03:56.209> one-inch<00:03:56.840> square

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
did so this was just a one-inch square

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.610 
did so this was just a one-inch square
and<00:03:57.560> it<00:03:58.400> makes<00:03:58.640> this<00:03:58.970> size<00:03:59.239> this<00:04:00.170> is<00:04:00.230> our

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
and it makes this size this is our

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.300 
and it makes this size this is our
ribbon<00:04:01.129> so<00:04:01.519> I've<00:04:01.670> used<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:02.299> ribbon<00:04:02.659> from<00:04:03.310> one

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
ribbon so I've used the ribbon from one

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.339 
ribbon so I've used the ribbon from one
of<00:04:04.430> our<00:04:04.519> pallets<00:04:05.000> says<00:04:05.299> delight<00:04:05.629> palette<00:04:06.079> and

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
of our pallets says delight palette and

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.920 
of our pallets says delight palette and
it<00:04:07.040> was<00:04:07.159> just<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:07.549> widest<00:04:08.060> ribbon<00:04:08.480> so<00:04:08.780> that

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
it was just the widest ribbon so that

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.800 
it was just the widest ribbon so that
makes<00:04:09.139> beautiful<00:04:09.769> flowers<00:04:10.400> as<00:04:10.549> well

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
makes beautiful flowers as well

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.879 
makes beautiful flowers as well
decorated<00:04:11.810> with<00:04:11.900> a<00:04:11.959> flower<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.470> a<00:04:12.560> little<00:04:12.769> bit

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
decorated with a flower and a little bit

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:17.490 
decorated with a flower and a little bit
of<00:04:13.010> bling<00:04:13.280> and<00:04:13.900> then<00:04:14.900> this<00:04:15.170> one<00:04:15.440> is<00:04:15.560> actually<00:04:15.739> a

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
of bling and then this one is actually a

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.949 
of bling and then this one is actually a
variation<00:04:18.500> on<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:18.680> same<00:04:18.889> thing<00:04:19.280> so<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.720> rule

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
variation on the same thing so the rule

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.430 
variation on the same thing so the rule
of<00:04:21.169> thumb<00:04:21.410> is<00:04:21.470> for<00:04:21.859> every<00:04:22.310> inch<00:04:22.639> wide<00:04:23.449> you<00:04:24.289> need

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
of thumb is for every inch wide you need

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.879 
of thumb is for every inch wide you need
30<00:04:24.800> centimeters<00:04:25.760> long<00:04:26.030> so<00:04:26.750> in<00:04:26.900> this<00:04:27.139> case<00:04:27.530> I

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
30 centimeters long so in this case I

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.850 
30 centimeters long so in this case I
wanted<00:04:28.520> a<00:04:28.789> 1-inch<00:04:29.750> piece<00:04:30.080> which<00:04:30.440> was<00:04:30.560> 30

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
wanted a 1-inch piece which was 30

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.909 
wanted a 1-inch piece which was 30
centimeters<00:04:31.580> long<00:04:31.789> a<00:04:32.169> chewing<00:04:33.169> of<00:04:33.380> one<00:04:33.740> and<00:04:33.889> a

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
centimeters long a chewing of one and a

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.420 
centimeters long a chewing of one and a
half<00:04:33.949> inch<00:04:34.430> which<00:04:34.729> was<00:04:35.199> 45<00:04:36.250> centimeters<00:04:37.250> and

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
half inch which was 45 centimeters and

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.629 
half inch which was 45 centimeters and
then<00:04:38.150> a<00:04:38.210> two<00:04:38.539> inch<00:04:38.750> which<00:04:39.139> was<00:04:39.380> 60<00:04:40.070> centimeters

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
then a two inch which was 60 centimeters

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.850 
then a two inch which was 60 centimeters
long<00:04:40.820> now<00:04:41.419> what<00:04:41.599> that<00:04:41.630> meant<00:04:42.050> is<00:04:42.289> I<00:04:42.410> needed<00:04:42.710> to

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
long now what that meant is I needed to

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.920 
long now what that meant is I needed to
make<00:04:42.979> the<00:04:43.130> 60<00:04:43.580> centimeter<00:04:44.060> long<00:04:44.300> one<00:04:44.510> for<00:04:44.750> all

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
make the 60 centimeter long one for all

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:45.640 
make the 60 centimeter long one for all
three

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
three

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.180 
three
I<00:04:45.680> then<00:04:46.780> constituted<00:04:47.780> them<00:04:47.930> up<00:04:48.080> I<00:04:48.349> glued<00:04:48.919> them

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
I then constituted them up I glued them

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.790 
I then constituted them up I glued them
down<00:04:49.490> and<00:04:49.760> then<00:04:50.060> I<00:04:50.090> formed<00:04:50.599> the<00:04:50.720> rosette<00:04:51.199> so

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
down and then I formed the rosette so

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.070 
down and then I formed the rosette so
they<00:04:51.919> are<00:04:52.099> actually<00:04:52.669> all<00:04:53.150> stuck<00:04:53.599> on<00:04:53.720> top<00:04:53.900> of

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
they are actually all stuck on top of

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.920 
they are actually all stuck on top of
each<00:04:54.199> other<00:04:54.440> so<00:04:54.650> that<00:04:55.039> why<00:04:55.699> do<00:04:55.760> you<00:04:55.940> get<00:04:56.270> the

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
each other so that why do you get the

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.800 
each other so that why do you get the
longer<00:04:57.409> you<00:04:57.530> get<00:04:57.740> so<00:04:58.130> 30<00:04:58.940> centimeters<00:04:59.599> long

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
longer you get so 30 centimeters long

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.070 
longer you get so 30 centimeters long
for<00:05:00.050> one<00:05:00.199> inch<00:05:00.490> 45<00:05:01.490> centimeters<00:05:02.210> long<00:05:02.449> for<00:05:02.930> a

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
for one inch 45 centimeters long for a

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.770 
for one inch 45 centimeters long for a
one<00:05:03.320> and<00:05:03.440> a<00:05:03.500> half<00:05:03.530> inch<00:05:04.010> 60<00:05:05.000> centimeters<00:05:05.570> long

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
one and a half inch 60 centimeters long

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.159 
one and a half inch 60 centimeters long
for<00:05:06.289> a<00:05:06.320> two<00:05:06.590> inch<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.130> that's<00:05:08.000> it<00:05:08.210> very<00:05:08.510> easy

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
for a two inch and that's it very easy

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.740 
for a two inch and that's it very easy
to<00:05:09.500> make<00:05:09.680> and<00:05:10.010> I<00:05:10.909> hope<00:05:11.150> you<00:05:11.419> enjoyed<00:05:11.720> that

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
to make and I hope you enjoyed that

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.919 
to make and I hope you enjoyed that
