going<00:00:47.239> through<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.600> process<00:00:48.110> you<00:00:48.739> need<00:00:48.830> to

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920

that's<00:00:51.620> a<00:00:51.680> bit<00:00:51.830> of<00:00:51.890> a<00:00:51.949> messy<00:00:52.160> job

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
that's a bit of a messy job

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.890 
that's a bit of a messy job
hence<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.239> latex<00:00:53.690> gloves<00:00:54.110> and<00:00:54.320> lots<00:00:54.949> of<00:00:55.070> paper

hence the latex gloves and lots of paper

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.020 
hence the latex gloves and lots of paper
we<00:00:56.900> give<00:00:57.080> this<00:00:57.170> a<00:00:57.229> good<00:00:57.680> clean-out<00:00:58.370> because<00:00:58.879> we

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
we give this a good clean-out because we

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.789 
we give this a good clean-out because we
can<00:00:59.180> put<00:00:59.299> some<00:00:59.510> spare<00:00:59.900> grease<00:01:00.199> in<00:01:00.440> there<00:01:00.650> just

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:00.799 
can put some spare grease in there just

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.390 
can put some spare grease in there just
in<00:01:00.979> case<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:01.400> roadside<00:01:01.850> emergencies<00:01:03.400> okay

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
in case the roadside emergencies okay

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.399 
in case the roadside emergencies okay
and<00:01:04.580> then<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:04.820> clamp<00:01:05.059> itself<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:05.960> it's

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
and then the clamp itself and it's

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.350 
and then the clamp itself and it's
really<00:01:06.830> important<00:01:07.400> to<00:01:07.490> make<00:01:07.729> sure<00:01:08.060> again

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
really important to make sure again

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.140 
really important to make sure again
we're<00:01:08.659> relatively<00:01:09.080> lucky<00:01:09.320> here<00:01:09.650> that<00:01:09.799> the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
we're relatively lucky here that the

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.570 
we're relatively lucky here that the
allen<00:01:11.150> key<00:01:12.140> portion<00:01:12.710> there<00:01:12.920> is<00:01:12.950> nice<00:01:13.340> and

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
allen key portion there is nice and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.370 
allen key portion there is nice and
clear<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.090> do<00:01:14.150> you<00:01:14.270> get<00:01:14.420> no<00:01:14.570> slippage<00:01:14.990> in<00:01:15.170> there

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
clear so do you get no slippage in there

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.840 
clear so do you get no slippage in there
but<00:01:15.799> you're<00:01:15.890> just<00:01:16.130> looking<00:01:16.400> to<00:01:16.520> get<00:01:16.610> rid<00:01:16.820> of

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
but you're just looking to get rid of

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.330 
but you're just looking to get rid of

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
grime now as we saw when we took this

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.090 
grime now as we saw when we took this
bearing<00:01:25.580> off<00:01:25.700> it's<00:01:25.880> in<00:01:26.060> very<00:01:26.330> good<00:01:26.480> condition

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
bearing off it's in very good condition

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.430 
bearing off it's in very good condition
we<00:01:28.100> don't<00:01:28.520> need<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:29.120> repack<00:01:29.600> this<00:01:29.900> with<00:01:30.140> grease

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
we don't need to repack this with grease

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.010 
we don't need to repack this with grease
we<00:01:31.010> just<00:01:31.340> make<00:01:31.520> sure<00:01:31.760> there's<00:01:32.060> no<00:01:32.300> dust<00:01:32.690> on

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.080 
we just make sure there's no dust on
there<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:33.890> we<00:01:34.130> can<00:01:34.280> just<00:01:34.310> literally<00:01:34.880> apply

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
there and we can just literally apply

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.050 
there and we can just literally apply
some<00:01:35.360> fresh<00:01:35.630> grease<00:01:35.930> on<00:01:36.170> there<00:01:36.410> now<00:01:37.010> if<00:01:37.400> this

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
some fresh grease on there now if this

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.810 
some fresh grease on there now if this
grease<00:01:38.390> was<00:01:38.630> very<00:01:38.870> old<00:01:39.230> and<00:01:39.560> very<00:01:39.650> sticky<00:01:40.370> and

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
grease was very old and very sticky and

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.640 
grease was very old and very sticky and
then<00:01:41.030> look<00:01:41.210> it's<00:01:41.510> very<00:01:41.840> obvious<00:01:42.230> when<00:01:42.380> grease

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
then look it's very obvious when grease

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.800 
then look it's very obvious when grease
is<00:01:42.830> old<00:01:43.070> we<00:01:43.730> would<00:01:43.880> use<00:01:44.030> some<00:01:44.240> brake<00:01:44.480> cleaner

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
is old we would use some brake cleaner

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.780 
is old we would use some brake cleaner
on<00:01:45.050> there<00:01:45.230> maybe<00:01:45.590> an<00:01:45.740> old<00:01:45.890> toothbrush<00:01:46.520> and

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
on there maybe an old toothbrush and

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.640 
on there maybe an old toothbrush and
literally<00:01:47.510> get<00:01:47.660> rid<00:01:47.690> of<00:01:47.870> all<00:01:48.020> that<00:01:48.050> old<00:01:48.200> grease

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
literally get rid of all that old grease

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.190 
literally get rid of all that old grease
but<00:01:49.310> what<00:01:49.460> I'm<00:01:49.580> just<00:01:49.760> about<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.120> do<00:01:50.420> is<00:01:50.570> what

up<00:02:15.140> nice<00:02:15.760> okay<00:02:16.760> with<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.090> hub<00:02:17.239> carrier<00:02:17.599> itself

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
up nice okay with the hub carrier itself

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.570 
up nice okay with the hub carrier itself
remember<00:02:18.290> we've<00:02:18.620> already<00:02:18.860> inspected<00:02:19.310> the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
remember we've already inspected the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.970 
remember we've already inspected the
bearing<00:02:19.970> Racing's<00:02:20.500> everything<00:02:21.500> is<00:02:21.680> looking

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
bearing Racing's everything is looking

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.009 
bearing Racing's everything is looking
really<00:02:22.129> good<00:02:22.250> here<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:23.299> we<00:02:23.450> just<00:02:23.659> give<00:02:23.840> this<00:02:23.959> a

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
really good here so we just give this a

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.309 
really good here so we just give this a
clean<00:02:24.790> now<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:25.849> may<00:02:26.239> find<00:02:26.599> that<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.110> grease

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
clean now you may find that the grease

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.930 
clean now you may find that the grease
in<00:02:27.590> here<00:02:27.620> is<00:02:28.099> very<00:02:28.610> dry<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.300> very

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
in here is very dry and very

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.610 
in here is very dry and very
and<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.570> might<00:02:30.780> need<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:31.020> spend<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.500> little

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
and you might need to spend a little

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.610 
and you might need to spend a little
more<00:02:31.770> time<00:02:32.160> cleaning<00:02:32.520> that<00:02:32.850> out<00:02:33.380> but<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.410> can

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
more time cleaning that out but you can

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.290 
more time cleaning that out but you can
see<00:02:34.800> right<00:02:35.070> inside<00:02:35.250> there<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.850> actually<00:02:36.270> a

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
see right inside there is actually a

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.250 
see right inside there is actually a
hollow<00:02:36.570> in<00:02:36.690> there

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
hollow in there

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.440 
hollow in there
and<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.680> don't<00:02:37.770> like<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.190> be<00:02:38.310> too<00:02:38.460> stingy<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:39.270> like

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
and I don't like to be too stingy I like

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.390 
and I don't like to be too stingy I like
to<00:02:39.570> put<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.780> good<00:02:40.200> dollop<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.740> grease<00:02:40.920> in<00:02:40.950> there

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
to put a good dollop of grease in there

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.390 
to put a good dollop of grease in there
so<00:02:41.610> with<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.880> just<00:02:42.120> campers<00:02:42.500> grease<00:02:43.500> pot<00:02:43.800> we

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
so with the just campers grease pot we

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.250 
so with the just campers grease pot we
push<00:02:44.670> down<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.150> outside<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:45.810> we<00:02:45.900> get<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.050> nice

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
push down the outside and we get a nice

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.440 
push down the outside and we get a nice
big<00:02:46.500> lump<00:02:46.740> of<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.040> just<00:02:47.670> put<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:47.880> in<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.420> then

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
big lump of it just put it in and then

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.320 
big lump of it just put it in and then
smear<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.590> all<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:50.820> way<00:02:50.910> around<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.300> inside

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
smear it all the way around the inside

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.320 
smear it all the way around the inside
case<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.410> then<00:02:53.370> finally<00:02:53.820> we<00:02:53.940> make<00:02:54.120> sure

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
case and then finally we make sure

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.910 
case and then finally we make sure
there's<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.630> good<00:02:54.810> application<00:02:54.960> of<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.680> on<00:02:55.800> the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
there's a good application of it on the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.310 
there's a good application of it on the
bearing<00:02:56.310> races<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.180> is<00:02:57.360> absolutely

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
bearing races and it is absolutely

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.500 
bearing races and it is absolutely
crucial<00:02:59.010> at<00:02:59.430> this<00:02:59.460> point<00:02:59.880> that<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.180> don't<00:03:00.330> get

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
crucial at this point that you don't get

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.270 
crucial at this point that you don't get
any<00:03:00.780> dirt<00:03:00.870> or<00:03:01.350> any<00:03:01.800> grit<00:03:02.100> in<00:03:02.250> there<00:03:04.130> so<00:03:05.130> when

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
any dirt or any grit in there so when

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.950 
any dirt or any grit in there so when
you<00:03:05.340> put<00:03:05.490> it<00:03:05.610> back<00:03:05.730> down<00:03:05.970> cover<00:03:06.480> up<00:03:06.630> with<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.840> bit

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
you put it back down cover up with a bit

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.600 
you put it back down cover up with a bit
of<00:03:07.050> paper<00:03:07.410> don't<00:03:07.590> do<00:03:07.800> it<00:03:07.860> on<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.040> windy<00:03:08.340> day<00:03:08.460> on<00:03:08.490> a

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.610 
of paper don't do it on a windy day on a
sandy<00:03:09.060> Drive<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.750> like<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:10.080> put<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.260> good

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
sandy Drive and I like to put a good

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.040 
sandy Drive and I like to put a good
dollop<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.190> grease<00:03:11.370> inside<00:03:12.180> my<00:03:12.450> dust<00:03:12.780> cover

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
dollop of grease inside my dust cover

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.250 
dollop of grease inside my dust cover
here<00:03:13.970> just<00:03:14.970> for<00:03:15.150> emergencies<00:03:15.360> don't<00:03:15.930> put<00:03:16.110> too

here just for emergencies don't put too
much<00:03:16.440> in<00:03:16.650> there<00:03:16.830> as<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:17.010> might<00:03:17.340> find<00:03:17.640> it

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
much in there as you might find it

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.340 
much in there as you might find it
difficult<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.360> put<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.660> cap<00:03:18.930> back<00:03:19.140> on

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
difficult to put the cap back on

difficult to put the cap back on
especially<00:03:19.770> on<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.490> other<00:03:21.180> side<00:03:21.510> where<00:03:21.810> you

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
especially on the other side where you

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.080 
especially on the other side where you

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
haven't got the little hole so all of

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.260 
haven't got the little hole so all of
our<00:03:24.240> parts<00:03:24.600> now<00:03:24.840> are<00:03:25.080> scrupulously<00:03:26.070> clean<00:03:26.460> one

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
our parts now are scrupulously clean one

our parts now are scrupulously clean one
final<00:03:27.750> thing<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:28.110> grease<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:29.190> we're<00:03:29.370> going<00:03:29.490> to

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
final thing to grease and we're going to

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.120 
final thing to grease and we're going to
put<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:29.760> smear<00:03:30.300> fresh<00:03:31.080> grease<00:03:31.410> all<00:03:31.740> the<00:03:32.040> way

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
put a smear fresh grease all the way

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.910 
put a smear fresh grease all the way
over<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.430> spindle<00:03:32.730> here<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.650> that<00:03:34.650> should

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
over the spindle here and that should

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.580 
over the spindle here and that should
help<00:03:35.100> us<00:03:35.340> slide<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.930> hub<00:03:36.930> on

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
help us slide the hub on

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.010 
help us slide the hub on
our<00:03:39.010> hope<00:03:39.310> here<00:03:39.580> we<00:03:39.760> know<00:03:40.000> that<00:03:40.030> our<00:03:40.239> outs<00:03:40.780> of

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
our hope here we know that our outs of

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.050 
our hope here we know that our outs of
bearings<00:03:41.530> are<00:03:41.680> in<00:03:41.770> excellent<00:03:42.160> condition<00:03:42.310> and

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
bearings are in excellent condition and

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.089 
bearings are in excellent condition and
we've<00:03:43.780> had<00:03:43.959> a<00:03:43.989> look<00:03:44.170> in<00:03:44.349> there<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:44.709> we<00:03:44.770> can<00:03:44.800> see

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
we've had a look in there and we can see

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.729 
we've had a look in there and we can see
this<00:03:45.250> is<00:03:45.430> new<00:03:45.640> and<00:03:45.970> again<00:03:46.270> the<00:03:46.870> grease<00:03:47.140> seal<00:03:47.440> is

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
this is new and again the grease seal is

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.070 
this is new and again the grease seal is
new<00:03:48.310> on<00:03:48.489> there<00:03:48.670> as<00:03:48.819> well<00:03:49.060> so<00:03:49.300> we're<00:03:49.630> all<00:03:49.720> okay

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
new on there as well so we're all okay

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.300 
new on there as well so we're all okay
with<00:03:50.200> it<00:03:50.319> you<00:03:50.380> can<00:03:50.470> probably<00:03:50.590> also<00:03:51.040> see<00:03:51.220> all

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
with it you can probably also see all

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.830 
with it you can probably also see all
that<00:03:51.430> fresh<00:03:51.700> grease<00:03:51.970> that<00:03:52.000> we<00:03:52.239> packed<00:03:52.480> in<00:03:52.660> from

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
that fresh grease that we packed in from

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.500 
that fresh grease that we packed in from
the<00:03:52.959> other<00:03:53.050> side<00:03:53.790> so<00:03:54.790> simply<00:03:55.599> a<00:03:55.630> case<00:03:55.900> of

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
the other side so simply a case of

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.110 
the other side so simply a case of
sliding<00:03:58.510> this<00:03:58.660> on<00:03:58.900> nice<00:03:59.410> and<00:03:59.650> gently<00:04:00.090> with<00:04:01.090> a

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
sliding this on nice and gently with a

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.190 
sliding this on nice and gently with a
little<00:04:01.450> wiggle<00:04:01.780> and<00:04:02.880> then<00:04:03.880> picking<00:04:04.120> up<00:04:04.390> the

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
little wiggle and then picking up the

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.630 
little wiggle and then picking up the
outer<00:04:05.380> bearing<00:04:06.069> the<00:04:06.489> cleaned<00:04:06.970> up<00:04:08.489> spacer<00:04:09.489> on

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
outer bearing the cleaned up spacer on

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.660 
outer bearing the cleaned up spacer on
there<00:04:09.880> and<00:04:10.090> also<00:04:10.569> take<00:04:10.959> note<00:04:11.200> of<00:04:11.410> that<00:04:11.860> little

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
there and also take note of that little

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.430 
there and also take note of that little
slot<00:04:12.910> on<00:04:13.180> there<00:04:13.390> because<00:04:13.690> that<00:04:13.840> will<00:04:14.049> only<00:04:14.080> go

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
slot on there because that will only go

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.400 
slot on there because that will only go
on<00:04:14.470> in<00:04:14.769> one<00:04:14.950> way<00:04:17.220> okay<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:19.079> we've<00:04:20.079> pretty<00:04:20.320> much

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
on in one way okay and we've pretty much

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.530 
on in one way okay and we've pretty much
all<00:04:21.100> done<00:04:21.489> they're<00:04:21.790> just<00:04:22.090> ready<00:04:22.270> for<00:04:22.330> the

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
all done they're just ready for the

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.440 
all done they're just ready for the
retaining<00:04:22.870> nut<00:04:23.050> I<00:04:23.610> think<00:04:24.610> we'll<00:04:24.760> just<00:04:25.180> make

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
retaining nut I think we'll just make

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.300 
retaining nut I think we'll just make
sure<00:04:25.479> there's<00:04:25.990> plenty<00:04:26.050> of<00:04:26.440> grease<00:04:26.770> in<00:04:26.800> there

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
sure there's plenty of grease in there

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.340 
sure there's plenty of grease in there
and<00:04:27.900> then<00:04:28.950> it's<00:04:29.950> just<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.340> case<00:04:30.580> of<00:04:31.080> picking<00:04:32.080> up

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
and then it's just a case of picking up

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
and then it's just a case of picking up
our<00:04:32.560> retaining<00:04:32.950> nut<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:35.160> remembering<00:04:36.160> which

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
our retaining nut and remembering which

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.170 
our retaining nut and remembering which
side<00:04:36.700> you're<00:04:36.970> on<00:04:38.250> as<00:04:39.250> to<00:04:39.460> which<00:04:39.639> way<00:04:39.850> up<00:04:40.000> it

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
side you're on as to which way up it

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.980 
side you're on as to which way up it
does<00:04:40.419> up<00:04:41.789> you'll<00:04:42.789> notice<00:04:43.270> that<00:04:43.510> it's<00:04:43.720> the

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
does up you'll notice that it's the

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.990 
does up you'll notice that it's the
wrong<00:04:44.410> way<00:04:44.590> round<00:04:44.620> to<00:04:45.039> what<00:04:45.190> we<00:04:45.340> used<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.700> hear

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
wrong way round to what we used to hear

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.140 
wrong way round to what we used to hear
so<00:04:46.300> it's<00:04:46.570> anti-clockwise<00:04:47.229> to<00:04:47.740> do<00:04:47.890> it<00:04:48.039> up<00:04:48.160> use

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
so it's anti-clockwise to do it up use

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.090 
so it's anti-clockwise to do it up use
our<00:04:49.360> adjustable<00:04:49.870> spanner<00:04:50.610> to<00:04:51.610> nip<00:04:52.270> it<00:04:52.450> up<00:04:53.100> and

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
our adjustable spanner to nip it up and

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.100 
our adjustable spanner to nip it up and
what<00:04:54.700> you<00:04:54.789> want<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.000> do<00:04:55.180> is<00:04:55.330> do<00:04:55.510> it<00:04:55.539> so<00:04:55.900> that

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
what you want to do is do it so that

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.170 
what you want to do is do it so that
it's<00:04:56.289> pretty<00:04:56.800> darn<00:04:57.190> tight<00:04:57.490> not<00:04:57.700> as<00:04:57.820> tight<00:04:58.000> as

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
it's pretty darn tight not as tight as

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.900 
it's pretty darn tight not as tight as
you<00:04:58.240> can<00:04:58.450> go<00:04:58.630> and<00:04:58.900> then<00:04:59.590> back<00:04:59.890> a<00:05:00.250> little<00:05:00.610> bit

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
you can go and then back a little bit

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.020 
you can go and then back a little bit
and<00:05:01.300> then<00:05:01.990> it's<00:05:02.140> ready<00:05:02.410> to<00:05:02.680> tighten<00:05:03.130> up<00:05:03.400> now

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
and then it's ready to tighten up now

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.940 
and then it's ready to tighten up now
when<00:05:04.240> we<00:05:04.390> have<00:05:04.539> either<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:05.140> disc<00:05:05.380> on<00:05:05.590> there<00:05:05.800> or

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
when we have either the disc on there or

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.550 
when we have either the disc on there or
the<00:05:06.070> wheel<00:05:06.280> we<00:05:06.820> can<00:05:06.850> just<00:05:07.240> check<00:05:07.539> it<00:05:07.810> for<00:05:08.380> the

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
the wheel we can just check it for the

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.200 
the wheel we can just check it for the
rock<00:05:08.710> and<00:05:08.950> we<00:05:09.010> want<00:05:09.220> a<00:05:09.340> tiny<00:05:09.669> almost

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
rock and we want a tiny almost

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.120 
rock and we want a tiny almost
impossible<00:05:10.990> amount<00:05:11.320> of<00:05:11.470> play<00:05:11.770> but<00:05:11.830> we

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
impossible amount of play but we

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
impossible amount of play but we
certainly<00:05:12.340> don't<00:05:12.610> want<00:05:12.729> it

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
certainly don't want it

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.120 
certainly don't want it
banging<00:05:13.600> backwards<00:05:13.930> on<00:05:14.020> forwards<00:05:14.470> but

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
banging backwards on forwards but

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.659 
banging backwards on forwards but
already<00:05:15.280> now<00:05:15.669> just<00:05:16.450> to<00:05:16.600> nip<00:05:16.780> up<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.620> allen<00:05:17.919> key

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:26.279 

and<00:05:22.680> one<00:05:23.680> final<00:05:24.070> bit<00:05:24.340> now<00:05:24.580> so<00:05:24.880> we<00:05:25.150> can<00:05:25.330> now<00:05:25.539> push

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
and one final bit now so we can now push

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.529 
and one final bit now so we can now push
our<00:05:26.590> speedo<00:05:26.919> cable<00:05:27.070> through<00:05:27.729> so<00:05:27.940> take<00:05:28.120> a<00:05:28.150> firm

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
our speedo cable through so take a firm

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.420 
our speedo cable through so take a firm
grip<00:05:28.780> from<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.169> backside<00:05:29.860> of<00:05:29.889> the<00:05:30.100> backing

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
grip from the backside of the backing

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.610 
grip from the backside of the backing
plate<00:05:30.639> push<00:05:30.970> it<00:05:31.180> through<00:05:31.389> and<00:05:32.020> I<00:05:32.139> like<00:05:32.320> to<00:05:32.440> push

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
plate push it through and I like to push

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.219 
plate push it through and I like to push
it<00:05:32.800> just<00:05:32.830> slightly<00:05:33.310> too<00:05:33.700> far<00:05:34.120> just<00:05:34.840> make<00:05:35.050> sure

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
it just slightly too far just make sure

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.980 
it just slightly too far just make sure
there's<00:05:35.440> nothing<00:05:35.710> on<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:35.979> end<00:05:36.130> there<00:05:36.780> if<00:05:37.780> you

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
there's nothing on the end there if you

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.960 
there's nothing on the end there if you
push<00:05:38.229> it<00:05:38.380> too<00:05:38.410> far<00:05:38.650> it<00:05:39.340> means<00:05:39.610> you<00:05:39.820> can

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
push it too far it means you can

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.790 
push it too far it means you can
actually<00:05:40.300> put<00:05:40.479> the<00:05:40.630> cable<00:05:41.050> through<00:05:41.440> the

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
actually put the cable through the

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.860 
actually put the cable through the
square<00:05:42.190> in<00:05:42.430> the<00:05:42.610> end<00:05:42.760> of<00:05:42.910> the<00:05:43.000> dust<00:05:43.240> cap<00:05:43.510> like

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
square in the end of the dust cap like

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.890 
square in the end of the dust cap like
that<00:05:44.139> before<00:05:44.710> you<00:05:44.860> push<00:05:45.070> the<00:05:45.220> dust<00:05:45.430> cap<00:05:45.639> on<00:05:45.900> now

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
that before you push the dust cap on now

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.140 
that before you push the dust cap on now
if<00:05:47.169> your<00:05:47.349> dust<00:05:47.620> cap<00:05:47.860> is<00:05:48.070> worn<00:05:48.099> out<00:05:48.640> in<00:05:48.849> any<00:05:49.030> way

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
if your dust cap is worn out in any way

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.480 
if your dust cap is worn out in any way
I<00:05:49.510> suggest<00:05:49.840> buying<00:05:50.260> a<00:05:50.440> new<00:05:50.650> one

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
I suggest buying a new one

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.610 
I suggest buying a new one
because<00:05:52.150> the<00:05:52.300> worst<00:05:52.690> thing<00:05:52.870> going<00:05:53.319> is<00:05:53.440> when

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
because the worst thing going is when

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.650 
because the worst thing going is when
your<00:05:53.740> speedo<00:05:53.979> cable<00:05:54.130> starts<00:05:54.759> to<00:05:55.060> slip<00:05:55.330> and<00:05:55.569> you

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
your speedo cable starts to slip and you

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.140 
your speedo cable starts to slip and you
get<00:05:55.810> a<00:05:55.840> false<00:05:56.080> reading<00:05:56.350> up<00:05:56.770> on<00:05:57.009> the<00:05:57.160> top<00:05:57.430> okay

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
get a false reading up on the top okay

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.939 
get a false reading up on the top okay
nice<00:05:58.569> gentle<00:05:59.169> tech<00:05:59.410> Geo

course<00:06:15.789> we<00:06:16.539> stuck<00:06:16.840> it<00:06:16.990> here<00:06:17.020> on<00:06:17.319> the<00:06:17.410> side<00:06:17.620> of

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
course we stuck it here on the side of

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.370 
course we stuck it here on the side of
the<00:06:17.860> tire<00:06:18.099> earlier<00:06:18.639> it<00:06:19.389> is<00:06:19.449> a<00:06:19.569> fiddle<00:06:20.050> there's

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
the tire earlier it is a fiddle there's
