00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
after you do this you will have

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.990 
after you do this you will have
interface<00:00:59.699> like<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.680> so<00:01:01.680> let's<00:01:02.460> see<00:01:02.670> how<00:01:02.940> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
interface like this so let's see how to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.200 
interface like this so let's see how to
monetize<00:01:03.899> our<00:01:04.320> application<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.460> get<00:01:05.700> banners

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
monetize our application to get banners

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.250 
monetize our application to get banners
working<00:01:07.040> through<00:01:08.040> these<00:01:08.189> go<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.869> monetize<00:01:09.869> new

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
working through these go to monetize new

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
working through these go to monetize new
up<00:01:10.640> select<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.850> add<00:01:12.119> up<00:01:12.600> manually<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.619> just

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
up select the add up manually and just

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.030 
up select the add up manually and just
type<00:01:14.490> any<00:01:14.820> name<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.180> want<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.869> just<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.860> you

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
type any name you want it just for you

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.170 
type any name you want it just for you
and<00:01:17.280> say<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.420> let's<00:01:18.930> type<00:01:19.500> at<00:01:19.770> Google<00:01:23.180> test

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and say so let's type at Google test

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.929 
and say so let's type at Google test
then<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.140> should<00:01:25.320> select<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> platform<00:01:26.040> it

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
then you should select the platform it

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.749 
then you should select the platform it
can<00:01:27.240> select<00:01:27.659> any<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.100> platform<00:01:29.340> but

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
can select any of this platform but

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.399 
can select any of this platform but
basically<00:01:30.180> plugin<00:01:30.630> support<00:01:30.750> comes<00:01:31.200> to

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
basically plugin support comes to

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.649 
basically plugin support comes to
Android<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.860> iOS<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.790> let's<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
Android and iOS so let's just like the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.520 
Android and iOS so let's just like the
Android<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.950> continue<00:01:36.079> now<00:01:37.079> we<00:01:37.140> should

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
Android and continue now we should

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.539 
Android and continue now we should
decide<00:01:38.329> what<00:01:39.329> type<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.659> AD<00:01:40.350> we<00:01:40.619> want<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.100> use<00:01:41.310> in

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
decide what type of AD we want to use in

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.749 
decide what type of AD we want to use in
our<00:01:41.670> application<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.930> burners<00:01:43.350> or

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
our application is it burners or

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.940 
our application is it burners or
interstitials<00:01:44.840> for<00:01:45.840> now<00:01:45.960> let's<00:01:46.290> let<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.740> be

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
interstitials for now let's let it be

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.600 
interstitials for now let's let it be
just<00:01:47.159> banners<00:01:48.060> then<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.470> configure<00:01:50.189> this

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
just banners then you can configure this

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.090 
just banners then you can configure this
burner<00:01:51.360> as<00:01:52.220> as<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.520> wish<00:01:54.590> but<00:01:55.590> please<00:01:55.860> note

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
that refresh rate you can just leave it

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.179 
that refresh rate you can just leave it
like<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:00.479> refresh<00:02:01.170> will<00:02:01.530> not<00:02:01.710> work<00:02:02.009> of

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
like this but refresh will not work of

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.830 
like this but refresh will not work of
somatically<00:02:02.670> until<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.240> application<00:02:03.360> is

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
somatically until the application is

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.370 
somatically until the application is
released<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.460> don't<00:02:05.759> be<00:02:06.060> afraid<00:02:06.270> if<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:07.170> will

now<00:02:33.030> we<00:02:33.120> have<00:02:33.510> our<00:02:34.280> bundle<00:02:35.280> registred<00:02:35.850> and

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
now we have our bundle registred and

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.390 
now we have our bundle registred and
what<00:02:36.840> do<00:02:36.900> we<00:02:36.990> want<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.290> use<00:02:37.530> from<00:02:37.740> here<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.250> is

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
what do we want to use from here that is

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.200 
what do we want to use from here that is
this<00:02:39.060> has<00:02:39.270> ad<00:02:39.450> unit<00:02:40.050> ID<00:02:40.820> that<00:02:41.820> is<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.090> only

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
this has ad unit ID that is the only

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.440 
this has ad unit ID that is the only
thing<00:02:42.570> we<00:02:43.170> need<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.680> be<00:02:43.890> able<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.340> show<00:02:44.550> this

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
thing we need to be able to show this

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.860 
thing we need to be able to show this
monomer<00:02:45.900> in<00:02:46.140> our<00:02:46.680> game<00:02:47.010> so<00:02:47.970> plugin<00:02:48.420> contains

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
monomer in our game so plugin contains

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.530 
monomer in our game so plugin contains
simple<00:02:49.800> prefab<00:02:50.310> solution<00:02:50.790> for<00:02:51.030> showing<00:02:51.300> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
simple prefab solution for showing the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.350 
simple prefab solution for showing the
binary<00:02:51.900> if<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.320> don't<00:02:52.650> want<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.070> do<00:02:53.360> any

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
binary if you don't want to do any

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.780 
binary if you don't want to do any
coding<00:02:54.690> if<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.980> would<00:02:56.100> like<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.340> use<00:02:56.640> it

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
coding if you would like to use it

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.990 
coding if you would like to use it
directly<00:02:57.330> from<00:02:57.390> your<00:02:57.660> code<00:02:57.990> and<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:59.070> have<00:02:59.700> a

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
directly from your code and to have a

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.270 
directly from your code and to have a
lot<00:03:00.240> more<00:03:00.560> functions<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.740> control<00:03:01.950> the

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
lot more functions to control the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
lot more functions to control the
banners<00:03:02.700> then<00:03:03.270> yes<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:04.610> able<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.760> do<00:03:05.850> this<00:03:06.000> and

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
banners then yes you able to do this and

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.350 
banners then yes you able to do this and
we<00:03:06.570> will<00:03:06.950> talk<00:03:07.950> more<00:03:07.980> about<00:03:08.340> this<00:03:08.880> in<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.120> next

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
we will talk more about this in the next

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.660 
we will talk more about this in the next
video<00:03:09.630> but<00:03:10.410> currently<00:03:10.860> we<00:03:11.070> just<00:03:11.310> won't<00:03:11.490> see

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
video but currently we just won't see

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.020 
video but currently we just won't see
how<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.840> simplest<00:03:13.260> way<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.890> get<00:03:14.580> boners

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
how to the simplest way to get boners

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.060 
how to the simplest way to get boners
and<00:03:15.510> interstitial<00:03:16.020> working<00:03:16.709> in<00:03:16.890> your

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
and interstitial working in your

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.550 
and interstitial working in your
application<00:03:17.760> we<00:03:18.480> will<00:03:18.630> use<00:03:18.900> some<00:03:19.200> kind<00:03:19.380> of

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
application we will use some kind of

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.770 
application we will use some kind of
prefab<00:03:20.010> solution<00:03:20.459> so<00:03:20.700> basically<00:03:21.120> what<00:03:21.360> we

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
prefab solution so basically what we

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.650 
prefab solution so basically what we
have<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.110> do<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.470> is<00:03:22.620> create<00:03:23.550> empty<00:03:24.000> game

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
have to do that is create empty game

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.370 
have to do that is create empty game
object<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:25.260> let's<00:03:25.680> name<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.840> add<00:03:29.720> one<00:03:30.720> or<00:03:30.930> you

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
object and let's name it add one or you

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.860 
object and let's name it add one or you
can<00:03:31.440> just<00:03:31.830> give<00:03:32.340> it<00:03:32.430> any<00:03:32.640> name<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.880> want<00:03:33.030> and

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
can just give it any name you want and

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.590 
can just give it any name you want and
attach<00:03:34.580> AdMob<00:03:35.580> banner<00:03:35.850> script<00:03:36.360> for<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:38.600> here's

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
attach AdMob banner script for it here's

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.110 
attach AdMob banner script for it here's
as<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:40.140> see<00:03:40.440> we<00:03:40.739> can<00:03:40.769> choose<00:03:41.010> what<00:03:41.850> banner

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
as you see we can choose what banner

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.770 
as you see we can choose what banner
type<00:03:42.540> we<00:03:42.900> want<00:03:43.739> it<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:44.070> be<00:03:44.250> banner<00:03:45.000> smart<00:03:45.540> panel

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
type we want it to be banner smart panel

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.710 
type we want it to be banner smart panel
open<00:03:46.530> leaderboards<00:03:47.400> or<00:03:47.670> major<00:03:48.120> number<00:03:48.420> change

open leaderboards or major number change

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.180 
open leaderboards or major number change
and<00:03:49.440> we<00:03:49.799> can<00:03:49.830> also<00:03:50.549> may<00:03:50.970> choose<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:52.190> anchor

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
and we can also may choose the anchor

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.890 
and we can also may choose the anchor
point<00:03:53.549> where<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.330> banner<00:03:54.570> will<00:03:54.870> appear<00:03:56.900> we

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
point where the banner will appear we

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.460 
point where the banner will appear we
need<00:03:58.049> to<00:03:58.170> specify<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:59.040> unit<00:03:59.790> IDs<00:04:00.360> for<00:04:00.870> Android

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
need to specify the unit IDs for Android

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.460 
need to specify the unit IDs for Android
and<00:04:01.830> for<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.670> obvious<00:04:03.260> currently<00:04:04.260> we<00:04:04.350> don't

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
and for the obvious currently we don't

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.390 
and for the obvious currently we don't
have<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:05.100> iOS<00:04:05.540> banners<00:04:06.540> unit<00:04:07.080> IDs<00:04:07.440> so<00:04:07.470> that<00:04:08.280> is

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
have the iOS banners unit IDs so that is

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.430 
have the iOS banners unit IDs so that is
not<00:04:08.580> a<00:04:08.610> problem<00:04:08.880> we<00:04:09.120> can<00:04:09.150> just<00:04:09.540> use<00:04:09.780> Android<00:04:10.260> so

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
not a problem we can just use Android so

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.140 
not a problem we can just use Android so
we<00:04:10.560> don't<00:04:10.739> have<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.100> iOS<00:04:11.310> but<00:04:11.760> if<00:04:12.000> you're

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
we don't have the iOS but if you're

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.560 
we don't have the iOS but if you're
going<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.799> build<00:04:13.799> it<00:04:14.040> for<00:04:14.400> iOS<00:04:14.850> then<00:04:15.150> of<00:04:15.299> course

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
going to build it for iOS then of course

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:22.570 
going to build it for iOS then of course
we<00:04:15.780> have<00:04:15.989> to<00:04:16.169> do<00:04:16.320> this<00:04:16.820> okay<00:04:17.820> so<00:04:20.660> here<00:04:21.660> is<00:04:21.810> our

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
we have to do this okay so here is our

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.420 
we have to do this okay so here is our
ad<00:04:23.580> unit<00:04:24.120> ID

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
ad unit ID

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.620 
ad unit ID
I<00:04:25.520> just<00:04:26.120> need<00:04:26.330> to<00:04:26.479> cooperate<00:04:27.550> and<00:04:28.550> that's<00:04:29.419> all

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
I just need to cooperate and that's all

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.140 
I just need to cooperate and that's all
here<00:04:31.090> that's<00:04:32.090> it<00:04:32.380> now<00:04:33.380> you<00:04:33.440> will<00:04:33.710> have<00:04:34.009> the<00:04:34.370> one

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
here that's it now you will have the one

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.870 
here that's it now you will have the one
working<00:04:35.600> on<00:04:36.050> this<00:04:36.350> stage<00:04:36.680> every<00:04:37.460> time<00:04:37.669> you

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
working on this stage every time you

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.120 
working on this stage every time you
will<00:04:38.030> load<00:04:38.240> this<00:04:38.479> chain<00:04:38.780> stage<00:04:39.320> one<00:04:39.770> will

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
will load this chain stage one will

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.029 
will load this chain stage one will
appears<00:04:40.669> when<00:04:41.330> you<00:04:41.360> will<00:04:41.690> load<00:04:42.440> another's

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
appears when you will load another's

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.060 
appears when you will load another's
change<00:04:43.340> and<00:04:43.639> go<00:04:44.120> away<00:04:44.720> from<00:04:45.139> this<00:04:45.350> stage<00:04:45.620> then

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
change and go away from this stage then

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.460 
change and go away from this stage then
the<00:04:46.280> bunny<00:04:47.090> will<00:04:47.330> disappear<00:04:48.080> that<00:04:48.289> is

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
the bunny will disappear that is

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.580 
the bunny will disappear that is
actually<00:04:49.070> useful<00:04:49.190> for<00:04:49.520> for<00:04:50.120> example<00:04:50.539> if<00:04:50.750> you

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
actually useful for for example if you

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.340 
actually useful for for example if you
want<00:04:51.860> to<00:04:51.979> show<00:04:52.130> banner<00:04:52.460> only<00:04:53.030> on<00:04:53.270> minions<00:04:53.930> and

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
want to show banner only on minions and

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.640 
want to show banner only on minions and
or<00:04:54.590> thumbs<00:04:54.949> in<00:04:55.419> so<00:04:56.419> we'll<00:04:56.690> actually<00:04:57.139> we<00:04:57.440> should

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
or thumbs in so we'll actually we should
