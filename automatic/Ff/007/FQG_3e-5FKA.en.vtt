00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.369
 it's a cumulative 52 kilometers of 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.170
 paved and after good until the end of 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.760
 race we still have we are still 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.100
 on these pavers the vibrations are 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.280
 huge c 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.630
 and it starts with your fingertips until 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.910
 to the end of the toes it is 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.540
 awesome thing the body have me 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.910
 exhausted 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.000
 so it's really important if you want 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.360
 have a maximum of a maximum of 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.360
 comfort 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.430
 we had the opportunity to see her to have this 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.500
 frame look from the beginning of the classics 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.690
 for all the races paved he is a 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.519
 little less rigid than our cable 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.120
 had a lot more 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.120
 comfortable 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.380
 2 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.900
 compared to the 6 185 that we have 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.700
 the year we have a normal seatpost 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.720
 classic is not bad because good 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.380
 is not in continuity with the cal so 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.300
 at least the scoop vibrations a little 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.330
 little level there is hot it's the 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.820
 work that luca elaborated on on the 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.470
 rear guy ropes and the super is very 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.440
 wise because it's a lot more 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.770
 comfortable than a frame that a frame 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.240
 very rigid so that's a comfort 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.100
 extra on paris roubaix I 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.940
 think it's details that plays 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.940
 a lot at the end of the race 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.010
 they worked well on his level of 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.110
 the gallows with the horizontal bar and 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.450
 from there we have a maneuverability that 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.830
 is who is great on the cobblestones there is 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.240
 in addition to an aluminum stem so 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.980
 it's less a word to say it's a bit 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.680
 less rigid and then it takes less 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.450
 vibrations compared to usually we have a 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.950
 carbon stem that goes to the water 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.360
 session we will have several visits and 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.440
 but here what we are looking for above all 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.440
 paris roubaix is ​​comfort 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.200
 we are on the pavement with the vibrations 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:31.080
 know not necessarily easy in the 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.489
 curves in the trajectories and there the 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.129
 to have torso skin in the 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.330
 continuity of seeing it is some 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.330
 very interesting thing 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.000
 first key to success is the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.090
 legs so if the sensations are 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.790
 good with material like that one 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.120
 will have no excuse to be close to 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.120
 victory
