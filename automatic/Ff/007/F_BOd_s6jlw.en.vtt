00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 filigree electrical engineers here or 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.500
 you are rather tangible 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.970
 machine builders 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.230
 maybe you are even math and 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.150
 physics students this here 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.400
 you know what it all means 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.139
 Together with the complex numbers 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.139
 you have to do a damn lot 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.320
 in the last video we have plus and times 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.340
 We have complex numbers 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.619
 first omitted 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.090
 that has a reason as we have so far 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.340
 getting to know the complex numbers 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.160
 it has to be that is but is mega 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.680
 Ugly, let's take a complex c1 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.450
 and divide that by c2 when we return 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.330
 the real part and imaginary parts 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.100
 we have to use that there shit 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.020
 that's just stupid for now 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.300
 we do not get excited immediately 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.820
 changed 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.920
 only patience a complex number c one can 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.660
 yes, you know yes and then there 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.390
 it real a certain angle 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.670
 Oh , we call that a lot because he is 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.350
 By the way, almost always so called 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.649
 this weird sign looks like 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.080
 a p the length of the red arrow what 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.759
 that was exactly the amount again 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.830
 from the complex numbers c 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.229
 Now if you have the triangle 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.960
 look at the a- b and the red arrow 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.610
 then you can form a and b too 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.500
 with the red arrow and the angle 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.220
 express completely normal as in the 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.250
 is in junior high school math for true even 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.039
 the amount of c so the red arrow times 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.009
 the cosinus of four cosinus is the 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:32.020
 anka did by hypothesis it at the 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.300
 Anka tÃ¤ten and the length of the red case 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.240
 the hypothesis and the length we have 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.550
 said is the amount of c and b is 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.880
 the same with the sine equal to b 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.080
 amount of ten times sinus of four you 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.330
 now you should also from the 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.700
 he knew he was against catheters 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.950
 by hypothesis and if that's it 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.770
 insert at ford comes just amount of 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.929
 ten times sinus of 4 as I said that 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.119
 is intermediate level mathematics if it is too 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.160
 quickly went down pause with it 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.280
 we are working on now she was 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.039
 just plus xb because that's how we put it 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.690
 a complex number in general since a and b 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.060
 we have just through sinus and cosinus 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.550
 and that weird new angle you 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.650
 So we can put that 1 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.260
 then we get ten is equal 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.510
 amount of ten times cosinus of 4 + e 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.430
 mail amount from 10 - from 4 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.410
 if we still have the amount of c 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.750
 we'll get that out of here 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.930
 the amount of ten times the cosinus of 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.310
 Fiji the sinus and how does it look? 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.400
 not cool at all 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.160
 tell yourself leonard euler what that's like 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.450
 a crass mat from 250 years ago 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.900
 so much important in mathematics 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.330
 made of ding comes the important one too 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:48.580
 reforming the cosine of real number 4 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.769
 + ii - of which is equal to x fi that 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.330
 that is how you can derive but also 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.160
 that blows up the frame here you have to 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.760
 Only believe us only one thing 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.870
 do not forget now high as can too 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.970
 become negative 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.739
 very important because usually thinks 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.420
 yes, that function is not negative 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:09.580
 eg high times pi is - 1 because loud euler 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.980
 eh high e mail pia is nothing else 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.190
 as cosinus of pima never sinus of 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.660
 pi cosinus of pi is - once under 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.660
 sinus of pi is 0 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.120
 So come out - but 1 back to 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.400
 formula comes you detail known 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.680
 that's exactly what we saw here 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.110
 So we can do the complex number 10 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.790
 again rewrite amount of ten 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.440
 high ifi already cool but I have 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.970
 still no idea what the amount 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.400
 and especially not like me 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.450
 Angle much can determine the amount 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.070
 you already know 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.630
 but we'll tell you again 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.489
 memory before hiding 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.410
 you can like a vector too 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.950
 make every component square 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.620
 add 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.650
 So the amount of co2 is the same 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.350
 2 + b high 2 or written differently 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.079
 amount of c is equal to root 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.639
 quadrath + c square can also be seen 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.829
 fast if you look at the picture again 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.900
 Just look at the pythagoras of the 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:07.870
 pages a and b and the length of the 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.030
 file c is still missing 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.639
 we need the house again we junk 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.549
 from the intermediate level namely the tangens 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:18.100
 of Catheter by anka the fact that 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.709
 against kt tsb and the uncut et is a 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.530
 So is the tan of cattle 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.470
 b right through back to ours 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.750
 number c let's leave it that way 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.300
 So it's still ten times 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.979
 high but now we still know how 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.770
 you have a lot of c and the angle 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:38.680
 calculates the amount of ces the root 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.180
 quadrath + b square and livestock is the 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.060
 Accumulate tangens from the bed 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.370
 the whole is called the polar before only that 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.470
 it has heard achja complex 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.600
 conjugate is now really easy when 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.520
 her your imaginary part is reflected 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.770
 too much - as it is now after 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.410
 So below shows when you conjugate 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.389
 is from your c that here is the 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.030
 and angles are just the direction 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:04.850
 from a lot different, namely simply - 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.310
 Before that, why the presentation so much 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.440
 horny is on you have to pay complex 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.940
 multiply or divide and we have 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.500
 you showed it a while ago that it was pretty 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.840
 gets complicated with the normal 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.970
 Presentation with the new presentation 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.849
 is times and shared really easy 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.759
 Let's look at two complex numbers c1 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:25.310
 and c2 we'll take it with us 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:27.440
 the new presentation and because at malia 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.500
 the order does not matter , it is the same 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:35.479
 the here amount of c1 times c2 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:37.880
 times high x 41 x fi 2 we only have the 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.440
 altered sequence and circuit 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.020
 Let's use a rule for 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.580
 potencies on the same basis you can the 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.880
 Namely adding an exponent 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:50.840
 So then there is the amounts of c 1 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.669
 and 2 x fi 1 plus 4 2 pretty cool or 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.099
 Much easier so the numbers with each other 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.530
 to multiply and now finally 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:59.479
 we show you how to share 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.690
 just as easy as in the 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:04.909
 spell-like as the c1 and c2 at this time 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.340
 but share again with the other 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:09.949
 by writing small tip 1 by 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:13.729
 something is the same - something 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:16.729
 so the c1 is given by c2 amount c1 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:19.970
 by amount to two times high times 41 times 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:21.889
 high - ii x fi 2 so we have that 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.900
 our marriage raised and for that in the 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:26.150
 exponent - made before 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.669
 and if we still pay the high 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:32.960
 add comes out amount c1 through 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:34.909
 amount c2 times high times 4 1 - 4 2 you 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.860
 See is not that hard when 

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:38.840
 you are in polar form are times and 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.270
 Easily shared in the normal form 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.580
 rb is correct for plus and minus 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:46.729
 Just that was all over again 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.949
 important first the owl formula the 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:51.260
 will you still need 100pro and 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:52.220
 Do not forget how high can 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.530
 become negative 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.850
 then that every complex numbers polar 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.660
 form can be written 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:02.450
 in amount x high the amount is 

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:05.060
 the root of ah high 2 + b high two 

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.130
 the angle fi is the battery of tangens 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.090
 b by a 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.070
 you can then like us 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.680
 have seen quite easily times and 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.300
 divided compute so if there are problems 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.040
 in the university with prove then pull 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.290
 you our playlist to the different ones 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.770
 proves true purely just right here 

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.690
 click 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.830
 but still a short question what 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.240
 he studied infected 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.520
 mechanical engineering computer scientist or 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.930
 Are you on the hashtag the academy? 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.760
 maybe you are even mistress 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.710
 Doctor or hashtag compete shoot 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.820
 Go tell us something here 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.590
 We are really interested 

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.210
 By then skin purely saves the world 

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.920
 happy since the sun is shining 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.550
 maybe we only love you guys 

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.180
 good and let 

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.180
 Yes
