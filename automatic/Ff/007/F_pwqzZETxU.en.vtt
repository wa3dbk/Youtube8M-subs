00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hi guys, I'm going to tell you guys today 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.160
 a little bit about boots 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.740
 although the helmet is the item 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.780
 security number one in a second 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.630
 I usually say that the column protector 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.180
 for those who do not know the infinite majority 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.630
 of injuries occur in the limbs 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.100
 lower legs or the ankles legs 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.019
 feet and so on 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.510
 so wear a boot that really 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.050
 protect is what makes the difference 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.210
 this supertec model given yesterday stars is 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.280
 a template I use that stoner uses 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.670
 that all professional pilots use 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.430
 exactly the door that the professional 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.170
 usa has on sale at the store what makes it 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.270
 a boot so sophisticated and sometimes the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.420
 people go to a store and do not know 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.239
 to differentiate what is a top boot than 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.030
 a simpler dilation than many times 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.710
 They end up costing the same thing so I go 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.910
 tell you a lot of things here 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.250
 first 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.100
 Imagine the bike falling on your foot 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.730
 so the soldering does not 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.820
 fold 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.070
 in this sense it is articulated only 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.770
 this way it has a rigid structure 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.049
 here that then prevents your piece 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.630
 crushed laterally it is clear that here 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.740
 requires a degree of flexibility not to 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.520
 can walk 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.520
 ok another feature a protection 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.049
 very strict for cinnamon because it is a 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:32.100
 very sensitive place is every little detail 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.409
 seam finishing ventilation was 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.960
 thought over the years and years of 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.880
 study and evolution of this model 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.600
 example here is this piece of 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.899
 metal because here has a slider is all 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.210
 boot is built so that in a fall 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.220
 you in no way have your foot 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.170
 caught suddenly imagine you 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.350
 sliding on the asphalt and your foot 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.560
 suddenly sticks to us and sticks to the floor 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.740
 and your knee flexes and gives a 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.140
 gives a lock it causes injuries 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.759
 so look, the person did not notice 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.020
 transports do not have this 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.660
 Imagine me slipping from my back what 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.000
 will shave this region is much higher 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.890
 there is a rebound so that it does not 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.709
 chances of rubber sole date 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.769
 which he will do on the ground and lock mine 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.769
 leg then all the construction of it has 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:29.730
 a reason to be the most interesting and 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.920
 important of everything and that very few 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.519
 boots has this sophistication 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.430
 When you fall, George is flying or 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.340
 either way is the trend we 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.099
 hit the leg on the floor and come to the ankle 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.260
 from one side to the other this boot is 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.819
 hinged back to back but she 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.890
 does not move sideways 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.989
 I'll show it on my foot so I 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.519
 I can move the bike and I can do it. 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.340
 walk normally 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.830
 She wears well is comfortable but I do not 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.930
 I can turn my ankle to the side 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.440
 So imagine if I leave, I'll hit the 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.410
 floor and my foot had not seen because it is 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.630
 here the secret on the inside is actually 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.060
 to the staff when they see the vice even play 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.430
 said it's your two bikes at 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.269
 which is not a boot that comes two 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.100
 parts 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.819
 we first wear this part 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.680
 inside which is hinged but which has an 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.810
 structure you have not set the 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.700
 side 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.340
 after I wear it I fit my 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.340
 foot inside the outer structure 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.370
 following these characteristics is 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.579
 boot that hooks some call 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.220
 cod others call the pedalboard 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.989
 hook when you move is just 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.780
 using silver idea as it is 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.870
 comfortable and sophisticated. 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.329
 It's like a velvet in the touch but it's 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.090
 extremely resistant not to hurt 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.639
 bike do not stick to anything because sometimes 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.150
 a quality boot hooks 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:04.560
 five-time dollar on hook is 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.830
 uncomfortable then it is precisely this 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.930
 area here that I'm finally showing 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.879
 have nothing 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.340
 more sophisticated in the market in terms of 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:16.759
 professional boot to manage 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.600
 supertec any doubt is do not fail to 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:19.729
 write 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.900
 I entered on my site bruno corano punto 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.620
 com 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.620
 a hug
