00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.040
 A little there was to the ball is Now this little comment field of everyone Hello reflection 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.590
 Card is 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.269
 Was written about a bit so how does this lamp last for a long time? 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.380
 Just a little 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:22.599
 Over at you and I think I wish Well reportedly been 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:24.470
 I think that I use the vise crew that everyone uses for the clean finger 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.769
 3 types of playing card marks 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:33.620
 De' and to say I travel sideways bicycle b 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:35.660
 I thought it would be better to use b if you want to make it look for practice 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.500
 That's really 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:47.540
 Of course Mr. Toka whether one type of which say I b There are today of the type 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:54.790
 And Do so because it is the edge a little hard with the high it left a little to last longer turn the other one 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.790
 Properly it is no to Tteyuu wash clean hands on to this exercise 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.310
 If Buber is exhausted 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:20.280
 It is an article 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.720
 I used it because it would be useless or it would be sloppy 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.100
 Naa 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.100
 Speaking of using Cairo 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.810
 There is also a boob 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:52.630
 Really it is not that I was using 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:54.970
 Although this lamp slippage has worsened , I think it is an expendable item and the playing cards are changing 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.930
 Because this card 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.490
 It is one but one 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.580
 Grinded buy and 630 Marchi trout 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:07.160
 Oh dear 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:12.700
 1 buy in dance and certainly at Don Quixote's 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:16.200
 Since it should have sold at wonder if I used in about 4000 yen a little less than 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.200
 I bought it first 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:27.170
 It is good information for everyone I think if you know many, but with this one number of bullets 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.740
 Let's sell 1998 meters here 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:35.500
 Because it is accumulated in a large amount by Costco 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:40.510
 Engagement station depression in 1998 with 12 pieces 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:45.520
 But if Costco is nearby 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.750
 If you buy a lot of this at Costco, it will be easy to play cards and one by one will be cheaper 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.960
 Kana I think so like 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:56.980
 As you can practice, I think you should buy it 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:01.180
 It is better not to throw away even if it becomes cards roster practice 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.690
 You can use outside or broke Toka bend the echo curve 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.770
 15 take also become a time Oitei' 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:13.690
 From what . Just new for you to use in practice 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:15.990
 Trump than you think happens to the good is better to just using clanging 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.280
 Wherever we call the plumper products 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.280
 I think if you can stop
