doing<00:03:05.380> this<00:03:05.560> song<00:03:05.800> I<00:03:05.830> was<00:03:06.040> actually<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.310> much

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
doing this song I was actually a much

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:31.880 
doing this song I was actually a much
mellower<00:03:07.060> version<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:07.780> it<00:03:07.900> was<00:03:08.080> no<00:03:08.350> pics

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.610

so there

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.990 
so there
just<00:03:35.519> kind<00:03:35.730> of<00:03:35.760> picking<00:03:36.629> and<00:03:36.900> strumming<00:03:36.959> then

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
just kind of picking and strumming then

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.070 
just kind of picking and strumming then

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
again I'm not thinking too much about

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:47.240 
again I'm not thinking too much about
what<00:03:40.500> I'm<00:03:40.590> doing<00:03:40.950> but<00:03:45.680> I'm<00:03:46.680> struggling<00:03:47.010> to

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
what I'm doing but I'm struggling to

00:03:47.250 --> 00:04:06.720 
what I'm doing but I'm struggling to
pick<00:03:47.519> it<00:03:47.670> up<00:03:47.790> as<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.060> come<00:03:48.390> back

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730

yeah<00:04:07.730> do<00:04:08.240> it<00:04:08.360> without<00:04:08.450> a<00:04:08.600> fix<00:04:08.900> too<00:04:09.050> much<00:04:09.200> these

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
yeah do it without a fix too much these

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.810

days<00:04:09.440> but<00:04:09.620> that's<00:04:09.980> another<00:04:10.610> another<00:04:11.090> option

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
days but that's another another option

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.539 
days but that's another another option

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.819 
I'm not gonna break down too much
basically<00:04:18.530> I<00:04:18.650> just<00:04:18.920> try<00:04:19.730> to<00:04:19.760> find<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:20.209> melody

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
basically I just try to find the melody

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.320 
basically I just try to find the melody
somewhere<00:04:21.829> around<00:04:21.980> there<00:04:22.370> you<00:04:22.550> know<00:04:22.670> and<00:04:22.940> make

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
somewhere around there you know and make

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.150 
somewhere around there you know and make
it<00:04:23.510> not<00:04:23.660> too<00:04:23.960> generic<00:04:24.140> sound<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.830> although<00:04:24.950> it

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
it not too generic sound and although it

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.680 
it not too generic sound and although it
does<00:04:25.340> end<00:04:25.550> up<00:04:25.700> sounding<00:04:26.090> like<00:04:26.150> pretty<00:04:26.570> much

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
does end up sounding like pretty much

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.180 
does end up sounding like pretty much
everything<00:04:27.080> else<00:04:27.170> I<00:04:27.350> do<00:04:27.410> on<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:27.800> twelfth<00:04:28.040> fret

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
everything else I do on the twelfth fret

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:47.719 
everything else I do on the twelfth fret
playing<00:04:28.460> slide<00:04:28.840> sort<00:04:29.840> of

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:57.510 

so<00:04:48.729> first<00:04:49.180> and<00:04:49.300> second<00:04:49.689> string<00:04:56.310> get<00:04:57.310> that

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
so first and second string get that

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.309 
so first and second string get that
third<00:04:57.759> string<00:04:58.060> in<00:04:58.240> there<00:04:58.479> until<00:04:58.629> though<00:04:59.020> that

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319 
third string in there until though that

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.170 
third string in there until though that
last<00:04:59.530> note<00:04:59.830> at<00:04:59.979> all<00:05:00.099> things<00:05:00.400> all<00:05:00.699> first<00:05:01.000> and

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
last note at all things all first and

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:13.830 
last note at all things all first and
second<00:05:01.509> I<00:05:01.539> guess<00:05:12.300> and<00:05:13.300> you<00:05:13.330> can<00:05:13.569> throw<00:05:13.719> in

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
second I guess and you can throw in

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:24.050 
second I guess and you can throw in
higher<00:05:14.050> note<00:05:14.289> sir

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.550 

anyway<00:05:25.060> a<00:05:25.090> lot<00:05:25.270> of<00:05:25.360> room<00:05:25.509> for<00:05:25.539> variation<00:05:26.139> and

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
anyway a lot of room for variation and

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.360 
anyway a lot of room for variation and
stuff<00:05:26.800> in<00:05:26.979> there<00:05:27.270> one<00:05:28.270> other<00:05:28.389> little<00:05:28.600> bit

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
stuff in there one other little bit

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.920 
stuff in there one other little bit
it's<00:05:30.370> not<00:05:30.550> even<00:05:30.759> in<00:05:30.850> Kokomo<00:05:31.270> Blues<00:05:31.479> but<00:05:31.720> it's

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
it's not even in Kokomo Blues but it's

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.600 
it's not even in Kokomo Blues but it's
kind<00:05:32.169> of<00:05:32.199> a<00:05:32.320> Fred<00:05:32.560> McDowell<00:05:32.860> lick<00:05:33.160> that<00:05:33.340> comes

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
kind of a Fred McDowell lick that comes

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:47.800 
kind of a Fred McDowell lick that comes
up<00:05:33.820> in<00:05:33.970> various<00:05:34.389> other<00:05:34.570> so<00:05:37.530> inspired

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:55.780 

so<00:05:48.770> there's<00:05:49.070> just<00:05:52.389> first<00:05:53.389> fret<00:05:53.720> of<00:05:54.139> the<00:05:54.790> second

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
so there's just first fret of the second

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:09.030 
so there's just first fret of the second
string<00:05:56.380> this<00:05:57.380> weird<00:05:57.650> thing<00:05:58.220> about<00:05:58.250> this

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.980 

yeah<00:06:10.240> you<00:06:11.240> know<00:06:11.360> there's<00:06:11.510> a<00:06:11.540> lot<00:06:11.660> of<00:06:11.810> room<00:06:11.960> for

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
yeah you know there's a lot of room for

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.010 
yeah you know there's a lot of room for
however<00:06:12.650> you<00:06:12.920> want<00:06:13.100> to<00:06:13.270> change<00:06:14.270> that<00:06:14.480> up<00:06:14.540> you

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
however you want to change that up you

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:41.430 
however you want to change that up you
can<00:06:15.050> do<00:06:15.350> a<00:06:15.380> lot<00:06:15.560> more<00:06:15.590> on<00:06:15.890> the<00:06:15.980> first

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.680 

that's<00:06:41.710> a<00:06:41.830> standard<00:06:42.460> fit<00:06:42.849> MacDowell<00:06:43.180> thing<00:06:43.479> I

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
that's a standard fit MacDowell thing I

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.230 
that's a standard fit MacDowell thing I
think<00:06:44.280> kind<00:06:45.280> of<00:06:45.370> just<00:06:45.580> you<00:06:45.819> know<00:06:45.880> smoothly

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 
think kind of just you know smoothly

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.180 
think kind of just you know smoothly
sliding<00:06:46.990> down<00:06:47.169> and<00:06:47.530> picking<00:06:47.740> as<00:06:48.009> you're

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.190 
sliding down and picking as you're

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.920 
sliding down and picking as you're
sliding<00:06:48.280> down<00:06:48.759> between<00:06:49.180> the<00:06:49.330> third<00:06:49.539> and<00:06:49.569> fifth

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:49.930 
sliding down between the third and fifth

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:50.219 
sliding down between the third and fifth
fret

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:50.229 
fret

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:58.550

mainly<00:06:51.039> on<00:06:51.160> the<00:06:51.430> 3rd<00:06:51.729> and<00:06:51.849> 4th<00:06:52.150> strings<00:06:52.660> really

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.659 

throw<00:06:59.560> it<00:06:59.740> in<00:06:59.830> there<00:07:00.009> where<00:07:00.160> you<00:07:00.250> feel<00:07:00.490> it

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:00.669 
throw it in there where you feel it

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:09.559 
throw it in there where you feel it
unless<00:07:01.660> you're<00:07:01.960> playing<00:07:02.080> with<00:07:02.289> other<00:07:02.440> people

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:09.569 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:15.539 

anyway<00:07:11.130> that's<00:07:12.130> the<00:07:12.340> basics<00:07:12.759> hope<00:07:13.060> that<00:07:13.240> helps
