stuff<00:00:15.339> here<00:00:15.580> I<00:00:15.759> like<00:00:16.240> any<00:00:16.419> other<00:00:16.599> tail<00:00:17.140> gyro

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
stuff here I like any other tail gyro

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.650 
stuff here I like any other tail gyro
this<00:00:17.680> is<00:00:17.800> where<00:00:17.950> we<00:00:18.039> teach<00:00:18.220> the<00:00:18.430> gyro<00:00:18.820> how<00:00:19.450> much

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
this is where we teach the gyro how much

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.870 
this is where we teach the gyro how much

direction the B stacks will let you do
it<00:00:24.760> one<00:00:24.939> direction<00:00:25.090> it'll<00:00:25.990> give<00:00:26.109> you<00:00:26.199> an

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
it one direction it'll give you an

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.800 
it one direction it'll give you an
indicator<00:00:26.679> light<00:00:26.800> here<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:28.359> color<00:00:28.570> is

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
indicator light here the color is

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.269 
indicator light here the color is
irrelevant<00:00:28.960> whichever<00:00:29.650> direction<00:00:30.099> you<00:00:30.130> go

first tool either be red or blue to
start<00:00:32.169> with<00:00:32.320> but<00:00:32.980> once<00:00:33.129> you've<00:00:33.280> set<00:00:33.610> the<00:00:33.760> end

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
start with but once you've set the end

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.460 
start with but once you've set the end
points<00:00:34.210> for<00:00:34.390> either<00:00:34.600> direction<00:00:35.010> then<00:00:36.010> the

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
points for either direction then the

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.570 
points for either direction then the
light<00:00:38.470> will<00:00:38.500> kind<00:00:38.769> of<00:00:38.799> do<00:00:38.949> a<00:00:38.979> flutter<00:00:39.280> and<00:00:39.460> go

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
light will kind of do a flutter and go

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.700 
light will kind of do a flutter and go
purple<00:00:40.059> for<00:00:40.239> you<00:00:40.360> so<00:00:41.199> here's<00:00:41.379> where<00:00:41.500> you<00:00:41.620> will

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
purple for you so here's where you will

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.579 
purple for you so here's where you will
go<00:00:41.799> ahead<00:00:41.890> and<00:00:42.100> add<00:00:42.670> your<00:00:42.699> your<00:00:43.570> link<00:00:43.869> for<00:00:44.500> your

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
go ahead and add your your link for your

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:47.759 
go ahead and add your your link for your
tail<00:00:44.769> back<00:00:45.489> on<00:00:45.699> your<00:00:45.820> servo<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:47.379> that<00:00:47.530> you<00:00:47.619> can

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
tail back on your servo so that you can

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:50.280 
tail back on your servo so that you can
do<00:00:47.890> that<00:00:48.360> very<00:00:49.360> simply<00:00:49.720> you<00:00:49.869> just<00:00:50.080> use<00:00:50.260> your

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
do that very simply you just use your

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.160 
do that very simply you just use your
your<00:00:50.769> tail<00:00:50.979> stick<00:00:51.420> your<00:00:52.420> rudder<00:00:52.600> stick<00:00:52.869> so

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
your tail stick your rudder stick so

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.350 
your tail stick your rudder stick so
that<00:00:53.320> you<00:00:53.440> can<00:00:53.619> you<00:00:54.400> can<00:00:54.580> get<00:00:54.729> the<00:00:54.879> end<00:00:55.059> points

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
that you can you can get the end points

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.689 
that you can you can get the end points
on<00:00:55.479> the<00:00:55.570> tail<00:00:55.780> and<00:00:58.920> then<00:00:59.920> once<00:01:00.400> you<00:01:00.519> have<00:01:00.670> it

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
on the tail and then once you have it

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.210 
on the tail and then once you have it
set<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:01.960> then<00:01:02.140> we<00:01:02.260> can<00:01:02.409> move<00:01:02.530> on<00:01:02.710> so<00:01:02.979> let's<00:01:03.129> go

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
set and then we can move on so let's go

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:10.510 
set and then we can move on so let's go
ahead<00:01:03.280> and<00:01:03.430> do<00:01:03.489> this<00:01:03.580> one

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.010 

there<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.610> go<00:01:11.730> that<00:01:12.270> tells<00:01:12.480> you<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.660> got<00:01:12.810> that

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
there you go that tells you it got that

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.930 
there you go that tells you it got that
side<00:01:13.320> now<00:01:14.250> we're<00:01:14.400> going<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.550> go<00:01:14.700> ahead<00:01:14.790> and

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
side now we're going to go ahead and

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.920 
side now we're going to go ahead and
move<00:01:15.030> back<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.480> drive<00:01:15.660> it<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> other<00:01:16.050> way<00:01:17.930> now

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
move back and drive it the other way now

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.420 
move back and drive it the other way now
you<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.230> play<00:01:19.410> around<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.800> this<00:01:19.890> step<00:01:20.130> as<00:01:20.280> long

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
you can play around on this step as long

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.490 
you can play around on this step as long
as<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.640> feel<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.170> until<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.230> get<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.470> right

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
as you feel like until you get it right

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.280 
as you feel like until you get it right
where<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.100> want<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.930> go<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.990> where<00:01:25.170> it's

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
where you want it go to where it's

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.110 
where you want it go to where it's
finding<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.920> could<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.490> stop<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> little<00:01:27.000> bit

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
finding I could just stop a little bit

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.420 
finding I could just stop a little bit
and<00:01:27.690> it<00:01:27.780> will<00:01:27.840> flutter<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.350> go<00:01:28.470> purple<00:01:28.890> that

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
and it will flutter and go purple that

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.670 
and it will flutter and go purple that
tells<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.820> you're<00:01:30.090> done<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:31.020> footnote

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
tells you that you're done a footnote

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.550 
tells you that you're done a footnote
about<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:32.070> one<00:01:32.250> here<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.790> step<00:01:33.230> and<00:01:34.230> I<00:01:34.350> can

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
about this one here this step and I can

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.020 
about this one here this step and I can
go<00:01:34.710> through<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> end<00:01:35.250> point<00:01:35.490> setup<00:01:35.820> here

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
go through the end point setup here

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.080 
go through the end point setup here
again<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:37.080> show<00:01:37.260> you<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:37.620> one<00:01:38.610> thing<00:01:38.760> I<00:01:38.850> wanted

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
again to show you but one thing I wanted

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.910 
again to show you but one thing I wanted
to<00:01:39.180> show<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.390> about<00:01:39.660> the<00:01:39.960> tail<00:01:40.230> is<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:41.520> a

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
to show you about the tail is that a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.120 
to show you about the tail is that a
little<00:01:43.920> tip<00:01:44.370> that<00:01:44.400> I<00:01:44.640> learned<00:01:44.910> was<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:46.130> as

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
little tip that I learned was that as

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.790 
little tip that I learned was that as
you<00:01:47.430> move<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.970> rudder<00:01:48.180> stick<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:49.530> your

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
you move the rudder stick on your

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.280 
you move the rudder stick on your
transmitter<00:01:50.510> whichever<00:01:51.510> direction<00:01:52.080> if<00:01:52.230> you

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
move the rudder stick the direction that

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.400 
move the rudder stick the direction that
the<00:02:01.860> tail<00:02:02.100> points<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.780> direction<00:02:04.230> that

the nose of the helicopter is going to

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.350 
the nose of the helicopter is going to
move<00:02:06.470> okay<00:02:07.470> so<00:02:08.429> that's<00:02:08.730> important<00:02:09.240> to<00:02:09.270> know

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
move okay so that's important to know

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.230 
move okay so that's important to know
this<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.869> good<00:02:10.050> time<00:02:10.260> to<00:02:10.320> see<00:02:10.590> if<00:02:10.679> your<00:02:11.240> your

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
this is a good time to see if your your

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.320 
this is a good time to see if your your
direction<00:02:12.570> reversing<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.350> correct<00:02:13.680> or<00:02:13.860> not<00:02:14.330> if

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
direction reversing is correct or not if

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.600 
direction reversing is correct or not if
it's<00:02:15.570> not<00:02:15.770> you<00:02:16.770> simply<00:02:17.160> go<00:02:17.310> into<00:02:17.459> your

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
it's not you simply go into your

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.800 
it's not you simply go into your
transmitter<00:02:18.260> into<00:02:19.260> your<00:02:19.650> reversing<00:02:20.220> menu<00:02:20.550> and

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
transmitter into your reversing menu and

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.290 
transmitter into your reversing menu and
you<00:02:21.810> can<00:02:21.930> adjust<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:22.410> there<00:02:23.060> let's<00:02:24.060> go<00:02:24.209> in

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
you can adjust that there let's go in

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.330 
you can adjust that there let's go in
your<00:02:24.420> reverse<00:02:24.690> switch<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.920> know<00:02:26.040> find

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
your reverse switch and you know find

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.490 
your reverse switch and you know find
which<00:02:26.550> one<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.940> or<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:28.020> know<00:02:28.110> move<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.410> your

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
which one is or you know move to your

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.920 
which one is or you know move to your
rudder<00:02:28.739> and<00:02:28.980> then<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.700> can<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:30.540> can<00:02:30.720> switch

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
rudder and then you can you can switch

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.620 
rudder and then you can you can switch
the<00:02:31.110> directions<00:02:31.530> there<00:02:31.739> so<00:02:32.360> just<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.420> little

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
the directions there so just a little

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.870 
the directions there so just a little
tip<00:02:33.810> about<00:02:34.020> that<00:02:34.260> it's<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.950> great<00:02:35.160> way<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.700> like

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
tip about that it's a great way and like

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.250 
tip about that it's a great way and like
I<00:02:35.970> said<00:02:36.030> before<00:02:36.300> you<00:02:36.600> can<00:02:36.630> hang<00:02:36.900> out<00:02:37.020> in<00:02:37.140> this

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
I said before you can hang out in this

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.960 
I said before you can hang out in this
step<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.709> do<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.130> as<00:02:38.310> many<00:02:38.489> times<00:02:38.730> as<00:02:38.850> you

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
step and do this as many times as you

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.150 
step and do this as many times as you
need<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.150> until<00:02:39.570> you<00:02:40.200> have<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.410> right<00:02:43.070> there<00:02:44.070> we

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
need to until you have it right there we

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:52.809 
need to until you have it right there we
go

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.360 

okay<00:02:53.819> wait<00:02:54.299> for<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.569> flutter<00:02:55.040> go<00:02:56.040> back<00:02:56.220> the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
okay wait for the flutter go back the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.530 
okay wait for the flutter go back the
other<00:02:56.400> direction<00:02:57.349> and<00:02:59.030> wait<00:03:00.030> for<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.299> flutter

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
other direction and wait for the flutter

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.009 
other direction and wait for the flutter
again<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.079> now<00:03:01.920> your<00:03:02.099> endpoints<00:03:02.430> are<00:03:02.519> set

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
again and now your endpoints are set

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.210 
again and now your endpoints are set
we're<00:03:04.019> done<00:03:04.170> with<00:03:04.319> that<00:03:04.439> step<00:03:04.709> let's<00:03:05.010> go<00:03:05.129> ahead

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
we're done with that step let's go ahead

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.630 
we're done with that step let's go ahead
and<00:03:05.400> move<00:03:05.549> on<00:03:06.319> to<00:03:07.319> step<00:03:07.620> off<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:07.890> tail<00:03:08.250> sensor

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
and move on to step off the tail sensor

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.060 
and move on to step off the tail sensor
direction
