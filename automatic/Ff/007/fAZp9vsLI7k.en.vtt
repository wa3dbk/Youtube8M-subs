I<00:04:57.480> said<00:04:57.630> the<00:04:57.840> scratch<00:04:58.260> started<00:04:58.590> with<00:04:58.680> a<00:04:58.710> drop

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
I said the scratch started with a drop

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.770 
I said the scratch started with a drop
test<00:04:59.220> that<00:04:59.370> I<00:04:59.430> did<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.670> other<00:04:59.760> day<00:04:59.820> over<00:05:00.180> here

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
test that I did the other day over here

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.870 
test that I did the other day over here
kind<00:05:01.650> of<00:05:01.740> spread<00:05:01.980> when<00:05:02.130> I<00:05:02.160> did<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.370> hammer<00:05:02.610> on

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
kind of spread when I did the hammer on

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.490 
kind of spread when I did the hammer on
this<00:05:03.090> area<00:05:03.330> obviously<00:05:03.600> it's<00:05:03.930> gonna<00:05:04.020> be<00:05:04.140> easier

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
this area obviously it's gonna be easier

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.260 
this area obviously it's gonna be easier
to<00:05:04.590> spread<00:05:04.830> so<00:05:05.370> maybe<00:05:05.580> if<00:05:05.670> it's<00:05:05.880> a<00:05:05.970> brand<00:05:06.120> new

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
to spread so maybe if it's a brand new

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.090 
to spread so maybe if it's a brand new
iPhone<00:05:06.600> it<00:05:06.750> wouldn't<00:05:07.080> have<00:05:07.260> done<00:05:07.560> you<00:05:07.980> know<00:05:08.040> I

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
iPhone it wouldn't have done you know I

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.890 
iPhone it wouldn't have done you know I
was<00:05:08.220> bad<00:05:08.430> right<00:05:08.610> here<00:05:08.910> let's<00:05:09.360> go<00:05:09.510> ahead<00:05:09.600> and

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
was bad right here let's go ahead and

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.340 
was bad right here let's go ahead and
see<00:05:10.620> if<00:05:10.650> I<00:05:10.740> could<00:05:10.890> actually<00:05:10.920> break<00:05:11.640> this<00:05:11.790> thing

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.300 

all<00:05:16.350> right<00:05:16.440> so<00:05:16.590> I<00:05:16.620> practice<00:05:17.010> a<00:05:17.070> little<00:05:17.130> bit

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
all right so I practice a little bit

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.760 
all right so I practice a little bit
more<00:05:17.870> but<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:18.990> display<00:05:19.320> is<00:05:19.380> still<00:05:19.590> working

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
more but the display is still working

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.590 
more but the display is still working
all<00:05:20.070> right<00:05:20.160> you<00:05:20.220> know<00:05:20.310> what<00:05:20.430> I'll<00:05:20.670> just<00:05:20.970> save

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
all right you know what I'll just save

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.030 
all right you know what I'll just save
that<00:05:21.810> to<00:05:21.990> it<00:05:22.050> for<00:05:22.260> another<00:05:22.530> video<00:05:22.740> I<00:05:22.890> guess

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
that to it for another video I guess

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.550 
that to it for another video I guess
because<00:05:23.730> it<00:05:24.720> doesn't<00:05:25.020> want<00:05:25.080> to<00:05:25.200> crack<00:05:25.350> I<00:05:25.380> mean

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
because it doesn't want to crack I mean

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.140 
because it doesn't want to crack I mean
the<00:05:25.620> displayed<00:05:25.950> won't<00:05:26.310> stop<00:05:26.550> working<00:05:26.700> so

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
the displayed won't stop working so

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.790 
the displayed won't stop working so
that's<00:05:27.780> pretty<00:05:28.020> impressive<00:05:28.200> anyway<00:05:28.650> that's

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
that's pretty impressive anyway that's

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.290 
that's pretty impressive anyway that's
