there<00:00:49.500> are<00:00:49.680> other<00:00:50.100> videos<00:00:50.370> about<00:00:50.909> this<00:00:51.089> is<00:00:51.269> a

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
there are other videos about this is a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.229 
there are other videos about this is a
permaculture<00:00:52.080> aspect<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.670> was<00:00:53.850> created<00:00:54.210> by

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
permaculture aspect that was created by

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.500 
permaculture aspect that was created by
I<00:00:54.390> think<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:54.870> New<00:00:55.080> Zealand<00:00:55.370> permaculturist

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
I think in New Zealand permaculturist

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.759 
I think in New Zealand permaculturist
permaculture<00:00:57.510> was<00:00:57.659> invented<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.320> Australia

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
permaculture was invented in Australia

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.090 
permaculture was invented in Australia
by<00:00:58.949> bill<00:00:59.220> Morrison<00:00:59.790> but<00:01:00.479> this<00:01:00.780> system<00:01:01.140> was

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
by bill Morrison but this system was

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.810 
by bill Morrison but this system was
invented<00:01:02.519> by<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.970> Kiwi<00:01:03.839> I<00:01:03.870> believe<00:01:04.559> now<00:01:05.280> how<00:01:05.610> it

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
invented by a Kiwi I believe now how it

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.600 
invented by a Kiwi I believe now how it
works<00:01:06.120> is<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.450> need<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.870> live<00:01:07.260> part<00:01:07.710> with<00:01:08.250> lots

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
works is you need a live part with lots

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.850 
works is you need a live part with lots
of<00:01:08.820> holes<00:01:09.150> drilled<00:01:09.750> into<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.560> worms

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
of holes drilled into it so the worms

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.360 
of holes drilled into it so the worms
can<00:01:11.340> move<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:11.970> out<00:01:12.120> of<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.450> garden<00:01:12.960> and

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
can move in and out of the garden and

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.460 
can move in and out of the garden and
you<00:01:14.370> need<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.820> fill<00:01:15.120> it<00:01:15.270> with<00:01:15.479> old<00:01:15.780> rotting

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
you need to fill it with old rotting

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.670 
you need to fill it with old rotting
manure<00:01:16.799> or<00:01:17.220> compost<00:01:17.720> put<00:01:18.720> your<00:01:18.899> worms<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.469> and

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
manure or compost put your worms in and

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.980 
manure or compost put your worms in and
then<00:01:19.860> fry<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.399> kitchen<00:01:20.759> scraps<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.270> top<00:01:21.539> now

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
then fry your kitchen scraps on top now

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.749 
then fry your kitchen scraps on top now
they<00:01:22.170> show<00:01:22.409> all<00:01:22.619> these<00:01:22.799> kitchen<00:01:23.219> scraps<00:01:23.490> in

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
they show all these kitchen scraps in

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.490 
they show all these kitchen scraps in
big<00:01:24.000> chunky<00:01:24.479> pieces<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.200> but<00:01:25.380> you

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
big chunky pieces and that but you

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.289 
big chunky pieces and that but you
really<00:01:25.799> need<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.039> break<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.610> down<00:01:26.640> worms<00:01:27.119> have

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
really need to break it down worms have

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.170 
really need to break it down worms have
got<00:01:27.420> small<00:01:27.840> mouths<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:29.610> more<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.939> break

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
got small mouths and the more you break

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.630 
got small mouths and the more you break
it<00:01:30.359> down<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:31.229> more<00:01:31.500> they'll<00:01:31.740> consume<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
it down the more they'll consume and the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.270 
it down the more they'll consume and the
faster<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.329> they'll<00:01:33.570> work<00:01:33.810> now<00:01:34.289> the<00:01:34.409> idea<00:01:34.979> is

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
faster that they'll work now the idea is

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.330 
faster that they'll work now the idea is
is<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.180> when<00:01:36.420> they're<00:01:36.630> consuming<00:01:37.289> this<00:01:37.500> food

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
is that when they're consuming this food

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.399 
is that when they're consuming this food
they<00:01:38.909> will<00:01:39.060> then<00:01:39.210> move<00:01:39.509> off<00:01:39.810> through<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
they will then move off through the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.590 
they will then move off through the
holes<00:01:40.649> back<00:01:41.159> into<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> karlon<00:01:41.969> beds<00:01:42.210> around

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
holes back into the karlon beds around

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.779 
holes back into the karlon beds around
here<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.560> light<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:44.039> and<00:01:44.159> distribute<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
here and light it and distribute the

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.240 
here and light it and distribute the
castings<00:01:45.359> now<00:01:46.350> lots<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.710> people<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:47.130> been

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
castings now lots of people have been

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.370 
castings now lots of people have been
doing<00:01:47.429> this<00:01:47.609> for<00:01:47.880> years<00:01:48.119> now<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.810> getting

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
doing this for years now and getting

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.880 
doing this for years now and getting
really<00:01:49.799> really<00:01:50.189> good<00:01:50.719> results<00:01:51.719> how<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.500> can

garden<00:02:24.330> as<00:02:24.600> well<00:02:24.780> so

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
garden as well so

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.300 
garden as well so
they're<00:02:25.840> breathing<00:02:26.320> up<00:02:26.470> they'll<00:02:26.710> breeding

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
they're breathing up they'll breeding

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.430 
they're breathing up they'll breeding
and<00:02:27.550> live<00:02:27.970> around<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.330> garden<00:02:28.810> come<00:02:29.020> in<00:02:29.230> and

and live around the garden come in and
then<00:02:29.980> eventually<00:02:30.280> you<00:02:30.610> might<00:02:30.820> decide<00:02:31.240> that

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
then eventually you might decide that

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.910 
then eventually you might decide that
you've<00:02:31.720> got<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.840> larger<00:02:32.260> garden<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.740> you've

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
you've got a larger garden that you've

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.610 
you've got a larger garden that you've
added<00:02:33.100> more<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:33.940> these<00:02:34.270> underground<00:02:34.810> pipeline

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
added more of these underground pipeline

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
added more of these underground pipeline
farms<00:02:36.100> as<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:37.060> go<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:37.990> can<00:02:38.020> also<00:02:38.470> water<00:02:39.340> from

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
farms as you go you can also water from

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.880 
farms as you go you can also water from
the<00:02:39.760> top<00:02:39.970> so<00:02:40.570> when<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.050> water<00:02:41.290> comes<00:02:41.560> through

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
the top so when the water comes through

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.060 
the top so when the water comes through
it's<00:02:42.760> distributed<00:02:43.510> nice<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:44.080> deep<00:02:44.320> into<00:02:44.620> the

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
it's distributed nice and deep into the

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.520 
it's distributed nice and deep into the
root<00:02:45.310> zone<00:02:45.340> of<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:45.940> plants<00:02:46.480> just<00:02:46.630> remember

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
root zone of the plants just remember

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.950 
root zone of the plants just remember
that<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:47.890> further<00:02:48.160> away<00:02:48.400> you<00:02:48.640> are<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.390> less

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
that the further away you are the less

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.080 
that the further away you are the less
water<00:02:50.470> these<00:02:50.680> guys<00:02:50.980> will<00:02:51.250> get<00:02:51.370> on<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.640> outside

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
water these guys will get on the outside

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.360 
water these guys will get on the outside
so<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:52.450> will<00:02:52.540> need<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:52.930> water<00:02:53.350> them<00:02:53.560> now<00:02:53.980> worms

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
so you will need to water them now worms

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.240 
so you will need to water them now worms
hate<00:02:55.030> chlorine<00:02:55.900> so<00:02:56.530> if<00:02:56.650> you're<00:02:56.770> going<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:57.010> heat

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.400 
hate chlorine so if you're going to heat
them<00:02:57.370> up<00:02:57.490> with<00:02:57.640> chlorine<00:02:58.090> they<00:02:58.570> possibly<00:02:59.110> will

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
them up with chlorine they possibly will

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.160 
them up with chlorine they possibly will
die<00:02:59.620> and<00:02:59.980> it<00:03:00.100> will<00:03:00.190> kill<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.430> eggs<00:03:00.820> as<00:03:01.120> well<00:03:01.170> so

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
die and it will kill the eggs as well so

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.370 
die and it will kill the eggs as well so
