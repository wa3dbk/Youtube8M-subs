00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:05.350
 to the point of not going to the global there was a crisis that goes on forever 

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:08.620
 irregularities 1 loeb then often 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:13.709
 this one five minutes earlier 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.230
 a third video of 1 36 the English company 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.509
 Geneste Lepine is the concern of all 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:21.460
 so here you go 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.079
 so for that reason the idea in the Netherlands 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.949
 you speak 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.949
 to retrieve a third soldier from the panoply 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.410
 while therein 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.410
 for what you want 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.090
 pierrick pivron 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.100
 filo filo 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.480
 so here we have passed the first step 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.260
 oxia by the options to be quite 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.540
 so we see here that we can and we must bring back 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.110
 target the dollar whistlers 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.650
 so auctioneers 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.570
 so we will learn 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.140
 % trades respectively 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.500
 in e3 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.830
 so it's not limited destroying 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.660
 to do this you have to go to the barracks 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.150
 for fraud 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.630
 yes the benefits to see her 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.630
 we are surprised we will not make a hard blow because it stops close 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.200
 according to the media 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.420
 so for 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.340
 to learn them it is necessary to return finally 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.490
 it takes by water 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.490
 apocalypse a lover aarau foreman 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.880
 here in the street 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.430
 we were scared 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.580
 charon has a job 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.000
 it's my buddy it's his boss who sends you 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.770
 he is a little stressed but nice 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.280
 What can I do for you 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.150
 gold the cat a cat wandering in the feet 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.510
 it's exactly what everyone is saving us 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.510
 there are many things to do in this farm 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.320
 what are you interested in 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.960
 I took into account in the north 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.960
 they have 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.790
 the basis of any society is born a strong team that relies on the 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.310
 peasants sow harvest maintain and many others weigh on the 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.179
 country responsibility 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:14.090
 in addition to news many people 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.329
 the peasant maintains the land it is a man the job 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.650
 I start by teaching you how to sunset I roll up the 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.650
 sleeves and I'm getting ready to harvest 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.350
 here you know what it takes to get started 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.549
 go by the boss 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.939
 who will give you work 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.999
 we will go see the boss 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:34.659
 which is therefore 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.659
 at the position is invited his moderator 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:43.539
 we're going to take a little jump to not take too much 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:45.029
 so here I go 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:48.029
 using my side mow 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:50.669
 elliott who are born scared 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.019
 flax cultivation 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.179
 for complicity 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:56.429
 to complete the quest 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:59.419
 you see these fights bunched of laissez-faire dollars 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:00.469
 for my part I do 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.119
 mowing targeted for the sporting part she 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.129
 and for those who do not like to take it 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.129
 we will propose 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.999
 we will make it simple 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:15.269
 in principle 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.269
 next click on one of his dreams 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:23.429
 I will spend so when my name is 12 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.019
 for 100 euros found himself entitled to kill them 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:31.789
 here I hope a little 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:33.269
 explain something to you 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.269
 we could see that we learned the craft of 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:40.069
 and for that the chemist ali the chemical be 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.689
 so there are several hits 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.309
 gold kinds of trades so there are harvest trades 100 more 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:47.949
 harvesting trades and craft trades 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.949
 crafts is all that is more subtle 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:53.469
 for 2011 m 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:55.429
 and so it creates areas 

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:57.689
 but in short amulets r 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.749
 what to attack to all this 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:03.449
 a chorus of tutorials for each job a little later 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.669
 our advancement in 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.479
 in this survey followed 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:12.009
 so if you have questions about certain trades 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:13.429
 do not hesitate to us 

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:16.269
 let it know in comment 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.169
 new comments on the video overview chain 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.699
 neither sent back myself 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.240
 ten years ago 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.789
 finally it will be a pleasure to debray 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:25.600
 the power 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.330
 forty-eight hours 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.629
 Well, I think I said it all 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:32.990
 cars for my part I did not know 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.990
 so we give ourselves an appointment 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.090
 we have seen michel guyot 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.999
 so I run a net pataky exchange 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:44.819
 and I accept 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.389
 I give you 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.389
 we can quite 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.150
 Gauclin 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.139
 we can finish the quest now 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.300
 so why not reaction 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.300
 so I can not you 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.220
 here we got 2 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.819
 the 5th 3rd period 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:09.069
 and that offers critics 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:12.210
 quite illegitimate tomorrow the three systems that we already have 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.210
 harvested here is the title 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.840
 by this agreement so we will look at states of the planet and as I you 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.020
 was explaining 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.209
 we already imagine delicate remains more features 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:35.400
 the movement is for the future 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.770
 the bad spirits tense a little the short side if we find ourselves for aures 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.949
 the approach of quebec will allow us in the cellar 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:42.909
 here's 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:46.050
 once the fighting has accelerated for the people 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.339
 emmi is too much 

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:50.210
 a race that we will meet again

 Why 

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:57.550
 released on the 5th 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.539
 a man who does not know at which level we will try 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:02.559
 for franck just after the rest 

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:05.559
 a second who just now may be stopping a rapist 

00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:11.809
 for alain quinet and me 

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:15.629
 we arrive at level 5 and we are on the manna in search of gain of 0

 advance improve 

00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:48.869
 as avenue 

00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:50.059
 at best if if you have
