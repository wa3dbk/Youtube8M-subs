00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 Hello my name is Thomas Frank I 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.339
 am the development engineer for the 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.870
 new corsa 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.960
 that means responsible for everyone 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.370
 driving characteristics in the vehicle 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:18.210
 aerodynamic acoustics driving behavior 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:21.570
 fuel consumption etc and yes I have 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.490
 the project started but then on 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.460
 my friendly colleague werner 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.810
 service passed 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.849
 yes my name is such a legal one 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.529
 basis projectes and with 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.910
 any responsibilities so 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.820
 Of course, then we concentrate 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.380
 in particular the vehicle characteristics 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.410
 that is what we are in 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.950
 need to take care of daily business 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.200
 priority in development in the new corsa 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.530
 were compared to the predecessor of the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.820
 driving behavior for example to improve 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.410
 we put a lot of emphasis on it 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.420
 to offer a comfortable chassis 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.609
 which is also a lot of fun 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.239
 makes regarding steering precision and 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.250
 handling 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.750
 I think we succeeded very much 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.100
 to make a good compromise 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.400
 and yes both with the colleagues as well 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.570
 our chassis came with our board 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.979
 very good 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.869
 we had already recently 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.030
 already journalists in the vehicle 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.759
 set and these were also full of 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.100
 praise so I think we are very very 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.110
 well placed yes not to forget 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.400
 and also an engine of our new one 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:33.120
 Three-cylinder engine really one 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:38.220
 new record set in relation to 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.540
 noise development on drivability 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.730
 fuel consumption 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.470
 So that's possible one of the highlights 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.680
 from our new corsa 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.270
 we are on a so-called 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.010
 validation wright on one 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.860
 validation side, it is important that 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.280
 We use the whole component systems 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.990
 in the vehicle are installed on each other 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.180
 still marginal vote 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.770
 we check if the functions are so 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.690
 work the way they work 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.730
 Should the systems be correct 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.860
 communicate with each other and 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.800
 accordingly we have a cross 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.620
 Functional steam with the experts 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.600
 from all areas exactly so we 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.300
 then drive with experts from the 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.950
 areas like the people around it 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.840
 Take care of vehicle air conditioning 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.530
 the people for the phrase acoustics 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.420
 responsible are people who are here 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.430
 chassis are responsible and all 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.350
 They check their individual components 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.880
 and in particular and that is 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.680
 crucial in such a validation 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.260
 for the vehicle like the im 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.060
 listen total context whether it is 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.730
 we have to manage the interfaces 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.080
 and that also happens in that sense 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.330
 as we imagined 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.489
 Last week we had one 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.090
 validation wright with our board 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:56.140
 So with k thomas neumann but also 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.390
 the white house of development and us 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.280
 had our corsa opposite the 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.340
 Competitors are therefore faced with the 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.800
 Competitive vehicles 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.970
 and I can say so it was a very 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.800
 good result 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.060
 we have improved properly and 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.570
 have an absolutely competitive 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:21.040
 put product on its legs which 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:23.019
 regarding comfort acoustics engine 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:29.290
 behavior acceleration et 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:30.850
 Cetera arrive well is rarely so much 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.569
 get an important praise as at 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:38.719
 not pleased with this phase 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.670
 a car and that is something really great 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:43.010
 can be and if the suggestion 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.620
 is possible of course with right 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.599
 and the beautiful was that we too 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.129
 still journalists have taken the 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.959
 Switzerland was practically not clean anymore 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.579
 internal assessment now from this 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.609
 vehicle and we have journalists 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:59.900
 Experts set in the cars rich 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:01.430
 and also those were full of praise and it 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.620
 was really nice to see how the with 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.219
 grinning faces from the car 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.129
 got out and own even has 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:11.989
 that is my car that is 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.310
 really what us natural and one 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.949
 better feedback than not sure 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.259
 we wish we have one here now 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:20.509
 new three-cylinder engine we have the 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:23.870
 engine completely redeveloped he is 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:25.789
 So very small 1 liter displacement is only 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.620
 therefore very efficient from consumption 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:29.539
 small but we have tried now 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.979
 to make this engine look like this 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:33.289
 that he feels like a big so 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.430
 once he has 115 ps that means he does 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.289
 really much fun has a high 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.699
 torque 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.650
 what you notice when driving that so 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.120
 similar to the driving pleasure of the diesel 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.340
 It would be synonymous with the gasoline engine have 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.990
 turbo charging and on the other hand we have 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.389
 developed them so far that he very much 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.229
 It is quiet that they feel that way 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.780
 they really drive a big one 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.330
 Engine of broich from the running gentlemen 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.190
 that was the compromise a little 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.289
 engine look great but small 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.389
 remain in consumption we do have a 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.460
 completely new engine a completely new 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.050
 the gear on the stand 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.330
 but now really in the test 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.270
 vehicle integrated with the suspension 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.199
 under all roads and rat conditions 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.759
 must not rattle anything 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.650
 we must not be unusual 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:14.870
 recognize noises and that check 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.919
 Let's go from a process that can 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.870
 one actually only then on the 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.330
 make street and on bad 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:24.320
 because, for example, that's really there 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:26.719
 Everything sounds solid we have a great deal 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.520
 good experts so these 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:30.349
 then identify where 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.669
 comes ago now that's just a 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:32.599
 stone that has fallen in somewhere 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.490
 a ride or is that really 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:36.770
 anything in the engine in gear or in 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.520
 the suspension we the we 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.159
 can improve 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.750
 and then we usually have two 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:44.029
 Three different parts to try 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.320
 still and then the best vote too 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:45.760
 a lot of 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.290
 that means we change again the 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.500
 Share and watch if maybe a something 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:54.750
 lighter stock works better around 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.750
 then to find the optimal one
