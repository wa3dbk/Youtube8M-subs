00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.209 
built them longer up that way because
she'd<00:01:57.749> already<00:01:57.869> worn<00:01:58.200> down<00:01:58.349> the<00:01:58.529> edges<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.069> we

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
she'd already worn down the edges so we

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.649 
she'd already worn down the edges so we
knew<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.429> she<00:01:59.729> would<00:01:59.849> probably<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:00.420> we<00:02:00.450> made

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
knew that she would probably if we made

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.120 
knew that she would probably if we made
them<00:02:00.779> longer<00:02:01.109> this<00:02:01.259> way<00:02:01.409> she<00:02:01.619> would<00:02:01.770> probably

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
them longer this way she would probably

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.010 
them longer this way she would probably
destroy<00:02:02.279> them<00:02:02.609> all<00:02:02.759> again<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.719> we<00:02:03.869> actually

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
destroy them all again so we actually

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.529 
destroy them all again so we actually
raised<00:02:04.649> all<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.159> gums<00:02:05.369> up<00:02:05.609> we<00:02:06.179> made<00:02:06.389> them

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
raised all the gums up we made them

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.410 
raised all the gums up we made them
symmetrical<00:02:07.229> we<00:02:07.950> also<00:02:08.160> put<00:02:08.729> in

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
symmetrical we also put in

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.870 
symmetrical we also put in
teeth<00:02:11.319> that<00:02:11.530> she<00:02:11.740> had<00:02:11.890> very<00:02:12.190> much<00:02:12.400> weird<00:02:12.670> all

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
teeth that she had very much weird all

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.210 
teeth that she had very much weird all
hand<00:02:13.270> designed<00:02:13.660> all<00:02:13.870> this<00:02:14.050> so<00:02:14.380> that<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.980> gave

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
hand designed all this so that it gave

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.980 
hand designed all this so that it gave
to<00:02:15.390> characterization<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.540> can<00:02:16.660> see<00:02:16.840> that

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
to characterization you can see that

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.020 
to characterization you can see that
edges<00:02:17.350> are<00:02:17.470> not<00:02:17.709> quite<00:02:18.040> perfectly<00:02:18.670> straight

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
edges are not quite perfectly straight

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.660 
edges are not quite perfectly straight
they<00:02:19.480> they<00:02:20.200> they're<00:02:20.590> slight<00:02:20.920> little<00:02:21.160> natural

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
they they they're slight little natural

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.040 
they they they're slight little natural
imperfections<00:02:21.880> that<00:02:22.300> were<00:02:22.450> built<00:02:22.690> into<00:02:22.959> her

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
imperfections that were built into her

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.620 
imperfections that were built into her
teeth<00:02:23.350> we<00:02:23.920> put<00:02:24.130> natural<00:02:24.630> characterizations

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
teeth we put natural characterizations

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.750 
teeth we put natural characterizations
through<00:02:25.900> like<00:02:26.140> little<00:02:26.380> white<00:02:26.530> tips<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:27.640> know

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
through like little white tips you know

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.060 
through like little white tips you know
so<00:02:28.030> we<00:02:28.780> tried<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.080> make<00:02:29.350> them<00:02:29.500> look<00:02:29.590> as<00:02:29.770> natural

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
so we tried to make them look as natural

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.500 
so we tried to make them look as natural
as<00:02:30.430> possible<00:02:30.459> so<00:02:30.850> that<00:02:30.910> no<00:02:31.150> one<00:02:31.300> would<00:02:31.450> ever

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
as possible so that no one would ever

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.320 
as possible so that no one would ever
know<00:02:31.660> what<00:02:32.230> she<00:02:32.380> had<00:02:32.470> done<00:02:33.120> but<00:02:34.120> she<00:02:34.240> would

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
know what she had done but she would

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.790 
know what she had done but she would
have<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.570> perfect<00:02:34.990> smile<00:02:35.230> on<00:02:35.470> her<00:02:35.620> wedding

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
have the perfect smile on her wedding

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.510 
have the perfect smile on her wedding
day<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.870> this<00:02:37.870> is<00:02:38.080> her<00:02:38.410> close-up<00:02:38.890> smile<00:02:39.220> now

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
day and this is her close-up smile now

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.210 
day and this is her close-up smile now
so<00:02:40.360> she's<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:40.540> lot<00:02:40.810> less<00:02:40.989> scummy<00:02:41.290> she<00:02:42.010> didn't

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
so she's a lot less scummy she didn't

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.030 
so she's a lot less scummy she didn't
have<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.489> restrict<00:02:42.850> her<00:02:43.030> lips<00:02:43.239> anymore<00:02:43.720> and

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
have to restrict her lips anymore and

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.199 
have to restrict her lips anymore and
this<00:02:45.040> is<00:02:45.220> her<00:02:45.400> smiling<00:02:47.459> with<00:02:48.459> her<00:02:48.580> eyes<00:02:48.850> I

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
this is her smiling with her eyes I

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.440 
this is her smiling with her eyes I
think<00:02:49.600> this<00:02:50.260> done<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:50.830> know<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.190> she<00:02:51.459> said<00:02:51.760> to

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
think this done you know and she said to

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.990 
think this done you know and she said to
me<00:02:52.630> it<00:02:53.320> was<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.470> best<00:02:53.620> thing<00:02:54.190> she's<00:02:54.459> ever<00:02:54.580> done

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
me it was the best thing she's ever done

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.480 
me it was the best thing she's ever done
for<00:02:55.300> her<00:02:55.450> life

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.550
