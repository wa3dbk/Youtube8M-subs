so forth why does that occur for a

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.840 
so forth why does that occur for a
couple<00:00:51.620> of<00:00:51.710> reasons<00:00:51.829> this<00:00:52.130> is<00:00:52.190> a<00:00:52.340> box<00:00:52.640> that

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
couple of reasons this is a box that

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.580 
couple of reasons this is a box that
gets<00:00:52.940> put<00:00:53.180> in<00:00:53.270> the<00:00:53.450> wall<00:00:53.630> more<00:00:53.930> modern<00:00:54.320> one<00:00:54.470> in

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
gets put in the wall more modern one in

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.770 
gets put in the wall more modern one in
plastic<00:00:55.070> one<00:00:55.220> here<00:00:55.489> but<00:00:56.270> when<00:00:56.510> they<00:00:56.600> cut<00:00:56.750> the

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
plastic one here but when they cut the

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.319 
plastic one here but when they cut the
drywall<00:00:57.079> in<00:00:57.500> you<00:00:57.920> can<00:00:58.070> have<00:00:58.160> space<00:00:58.520> around<00:00:59.000> the

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
drywall in you can have space around the

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.900 
drywall in you can have space around the
sides<00:00:59.570> of<00:00:59.809> the<00:00:59.870> box<00:01:00.110> that<00:01:00.590> are<00:01:00.649> open<00:01:01.130> and

there's big openings in the back that

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:04.990 
there's big openings in the back that
you<00:01:03.590> knock<00:01:03.829> out<00:01:04.070> that<00:01:04.219> while<00:01:04.399> the<00:01:04.549> wiring<00:01:04.969> to

you knock out that while the wiring to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.819 
you knock out that while the wiring to
come<00:01:05.269> through<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:06.170> that<00:01:06.290> goes<00:01:06.439> through<00:01:06.710> the

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 
come through so that goes through the

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.580 
come through so that goes through the
drywall<00:01:07.360> back<00:01:08.360> into<00:01:08.690> the<00:01:08.810> insulation<00:01:09.500> and

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
there opens this box up to the cold air

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.560 
there opens this box up to the cold air
that's<00:01:15.950> hitting<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.400> exterior<00:01:16.850> wall<00:01:17.299> of<00:01:17.330> the

basically<00:01:28.549> a<00:01:28.640> piece<00:01:28.880> of<00:01:29.000> foam<00:01:29.180> this<00:01:29.780> one's<00:01:30.049> for

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
basically a piece of foam this one's for

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.469 
basically a piece of foam this one's for
an<00:01:30.290> electrical<00:01:30.680> outlet<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.880> this<00:01:32.119> one's<00:01:32.299> for

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
an electrical outlet and this one's for

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.300 
an electrical outlet and this one's for
a<00:01:32.510> light<00:01:32.630> switch<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.710> what<00:01:34.040> they're<00:01:34.159> going<00:01:34.250> to

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
a light switch and what they're going to

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.830 
a light switch and what they're going to
do<00:01:34.400> on<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.610> box<00:01:34.820> is<00:01:35.210> they're<00:01:35.479> actually<00:01:35.750> going

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
do on the box is they're actually going

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.469 
do on the box is they're actually going
to<00:01:35.930> cover<00:01:36.229> up<00:01:36.470> some<00:01:37.310> of<00:01:37.400> that<00:01:37.430> exterior<00:01:38.030> and

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
to cover up some of that exterior and

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.810 
to cover up some of that exterior and
seal<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:38.990> interior<00:01:39.650> tightly<00:01:40.159> also<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:40.670> we

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
seal the interior tightly also so we

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.000 
seal the interior tightly also so we
don't<00:01:41.000> get<00:01:41.119> that<00:01:41.299> airflow<00:01:41.659> so<00:01:42.290> this<00:01:42.439> is<00:01:42.560> really

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
don't get that airflow so this is really

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.859 
don't get that airflow so this is really
simple<00:01:43.250> let's<00:01:43.520> go<00:01:43.670> ahead<00:01:43.760> and<00:01:43.939> put<00:01:44.060> one<00:01:44.090> in<00:01:44.360> the

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
simple let's go ahead and put one in the

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.570 
simple let's go ahead and put one in the
two<00:01:44.990> of<00:01:45.080> them<00:01:45.229> in<00:01:45.320> quickly<00:01:45.680> and<00:01:45.890> just<00:01:46.430> show<00:01:46.549> you

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
two of them in quickly and just show you

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.310 
two of them in quickly and just show you
how<00:01:46.729> that's<00:01:46.850> done<00:01:46.970> all<00:01:47.869> right<00:01:47.930> we're<00:01:48.170> going<00:01:48.290> to

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
how that's done all right we're going to

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.280 
how that's done all right we're going to
start<00:01:48.590> off<00:01:48.710> by<00:01:48.920> removing<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:50.020> cover<00:01:51.020> plate

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
start off by removing the cover plate

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.370 
start off by removing the cover plate
here<00:01:51.670> from<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.759> electrical<00:01:53.240> outlet<00:01:53.600> in<00:01:54.200> this

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
here from the electrical outlet in this

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.990 
here from the electrical outlet in this
case<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.710> power<00:01:54.890> is<00:01:55.220> not<00:01:55.460> off<00:01:55.670> we're<00:01:55.909> not

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
case the power is not off we're not

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.070 
case the power is not off we're not
going<00:01:56.119> to<00:01:56.180> touch<00:01:56.299> any<00:01:56.479> of<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.630> wiring<00:01:56.810> in

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
going to touch any of the wiring in

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.880 
going to touch any of the wiring in
there<00:01:57.229> it's<00:01:57.380> kind<00:01:57.530> of<00:01:57.560> like<00:01:57.619> if<00:01:57.799> you<00:01:57.830> were

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
there it's kind of like if you were

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.100 
there it's kind of like if you were
painting<00:01:58.430> your<00:01:59.240> walls<00:01:59.270> you<00:01:59.780> would<00:01:59.930> go<00:02:00.020> ahead

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
painting your walls you would go ahead

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.620 
painting your walls you would go ahead
and<00:02:00.229> do<00:02:00.409> that<00:02:00.729> and<00:02:01.729> you<00:02:01.790> can<00:02:02.119> see<00:02:02.299> here<00:02:02.479> that

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
and do that and you can see here that

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.690 
and do that and you can see here that
space<00:02:02.960> we<00:02:03.140> were<00:02:03.229> talking<00:02:03.650> about<00:02:03.770> I<00:02:04.159> can<00:02:04.490> slip<00:02:04.640> a

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
space we were talking about I can slip a

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.210 
space we were talking about I can slip a
pretty<00:02:04.970> big<00:02:05.180> blade<00:02:05.540> on<00:02:06.290> that<00:02:06.619> side<00:02:06.890> of<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.130> this

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
pretty big blade on that side of it this

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.550 
pretty big blade on that side of it this
is<00:02:07.400> up<00:02:07.520> against<00:02:07.850> a<00:02:07.909> 2x4<00:02:08.479> but<00:02:08.989> I've<00:02:09.079> got<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.259> gap

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
around this it's open to the outside

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.059 
around this it's open to the outside
wall<00:02:11.540> I<00:02:11.569> also<00:02:11.810> have<00:02:12.049> wiring<00:02:12.319> spots<00:02:12.800> on<00:02:12.980> the

wall I also have wiring spots on the

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.180 
wall I also have wiring spots on the
inside<00:02:13.459> where<00:02:14.209> I'm<00:02:14.330> coming<00:02:14.660> across<00:02:14.980> so<00:02:15.980> pretty

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
inside where I'm coming across so pretty

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:24.360 
inside where I'm coming across so pretty
simply<00:02:16.610> I'm<00:02:16.970> going<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.180> put<00:02:17.300> this<00:02:17.420> in<00:02:17.599> place
