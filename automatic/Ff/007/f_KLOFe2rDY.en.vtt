00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.220 

man<00:00:15.330> yeah<00:00:17.089> the<00:00:18.089> way<00:00:18.240> stars<00:00:18.599> live<00:00:18.929> and<00:00:19.080> die

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
man yeah the way stars live and die

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.140 
man yeah the way stars live and die
makes<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.740> lot<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:19.890> sense<00:00:20.220> if<00:00:20.669> you<00:00:20.789> consider

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
makes a lot of sense if you consider

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.679 
makes a lot of sense if you consider
what<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.419> star<00:00:21.779> really<00:00:22.169> is<00:00:23.029> simply<00:00:24.029> put<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.449> star

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
what a star really is simply put a star

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.779 
what a star really is simply put a star
is<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> large<00:00:25.199> amount<00:00:25.499> of<00:00:25.589> gas<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.039> dust<00:00:26.099> that

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
is a large amount of gas and dust that

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.019 
is a large amount of gas and dust that
is<00:00:26.820> collapsing<00:00:27.570> under<00:00:27.839> the<00:00:27.929> force<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.289> gravity

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
is collapsing under the force of gravity

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.240 
is collapsing under the force of gravity
at<00:00:30.029> first<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.989> crush<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.470> gravity<00:00:31.499> makes<00:00:32.099> the

at first this crush of gravity makes the

a<00:00:34.079> nuclear<00:00:34.500> explosion<00:00:34.949> this<00:00:35.940> explosion

00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:36.359 
a nuclear explosion this explosion

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:38.360 
a nuclear explosion this explosion
supports<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.199> star<00:00:37.440> against<00:00:37.800> gravity<00:00:37.859> and

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
supports the star against gravity and

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.479

nothing<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.929> support<00:00:52.050> gravity<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.160> once<00:00:53.550> again

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
nothing to support gravity so once again

the star starts collapsing what happens
next<00:00:56.820> depends<00:00:57.359> on<00:00:57.600> how<00:00:57.750> much<00:00:57.960> mass<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.469> star

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679 
next depends on how much mass the star

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.919 
next depends on how much mass the star
had<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> beginning<00:00:59.429> and<00:00:59.699> which<00:01:00.390> forces<00:01:00.719> of

and becomes a bottomless pit that we

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.260 
and becomes a bottomless pit that we

call a black hole nothing can escape the

reason we call them black is that the

reason we call them black is that the

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
gravity is so intense it can actually

gravity is so intense it can actually
pull<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.420> light<00:02:06.810> itself<00:02:08.180> so<00:02:09.180> the<00:02:09.450> final<00:02:09.780> death

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930

of<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.140> star<00:02:10.380> depends<00:02:10.830> on<00:02:10.980> its<00:02:11.100> mass<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.820> what
