earlier<00:00:07.109> on<00:00:07.259> in<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.470> season<00:00:07.710> I<00:00:07.980> had<00:00:08.160> my

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
earlier on in the season I had my

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.370 
earlier on in the season I had my
brainwaves<00:00:08.880> made<00:00:09.240> into<00:00:09.480> music<00:00:09.870> it<00:00:10.080> was<00:00:10.200> to

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
brainwaves made into music it was to

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.799 
brainwaves made into music it was to
create<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.679> CD<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.519> help<00:00:11.730> me<00:00:11.880> sleep<00:00:12.179> or<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:12.570> wake

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
create a CD to help me sleep or to wake

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.079 
create a CD to help me sleep or to wake
me<00:00:13.019> up<00:00:13.170> now<00:00:13.830> music<00:00:14.160> from<00:00:14.460> brainwaves<00:00:14.940> is

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
me up now music from brainwaves is

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.240 
me up now music from brainwaves is
becoming<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.570> group<00:00:15.929> experience<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.949> we<00:00:17.039> went

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
becoming a group experience and we went

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.370 
becoming a group experience and we went
to<00:00:17.369> check<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.730> out

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.470 

tonight<00:00:25.130> there's<00:00:25.490> going<00:00:25.700> to<00:00:25.790> be<00:00:25.880> a<00:00:25.970> concert

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:36.460 
tonight there's going to be a concert
unlike<00:00:27.020> any<00:00:27.320> that's<00:00:27.740> come<00:00:28.010> before<00:00:35.470> everyone

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
unlike any that's come before everyone

unlike any that's come before everyone
in<00:00:36.620> the<00:00:36.710> audience<00:00:36.920> will<00:00:37.430> enter<00:00:37.730> a<00:00:37.760> special

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
in the audience will enter a special

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.570 
in the audience will enter a special
headspace<00:00:38.810> that's<00:00:39.650> because<00:00:39.950> their<00:00:40.160> brains

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
headspace that's because their brains

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:57.220 
headspace that's because their brains
are<00:00:41.030> providing<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:41.720> entertainment<00:00:56.230> like

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
are providing the entertainment like

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.990 
are providing the entertainment like
what<00:00:57.409> are<00:00:57.500> they<00:00:57.589> gonna<00:00:57.710> do<00:00:57.980> to<00:00:58.010> me<00:00:58.280> right<00:00:58.670> I

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
what are they gonna do to me right I

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.310 
what are they gonna do to me right I
think<00:00:59.540> you<00:00:59.600> have<00:00:59.690> a<00:00:59.750> special<00:01:00.080> treat<00:01:00.290> here

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
think you have a special treat here

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.009 
think you have a special treat here
because<00:01:01.180> this<00:01:02.180> sort<00:01:02.420> of<00:01:02.479> has<00:01:02.600> have<00:01:02.690> been<00:01:02.839> as

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
because this sort of has have been as

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.840 
because this sort of has have been as
much<00:01:03.170> an<00:01:03.320> experiment<00:01:03.860> for<00:01:04.070> all<00:01:04.280> of<00:01:04.430> us<00:01:04.550> as

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
much an experiment for all of us as

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.190 
much an experiment for all of us as
maybe<00:01:05.180> this<00:01:05.390> is<00:01:05.510> a<00:01:05.570> sort<00:01:05.750> of<00:01:05.810> an<00:01:05.900> experiment

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
maybe this is a sort of an experiment

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.510 
maybe this is a sort of an experiment
for<00:01:06.650> yourself

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.160 
drum beats now everyone's hooked up it's
time<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:57.890> learn<00:02:58.070> how<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.340> play<00:02:58.610> in<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.910> waves

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170

one<00:03:00.170> of<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.320> responses<00:03:00.770> that<00:03:00.800> we're<00:03:01.010> looking

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
one of the responses that we're looking

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.520 
one of the responses that we're looking
for<00:03:01.250> is<00:03:01.610> sort<00:03:01.880> of<00:03:01.910> agitation<00:03:02.390> now<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:03.200> see

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
for is sort of agitation now you see

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.870 
for is sort of agitation now you see
these<00:03:03.650> sort<00:03:03.890> of<00:03:03.950> electricity<00:03:04.310> kind<00:03:04.790> of

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
these sort of electricity kind of

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.060 
these sort of electricity kind of
flashing<00:03:05.150> by<00:03:05.480> on<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.840> screen<00:03:06.170> I<00:03:06.410> sort<00:03:06.920> of<00:03:06.950> like

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
flashing by on the screen I sort of like

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.190 
flashing by on the screen I sort of like
to<00:03:07.100> think<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.400> this<00:03:07.520> as<00:03:07.820> sort<00:03:08.150> of<00:03:08.270> the<00:03:08.690> stage<00:03:08.930> of

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
to think of this as sort of the stage of

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.199 
to think of this as sort of the stage of
music<00:03:09.590> but<00:03:09.860> instead<00:03:10.130> of<00:03:10.190> notes<00:03:10.580> passing<00:03:11.060> by

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
music but instead of notes passing by

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.540 
music but instead of notes passing by
notes<00:03:11.900> now<00:03:12.140> are<00:03:12.350> sort<00:03:12.530> of<00:03:12.590> your<00:03:12.709> EEG<00:03:12.860> and<00:03:13.430> we're

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
notes now are sort of your EEG and we're

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.280 
notes now are sort of your EEG and we're
sort<00:03:13.700> of<00:03:13.760> forming<00:03:14.090> this<00:03:14.209> Orchestra<00:03:14.720> you'll

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
sort of forming this Orchestra you'll

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.500 
sort of forming this Orchestra you'll
notice<00:03:15.650> some<00:03:15.800> of<00:03:15.830> them<00:03:16.010> sort<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.280> flash<00:03:16.489> red<00:03:16.820> so

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
notice some of them sort of flash red so

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.259 
notice some of them sort of flash red so
when<00:03:18.290> it's<00:03:18.440> red<00:03:18.739> it<00:03:19.730> means<00:03:19.820> you're<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.060> little

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
when it's red it means you're a little

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.000 
when it's red it means you're a little
bit<00:03:20.360> agitated<00:03:20.590> so<00:03:21.590> we're<00:03:21.680> probably<00:03:21.860> getting

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
bit agitated so we're probably getting

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.910 
bit agitated so we're probably getting
some<00:03:22.250> muscular<00:03:22.670> response<00:03:23.030> so<00:03:23.959> if<00:03:24.470> you'd<00:03:24.680> sort

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
some muscular response so if you'd sort

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.560 
some muscular response so if you'd sort
of<00:03:24.980> if<00:03:25.190> you<00:03:25.250> sort<00:03:25.430> of<00:03:25.519> clench<00:03:25.760> your<00:03:25.820> teeth<00:03:25.940> or

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
of if you sort of clench your teeth or

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.040 
of if you sort of clench your teeth or
sort<00:03:26.930> of<00:03:26.989> you<00:03:27.140> know<00:03:27.340> grimace<00:03:28.340> there<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.090> go<00:03:29.209> so

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
sort of you know grimace there you go so

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.080 
sort of you know grimace there you go so
you<00:03:30.140> get<00:03:30.230> a<00:03:30.260> lot<00:03:30.380> more<00:03:30.410> red<00:03:30.739> signal<00:03:31.130> phones

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
you get a lot more red signal phones

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.600 
you get a lot more red signal phones
program<00:03:32.600> will<00:03:32.810> screen<00:03:33.200> out<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.739> agitated<00:03:34.250> red

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
program will screen out the agitated red

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.240 
program will screen out the agitated red
signals<00:03:35.090> it<00:03:35.720> will<00:03:35.870> take<00:03:36.110> only<00:03:36.320> the<00:03:36.590> calm<00:03:36.860> white

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
signals it will take only the calm white

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.940 
signals it will take only the calm white
signals<00:03:37.760> and<00:03:38.060> make<00:03:38.209> music<00:03:38.420> of<00:03:38.780> them<00:03:38.989> this<00:03:39.830> is

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
signals and make music of them this is

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.949 
signals and make music of them this is
sort<00:03:40.100> of<00:03:40.160> a<00:03:40.280> biofeedback<00:03:41.120> application<00:03:41.840> if<00:03:41.930> you

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
sort of a biofeedback application if you

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.330 
sort of a biofeedback application if you
I'll<00:03:42.140> try<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:42.350> play<00:03:42.560> around<00:03:42.769> with<00:03:43.010> seeing

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
I'll try to play around with seeing

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.040 
I'll try to play around with seeing
yourself<00:03:43.880> making<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.330> go<00:03:44.450> red<00:03:44.690> and<00:03:44.720> then

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
yourself making it go red and then

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.259 
yourself making it go red and then
relaxing<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:45.709> then<00:03:45.800> making<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.250> kind<00:03:46.850> of<00:03:46.970> take

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
relaxing and then making it kind of take

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.080 
relaxing and then making it kind of take
on<00:03:47.390> a<00:03:47.510> more<00:03:47.750> relaxed<00:03:48.200> state<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:49.340> rehearsal<00:03:49.910> is

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
on a more relaxed state the rehearsal is

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.690 
on a more relaxed state the rehearsal is
over<00:03:50.120> and<00:03:50.810> it's<00:03:51.019> time<00:03:51.110> to<00:03:51.560> perform<00:03:51.700> the

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
over and it's time to perform the

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.090 
over and it's time to perform the
audience<00:03:53.180> meditates<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:54.050> their<00:03:54.320> meditations

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
audience meditates and their meditations

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:15.660 
audience meditates and their meditations
become<00:03:55.610> music

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.310 

not<00:04:16.670> everyone<00:04:17.239> is<00:04:17.389> entranced<00:04:17.840> by<00:04:18.170> the

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
not everyone is entranced by the

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.120 
not everyone is entranced by the
performance<00:04:18.920> it<00:04:19.760> was<00:04:19.850> different<00:04:20.480> I<00:04:21.130> thought

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
performance it was different I thought

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.370 
performance it was different I thought
it<00:04:22.250> would<00:04:22.340> be<00:04:22.490> like<00:04:22.670> more<00:04:24.250> music<00:04:26.380> everything

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
it would be like more music everything

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.980 
it would be like more music everything
just<00:04:27.440> kind<00:04:27.650> of<00:04:27.680> got<00:04:27.800> lost<00:04:27.950> from<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.250> noise<00:04:28.400> and

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
just kind of got lost from the noise and

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.240 
just kind of got lost from the noise and
ended<00:04:29.990> up<00:04:30.080> there<00:04:30.590> wasn't<00:04:30.800> really<00:04:30.860> much<00:04:31.010> of<00:04:31.100> a

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
ended up there wasn't really much of a

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.430 
ended up there wasn't really much of a
rhythm<00:04:31.580> or<00:04:31.750> any<00:04:32.750> kind<00:04:32.870> of<00:04:32.930> melody<00:04:33.169> to<00:04:33.380> the

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
rhythm or any kind of melody to the

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.909 
rhythm or any kind of melody to the
music<00:04:34.090> but<00:04:35.090> some<00:04:35.120> do<00:04:35.630> find<00:04:35.930> harmony<00:04:36.200> of<00:04:36.800> a

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
music but some do find harmony of a

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.920 
music but some do find harmony of a
social<00:04:37.310> nature<00:04:37.490> they<00:04:38.360> looked<00:04:38.570> around<00:04:38.660> and

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
social nature they looked around and

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.290 
social nature they looked around and
everybody's<00:04:39.440> kind<00:04:39.620> of<00:04:40.000> everyone<00:04:41.000> just<00:04:41.180> had

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.570 
but awake at the same time just kind of
as<00:04:51.980> one<00:04:52.820> group<00:04:53.120> that<00:04:53.150> was<00:04:53.750> something<00:04:54.220> I<00:04:55.220> felt

as one group that was something I felt

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.190 
as one group that was something I felt
like<00:04:55.780> like<00:04:56.780> we<00:04:56.990> were<00:04:57.110> all<00:04:58.900> tapping<00:04:59.900> into<00:05:00.050> the

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
like like we were all tapping into the

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:10.300 
like like we were all tapping into the
same<00:05:00.410> energy<00:05:03.850> completely<00:05:04.850> different<00:05:09.310> the

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
same energy completely different the

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.640 
same energy completely different the
James<00:05:10.610> Fung<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.330> concert<00:05:11.810> is<00:05:12.020> a<00:05:12.050> success

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
James Fung the concert is a success

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.000 
James Fung the concert is a success
heard<00:05:13.280> by<00:05:13.550> people<00:05:14.090> and<00:05:14.330> Technology<00:05:15.229> who

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
heard by people and Technology who

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.820 
heard by people and Technology who
really<00:05:16.280> was<00:05:16.430> a<00:05:16.460> composer<00:05:16.820> of<00:05:16.940> that<00:05:17.060> music<00:05:17.830> it's

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
really was a composer of that music it's

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.469 
really was a composer of that music it's
really<00:05:19.070> a<00:05:19.310> shared<00:05:19.580> experience<00:05:20.120> and<00:05:20.210> I<00:05:20.300> think

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
really a shared experience and I think

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.090 
really a shared experience and I think
that's<00:05:20.630> sort<00:05:20.720> of<00:05:20.870> cut<00:05:21.080> against<00:05:21.770> it<00:05:21.830> called<00:05:21.979> the

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
that's sort of cut against it called the

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.060 
that's sort of cut against it called the
question<00:05:22.310> and<00:05:22.640> oceans<00:05:22.970> of<00:05:23.240> know<00:05:23.900> of<00:05:24.169> sort<00:05:24.979> of

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
question and oceans of know of sort of

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.490 
question and oceans of know of sort of
you<00:05:25.940> know<00:05:25.970> who<00:05:26.180> owns<00:05:26.450> this<00:05:26.690> music<00:05:27.080> if<00:05:27.200> you<00:05:27.350> will

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
you know who owns this music if you will

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.409 
you know who owns this music if you will
this<00:05:27.979> is<00:05:28.160> sort<00:05:28.310> of<00:05:28.340> a<00:05:28.430> shared<00:05:28.669> a<00:05:28.940> shared<00:05:29.240> space

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
this is sort of a shared a shared space

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.480 
this is sort of a shared a shared space
that<00:05:29.930> we<00:05:30.320> all<00:05:30.440> created<00:05:30.710> together<00:05:31.010> so<00:05:31.280> I<00:05:31.310> think

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
that we all created together so I think

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.300 
that we all created together so I think
this<00:05:31.610> sort<00:05:31.729> of<00:05:31.789> pushes<00:05:32.150> this<00:05:32.300> vision<00:05:32.630> of

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
this sort of pushes this vision of

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.150 
this sort of pushes this vision of
sort<00:05:33.970> of<00:05:34.030> community<00:05:34.720> and<00:05:34.810> collaboration

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
sort of community and collaboration

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.760 
sort of community and collaboration
within<00:05:36.160> technology
