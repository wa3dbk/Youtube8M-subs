00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.800
 Our new commander Magath tells Weigand the rule has been confirmed 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.300
 second government is the first time the hardest possible there I have on mine 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.419
 command 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:19.599
 you know that his father was the man of the ninth of Lohr 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.599
 not to mention the 5000 men the boy is a bad omen 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.640
 That is to say, everyone should probably have been seen tomorrow 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.430
 In the 18th century, local considerations such as these may make one man 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.430
 Passing out a region too dangerous when dealing with the city 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.070
 it is a slave who does what he does he has to do everything I hate everything for what he does 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.230
 stands 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.230
 the idea was that the opposing ranks were alone 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.710
 that he should do that 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.870
 to prepare 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.670
 how can I mean a piece of metal so much the age average 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.880
 told 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.160
 the eagle is dead 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.050
 that we too 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.310
 the Senate wants 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.680
 who knows it 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.790
 belongs to them 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.320
 the men stood varied, said Ackermann the newspaper is always 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.320
 still mostly clear 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.770
 I hope that I will tomorrow 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:24.800
 Corbijn 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.940
 we have to be clear 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.940
 if you serve me to survive 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.750
 we have to do it now 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.160
 there
