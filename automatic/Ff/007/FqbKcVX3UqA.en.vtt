00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.640
 things that you with your group of friends for 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.589

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.110
 backing times it's like that it costs you there 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.870
 things that I have to do 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.850
 it's hard 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.740
 There are things that it's hard for you to go dancing 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.510
 going to dance is difficult, you always have a 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.340
 boluda that resiste saw you want to go to 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.630
 dance and it 's difficult because of the music that 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.030
 they pass in the clubs that they want 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.940
 dances crouching that you begin to 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.980
 shake that you go down slowly you saw in addition 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.890
 they tell you down to below they are like 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.720
 Latin American dictators this is a 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.550
 pos and good car I will dance once 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.380
 in little worthy if he knew he was going to walk 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.640
 thrown by the floor I came joe and I 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.260
 One is very difficult, it is very difficult for me 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.300
 in the summer I also like that I gave 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.620
 account you saw how old I was 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.300
 count to repeat this that in the summer 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.550
 they used the york cited without good 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.660
 cortitos well cortitas well cortitos y 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.040
 you look at them think about the 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.220
 I really have panties that size 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.020
 do not 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.420
 it's sad it's sad but it's good things 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.400
 that are changing everything is changing with 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.979
 the time the couples for example the 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.290
 cohabitation no longer dries in the public 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.900
 there are people who live together 8 ago 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.940
 years things change things change 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.800
 for example in my case never again 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.900
 never again did he see the soap again 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.700
 hairs 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.720
 sometimes I go to the bathroom and I feel fat 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.930
 you put a hamster in the soap dish 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.340
 it's very unpleasant you saw something else that 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.810
 I realized how I realized that with 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.400
 the coexistence relationships go 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.020
 changing for example the men of the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.970
 generation of my dad are not going to 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.650
 buy clothes or dress them or they go to 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.150
 buy clothes or then center your local 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.880
 of menswear and you see that the woman 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.780
 go first to the place you saw the seller 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.000
 speaks directly to the woman has 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.550
 past seeing men who look out 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.200
 head for the tester and see that your 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.040
 Woman is not out waiting for her face 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.349
 of anguish 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.819
 the face of disquiet you saw have 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.640
 approach you and if you fat you went through 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:58.930
 you gave your lady the wanted very boludo not 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:01.719
 this is how terrible is terrible 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.579
 I believe that some women have 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:05.650
 a very active role at that time for the 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:09.280
 time they go they look for colors like 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.540
 that are the commission dresses even them 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.269
 believe what the seller says 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.190
 sell it and 0 in 48 there is no mine by se 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.280
 fixed equal you saw 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.320
 that's how it is so it's weird but for example 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.960
 It happens that some girls take their 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.760
 couples to buy clothes with them too 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.380
 and that's a car because we've focused 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.440
 your local women's clothing and you see a 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.710
 series of men wandering 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.150
 with the face of the dead alive you saw with a 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.210
 face as saying I can be 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.970
 looking aldosivi institute and I'm here 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.530
 the clothing stores are aware of 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.720
 this and what they do is make you seat 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.980
 near the testers and you look for 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.340
 back if you have a row of men 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.959
 with face of ortho 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.550
 some have the eggs are 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.709
 puffy sitting up 20 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.550
 weeks and it is a scourge is a scourge 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.700
 but good as well 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.980
 I only know her that she does not pay anything 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.480
 but that's the way it is like all the 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.360
 cities have some time that is 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.349
 half a shit for example 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.150
 preadolescent preadolescents also 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.310
 It's a weird moment especially because 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.349
 you are developing as you have 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.510
 the half disorganized body dresses like 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.890
 that those horrible ugly to me gives me 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.510
 many age pressures go to the 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.910
 birthday because you had to play the 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.380
 little bottle and it also gives me a lot of pressure 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.990
 the little bottle I was afraid to touch me 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.340
 The pri decor devices saw that the 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.990
 courses there was always a kid with 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.080
 appliances I had a partner that had 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.639
 a bumper directly because he looks at it 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.960
 in science the truth I do not know 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.360
 his mother asks to be a heron 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.500
 Transformer because it does not explain gentlemen 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.500
 thank you very much good night 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:48.370
 luciana for evil to wood no 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.370
 with this we close but
