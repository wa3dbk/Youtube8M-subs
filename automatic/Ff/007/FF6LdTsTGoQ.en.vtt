rival now let's race now this is a

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.219 
rival now let's race now this is a
rather<00:01:25.140> unique<00:01:25.380> stage<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:27.659> pretty

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
rather unique stage in that it's pretty

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.539 
rather unique stage in that it's pretty
different<00:01:28.590> from<00:01:29.009> all<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.250> other<00:01:29.369> ones

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
different from all the other ones

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.609 
different from all the other ones
logically<00:01:30.619> pretty<00:01:31.619> much<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.950> objective<00:01:32.549> is

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
logically pretty much the objective is

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.109 
logically pretty much the objective is
if<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.799> race<00:01:35.009> long<00:01:35.310> enough<00:01:35.549> there<00:01:35.759> will<00:01:35.820> be

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
if you race long enough there will be

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.600 
if you race long enough there will be
like<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.420> time<00:01:36.720> limit<00:01:37.049> going<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.680> you

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
like this time limit going on and you

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.399 
like this time limit going on and you
have<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.000> make<00:01:39.180> sure<00:01:39.210> you've<00:01:39.780> passed<00:01:40.079> the

the<00:02:48.900> hardest<00:02:49.319> level<00:02:49.829> in<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.160> world<00:02:51.170> although

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
the hardest level in the world although

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.680 
the hardest level in the world although
it'll<00:02:52.319> get<00:02:52.680> more<00:02:52.890> difficult<00:02:53.430> further<00:02:54.390> into

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
it'll get more difficult further into

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.819 
it'll get more difficult further into
the<00:02:54.780> race<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:54.959> mean<00:02:55.079> this<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.379> only<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.680> first

entire<00:02:58.890> course<00:02:59.280> three<00:02:59.940> times<00:03:00.920> but<00:03:01.920> as<00:03:02.040> long<00:03:02.160> as

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
entire course three times but as long as

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.339 
entire course three times but as long as
you<00:03:02.340> just<00:03:02.489> take<00:03:03.090> all<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.390> booster<00:03:03.780> pads<00:03:04.079> you

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
you just take all the booster pads you

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.180 
you just take all the booster pads you
should<00:03:04.680> hear<00:03:05.069> me<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.280> get<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.609> every<00:03:05.790> time

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
should hear me to get it every time

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.080 
should hear me to get it every time
there<00:03:08.190> we<00:03:08.370> go<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:09.060> end<00:03:09.989> of<00:03:10.140> lap<00:03:10.319> one<00:03:10.880> time<00:03:11.880> from

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
there we go and end of lap one time from

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.670 
there we go and end of lap one time from
lap<00:03:12.299> two<00:03:13.099> and<00:03:14.840> that's<00:03:15.840> basically<00:03:16.319> all<00:03:16.440> there

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
lap two and that's basically all there

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.420 
lap two and that's basically all there
is<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:17.099> I<00:03:18.230> know<00:03:19.230> you<00:03:19.349> can't<00:03:19.980> get<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.220> leg<00:03:20.400> a

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
is to it I know you can't get a leg a

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.099 
is to it I know you can't get a leg a
little<00:03:20.579> cutscene<00:03:21.180> for<00:03:21.510> this<00:03:21.660> one<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:21.870> don't

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
little cutscene for this one I don't

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.199 
little cutscene for this one I don't
know<00:03:22.260> why<00:03:22.530> but<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.919> sound<00:03:23.190> wasn't<00:03:23.609> working<00:03:24.030> I

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
know why but the sound wasn't working I

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.870 
know why but the sound wasn't working I
guess<00:03:24.810> it's<00:03:24.989> one<00:03:25.139> of<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.290> game's<00:03:25.530> bugs<00:03:25.919> but

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
guess it's one of the game's bugs but

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.280 
guess it's one of the game's bugs but
yeah<00:03:27.500> crash<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:29.299> the<00:03:30.299> entire<00:03:30.540> crash<00:03:30.870> brings

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
yeah crash and the entire crash brings

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.620 
yeah crash and the entire crash brings
down<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.590> big<00:03:32.340> stone<00:03:32.669> pillar<00:03:33.030> essentially

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
down a big stone pillar essentially

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.610 
down a big stone pillar essentially
blocking<00:03:34.109> part<00:03:34.319> of<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.560> path<00:03:36.319> also<00:03:37.319> that

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
blocking part of the path also that

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.400 
blocking part of the path also that
little<00:03:37.829> cutscene<00:03:38.510> pretty<00:03:39.510> much<00:03:39.599> butchers<00:03:40.169> the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
little cutscene pretty much butchers the

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.069 
little cutscene pretty much butchers the
story<00:03:40.799> even<00:03:41.310> further<00:03:41.720> because<00:03:42.720> if<00:03:42.900> you've

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
story even further because if you've

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.199 
story even further because if you've
seen<00:03:43.349> the<00:03:43.500> movie<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:44.040> will<00:03:44.400> recognize<00:03:44.910> that

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
seen the movie you will recognize that

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.559 
seen the movie you will recognize that

at<00:04:43.450> least<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:43.960> mini<00:04:44.169> kits<00:04:44.470> are<00:04:44.620> easy<00:04:44.830> to<00:04:45.010> get

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
at least the mini kits are easy to get

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.680 
at least the mini kits are easy to get
in<00:04:45.250> this<00:04:45.400> stage<00:04:45.700> you<00:04:46.000> just<00:04:46.120> have<00:04:46.240> to<00:04:46.390> kind<00:04:46.630> of

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
in this stage you just have to kind of

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.680 
in this stage you just have to kind of
run<00:04:46.870> them<00:04:46.960> over<00:04:47.050> they're<00:04:47.440> all<00:04:47.560> pretty<00:04:47.830> close

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
run them over they're all pretty close

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.030 
run them over they're all pretty close
to<00:04:49.690> get<00:04:49.930> you<00:04:50.050> don't<00:04:50.110> really<00:04:50.260> have<00:04:50.380> to<00:04:50.530> deviate

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
to get you don't really have to deviate

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.010 
to get you don't really have to deviate
from<00:04:51.070> the<00:04:51.430> main<00:04:51.610> path<00:04:51.880> very<00:04:52.330> much<00:04:52.540> to<00:04:52.720> get<00:04:52.870> all

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
from the main path very much to get all

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.690 
from the main path very much to get all
of<00:04:53.169> them<00:04:53.290> and<00:04:53.410> now<00:04:53.770> they<00:04:54.010> have<00:04:54.130> you<00:04:54.280> go<00:04:54.430> here

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
of them and now they have you go here

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.170 
of them and now they have you go here
all<00:04:54.850> of<00:04:54.880> a<00:04:55.000> sudden<00:04:55.330> for<00:04:55.960> some<00:04:56.169> reason<00:04:57.000> but<00:04:58.000> it

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
all of a sudden for some reason but it

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.110 
all of a sudden for some reason but it
works<00:04:59.100> gives<00:05:00.100> you<00:05:00.220> the<00:05:00.340> ability<00:05:00.400> for<00:05:00.640> lots<00:05:01.000> of

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
works gives you the ability for lots of

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
pretty tricky go through here and crap I

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.680 
pretty tricky go through here and crap I
know<00:05:48.460> but<00:05:48.640> it's<00:05:48.760> kind<00:05:48.850> of<00:05:48.940> steering<00:05:49.479> really

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
know but it's kind of steering really

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.420 
know but it's kind of steering really
awkwardly<00:05:50.110> you<00:05:50.229> can<00:05:50.380> like<00:05:50.800> you<00:05:50.919> can<00:05:50.950> go<00:05:51.190> left

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
awkwardly you can like you can go left

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.340 
awkwardly you can like you can go left
very<00:05:51.850> easily<00:05:52.090> but<00:05:52.479> you<00:05:52.540> have<00:05:52.810> a<00:05:52.840> hard<00:05:53.110> time

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
very easily but you have a hard time

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.490 
very easily but you have a hard time
steering<00:05:53.800> right<00:05:54.040> I<00:05:55.169> don't<00:05:56.169> know<00:05:56.229> why<00:05:56.380> maybe

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
steering right I don't know why maybe

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.110 
steering right I don't know why maybe
because<00:05:56.680> it's<00:05:56.979> uphill<00:05:57.430> or<00:05:57.580> something

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
because it's uphill or something

just<00:05:58.810> weird<00:06:00.240> shoddy<00:06:01.240> programming<00:06:01.930> I<00:06:02.050> guess

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
just weird shoddy programming I guess

there we go problem solved although now
I'm<00:06:07.870> probably<00:06:08.110> gonna<00:06:08.350> have<00:06:08.500> a<00:06:08.560> hard<00:06:08.800> time
