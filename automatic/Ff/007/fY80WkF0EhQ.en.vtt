to<00:00:07.140> show<00:00:07.290> you<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:08.000> technique<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.090> used<00:00:09.299> for

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
to show you the technique I used for

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.039 
to show you the technique I used for
installing<00:00:09.900> my<00:00:10.110> bearings<00:00:10.620> on<00:00:11.330> 4g63<00:00:12.330> this<00:00:12.869> is

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
installing my bearings on 4g63 this is

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.650 
installing my bearings on 4g63 this is
for<00:00:13.289> the<00:00:14.190> balance<00:00:14.580> shaft<00:00:14.760> elimination<00:00:15.480> kit

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
for the balance shaft elimination kit

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.529 
for the balance shaft elimination kit
actually<00:00:16.529> got<00:00:16.619> mine<00:00:16.800> from<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:18.000> place<00:00:18.240> here

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
actually got mine from this place here

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.410 
actually got mine from this place here
from<00:00:19.640> F<00:00:20.640> FWD<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:22.220> feel<00:00:23.220> like<00:00:23.340> 65<00:00:23.850> bucks

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
from F FWD I feel like 65 bucks

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.050 
from F FWD I feel like 65 bucks
came<00:00:25.110> with<00:00:25.550> brand<00:00:26.550> new<00:00:26.640> bearings<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:29.060> the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
came with brand new bearings and the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.479 
came with brand new bearings and the
stumpy<00:00:30.570> shadow<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.289> pretty<00:00:32.129> much<00:00:32.219> everything

stumpy shadow so pretty much everything
everything<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.180> need<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> install

everything you need for the install
there's<00:00:36.810> my<00:00:37.079> old<00:00:37.500> bearings<00:00:38.160> removed<00:00:38.880> the<00:00:39.780> ones

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
there's my old bearings removed the ones

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.960 
there's my old bearings removed the ones
that<00:00:40.470> comes<00:00:40.710> with<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.100> just<00:00:41.340> started<00:00:41.760> here<00:00:41.910> in

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
that comes with I just started here in

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.240 
that comes with I just started here in
the<00:00:42.060> block<00:00:42.300> I've<00:00:43.079> already<00:00:43.530> installed<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
the block I've already installed the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.229 
the block I've already installed the
rear<00:00:44.610> bearing<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.690> for<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.910> what<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:47.940> used

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
rear bearing and for that what I used

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.900 
rear bearing and for that what I used
since<00:00:49.020> it's<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.800> little<00:00:49.950> hard<00:00:50.220> to<00:00:50.340> get<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.550> I'm

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
since it's a little hard to get to I'm

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.130 
since it's a little hard to get to I'm
going<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.329> show<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.660> I've<00:00:51.780> got<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.899> light

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
going to show you that I've got a light

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.120 
going to show you that I've got a light
on<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:53.510> back<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.750> there<00:00:55.020> exactly<00:00:55.800> where<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
on it back in there exactly where the

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.160 
on it back in there exactly where the
lights<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.579> got<00:00:56.880> to<00:00:57.300> see<00:00:57.890> there<00:00:58.890> that's<00:00:59.520> the

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
lights I got to see there that's the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.459 
lights I got to see there that's the
rear<00:01:01.170> bearing<00:01:01.670> now<00:01:02.670> with<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:04.259> got<00:01:04.439> a

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:04.469 
rear bearing now with that one you got a

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:06.050 
rear bearing now with that one you got a
precedent<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.219> got<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.430> beat<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.909> there

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
precedent you got to beat it in there

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.499 
precedent you got to beat it in there
somehow

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
somehow

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:12.880 
somehow
so<00:01:06.810> actually<00:01:07.170> what<00:01:07.259> I<00:01:07.350> use<00:01:08.569> was<00:01:10.009> if<00:01:11.009> you<00:01:11.249> really

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
so actually what I use was if you really

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.380 
so actually what I use was if you really
so<00:01:13.520> it's<00:01:13.670> right<00:01:14.270> there

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.740 

all<00:01:19.050> the<00:01:19.140> way<00:01:19.260> up<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.740> about<00:01:19.800> two<00:01:20.070> foot<00:01:20.510> or<00:01:21.510> so

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
all the way up it's about two foot or so

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.490 
all the way up it's about two foot or so
extension<00:01:23.000> a<00:01:24.350> deep<00:01:25.350> well<00:01:25.530> socket<00:01:25.590> and

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
extension a deep well socket and

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.219 
extension a deep well socket and
actually<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.710> whole<00:01:29.310> bit<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:30.720> reason<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.080> chose

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
actually a whole bit the reason I chose

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.930 
actually a whole bit the reason I chose
the<00:01:31.440> whole<00:01:31.590> assault<00:01:31.890> bit<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.369> because<00:01:32.760> it's

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
the whole assault bit is because it's

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.150 
the whole assault bit is because it's
the<00:01:33.030> same<00:01:33.270> outside<00:01:33.780> diameter<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.770> bearing

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
the same outside diameter of the bearing

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.770 
the same outside diameter of the bearing
which<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.700> from<00:01:35.940> mine<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.150> think<00:01:36.330> it's<00:01:36.600> like<00:01:36.690> an

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
which is from mine I think it's like an

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.530 
which is from mine I think it's like an
inch<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.020> 3/4<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.680> think<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.270> but<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.450> is

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
inch and 3/4 I think this is but this is

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.600 
inch and 3/4 I think this is but this is
how<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.690> goes<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.140> your<00:01:40.560> drill<00:01:40.890> or<00:01:41.130> whatever

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
how it goes in your drill or whatever

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.580 
how it goes in your drill or whatever
that<00:01:41.790> you're<00:01:42.000> using<00:01:42.180> excuse<00:01:42.570> me<00:01:42.720> there<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.200> go

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
that you're using excuse me there you go

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.240 
that you're using excuse me there you go
so<00:01:43.860> what<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.009> did<00:01:44.130> was<00:01:44.940> take<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:45.990> off<00:01:46.200> take<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
so what I did was take it off take the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.980 
so what I did was take it off take the
shaft<00:01:47.490> out<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:50.310> actually<00:01:50.930> install<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:53.490> shaft

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
shaft out and actually install the shaft

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:05.620 
shaft out and actually install the shaft
backwards<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:03.000> now<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.210> have<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.539> stub<00:02:03.899> shaft

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
backwards so now you have the stub shaft

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.279 
backwards so now you have the stub shaft
there<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:07.080> facing<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:09.019> alright

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
there it's facing in alright

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.940 
there it's facing in alright
and<00:02:10.830> now<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.070> outside<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:12.150> flat<00:02:12.420> half

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
and now the outside the flat half

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.190 
and now the outside the flat half
take<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:15.110> socket<00:02:16.110> that's<00:02:16.230> got<00:02:17.540> insert<00:02:18.540> over

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
take the socket that's got insert over

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.000 
take the socket that's got insert over
the<00:02:19.860> bolt<00:02:20.100> in<00:02:20.310> there<00:02:20.870> then<00:02:21.870> take<00:02:22.170> your<00:02:22.830> long

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
the bolt in there then take your long

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.699 
the bolt in there then take your long
extension<00:02:23.580> oh<00:02:26.390> get<00:02:27.390> inside<00:02:27.690> there<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.170> then

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
extension oh get inside there and then

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.220 
extension oh get inside there and then
this<00:02:28.860> will<00:02:29.010> go<00:02:29.130> through<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:30.060> block<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:31.020> then

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
this will go through the block and then

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.699 
this will go through the block and then
you<00:02:31.320> just<00:02:31.590> yeah<00:02:32.010> you'd<00:02:32.220> be<00:02:32.370> able<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.580> get<00:02:32.730> in<00:02:32.880> it

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
you just yeah you'd be able to get in it

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.490 
you just yeah you'd be able to get in it

when<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.340> just<00:02:56.580> use<00:02:56.730> there's<00:02:57.120> another<00:02:57.330> socket<00:02:57.720> I

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
when I just use there's another socket I

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.350 
when I just use there's another socket I
have<00:02:58.280> laying<00:02:59.280> around<00:02:59.400> this<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.180> like<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:02.360> 36

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
have laying around this is like a 36

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.199 
have laying around this is like a 36
millimeter<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:05.070> did<00:03:05.580> is<00:03:05.670> just<00:03:05.700> do<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.030> same

that<00:03:11.250> what<00:03:11.430> good<00:03:11.550> this<00:03:11.670> socket<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.150> now<00:03:12.360> out

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
that what good this socket is now out

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.600 
that what good this socket is now out
and<00:03:13.320> spacing<00:03:13.890> you<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.130> that's<00:03:14.250> perfectly

you don't you know bend it or jam it in
there<00:03:39.410> so<00:03:40.410> they're<00:03:40.590> flat<00:03:40.680> against<00:03:41.100> there<00:03:49.520> some

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
there so they're flat against there some

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.450 
there so they're flat against there some
love<00:03:50.700> taps<00:03:50.970> there<00:03:51.530> and<00:03:52.530> then<00:03:52.740> that's<00:03:52.920> that's

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
love taps there and then that's that's

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
like a piston top knock that bearing

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.850 
like a piston top knock that bearing
right<00:04:09.510> on<00:04:09.660> it<00:04:10.730> that's<00:04:11.730> for<00:04:11.970> that<00:04:12.120> one<00:04:12.860> since
