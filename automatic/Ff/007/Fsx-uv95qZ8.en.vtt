00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.200
 Hello. 

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.170
 I am Serizawa, an afterbeat music school guitar instructor. 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:11.780
 Today is the continuation of the sweep, and this time I would like to do a little bit about how to use the left hand. 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.170
 I used to use my right hand earlier, but this time it's my left hand. 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.230
 There are a few different phrases and I can not say in a nutshell, but 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.080
 I introduced this 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.290
 Learn more about how to use your left hand with the phrase 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.160
 First, if your index finger is stuck all the time. 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.040
 Because the index finger is in charge of 5 frets for both 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 3rd strings, 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.980
 It doesn't matter if you stick it as it is, but 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.980
 If you play with your left index finger attached for a long time ... 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.550
 It feels like it's like playing a chord. 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:02.960
 So, in order to eliminate this, it is difficult, but one by one .... 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.939
 do you understand. 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.839
 Front, middle, root. Around this first joint? 

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:17.210
 Root, middle, first end. 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.020
 There is a need to play with it. 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.810
 So, while doing this play, even if you go to the pinky, it's your index finger. 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.170
 To keep the movement of the index finger. 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.119
 So, even if you do not mute the bridge 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:50.050
 I want to be able to do this kind of separation. 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:59.880
 So, if I use Bridge Mute to improve sound separation. 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.590
 Even if you use the bridge mute and the index finger is not attached 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:15.310
 After all, it is a slight overtone. 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.290
 This will remain, so be careful with your index finger. 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.760
 It is difficult, but let's make it possible to separate. 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.300
 This is also true for other phrases. 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.400
 There is no form lined along the line like this, though ... 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.510
・ ・ And, when I go, it is a feeling that the index finger plays firmly. 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.540
 So, regarding this sweep, 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.110
 The right hand can not mute the 4th, 5th, 6th strings with his thumb, 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.120
 The point to watch out for is that side. 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.120
 I want to use my left hand well so that the sounds do not overlap. 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.179
 Not ... 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:07.879
 I'm a little freakish. 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.660
 Yup. That's what it looks like today. 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.690
 Use your left hand well to separate the sounds. 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.670
 If you can't do this, it's a great phrase for sweep phrases, 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.430
 Because even a good phrase will be badly clogged, 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.480
 Let's do our best and practice.
