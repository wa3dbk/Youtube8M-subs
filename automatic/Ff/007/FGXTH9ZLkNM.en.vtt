 London front is nice to see this is 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:18.800
 Election victory in place m 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.710
 and add 3 points then what 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.329
 everything there 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.769
 and then I've got about the name of OPNET 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.060
 wanted at the side of a simple 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.710
 grow up 25 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.460
 and here it is again with an immense GC and more 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.820
 and a few other things that there is something there is 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.630
 with and here then the whole data floats so 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.510
 what's on the back - and now for what this has to know everything 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.240
 Dr and then take a picture 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.900
 and then you come with smiles separated should the report of the keyboard 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.690
 No 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.550
 beautiful 4 2 percent off 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.700
 States do not have differences between 45 and 55 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.880
 with the shady sides different languages 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.410
 5 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.760
 then it seemed likely 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.710
 So that seems to me to be so detailed 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.220
 playful 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.630

 because there are also the mosquito larvae ladder beams is Berndt Georg Thamm Mutterpass 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:14.479
 Plow leads to computer 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.479
 and then of course the Kiel Fjord 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:25.669
 Company photo narrowly defined 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.419
 feels somehow possible 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.429
 St tipped well who a little heavier 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:43.679
 the 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:46.699
 shorter than I thought 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.409
 Model English had resistance below 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.409
 do not crack did not go too easy 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.140
 Pietsch Peachum Nansen back that feels good 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.119
 Prof 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:03.459
 and 87 for the back 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.459
 Open that the Knack no longer human as in the old 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:09.499
 as in the old education 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:12.639
 that always looks like animals that are not nicely liquid 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.639
 Prop Bet and the buttons of course nice too 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.309
 with squares stayed the same I think the painted 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:24.839
 So grabbing no feeling like in this country then biting and eyeing 

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:27.529
 occur and are still the lady 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:29.899
 Percent so rents customers 

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:32.059
 to ads 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:33.599
 I do not want to follow 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.599
 Rome, of course, behind the box 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.360
 have read the same that the stream bed is to express final then you have 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.979
 the health insurance companies go down 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:49.129
 this is certainly the case so now familiar 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.169
 not everything goes down the same way 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.909
 that's how everything stays fixed » 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.909
 Jan Schaumann could 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.929
 Fasel's connections have remained more or less the same system 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:04.680
 percent 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.429
 now count like the authors 

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:09.209
 us-bip 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.679
 then you need excellence 

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:13.459
 March will be 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.510
 Letz saved and exciting can quite well done 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.330
 Josef is still busy 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.729
 but as 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.790
 there is still a usb cable supplied v 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:33.789

 Judge Mittrup 4 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.689
 stuck to the stove for a long time 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.509
 a very white 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:48.719
 to us 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:51.569
 acceptable amount will be possible 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:54.569
 Percent rose Cologne Live the Light 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.759
 I suspect hamlet 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.039
 around 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.339
 only one cdu member has 

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:03.930
 in the letter 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.839
 there from pried area 

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:08.559
 that you have to download this 

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:11.559
 Desmond in the table normal real desire to find 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.180
 it stands 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.699
 I hold on to the siren to download the latest unlocked Live Lite 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.520
 here formed 1 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.039
 and if we say that 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.039
 and then you have to enter the serial number too 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:34.849
 and the smokers just give it a try 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:38.529
 for some needs and had mostly get 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:41.210
 and 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.689
 that's what you get 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:46.689
 of course whole neighbor major project 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:50.589
 8th 

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:53.860
 there is no reason 4 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.860
 other computers are not off 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:10.029
 Künast a bidding process instead 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:13.029
 Lisieux display will be Apple too I stay green 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.490
 and so must dapd off 

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:22.219
 Time that everything is very nice and display 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:25.409
 So we see the Riegler we need for unfounded 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:29.539
 until his 100th 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:31.439
 and when you turn slowly 

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:34.519
 then changed slowly and always turned the time 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.779
 and if we should not do that 

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:40.650
 and because she has other questions 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.999
 we just comment 

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:44.439
 see you next time
