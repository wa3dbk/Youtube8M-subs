00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:05.230
 more and more bicycle dealers are being duped by cycling a test drive 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.670
 are stolen 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.530
 in a few months time at least six stores in our province are at this 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.519
 stolen 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.839
 these are images of a security camera of the sake stray florakade in the 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:18.089
 city ​​of groningen 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:21.599
 one of the employees is a customer who is looking for a new bicycle 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:24.859
 has dropped his eye on a gazelle 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.269
 costs 800 euros 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.640
 unsuspectingly, the employee prepared the bike for a test drive the rest 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.130
 is history 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.060
 complain to a good story 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.270
 further thinking falls to the search of women's football but the question if already 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.170
 and 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.780
 can have the paepe pay 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.000
 make the test 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.990
 he is still dealing with that 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.280
 The story of the sugars in Groningen has long been no exception 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.380
 more 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.310
 bicycle dealers in thinking winschoten and hair happened this year 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.510
 the same 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.680
 and at the beginning of November it was the turn of the house for two-wheelers in his pants 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.870
 after a few minutes of each other your sense of achievement 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.140
 otherwise go wrong so 9 first but fished at the back we also look 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.080
 somebody could work somewhere in london 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.210
 but that is now the case after twenty minutes a woman 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.170
 but just reported to the police 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.970
 And so in a church, traders don't want to focus on measures such as 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.230
 for example, paying a deposit 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.630
 or it is compulsory to identify you are new judges 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.240
 because a wad has happened to everyone, so now everyone who is cycling with a bee 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.560
 and go out the door 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.090
 I don't know the person in question 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.760
 without having to leave his identity behind 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.960
 and the series is also a colleague in Zuidbroek from now on extra alert 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.460
 and I will keep them a bit stricter after I have already 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.880
 trade 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.170
 And then I will indeed consider a structural approach to the card 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.640
 distinguish not to wait and change and you do and the other does not 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.039
 entrepreneurs and are often not insured 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.629
 because, after all, the striker is voluntarily given 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.970
 a matter of companies offering products
