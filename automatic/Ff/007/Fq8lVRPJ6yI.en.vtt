00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
I'm gonna be calling out everything that

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.570 
I'm gonna be calling out everything that
I'm<00:00:25.080> thinking<00:00:25.320> but<00:00:26.039> I'm<00:00:26.130> only<00:00:26.189> gonna<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.490> this

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
I'm thinking but I'm only gonna do this

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.070 
I'm thinking but I'm only gonna do this
for<00:00:26.789> clan<00:00:26.939> versus<00:00:27.269> clan<00:00:27.510> because<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.810> think

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
for clan versus clan because I think

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.999 
for clan versus clan because I think
it's<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.260> lot<00:00:28.560> more<00:00:30.470> applicable<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.590> think

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
it's a lot more applicable I think

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.799 
it's a lot more applicable I think
that's<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.279> word<00:00:32.430> applicable<00:00:32.809> applicable

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
that's the word applicable applicable

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.250 
that's the word applicable applicable
just<00:00:34.440> more<00:00:34.680> pliable<00:00:35.070> basically<00:00:35.880> um<00:00:36.750> whenever

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
just more pliable basically um whenever

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.530 
just more pliable basically um whenever
I'm<00:00:37.410> doing<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.129> clan<00:00:38.430> vs.<00:00:38.760> plan<00:00:39.000> because<00:00:39.420> in

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
I'm doing it in clan vs. plan because in

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.660 
I'm doing it in clan vs. plan because in
pubs<00:00:39.780> there's<00:00:40.140> always<00:00:40.410> different<00:00:40.680> situations

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
pubs there's always different situations

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.889 
pubs there's always different situations
and<00:00:41.760> claim<00:00:41.940> versus<00:00:42.180> clan<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.480> more<00:00:42.629> straight

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
and claim versus clan it's more straight

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.330 
and claim versus clan it's more straight
up<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.140> I'm<00:00:43.230> gonna<00:00:43.320> be<00:00:43.500> saying<00:00:43.950> everything

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
up so I'm gonna be saying everything

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.920

get on the flags you can't really do

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.509 
get on the flags you can't really do
anything<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.620> SMGs<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.219> the<00:02:20.340> bigger

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
anything so the SMGs have the bigger

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:21.890 
anything so the SMGs have the bigger
role<00:02:20.760> but<00:02:20.969> we<00:02:21.060> have<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.269> keep<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.540> people<00:02:21.780> off

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
role but we have to keep the people off

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.380 
role but we have to keep the people off
the<00:02:22.079> SMGs<00:02:22.560> which<00:02:22.769> is<00:02:22.890> hard<00:02:23.129> so<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.760> don't<00:02:24.030> know<00:02:24.150> I

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
the SMGs which is hard so I don't know I

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.640 
the SMGs which is hard so I don't know I
don't<00:02:24.599> really<00:02:24.810> know<00:02:24.930> what<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.319> hell<00:02:25.439> to<00:02:25.530> do

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
don't really know what the hell to do

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.220 
don't really know what the hell to do
but<00:02:25.829> this<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.069> usually<00:02:26.250> my<00:02:26.430> break<00:02:26.760> off<00:02:26.969> I<00:02:27.239> don't

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.880 
so basically if you kill her assault
right<00:04:40.810> I<00:04:40.930> mean<00:04:41.080> if<00:04:41.140> you<00:04:41.200> kill<00:04:41.380> their<00:04:41.500> SMG

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
right I mean if you kill their SMG

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.040 
right I mean if you kill their SMG
players<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:43.060> assault<00:04:43.360> rifles<00:04:43.690> are<00:04:43.750> useless

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
players the assault rifles are useless

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.210 
players the assault rifles are useless
they're<00:04:44.320> this<00:04:44.440> getting<00:04:44.710> kills<00:04:44.950> around<00:04:45.070> the

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
they're this getting kills around the

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.410 
they're this getting kills around the

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
but now okay this is a mistake that I

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.080 
but now okay this is a mistake that I
make<00:06:04.180> a<00:06:04.210> lot<00:06:04.450> personally<00:06:04.750> I<00:06:05.550> don't<00:06:06.550> usually<00:06:06.700> go

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
make a lot personally I don't usually go

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.480 
make a lot personally I don't usually go
up<00:06:07.120> top<00:06:07.510> strip<00:06:07.990> on<00:06:08.230> spawn<00:06:08.770> when<00:06:08.980> I<00:06:09.070> spawn<00:06:09.340> it's

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
up top strip on spawn when I spawn it's

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.630 
up top strip on spawn when I spawn it's
trip<00:06:09.760> going<00:06:10.570> top<00:06:10.780> strip<00:06:11.140> is<00:06:11.290> so<00:06:11.770> important<00:06:12.550> and

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
trip going top strip is so important and

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.420 
trip going top strip is so important and
it's<00:06:12.790> so<00:06:12.880> overlooked<00:06:13.740> because<00:06:14.740> if<00:06:14.980> you<00:06:15.070> go<00:06:15.190> top

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
it's so overlooked because if you go top

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.800 
it's so overlooked because if you go top
strip<00:06:15.700> you<00:06:15.820> can<00:06:15.970> pick<00:06:16.120> off<00:06:16.240> anybody<00:06:16.600> that's

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
strip you can pick off anybody that's

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.960 
strip you can pick off anybody that's
broken<00:06:17.110> the<00:06:17.890> angle<00:06:18.280> that<00:06:18.370> you<00:06:18.490> get<00:06:18.640> from<00:06:18.790> down

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
broken the angle that you get from down

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.430 
broken the angle that you get from down
there<00:06:19.210> is<00:06:19.420> really<00:06:19.720> really<00:06:19.900> hard<00:06:20.140> to<00:06:20.260> shoot

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.050 
of top on I'd say broken is the most

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.540

important<00:07:41.530> on<00:07:41.680> both<00:07:41.860> sides<00:07:42.160> because<00:07:42.430> it

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:42.550 
important on both sides because it

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.390 
important on both sides because it
forces<00:07:42.820> pawn<00:07:43.150> spawns<00:07:43.540> and<00:07:43.990> also<00:07:44.500> you<00:07:45.280> could

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:45.400 
forces pawn spawns and also you could

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.280 
forces pawn spawns and also you could
