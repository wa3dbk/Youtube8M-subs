00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.190
 I like the fluid and I 'm over 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.260
 a brief here for the channel 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.360
 so prepare your groceries together 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.570
 Your friends, because today we are going to talk. 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.570
 about 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.460
 produced by massive entertainement 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.890
 subdivision of ubisoft in sweden 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.230
 I created one of the most anticipated online games 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.390
 of the new generation of division class 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.580
 brings several innovations to portray 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.920
 a new york devastated in the most 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.710
 realistic and complete with 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.470
 confirmed launch for 2015 will be 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.430
 available for xbox a playstation 4 and 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.190
 PraÃ§a 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.230
 the game takes the name of tom clancy as 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.869
 American writer who has had 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.740
 more than 76 million copies of games with 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:12.800
 Your Name Sold Games Like Split Sky 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.810
 gothic hubble if by what is known 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.820
 From the author we can expect a story 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.710
 with great attention espionage and 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.070
 possibly have atmosphere 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.960
 extremely immersive division of 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.240
 passes in a new york with the scenery post 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.220
 apocalyptic but forget the stories 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.840
 menstrue no zombie apocalypse 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.030
 alien invasion 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.869
 much less giant smiling eaters 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.210
 of humans 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.190
 in the game the cause of all this confusion 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.709
 is a deadly virus that has spread 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.500
 rapidly by the population for three 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:44.030
 weeks from the black friday 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.569
 thinking is almost an apocalypse 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.569
 zombie 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.680
 all basic services started 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.110
 to fail 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.640
 imagine a company without service 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.840
 health police 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.370
 the government knows Brazil in the middle 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.910
 these circumstances the president 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.970
 invoked guideline 51 and the secret unit 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.470
 division support is active to bring 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.620
 order to chaos and discover the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.180
 responsible for all this 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.620
 disguised among the population with 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.780
 common citizens 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.730
 these agents are trained to operate 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.540
 independent of command in situations of 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.310
 emergency 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.709
 and is in the skin of one of these agents 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.709
 we want to play in one of the main 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.060
 missions will be to restructure the 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.660
 infrastructure request of new city 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.910
 york 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.129
 being very careful about your actions 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.829
 because they all influenced the game of a 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.519
 will be reflected throughout the 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.220
 City 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.829
 developers claim that the title 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.599
 have a main campaign that must have 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.459
 beginning middle and end 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.319
 but of course games can 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.150
 keep playing almost for time 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.670
 undetermined after reaching the end 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.739
 this story 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.989
 one of the main innovations of the game are 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.120
 extremely detailed scenarios and 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.769
 all this is possible thanks to 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.900
 to the new graphics engine created 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.329
 exclusively for division 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.579
 named the snow drop the power of creation 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.709
 instrument was fully 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.989
 to meet the requirements of the next 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.510
 generation consoles and completing 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.579
 ability to create an environment 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.139
 responsible and artificial intelligence 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.510
 complex and global lighting 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.700
 dynamic the power of this new line 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.639
 that the damage caused to the 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.930
 environment will not be lost even when 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.780
 you leave the map 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.389
 all this to represent big eiko da 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.120
 as complete as possible. 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:02.099
 familiar streets and markets that are now 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.840
 dominated by clans that will do everything to 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.760
 survive 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.069
 the title will be a cry in third 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.380
 person with a giant open world and 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.900
 various elements known to the 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.269
 rpg as the experience system 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.820
 magnification and collection of items 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.409
 even with elements of rpg the game does not 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.030
 will have class defined 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:23.190
 as the player evolves in the 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.020
 history is acquiring points that 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.569
 should be applied in the evolution 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.520
 specific characteristics that will be 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:31.979
 fully determined by their 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.349
 own choices requires a connection

 You can search in this game. 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.680
 with the intention of the developers 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.450
 is that during the adventure you can 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.420

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:08.250
 same gameplay patterns and will be 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.280
 combination that will be the basis for 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.560

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.280
 no game 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.530
 according to producers the goal of tone
