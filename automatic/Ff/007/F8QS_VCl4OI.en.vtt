but despite its small size it's fully

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.279 
but despite its small size it's fully
loaded<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.059> really<00:00:51.600> gives<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> lot<00:00:52.260> of

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
loaded it really gives you a lot of

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.130 
loaded it really gives you a lot of
control<00:00:52.789> a<00:00:53.789> lot<00:00:54.180> more<00:00:54.360> control<00:00:54.629> than<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.899> may

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
control a lot more control than you may

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.479 
control a lot more control than you may
initially<00:00:55.440> realize<00:00:55.860> when<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.129> just<00:00:56.250> look<00:00:56.399> at

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
initially realize when you just look at

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.369 
initially realize when you just look at
the<00:00:56.610> surface<00:00:56.840> and<00:00:57.840> part<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> reason<00:00:58.350> for

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
the surface and part of the reason for

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.990 
the surface and part of the reason for
that<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.710> we've<00:00:58.859> taken<00:00:59.070> advantage<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.730> being

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
that is we've taken advantage of being

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.240 
that is we've taken advantage of being
able<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.329> basically<00:01:00.770> multitask<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:01.920> some<00:01:02.129> of

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
able to basically multitask on some of

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.250 
able to basically multitask on some of
these<00:01:02.340> buttons<00:01:02.609> at<00:01:03.090> face<00:01:03.329> value<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.809> look<00:01:04.110> at

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
these buttons at face value you look at

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.230 
EQ controls at the top here now I said
there's<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> lot<00:01:38.040> more<00:01:38.220> going<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.700> here<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.119> in

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
there's a lot more going on here and in

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.969 
there's a lot more going on here and in
a<00:01:39.540> really<00:01:39.720> good<00:01:39.869> example<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.380> those<00:01:40.770> other

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
a really good example of those other

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.800 
a really good example of those other
things<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.280> are<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:41.790> actually<00:01:42.270> exist

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
things that are going on actually exist

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.740 
things that are going on actually exist
on<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.110> wheels<00:01:43.350> themselves<00:01:43.909> is<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.540> know<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
on the wheels themselves is you know the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.389 
on the wheels themselves is you know the
basic<00:01:46.140> function<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.530> course<00:01:46.740> for<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.040> wheel<00:01:47.220> is

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
basic function of course for a wheel is

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.590 
basic function of course for a wheel is
going<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.610> be<00:01:47.700> able<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.030> do<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> little<00:01:48.390> bit<00:01:48.509> of

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
going to be able to do a little bit of

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.510 
going to be able to do a little bit of
pitch<00:01:48.720> control<00:01:49.110> which<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.560> know<00:01:49.649> just<00:01:49.890> a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
pitch control which is you know just a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.100 
pitch control which is you know just a
little<00:01:50.759> bit<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:50.970> pitch<00:01:51.090> control<00:01:51.420> or<00:01:51.570> cueing<00:01:52.020> or

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
little bit of pitch control or cueing or

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.660 
little bit of pitch control or cueing or
things<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.189> if<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.310> got<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> track

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
things like that so if I got a track

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.020 
things like that so if I got a track
playing<00:01:53.939> right<00:01:54.149> now

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
playing right now

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
can do other things with these wheels -

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.369 
can do other things with these wheels -
so<00:02:13.299> you<00:02:13.390> wanna<00:02:13.540> go<00:02:13.660> find<00:02:13.810> my<00:02:13.959> next<00:02:14.140> track
