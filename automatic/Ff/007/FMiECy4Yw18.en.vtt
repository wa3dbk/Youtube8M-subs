00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:13.080
 And then folks and freddie mac welcome to 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.480
 One more video this time I'm going to start 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.570
 video reading a small piece of news 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.369
 for you and the course of the video we 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.939
 to debate the subheadings so let's go 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.760
 over there 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.070
 the biggest controversy if it is confirmed is 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.900
 that the console may not accept the use of 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.050
 games of the second hand because the sony 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.640
 registered a patent based on nfc that 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.620
 identifies information from the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.989
 including locations where you have 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.340
 used in this way will no longer be 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.300
 to exchange games with friends 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.059
 nor to buy used discs in stores or 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.620
 Either you by name is sony should already have 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.260
 If I touch that I'm talking a new 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.289
 playstation 3 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.199
 Walkman as you prefer to call him 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:58.770
 and the controversy of the time is that this console 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.390
 would probably come with the software which 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.049
 One thing I did not understand was the form. 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.159
 I do not know why you can not borrow your 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.960
 games it will only run on your console and 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.600
 This is a bit boring because besides 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.030
 to keep you from lending to being caught 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.560
 borrowed games or play games with 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.360
 your friends also ask you to 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.720
 buy second hand games that are 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.110
 much cheaper not to be used 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.180
 so this is the subject of today I wanted 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.880
 to know if you guys think much of you 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.180
 The legal kind of video game is you. 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.700
 can play be play online lend 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.560
 pro friend the cousin job lent it 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.900
 you have not yet played of the person 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.460
 this comes from the atari data of the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.829
 attack not because in the afternoon and it was a game 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.100
 just did not attack but the cartridge that you 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.860
 could borrow and borrow and that 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.229
 Since always came imagine finish with 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.180
 it now an hour for another 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.450
 this in the sony of course I do not know if the new 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.119
 xbox will come with such content 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.310
 I think they were not at Sonyy's the most 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.520
 comes from consoles in the world 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.829
 and is the one that most has titles in quality 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.910
 in the world and is the best console in 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.979
 day at the market 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.390
 I do not know if it will change in the next generation 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.459
 or not and I came away with this is the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.019
 our joy of being able to lend 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.690
 pick up games that we do not like to 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.019
 people lend is each of these reasons 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.840
 to lend or not to lend 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:30.150
 however because the thing is so cool like you 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.620
 I was playing and I could change, I do not know 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.840
 house of his cousin exchanged I have this 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.870
 game you have what I want and and we 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.930
 exchange and then when will I give you back 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.360
 and so does how often or I played 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.650
 playstation game with neighbors face 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.599
 and play 2 was also very cool because 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.640
 game that you often did not like 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.319
 more control that he did not like 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.470
 to play you could change that person 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.140
 she wanted so many games I did 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.519
 several games is or when a 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.580
 friend comes from a videogame 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.670
 he can deliver the games and this does not 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.420
 It's going to happen dumber, it's something. 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.730
 boring and I think the black sony and I 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.980
 I hope Sony does not do it because 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.540
 if not the next newest xbox 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.670
 generation will unleash sales in me 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.060
 I think because many people also 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.069
 buy a playstation 3 but bought only 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.549
 plays second hand because they are cheaper 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.819
 it's people who have less is able to 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.870
 financially so to spend on games 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.769
 news but it's a bit to power 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.269
 see if you buy second hand the cheapest 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.410
 if it is bought second hand it will power 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.880
 also this 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.799
 Something else I've heard too. 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.200
 changing now by continuing the subject 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:46.410
 but speaking another thing is what type 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.359
 You'll be able to think but I saw I read 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.340
 that you can lend to the person who 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:54.209
 You're just going to have to buy, I think. 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.430
 probably on the psn and so she 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.130
 will put her data and then if she 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.639
 bought a game after she will be able to 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.380
 continue playing that game and county 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.810
 and stuff like that 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.870
 So if you can lend someone 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.170
 that the person you loaned the game is 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.760
 going to hit complex license so it was 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.030
 That's what I was going to say in the video, I 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.090
 I want you to comment 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.430
 below if you think it 's fair or not 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.620
 sony put this technology wins clear 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.240
 a great technology for them will be 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.760
 lots of snow will earn much more 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.500
 money with it and not only it like everything 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.970
 also because the fuck is going to 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.910
 person will have to go there and buy another 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.500
 I play to be able to play and it will not 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.139
 power to borrow more then they 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.570
 They're going to put in a lot of money. 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.919
 better known with this new license and 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.139
 loans 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.180
 then they will probably plant more 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.590
 Sir, it's a father's name, it's just a reminder. 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.570
 great tradition of video games who 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.770
 need the games will die so it was 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.540
 That 's what I wanted to talk to you I 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.640
 I want you to eat and if you think 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.130
 fair or not I hope you have enjoyed 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.680
 of video if they liked please click 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.210
 I liked it below if you liked the 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.400
 favorite odds 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.780
 the video was a little short I know but it was 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.700
 What I had to say is not much 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.650
 thing just this type of pet to discuss with 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.710
 you the document although you think 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.780
 Whether or not sony does this right is 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.370
 more kind many people will stay 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.500
 disappointed and will probably go 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.780
 buy the other competing console by 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.820
 cause of that then was that comments 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.630
 below if you like or not the video was worth 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.630
 said I went 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.150
 ae
