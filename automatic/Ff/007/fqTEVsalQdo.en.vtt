00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
honestly it was kind of a risk spending

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.719 
honestly it was kind of a risk spending
this<00:01:08.760> much<00:01:08.970> money<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.600> um<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:11.280> thing<00:01:11.549> that

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
this much money on it um the thing that

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.640 
this much money on it um the thing that
really<00:01:11.939> got<00:01:12.240> me<00:01:12.479> about<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.960> though<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.380> it

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
really got me about it though is that it

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.429 
really got me about it though is that it
said<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.010> provides<00:01:14.850> six<00:01:15.299> thousand<00:01:15.840> times<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
said it provides six thousand times the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.499 
said it provides six thousand times the
moisture<00:01:17.130> or<00:01:17.310> something<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.479> I

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
moisture or something like that so I

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.469 
moisture or something like that so I
thought<00:01:18.780> well<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.130> lives<00:01:20.490> up<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.970> that

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
thought well if it lives up to that that

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.050 
thought well if it lives up to that that
it's<00:01:21.659> definitely<00:01:21.869> worth<00:01:22.470> trying<00:01:23.220> out<00:01:23.640> so

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
it's definitely worth trying out so

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.030 
it's definitely worth trying out so
anyway<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:24.990> did<00:01:25.350> get<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.710> um<00:01:27.229> these<00:01:28.229> are<00:01:28.290> pretty

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
anyway I did get it um these are pretty

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.330 
anyway I did get it um these are pretty
comparable<00:01:29.460> also<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.840> know<00:01:31.409> tart<00:01:31.770> has<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
comparable also to you know tart has the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.910 
comparable also to you know tart has the
cheek<00:01:33.060> stain<00:01:33.390> that's<00:01:34.200> all<00:01:34.409> supposed<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.829> be

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
cheek stain that's all supposed to be

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.249 
cheek stain that's all supposed to be
very<00:01:35.189> good<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.090> your<00:01:36.210> skin<00:01:36.360> or<00:01:36.689> moisturizing

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
very good for your skin or moisturizing

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.200 
very good for your skin or moisturizing
or<00:01:37.350> whatever<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.979> think<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.729> all<00:01:38.909> kind

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
or whatever so I think this is all kind

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.929 
or whatever so I think this is all kind
of<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.450> same<00:01:40.159> family<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.189> makeup<00:01:41.790> or

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
of in the same family of makeup or

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.760 
of in the same family of makeup or
whatever<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.270> think<00:01:42.600> it's<00:01:42.750> like<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> gel<00:01:43.200> base<00:01:43.439> or

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
whatever I think it's like a gel base or

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.300 
whatever I think it's like a gel base or
something<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.270> but<00:01:45.270> anyway<00:01:45.950> so<00:01:46.950> this

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
something like that but anyway so this

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.179 
something like that but anyway so this
is<00:01:47.490> what<00:01:47.869> what<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.020> packaging<00:01:49.229> looks<00:01:49.530> like<00:01:49.950> I

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
is what what the packaging looks like I

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.730 
is what what the packaging looks like I
actually<00:01:51.030> think<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.960> packaging<00:01:52.590> is

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
actually think that the packaging is

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.719 
actually think that the packaging is
pretty<00:01:53.720> pretty<00:01:54.720> genius<00:01:55.320> um<00:01:55.920> for<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.549> lip

compared<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.290> my<00:02:16.410> thumb<00:02:16.620> it's<00:02:16.860> like<00:02:17.150> half<00:02:18.150> of

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
compared to my thumb it's like half of

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.780 
compared to my thumb it's like half of
my<00:02:18.480> thumb<00:02:18.810> i<00:02:18.960> guess<00:02:19.170> but<00:02:19.800> it's<00:02:19.980> also<00:02:20.130> pretty

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
my thumb i guess but it's also pretty

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.550 
my thumb i guess but it's also pretty
thick<00:02:21.350> so<00:02:22.730> um<00:02:24.410> now<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.740> might<00:02:26.580> not<00:02:26.760> look<00:02:27.060> like

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
thick so um now that might not look like

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.630 
thick so um now that might not look like
too<00:02:28.560> much<00:02:28.710> product<00:02:29.070> for<00:02:29.400> spending

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
too much product for spending

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.120 
too much product for spending
twenty-four<00:02:30.270> dollars<00:02:30.390> i<00:02:30.900> mean<00:02:30.930> because<00:02:31.890> the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
twenty-four dollars i mean because the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.910 
twenty-four dollars i mean because the
container<00:02:32.850> looks<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.240> lot<00:02:33.360> bigger<00:02:33.600> but<00:02:34.080> i<00:02:34.320> think

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
container looks a lot bigger but i think

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.340 
container looks a lot bigger but i think
the<00:02:35.040> product<00:02:35.580> is<00:02:35.760> definitely<00:02:36.150> worth<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.510> $24

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
the product is definitely worth a $24

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.590 
the product is definitely worth a $24
because<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:39.110> quality<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.470> stain<00:02:40.890> is

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
because the quality of the stain is

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.150 
because the quality of the stain is
actually<00:02:42.600> really<00:02:42.780> good<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.260> really<00:02:43.410> does<00:02:43.800> last

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
actually really good it really does last

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.900 
actually really good it really does last
most<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.300> day<00:02:45.560> i've<00:02:46.560> put<00:02:46.860> this<00:02:47.010> on<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.700> the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
most of the day i've put this on in the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.280 
most of the day i've put this on in the
morning<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:50.030> haven't<00:02:51.030> really<00:02:51.360> felt<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.140> need

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
morning and haven't really felt the need

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.320 
morning and haven't really felt the need
to<00:02:52.470> touch<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.710> up<00:02:53.010> until<00:02:53.460> maybe<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:53.970> later<00:02:54.120> in

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
to touch it up until maybe like later in

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.030 
to touch it up until maybe like later in
the<00:02:54.420> afternoon<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:55.140> that's<00:02:55.290> even<00:02:55.650> after

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
the afternoon and that's even after

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.680 
the afternoon and that's even after
eating<00:02:56.340> lunch<00:02:56.640> probably<00:02:57.030> just<00:02:57.300> because<00:02:57.420> I'm

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
eating lunch probably just because I'm

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.230 
eating lunch probably just because I'm
like<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.770> know<00:02:58.800> blotting<00:02:59.430> my<00:02:59.580> mouth<00:02:59.790> and

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
like you know blotting my mouth and

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.200 
like you know blotting my mouth and
whatever<00:03:00.810> but<00:03:00.900> um<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:02.100> think<00:03:02.610> this<00:03:02.730> works

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
whatever but um I think this works

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.650 
whatever but um I think this works
really<00:03:04.170> great<00:03:04.470> as<00:03:05.460> far<00:03:05.820> as<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.150> moisture

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
really great as far as the moisture

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.330 
really great as far as the moisture
factor<00:03:07.230> um<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:08.390> I<00:03:09.390> guess<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.170> moisturizes<00:03:11.160> that

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
factor um I I guess it moisturizes that

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.320 
factor um I I guess it moisturizes that
much<00:03:11.550> I<00:03:11.730> can't<00:03:11.970> really<00:03:12.510> tell<00:03:12.980> because<00:03:14.030> my<00:03:15.030> lips

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
much I can't really tell because my lips

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.440 
much I can't really tell because my lips
have<00:03:15.510> been<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:16.110> dry<00:03:16.680> this<00:03:16.740> winter<00:03:17.120> that's<00:03:18.120> like

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
have been so dry this winter that's like

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.900 
have been so dry this winter that's like
anytime<00:03:18.660> I<00:03:19.020> put<00:03:19.260> any<00:03:19.530> kind<00:03:19.800> of<00:03:19.980> lip<00:03:20.190> product<00:03:20.730> it

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
anytime I put any kind of lip product it

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.690 
anytime I put any kind of lip product it
just<00:03:21.150> causes<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.500> dry<00:03:22.800> skin<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.400> kind<00:03:23.610> of

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
just causes the the dry skin to kind of

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.790 
just causes the the dry skin to kind of
flake<00:03:23.940> up<00:03:24.150> so<00:03:24.540> that's<00:03:25.110> kind<00:03:25.320> of<00:03:25.350> been<00:03:25.500> annoying

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
flake up so that's kind of been annoying

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.890 
flake up so that's kind of been annoying
but<00:03:26.070> I<00:03:26.100> think<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.640> this<00:03:27.150> has<00:03:27.360> actually<00:03:27.540> been

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
but I think that this has actually been

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.840 
but I think that this has actually been
helping<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.680> get<00:03:28.950> rid<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.190> some<00:03:29.310> of<00:03:29.520> the<00:03:29.670> dead

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
helping to get rid of some of the dead

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.470 
helping to get rid of some of the dead
skin<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.510> maybe<00:03:30.900> it's<00:03:31.080> good<00:03:31.230> thing<00:03:31.440> um<00:03:32.480> but

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
skin so maybe it's good thing um but

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.990 
skin so maybe it's good thing um but
anyway<00:03:33.840> as<00:03:34.380> far<00:03:34.440> as<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:34.950> color<00:03:35.190> payoff<00:03:35.460> like

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
anyway as far as the color payoff like

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.940 
anyway as far as the color payoff like
um<00:03:37.070> you<00:03:38.070> can<00:03:38.280> really<00:03:38.640> layer<00:03:38.940> this<00:03:39.270> up<00:03:39.630> so<00:03:40.050> you

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
um you can really layer this up so you

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.010 
um you can really layer this up so you
know<00:03:40.980> if<00:03:41.190> I<00:03:41.280> put<00:03:41.550> just<00:03:41.820> like<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.750> know<00:03:42.780> just

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020

a little bit little coat um it'll make a
really<00:03:46.290> nice<00:03:46.470> pink<00:03:47.010> flush<00:03:47.400> but<00:03:47.760> then<00:03:47.970> if<00:03:48.270> I

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.690 
I can make it super vibrant actually
when<00:03:54.240> I<00:03:54.270> tested<00:03:54.930> this<00:03:55.290> at<00:03:55.500> sephora<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:56.130> had

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
kind of give you an idea so the first

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.150 
kind of give you an idea so the first
watch<00:04:18.570> is<00:04:18.810> just<00:04:18.989> like<00:04:19.140> one<00:04:19.320> swipe<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:20.010> then

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
watch is just like one swipe and then

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.000 
watch is just like one swipe and then
the<00:04:20.370> second<00:04:20.790> one<00:04:20.820> is<00:04:21.260> like<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.320> couple<00:04:22.680> swipes

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
the second one is like a couple swipes

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
this review is kind of scattered and all

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.580 
this review is kind of scattered and all
over<00:05:16.229> the<00:05:16.349> place<00:05:16.560> but<00:05:16.830> hopefully<00:05:18.229> that<00:05:19.229> tells

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
over the place but hopefully that tells

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.749 
over the place but hopefully that tells
you<00:05:19.740> what<00:05:19.889> you<00:05:20.009> need<00:05:20.159> to<00:05:20.280> know<00:05:20.310> about<00:05:20.430> the

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 
you what you need to know about the

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:22.939 
you what you need to know about the
product<00:05:21.150> so<00:05:21.479> anyway<00:05:21.870> I'd<00:05:22.169> say<00:05:22.500> that<00:05:22.740> the

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
product so anyway I'd say that the

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:24.980 
product so anyway I'd say that the
twenty-four<00:05:23.460> dollars<00:05:23.639> is<00:05:24.180> definitely<00:05:24.750> worth

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
twenty-four dollars is definitely worth

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.189 
twenty-four dollars is definitely worth
it<00:05:25.340> and<00:05:26.340> so<00:05:26.669> I<00:05:26.699> don't<00:05:26.970> regret<00:05:27.389> having<00:05:27.630> spent

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
it and so I don't regret having spent

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.080 
it and so I don't regret having spent
that<00:05:28.380> much<00:05:28.530> on<00:05:28.680> this<00:05:28.830> product<00:05:29.280> i<00:05:29.400> think<00:05:29.639> i<00:05:29.789> will

and<00:06:27.630> also<00:06:28.289> lined<00:06:28.650> is<00:06:29.039> the<00:06:29.880> magenta<00:06:30.330> liner<00:06:30.630> so<00:06:31.409> I

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
and also lined is the magenta liner so I

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.700 
and also lined is the magenta liner so I
think<00:06:31.800> that<00:06:32.039> this<00:06:32.610> pink<00:06:33.090> really<00:06:33.560> kind<00:06:34.560> of

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
think that this pink really kind of

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.029 
think that this pink really kind of
gives<00:06:35.250> a<00:06:35.400> good<00:06:35.719> tone<00:06:36.719> to<00:06:37.229> some<00:06:37.440> other<00:06:37.589> pink

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 
gives a good tone to some other pink

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:40.460 
gives a good tone to some other pink
lipsticks<00:06:38.520> that<00:06:38.610> you<00:06:38.820> might<00:06:39.000> have<00:06:39.029> so

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.470 
lipsticks that you might have so

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.410 
lipsticks that you might have so
actually<00:06:40.830> by<00:06:40.950> having<00:06:41.280> that<00:06:41.310> darker<00:06:41.760> color<00:06:42.000> you

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420 
actually by having that darker color you

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.300 
actually by having that darker color you
might<00:06:42.600> even<00:06:42.630> find<00:06:43.170> that<00:06:43.380> you<00:06:43.470> can<00:06:43.740> get<00:06:44.160> more

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 
might even find that you can get more

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.100 
might even find that you can get more
use<00:06:44.550> out<00:06:44.760> of<00:06:44.820> some<00:06:45.090> of<00:06:45.180> the<00:06:45.300> lipsticks<00:06:46.020> that

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
use out of some of the lipsticks that

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.900 
use out of some of the lipsticks that
you<00:06:46.350> have<00:06:46.560> just<00:06:46.830> to<00:06:46.980> kind<00:06:47.190> of<00:06:47.250> create<00:06:47.490> a<00:06:47.670> new

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910

tone<00:06:48.420> or<00:06:48.660> new<00:06:48.810> shades<00:06:49.080> so<00:06:49.410> just<00:06:50.220> thought<00:06:50.400> I'd

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
tone or new shades so just thought I'd
