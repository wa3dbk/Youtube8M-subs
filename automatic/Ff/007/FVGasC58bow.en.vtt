00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
really insane to make a few tips that I

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.779 
really insane to make a few tips that I
have<00:00:33.410> for<00:00:33.649> flip-flops<00:00:34.100> that<00:00:34.309> I<00:00:34.340> think<00:00:34.640> are

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:34.789 
have for flip-flops that I think are

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:37.779 
have for flip-flops that I think are
important<00:00:35.329> for<00:00:35.809> where<00:00:36.050> to<00:00:36.140> wear<00:00:36.289> them<00:00:36.789> number

00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:37.789 
important for where to wear them number

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:40.779 
important for where to wear them number
one<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:38.390> beach<00:00:38.600> is<00:00:38.629> obviously<00:00:39.199> the<00:00:39.789> perfect

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:40.789 
one the beach is obviously the perfect

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.240 
one the beach is obviously the perfect
zone<00:00:41.059> for<00:00:41.120> flip-flops<00:00:42.079> they<00:00:42.469> that<00:00:42.829> is<00:00:43.010> like

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
zone for flip-flops they that is like

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.009 
zone for flip-flops they that is like
the<00:00:43.399> ideal<00:00:43.730> place<00:00:43.910> to<00:00:44.030> wear<00:00:44.329> flip-flops<00:00:44.780> I

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
the ideal place to wear flip-flops I

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.979 
the ideal place to wear flip-flops I
also<00:00:45.469> think<00:00:45.769> that<00:00:45.890> they<00:00:46.070> work<00:00:46.250> well<00:00:46.579> with<00:00:47.059> maxi

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
also think that they work well with maxi

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.509 
also think that they work well with maxi
dresses<00:00:48.230> they<00:00:48.530> look<00:00:48.710> really<00:00:48.890> cute<00:00:49.190> so<00:00:49.429> if

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
especially if they have a little bit

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.319 
especially if they have a little bit
more<00:00:58.010> design<00:00:58.309> decent<00:00:58.640> crystal<00:00:58.999> or<00:00:59.089> something

like that I do think that they are okay
to<00:01:02.269> wear<00:01:03.170> this<00:01:03.230> is<00:01:03.620> that<00:01:03.710> are<00:01:03.800> outside<00:01:04.129> pretty

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
much that's where I feel like they go

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.340 
much that's where I feel like they go
better<00:01:06.590> in<00:01:06.860> that<00:01:07.090> definitely<00:01:08.090> a<00:01:08.240> negative<00:01:08.900> no

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
better in that definitely a negative no

better in that definitely a negative no
to<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:09.799> office<00:01:10.280> or<00:01:10.520> anywhere<00:01:10.990> inside<00:01:11.990> they

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
to the office or anywhere inside they

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.800 
to the office or anywhere inside they
are<00:01:12.290> definitely<00:01:12.770> okay<00:01:13.549> to<00:01:14.000> wear<00:01:14.210> to<00:01:14.659> get<00:01:14.780> a

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
are definitely okay to wear to get a

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.840 
are definitely okay to wear to get a
pedicure<00:01:14.960> or<00:01:15.380> anything<00:01:15.770> like<00:01:15.799> that<00:01:15.920> obviously

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
pedicure or anything like that obviously

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.859 
pedicure or anything like that obviously
that's<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.119> perfect<00:01:17.299> place<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:17.750> wear

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
that's the perfect place to wear

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.359 
that's the perfect place to wear
flip-flops<00:01:18.259> I<00:01:18.380> think<00:01:18.560> they're<00:01:18.710> over<00:01:19.009> worn<00:01:19.280> a

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
flip-flops I think they're over worn a

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:20.649 
flip-flops I think they're over worn a
lot<00:01:19.549> and<00:01:19.700> I<00:01:19.790> think<00:01:20.000> people<00:01:20.060> think<00:01:20.360> that<00:01:20.540> they

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
lot and I think people think that they

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.240 
lot and I think people think that they
could<00:01:20.720> just<00:01:20.840> throw<00:01:21.170> them<00:01:21.320> on<00:01:21.470> all<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.740> time<00:01:22.070> no

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
could just throw them on all the time no

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.710 
could just throw them on all the time no
matter<00:01:22.280> where<00:01:22.579> they're<00:01:22.670> going<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:23.180> it

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
matter where they're going and it

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.850 
matter where they're going and it
doesn't<00:01:23.960> really<00:01:24.020> make<00:01:24.500> a<00:01:24.560> lot<00:01:24.649> of<00:01:24.770> sense

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
doesn't really make a lot of sense

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.469 
doesn't really make a lot of sense
especially<00:01:25.100> I<00:01:25.460> see<00:01:25.610> them<00:01:25.759> walking<00:01:26.030> around<00:01:26.329> the

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
especially I see them walking around the

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.560 
especially I see them walking around the
streets<00:01:26.750> i'm<00:01:26.930> not<00:01:27.110> that<00:01:27.740> clean<00:01:28.159> and<00:01:28.490> your<00:01:29.360> feet

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
streets i'm not that clean and your feet

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.940 
streets i'm not that clean and your feet
will<00:01:29.600> get<00:01:29.930> really<00:01:30.229> dirty<00:01:30.380> on<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.680> bottom

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
will get really dirty on the bottom

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.560 
will get really dirty on the bottom
sometimes<00:01:31.189> from<00:01:31.520> wearing<00:01:31.700> them<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.060> might<00:01:32.479> be

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
sometimes from wearing them so might be

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.609 
sometimes from wearing them so might be
something<00:01:32.780> to<00:01:32.930> consider<00:01:32.990> when<00:01:33.380> you're

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
something to consider when you're

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.399 
something to consider when you're
wearing<00:01:33.890> them<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:34.250> they're<00:01:34.759> flopping<00:01:35.000> around

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
wearing them and they're flopping around

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.380 
wearing them and they're flopping around
