00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
start us off with the boot on the 10k

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.940 
start us off with the boot on the 10k
sure<00:00:17.330> yeah<00:00:17.599> this<00:00:17.720> our<00:00:17.869> 10k<00:00:18.259> boot<00:00:18.500> again

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:18.950 
sure yeah this our 10k boot again

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.100 
sure yeah this our 10k boot again
upgrades<00:00:19.880> from<00:00:20.060> previous<00:00:20.480> models<00:00:20.900> we've

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
upgrades from previous models we've

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.150 
upgrades from previous models we've
really<00:00:21.320> done<00:00:21.350> is<00:00:21.560> really<00:00:21.740> try<00:00:21.830> to<00:00:21.860> go<00:00:22.039> over

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
really done is really try to go over

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.130 
really done is really try to go over
with<00:00:22.250> a<00:00:22.310> really<00:00:22.550> stiff<00:00:22.820> quarter<00:00:23.210> so<00:00:23.810> it's<00:00:24.050> a

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
with a really stiff quarter so it's a

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.720 
with a really stiff quarter so it's a
pro<00:00:24.350> armor<00:00:24.529> three<00:00:24.830> quarter<00:00:25.250> which<00:00:25.430> is<00:00:25.550> similar

of course we have the pump so you can

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.330 
of course we have the pump so you can
really<00:00:29.689> customize<00:00:30.140> your<00:00:30.560> fit<00:00:30.619> lock<00:00:31.130> your

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
really customize your fit lock your

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.580 
really customize your fit lock your
healing<00:00:31.820> so<00:00:32.570> you<00:00:32.660> get<00:00:32.750> that<00:00:32.900> great<00:00:33.080> feel<00:00:33.410> and

you don't lose any of your power with
your<00:00:39.589> feet<00:00:39.769> moving<00:00:40.010> around<00:00:40.220> in<00:00:40.339> your<00:00:40.370> boot<00:00:40.610> so

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
your feet moving around in your boot so

again a really stiff but lightweight
quarter<00:00:43.670> to<00:00:44.600> again<00:00:44.780> maximize<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:45.530> energy

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
quarter to again maximize the energy

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.530 
quarter to again maximize the energy
transferring<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.400> the<00:00:46.430> ice<00:00:46.610> now<00:00:47.299> how<00:00:47.479> would

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
transferring to the ice now how would

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.439 
transferring to the ice now how would
you<00:00:47.720> compare<00:00:48.260> and<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:49.610> stiffness<00:00:49.879> of<00:00:50.239> your

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
you compare and the stiffness of your

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.000 
you compare and the stiffness of your
inline<00:00:50.839> skates<00:00:51.110> to<00:00:51.229> the<00:00:51.260> ice<00:00:51.440> skates<00:00:51.739> it's

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
inline skates to the ice skates it's

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.670 
inline skates to the ice skates it's
it's<00:00:52.699> exactly<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.420> same<00:00:53.629> we<00:00:53.930> use<00:00:54.049> the<00:00:54.470> same

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
it's exactly the same we use the same

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.039 
it's exactly the same we use the same
construction<00:00:55.159> from<00:00:55.519> a<00:00:55.580> quarter<00:00:55.850> and<00:00:56.659> from<00:00:56.930> a

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:57.049 
construction from a quarter and from a

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:59.289 
construction from a quarter and from a
heel<00:00:57.470> counter<00:00:57.650> point<00:00:57.920> of<00:00:58.070> view<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:58.970> all<00:00:59.119> the

00:00:59.289 --> 00:00:59.299 
heel counter point of view and all the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:00.579 
heel counter point of view and all the
reinforcements<00:00:59.960> that<00:00:59.989> we<00:01:00.110> have<00:01:00.229> on<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.470> ice

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
reinforcements that we have on the ice

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.259 
reinforcements that we have on the ice
we<00:01:00.830> put<00:01:01.010> into<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:01.309> roller<00:01:01.489> so<00:01:01.760> again<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:01.970> really

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
we put into the roller so again a really

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.479 
we put into the roller so again a really
stiff<00:01:02.510> I<00:01:02.690> in<00:01:02.869> boot<00:01:03.049> and<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.650> fit<00:01:03.890> aspects<00:01:04.309> as

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
stiff I in boot and the fit aspects as

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.010 
stiff I in boot and the fit aspects as
well<00:01:04.519> are<00:01:04.820> those<00:01:04.940> gonna<00:01:05.119> be<00:01:05.210> on<00:01:05.299> pars<00:01:05.540> yeah

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
absolutely we try to keep our fit the

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.069 
absolutely we try to keep our fit the
same<00:01:07.759> so<00:01:07.969> again<00:01:08.149> if<00:01:08.240> you<00:01:08.329> like<00:01:08.479> our<00:01:08.630> ice<00:01:08.810> fit

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079 
same so again if you like our ice fit

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:10.450 
same so again if you like our ice fit
you<00:01:09.500> know<00:01:09.619> you<00:01:09.680> know<00:01:09.859> exactly<00:01:10.250> what<00:01:10.340> you're

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
you know you know exactly what you're

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.859 
you know you know exactly what you're
getting<00:01:10.549> with<00:01:10.759> our<00:01:10.939> roller<00:01:11.090> fit<00:01:11.359> yeah<00:01:11.750> I<00:01:11.810> mean

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
getting with our roller fit yeah I mean

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.510 
getting with our roller fit yeah I mean
I<00:01:12.049> think<00:01:12.079> that's<00:01:12.380> great<00:01:12.829> to<00:01:13.039> keep<00:01:13.189> in<00:01:13.310> mind

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
I think that's great to keep in mind

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.490 
I think that's great to keep in mind
especially<00:01:14.210> guys<00:01:14.630> that<00:01:14.869> may<00:01:14.960> be<00:01:15.020> using<00:01:15.350> your

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
especially guys that may be using your

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.109 
especially guys that may be using your
ice<00:01:15.619> skates<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.159> want<00:01:16.280> to<00:01:16.340> jump<00:01:16.549> into<00:01:16.729> role<00:01:16.939> or

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
ice skates and want to jump into role or

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.330 
ice skates and want to jump into role or
vice<00:01:17.390> versa<00:01:17.750> yeah<00:01:18.229> they<00:01:18.500> can<00:01:18.679> you<00:01:18.979> know<00:01:19.100> count

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
vice versa yeah they can you know count

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.740 
vice versa yeah they can you know count
on<00:01:19.460> that<00:01:19.609> consistency<00:01:20.210> between<00:01:20.420> them

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
on that consistency between them

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.090 
on that consistency between them
absolutely<00:01:21.350> and<00:01:21.439> what<00:01:21.560> we<00:01:21.619> really<00:01:21.829> tried<00:01:22.009> to

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
absolutely and what we really tried to

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.469 
absolutely and what we really tried to
do<00:01:22.189> is<00:01:22.280> make<00:01:22.399> sure<00:01:22.429> we<00:01:22.729> have<00:01:22.850> a<00:01:22.880> wide<00:01:23.179> fit

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
do is make sure we have a wide fit

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:24.999 
do is make sure we have a wide fit
through<00:01:23.719> the<00:01:23.780> forefoot<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:24.770> again<00:01:24.829> you

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
through the forefoot and so again you

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.520 
through the forefoot and so again you
get<00:01:25.159> that<00:01:25.340> level<00:01:25.579> of<00:01:25.729> comfort<00:01:26.149> so<00:01:26.719> it's<00:01:26.990> same

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
get that level of comfort so it's same

the way it's designed again make sure
that<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.329> don't<00:03:00.450> lose<00:03:00.659> any<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.959> that<00:03:01.049> power

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
that you don't lose any of that power

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.740 
that you don't lose any of that power
going<00:03:01.560> into<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.950> surface<00:03:02.400> mm-hmm<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.180> then

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
going into the surface mm-hmm and then

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.809 
going into the surface mm-hmm and then
and<00:03:04.170> with<00:03:04.349> those<00:03:04.470> lower<00:03:04.890> or<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.489> smaller

actually I'm learning mobility it's
really<00:03:09.629> a<00:03:09.659> question<00:03:09.840> mobility<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.010> get

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
really a question mobility so you get

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.410 
really a question mobility so you get
that<00:03:11.310> power<00:03:11.579> with<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.849> big<00:03:12.000> wheels<00:03:12.209> at<00:03:12.390> the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
that power with the big wheels at the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.030 
that power with the big wheels at the
back<00:03:12.480> there<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.290> have<00:03:13.379> that<00:03:13.530> great<00:03:13.680> stride

back there you have that great stride
and<00:03:14.280> then<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.489> mobility<00:03:14.879> and<00:03:15.000> agility<00:03:15.269> of<00:03:15.450> the

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
and then the mobility and agility of the

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.839 
and then the mobility and agility of the
smaller<00:03:15.840> ones<00:03:16.019> in<00:03:16.140> front<00:03:16.379> yeah<00:03:17.159> and<00:03:17.340> then<00:03:17.519> as
