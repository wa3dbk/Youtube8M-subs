00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.620
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.389
 this channel today is about that 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.240
 samsung galaxy s you and we will 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:20.029
 let's see if this product resp 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.099
 This cellphone is less powerful and 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.910
 more powerful games without problems 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.210
 can play 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.130
 This test is only for gameplay resp 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.160
 not to the gameplay but only to the 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.780
 performance so please take into account that 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.150
 I play through a camera and to 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.620
 this can not bring the performance 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.050
 which you usually play in such a game 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.460
 should bring so please just look up 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.400
 the graphics resp 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.900
 whether the whole thing runs smoothly whether the fps 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.460
 tune and whether the performance in 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.049
 order that we start with angry 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.150
 so I have angry birds fruit 

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:54.589
 ninja and the carrier downloaded that 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.510
 There are three games from left to right 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.070
 We are becoming more and more powerful on the right side 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.769
 start with the weakest play what I 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.960
 calls angry birds very well known and very 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.350
 Well this game is fun to play 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.150
 definitely 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.890
 and then you have to see if that 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.950
 samsung galaxy s duos in the exact 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.740
 designation is called the whole gts 7 5 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.009
 6 2 that the long term whether it is 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.329
 creates floods in games of course 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.640
 we have the free version 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:23.810
 That's why we also have advertising here 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.259
 I disconnect hope that does not bother 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.340
 and now we'll get out of here and 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.679
 humming in and we'll see 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.880
 performance runs all the liquid that 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:34.130
 is not to be expected otherwise 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.670
 this processor and if we now 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.909
 shoot here , we only get it 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.049
 a pity shame a pity 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.420
 just because a wrong so you 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.119
 it looks like everything is running smoothly 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.399
 everything works as it should and me 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.999
 do not see any major performance now 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.560
 problems or fps burglaries or from the 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:55.999
 Everything in the graphics also scores 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.590
 order we have a very nice one 

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:59.749
 By the way, the display is a bright display 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.929
 on the maximum settings of the 

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:04.039
 brightness can not go on 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.020
 and that looks all right but we 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.729
 are in the green area at angry birds 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.830
 Let's move on to the next game 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.670
 what i call fruit ninja should be too 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.950
 be known to everyone 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.000
 a few fruits cut new 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.350
 Let's try here I have 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.950
 already played something whole already 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.720
 tested and you can see 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.599
 this all works fine here I can 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.599
 all this time here and there vision 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.489
 and we have no problems here 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.989
 Samsung Galaxy's duos can be enjoyed at Fruit 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.580
 ninja of course show what can and we 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.530
 cut a bomb ok then not 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.319
 Okay, let's get her with us 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.090
 let's see the effect of the cinema 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.510
 it all looks nice and everything 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.860
 Great 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.360
 We try it , that was it 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.810
 but it is so beautiful and we do it 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.810
 like to see 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.530
 so you can easily for people who 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.720
 just want to play in between 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.459
 Can not you do that the samsung galaxy s 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.239
 of course recommend duos 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.870
 smaller games and also 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.880
 the more powerful games we play 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.549
 to see it immediately are possible without any problems 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.620
 sometimes with this phone whole times 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.680
 and make the last game the 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.019
 The trigger is called a very bloody one 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.519
 Game is all because we have to 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:16.190
 Shoot down zombies from the graphic 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.900
 of course not in the something appealing 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.970
 compare for example as a game as 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.540
 fifa fifa 13 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.880
 infinity blade but something 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.410
 appealing and the samsung galaxy s 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.139
 duos should cope with it 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.609
 the rest you can see me here right now hello 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:35.690
 how strong here is the first quest or 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.709
 day 1 we have to shoot down the zombies 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.170
 Loading screen is in this game 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.859
 a little longer 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.600
 that's why we have to look that 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:43.310
 as easy as possible 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.750
 that means we can bridge 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.370
 Here normal control and the 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.239
 area running around parties like 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.739
 very very bloody said this game and 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.239
 very very angry zombies like us 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.760
 try to eat and they want to 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.139
 our brains have no problem with that 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.930
 We do not look at each other if it's a game 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:01.220
 The game runs smoothly 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.459
 and if the samsung galaxy s you have 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.220
 which games can keep up 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.389
 to let's go going on the left can 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.849
 we're on the right we're coming 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.220
 we wiggle our weapon back and forth 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.359
 shoot down a ton here 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.319
 yes we shot a great one 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.459
 have done it they have ours 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.229
 lifestyle achieves because we have one 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.910
 ton shot down here already a few 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.490
 seen performance problems 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.110
 When, where I'm right about the right 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.860
 corner where the zombies are loaded 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.050
 to have 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.620
 So you can see there already has 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:34.790
 performance has already eased a bit 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:40.419
 oh my god she toured milk this 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:42.410
 evil zombies or is the next dead 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.430
 Of course I have to try in the 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.650
 to stay in the camera 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.669
 It will be a bit difficult with the mobile phone 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.830
 you have to take care that you have the 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.770
 zombies all kill and you can see 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.419
 the whole thing is still running reasonably 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.830
 fluently as it can play on 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.380
 In any case you only have one here 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.990
 small performance problems or fps 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.360
 burglary where I walked around the corner 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:07.070
 when all the zombies have loaded i 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.449
 think that this is the only one 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.680
 stay with these games we have that 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.940
 whole mission made it here that was 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.680
 a very difficult mission as you can see 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.680
 and you look at that but galaxy s you 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.979
 you can easily play normal games 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.300
 or something more powerful games 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.820
 Play easily and I can 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.050
 only recommend to the whole power that makes 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.880
 you definitely enjoy it 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.850
 in that we have such a nice bright 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.830
 display has the whole thing very much 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.270
 Out of contrast and very good from that 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.919
 so far to the test whether one with the 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.460
 Samsung Galaxy s duos a few games 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.900
 can play 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.669
 I can thank you for that 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.030
 watch and see you next time on 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.030
 meet again
