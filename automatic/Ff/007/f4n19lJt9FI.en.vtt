00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
team value elsewhere I've swapped the

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.789 
team value elsewhere I've swapped the
injured<00:03:05.269> Rangel<00:03:05.690> for<00:03:06.019> an<00:03:06.110> extra<00:03:06.440> Everton

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
injured Rangel for an extra Everton

defender Jagielka and I've also bought

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.059

in<00:03:10.130> a<00:03:10.190> Lampard<00:03:10.610> in<00:03:11.120> place<00:03:11.420> of<00:03:11.450> Barclay<00:03:11.989> I<00:03:12.200> do

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
in a Lampard in place of Barclay I do

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.190 
in a Lampard in place of Barclay I do
think<00:03:13.340> Barclay<00:03:13.670> is<00:03:13.700> a<00:03:13.819> decent<00:03:14.090> player<00:03:14.420> and

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
think Barclay is a decent player and

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.720 
think Barclay is a decent player and
he's<00:03:15.319> had<00:03:15.560> two<00:03:15.890> or<00:03:16.040> three<00:03:16.280> standout

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
he's had two or three standout

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.880 
he's had two or three standout
performances<00:03:17.360> so<00:03:17.569> far<00:03:17.599> this<00:03:17.900> season<00:03:17.959> so<00:03:18.739> I<00:03:18.769> do

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
performances so far this season so I do

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:19.809 
performances so far this season so I do
you<00:03:18.950> think<00:03:19.099> there<00:03:19.190> were<00:03:19.280> more<00:03:19.459> girls<00:03:19.640> coming

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
you think there were more girls coming

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.449 
you think there were more girls coming
from<00:03:20.239> him<00:03:20.450> over<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:20.870> next<00:03:21.110> few<00:03:21.290> weeks<00:03:21.500> but<00:03:22.430> I

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
from him over the next few weeks but I

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.640 
from him over the next few weeks but I
decided<00:03:22.879> that<00:03:23.000> I'd<00:03:23.360> prefer<00:03:23.629> three<00:03:24.230> Everton

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
decided that I'd prefer three Everton

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.080 
decided that I'd prefer three Everton
defensive<00:03:25.190> players<00:03:25.430> for<00:03:25.700> their<00:03:25.819> upcoming

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
defensive players for their upcoming

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.089 
defensive players for their upcoming
fixtures<00:03:26.440> since<00:03:27.440> they<00:03:27.560> have<00:03:27.739> been<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:28.069> best

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
fixtures since they have been the best

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.220 
fixtures since they have been the best
team<00:03:28.370> so<00:03:28.640> far<00:03:28.670> four<00:03:29.060> clean<00:03:29.209> sheets<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:29.750> they

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
team so far four clean sheets and they

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.309 
team so far four clean sheets and they
do<00:03:30.290> have<00:03:30.379> a<00:03:30.500> nice<00:03:30.709> run<00:03:30.950> of<00:03:31.040> fixtures<00:03:31.160> coming<00:03:31.579> up

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
do have a nice run of fixtures coming up

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.020 
do have a nice run of fixtures coming up
my<00:03:33.319> decision<00:03:33.739> to<00:03:33.920> bring<00:03:34.160> in<00:03:34.400> three<00:03:34.670> Everton

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
my decision to bring in three Everton

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.300 
my decision to bring in three Everton
defenders<00:03:35.480> is<00:03:35.660> definitely<00:03:36.200> risky<00:03:36.379> but<00:03:37.190> as

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
defenders is definitely risky but as

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.009 
defenders is definitely risky but as
long<00:03:37.549> as<00:03:37.700> you<00:03:37.819> think<00:03:38.030> of<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.269> over<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.569> period<00:03:38.840> of

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
long as you think of it over a period of

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.379 
long as you think of it over a period of
time<00:03:39.290> as<00:03:39.530> opposed<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:40.160> a<00:03:40.340> week-by-week<00:03:40.610> basis

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
time as opposed to a week-by-week basis

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.629 
time as opposed to a week-by-week basis
I<00:03:41.569> think<00:03:42.049> it<00:03:42.139> should<00:03:42.290> be<00:03:42.319> ok<00:03:42.579> there'll<00:03:43.579> be

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
I think it should be ok there'll be

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.940 
I think it should be ok there'll be
times<00:03:43.940> when<00:03:44.239> they<00:03:44.840> each<00:03:45.019> get<00:03:45.290> me<00:03:45.440> just<00:03:45.620> one<00:03:45.769> or

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
times when they each get me just one or

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.800 
times when they each get me just one or
two<00:03:45.980> points<00:03:46.579> and<00:03:46.790> that<00:03:47.389> could<00:03:47.569> even<00:03:47.660> happen

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
two points and that could even happen

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.229 
two points and that could even happen
this<00:03:48.139> weekend<00:03:48.560> but<00:03:49.100> every<00:03:49.370> time<00:03:49.549> Everton<00:03:50.090> do

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
this weekend but every time Everton do

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.729 
this weekend but every time Everton do
manager<00:03:50.569> clean<00:03:50.750> sheet<00:03:50.959> it<00:03:51.170> will<00:03:51.290> be<00:03:51.410> worth<00:03:51.560> at

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
manager clean sheet it will be worth at

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.190 
manager clean sheet it will be worth at
least<00:03:51.769> 18<00:03:52.310> points<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:52.849> probably<00:03:53.569> more<00:03:53.810> after

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
least 18 points and probably more after

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.410 
least 18 points and probably more after
bonus<00:03:54.470> points<00:03:54.769> so<00:03:55.519> as<00:03:55.670> I<00:03:55.700> say<00:03:55.910> I<00:03:55.940> think<00:03:56.060> it<00:03:56.299> will

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
bonus points so as I say I think it will

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.500 
bonus points so as I say I think it will
work<00:03:56.450> out<00:03:56.750> overall<00:03:57.200> I<00:03:57.940> was<00:03:58.940> thinking<00:03:59.299> about

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
work out overall I was thinking about

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.539 
work out overall I was thinking about
bringing<00:03:59.750> in<00:03:59.900> Lukaku<00:04:00.349> forgery<00:04:00.769> but<00:04:01.040> that

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
bringing in Lukaku forgery but that

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.129 
bringing in Lukaku forgery but that
would<00:04:01.670> mean<00:04:01.790> losing<00:04:02.030> an<00:04:02.359> Everton<00:04:02.720> defender

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
would mean losing an Everton defender

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.589 
would mean losing an Everton defender
and<00:04:03.319> in<00:04:04.130> a<00:04:04.190> couple<00:04:04.459> of<00:04:04.489> weeks<00:04:04.549> Giroux<00:04:05.000> speakers

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
and in a couple of weeks Giroux speakers

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.870 
and in a couple of weeks Giroux speakers
look<00:04:05.750> really<00:04:06.049> nice<00:04:06.200> West<00:04:06.980> Ham<00:04:07.250> Newcastle

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470

taking a hit to get rid of him to then

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.120 
taking a hit to get rid of him to then

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
back in a couple of weeks I've decided

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.199 
back in a couple of weeks I've decided
to<00:04:18.769> bring<00:04:18.950> in<00:04:19.010> Lampard<00:04:19.519> on<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:19.789> basis<00:04:20.180> that

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
to bring in Lampard on the basis that

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.270 
to bring in Lampard on the basis that
although<00:04:20.840> he'll<00:04:21.079> get<00:04:21.260> a<00:04:21.289> few<00:04:21.620> one<00:04:21.859> pointers

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
although he'll get a few one pointers

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.460 
although he'll get a few one pointers
over<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.180> course<00:04:23.330> of<00:04:23.539> the<00:04:23.660> season<00:04:23.840> he<00:04:24.229> should

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
over the course of the season he should

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.170 
over the course of the season he should
be<00:04:24.590> looking<00:04:24.919> at<00:04:25.070> get<00:04:25.220> in<00:04:25.310> at<00:04:25.400> least<00:04:25.550> ten<00:04:25.910> goals

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
be looking at get in at least ten goals

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.510 
be looking at get in at least ten goals
and<00:04:26.479> probably<00:04:26.960> more<00:04:27.200> so<00:04:27.830> as<00:04:27.979> long<00:04:28.130> as<00:04:28.190> I<00:04:28.400> keep

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
and probably more so as long as I keep

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.430 
and probably more so as long as I keep
him<00:04:28.700> for<00:04:28.880> the<00:04:29.000> season<00:04:29.360> it<00:04:29.539> should<00:04:30.050> work<00:04:30.200> out

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
him for the season it should work out

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.980 
him for the season it should work out
and<00:04:30.950> also<00:04:31.430> I<00:04:31.610> like<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.120> idea<00:04:32.210> of<00:04:32.419> having<00:04:32.630> both

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
and also I like the idea of having both

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.200 
and also I like the idea of having both
Lampard<00:04:33.590> and<00:04:33.770> hazard<00:04:34.130> since<00:04:34.820> they<00:04:35.030> are

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
Lampard and hazard since they are

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.360 
Lampard and hazard since they are
Chelsea's<00:04:35.750> penalty<00:04:36.169> takers<00:04:36.530> so<00:04:36.710> by<00:04:37.220> having

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
Chelsea's penalty takers so by having

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.040 
Chelsea's penalty takers so by having
them<00:04:37.669> I'm<00:04:37.880> guaranteed<00:04:38.330> to<00:04:38.510> get<00:04:38.630> points<00:04:38.990> for

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
them I'm guaranteed to get points for

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.960 
them I'm guaranteed to get points for
all<00:04:39.289> the<00:04:39.440> penalties<00:04:39.770> Chelsea<00:04:40.400> managed<00:04:40.639> to<00:04:40.789> win

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
all the penalties Chelsea managed to win

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.170 
all the penalties Chelsea managed to win
and<00:04:41.120> score<00:04:42.130> in<00:04:43.130> terms<00:04:43.460> of<00:04:43.610> selection<00:04:44.090> this

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
and score in terms of selection this

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.570 
and score in terms of selection this
week<00:04:44.360> I'm<00:04:44.599> not<00:04:44.990> yet<00:04:45.169> decided<00:04:45.500> on<00:04:45.830> who<00:04:46.340> to<00:04:46.520> start

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
week I'm not yet decided on who to start

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.750 
week I'm not yet decided on who to start
between<00:04:47.060> Turner<00:04:47.450> Flanagan<00:04:48.080> and<00:04:48.229> kashani

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
between Turner Flanagan and kashani

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.220 
between Turner Flanagan and kashani
Turner<00:04:49.760> has<00:04:50.000> the<00:04:50.180> easiest<00:04:50.539> fixture

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
Turner has the easiest fixture

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.410 
Turner has the easiest fixture
home<00:04:51.440> to<00:04:51.680> West<00:04:51.830> Brom<00:04:52.130> so<00:04:52.640> I'm<00:04:52.730> edging<00:04:53.030> towards

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
home to West Brom so I'm edging towards

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.360 
home to West Brom so I'm edging towards
him<00:04:53.540> at<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:53.720> moment<00:04:54.020> and<00:04:54.710> also<00:04:54.890> I'm<00:04:55.160> torn

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
him at the moment and also I'm torn

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.730 
him at the moment and also I'm torn
between<00:04:55.490> play<00:04:55.910> in<00:04:55.970> jeru<00:04:56.210> or<00:04:56.570> yanez<00:04:56.930> I<00:04:57.050> because

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
between play in jeru or yanez I because

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.740 
between play in jeru or yanez I because
Giroux<00:04:57.980> has<00:04:58.220> a<00:04:58.250> tricky<00:04:58.610> fixture<00:04:58.970> away<00:04:59.330> to<00:04:59.390> man

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
Giroux has a tricky fixture away to man

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.570 
Giroux has a tricky fixture away to man
city<00:04:59.960> so<00:05:00.440> may<00:05:00.620> not<00:05:00.800> get<00:05:00.890> a<00:05:00.950> lot<00:05:01.130> of<00:05:01.160> chances

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
city so may not get a lot of chances

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.430 
city so may not get a lot of chances
where<00:05:02.270> as<00:05:02.390> young<00:05:02.570> as<00:05:02.690> I<00:05:02.810> had<00:05:02.990> a<00:05:03.020> great<00:05:03.230> game

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
where as young as I had a great game

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.350 
where as young as I had a great game
last<00:05:03.500> weekend<00:05:04.040> against<00:05:04.370> Newcastle<00:05:04.820> and<00:05:04.910> was

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
last weekend against Newcastle and was

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.850 
last weekend against Newcastle and was
one<00:05:05.480> of<00:05:05.510> the<00:05:05.660> few<00:05:05.900> players<00:05:06.170> for<00:05:06.380> United<00:05:06.500> who

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
one of the few players for United who

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.410 
one of the few players for United who
was<00:05:07.040> creating<00:05:07.580> chances<00:05:07.820> and<00:05:08.210> looking

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
was creating chances and looking

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.210 
was creating chances and looking
positive<00:05:08.840> so<00:05:09.410> I<00:05:09.440> think<00:05:09.530> he<00:05:09.770> should<00:05:09.920> get<00:05:10.010> end<00:05:10.160> of

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
positive so I think he should get end of

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.800 
positive so I think he should get end of
the<00:05:10.310> start<00:05:10.580> this<00:05:10.670> weekend<00:05:11.060> against<00:05:11.390> villa<00:05:11.540> and

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
the start this weekend against villa and

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.930 
the start this weekend against villa and
if<00:05:12.440> he<00:05:12.560> carries<00:05:12.800> on<00:05:13.010> plane<00:05:13.220> leggy<00:05:13.520> husband

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
if he carries on plane leggy husband

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
probably going to go for Aguero all

probably going to go for Aguero all
three<00:05:20.810> of<00:05:20.840> my<00:05:21.110> strikers<00:05:21.620> this<00:05:21.770> week<00:05:21.950> have

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
three of my strikers this week have

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.790 
three of my strikers this week have
tricky<00:05:22.460> fixtures<00:05:22.880> but<00:05:23.060> Aguero<00:05:24.050> is<00:05:24.470> at<00:05:24.620> home

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
tricky fixtures but Aguero is at home

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.980 
tricky fixtures but Aguero is at home
and<00:05:25.070> man<00:05:25.670> city<00:05:25.880> have<00:05:26.150> been<00:05:26.180> scoring<00:05:26.630> a<00:05:26.720> lot<00:05:26.750> at

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
and man city have been scoring a lot at

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.770 
and man city have been scoring a lot at
home<00:05:27.080> in<00:05:27.440> recent<00:05:27.830> weeks<00:05:27.860> I<00:05:28.280> am<00:05:29.060> also<00:05:29.270> tempted

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
home in recent weeks I am also tempted

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.510 
home in recent weeks I am also tempted
with<00:05:29.870> Suarez<00:05:30.170> because<00:05:30.860> he's<00:05:31.070> been<00:05:31.250> in<00:05:31.340> great

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
with Suarez because he's been in great

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.460 
with Suarez because he's been in great
form<00:05:31.790> lately<00:05:31.970> five<00:05:32.390> goals<00:05:32.660> in<00:05:32.870> his<00:05:32.990> last<00:05:33.080> two

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
form lately five goals in his last two

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.620 
form lately five goals in his last two
games<00:05:33.710> and<00:05:34.010> with<00:05:34.730> Jarrod<00:05:35.120> out<00:05:35.210> injured

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
games and with Jarrod out injured

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.850 
games and with Jarrod out injured
there's<00:05:35.870> a<00:05:35.930> good<00:05:36.140> chance<00:05:36.410> he'll<00:05:36.620> be<00:05:36.770> on

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
there's a good chance he'll be on

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.530 
there's a good chance he'll be on
penalties<00:05:37.310> so<00:05:37.520> it's<00:05:38.120> a<00:05:38.150> toss<00:05:38.300> up<00:05:38.360> between

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
penalties so it's a toss up between

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.990 
penalties so it's a toss up between
those<00:05:38.870> two<00:05:39.080> for<00:05:39.320> me<00:05:39.440> at<00:05:39.530> the<00:05:39.590> minute<00:05:39.830> but<00:05:40.790> I<00:05:40.820> am

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
those two for me at the minute but I am

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.960 
those two for me at the minute but I am
edging<00:05:41.330> towards<00:05:41.690> Aguero<00:05:42.520> and<00:05:43.520> as<00:05:43.640> always<00:05:43.850> you

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
edging towards Aguero and as always you

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
can find the predicted lineups and any

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.380 
can find the predicted lineups and any
