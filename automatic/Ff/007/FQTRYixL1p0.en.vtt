00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
so it's been a lot of debate about the

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.590 
so it's been a lot of debate about the
fic<00:00:04.470> nine<00:00:05.160> hundred<00:00:05.580> or<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.759> thousand<00:00:06.120> CC<00:00:06.240> Bosch

core<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.680> ID<00:00:08.120> 1100<00:00:09.120> injectors<00:00:09.840> we<00:00:10.650> just

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
core and the ID 1100 injectors we just

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.560 
core and the ID 1100 injectors we just
got<00:00:10.980> two<00:00:11.190> brand-new<00:00:11.759> out<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.059> box<00:00:12.269> as<00:00:12.450> you

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
got two brand-new out of the box as you

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.259 
got two brand-new out of the box as you
can<00:00:12.719> see<00:00:13.130> basically<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.490> same<00:00:14.639> connectors<00:00:15.120> I

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
can see basically the same connectors I

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.170 
can see basically the same connectors I
mean<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.870> IDs<00:00:16.410> are<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.680> nice<00:00:16.890> stealth<00:00:17.490> black<00:00:17.880> so

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
mean the IDs are a nice stealth black so

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.000 
mean the IDs are a nice stealth black so
they<00:00:18.300> get<00:00:18.449> tucked<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.810> but<00:00:19.020> effectively<00:00:19.770> it's

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
they get tucked in but effectively it's

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.490 
they get tucked in but effectively it's
the<00:00:20.130> same<00:00:20.340> exact<00:00:21.180> connector<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:22.230> have<00:00:22.350> your

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
the same exact connector you have your

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.259 
the same exact connector you have your

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
flow sheets between the two which we can

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.290

injectors they all match up I don't know

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.399 
injectors they all match up I don't know
if<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:26.850> see<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.210> camera<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.259> it's

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
if you can see in a camera so it's

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.280 
if you can see in a camera so it's
effectively<00:01:29.360> very<00:01:30.360> similar<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:30.990> not<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.200> same

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
effectively very similar if not the same

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:41.990 
effectively very similar if not the same
injector<00:01:39.650> so<00:01:40.650> hopefully<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.430> helps<00:01:41.909> a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
injector so hopefully that helps a

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.429 
injector so hopefully that helps a
little<00:01:42.090> bit<00:01:42.270> I'm<00:01:42.509> sure<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.869> they<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.229> some

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
little bit I'm sure that they have some

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.319 
little bit I'm sure that they have some
proprietary<00:01:43.710> machining<00:01:44.430> processes<00:01:44.909> for<00:01:45.240> the

products both work and let me see the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.130 
products both work and let me see the
two<00:01:49.409> tips<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.970> as<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.180> both<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.630> same<00:01:54.840> ball<00:01:55.020> and

seeder inside but this has a little
