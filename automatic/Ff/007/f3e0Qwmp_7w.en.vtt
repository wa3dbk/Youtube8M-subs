the<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.680> tool<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.829> came<00:01:58.979> with<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.219> oneplus

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
the the tool that came with the oneplus

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.719 
the the tool that came with the oneplus
has<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.820> longer<00:02:00.119> pin<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.680> length<00:02:02.579> is

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
has a longer pin and the length is

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.399 
has a longer pin and the length is
necessary<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.360> can't<00:02:03.570> pop<00:02:03.780> out<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.170> SIM<00:02:04.380> tray

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
necessary you can't pop out the SIM tray

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.469 
necessary you can't pop out the SIM tray
if<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.920> don't<00:02:05.100> have<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.060> right<00:02:06.240> length

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
if you don't have just the right length

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.520 
if you don't have just the right length
pin

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
pin

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.779

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
backwards on the oneplus and what will

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.630 
backwards on the oneplus and what will

happen is that the bottom of the tray

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.220 
happen is that the bottom of the tray
will<00:02:57.819> stick<00:02:58.030> out<00:02:58.209> I<00:02:58.390> did<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.900> first<00:02:58.930> time

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
will stick out I did that the first time

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.720 
will stick out I did that the first time
and<00:02:59.560> it<00:02:59.620> just<00:02:59.769> doesn't<00:02:59.890> recognize<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.489> card

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
and it just doesn't recognize the card

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.699 
and it just doesn't recognize the card
but<00:03:00.910> it<00:03:01.060> fortunately<00:03:01.989> didn't<00:03:02.349> damage<00:03:02.560> the

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
but it fortunately didn't damage the

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.610 
but it fortunately didn't damage the
phone<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:04.390> once<00:03:04.630> you<00:03:04.720> betcha<00:03:04.840> SIM<00:03:05.110> card<00:03:05.380> in<00:03:05.530> you

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620
