way that a lot of adults will go oh I
can't<00:03:07.450> wait<00:03:07.569> for<00:03:07.629> the<00:03:07.870> next<00:03:07.989> Alex<00:03:08.440> Cross

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
can't wait for the next Alex Cross

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.800

because<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.849> pages<00:03:10.269> practically<00:03:10.599> turned

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
because the pages practically turned

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.900 
because the pages practically turned
themselves<00:03:11.049> I<00:03:11.530> really<00:03:12.340> thought<00:03:12.549> it<00:03:12.670> would<00:03:12.790> be

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
themselves I really thought it would be

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.150 
themselves I really thought it would be
a<00:03:12.940> useful<00:03:13.180> thing<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.599> write<00:03:14.049> books<00:03:14.950> that

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
a useful thing to write books that

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.610 
a useful thing to write books that
adults<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.819> kids<00:03:16.239> would<00:03:17.140> have<00:03:17.260> that<00:03:17.410> same

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
adults and kids would have that same

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.780 
adults and kids would have that same
feeling<00:03:17.650> about<00:03:18.040> that<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.519> page<00:03:18.760> is

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
feeling about that the page is

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.490 
feeling about that the page is
practically<00:03:19.299> turned<00:03:19.510> themselves<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:20.079> also

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
practically turned themselves and also

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.330 
practically turned themselves and also
that<00:03:21.750> adults<00:03:22.750> and<00:03:23.079> kids<00:03:23.200> could<00:03:23.470> talk<00:03:23.739> to<00:03:24.010> each
