was it became a big fan and so I was
very<00:02:21.790> precious<00:02:22.390> about<00:02:22.650> not<00:02:23.650> losing<00:02:24.870> their

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
very precious about not losing their

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.559 
very precious about not losing their
feel<00:02:26.319> or<00:02:26.650> their<00:02:26.890> message<00:02:27.459> or<00:02:27.670> their<00:02:27.910> intensity

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
or the you know the tonality that I

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.559 
or the you know the tonality that I

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
created because I were a punk band you

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.140 
created because I were a punk band you
know<00:02:34.690> they<00:02:34.870> were<00:02:34.930> over<00:02:35.640> they<00:02:36.640> weren't<00:02:36.849> trying

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
know they were over they weren't trying

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.979 
know they were over they weren't trying
to<00:02:37.180> be<00:02:37.239> big<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:37.900> clever<00:02:38.700> necessarily<00:02:39.989> but

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
to be big and clever necessarily but

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.479 
to be big and clever necessarily but
they<00:02:41.200> put<00:02:41.470> they<00:02:41.769> you<00:02:41.920> know<00:02:41.950> they<00:02:42.069> struck<00:02:42.459> a

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
they put they you know they struck a

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.120 
they put they you know they struck a
chord<00:02:42.819> oh<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:43.209> was<00:02:43.569> a<00:02:43.660> bit<00:02:43.989> of<00:02:44.019> magic<00:02:44.500> chemistry

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
chord oh it was a bit of magic chemistry

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.390 
chord oh it was a bit of magic chemistry
going<00:02:45.310> on<00:02:45.430> with<00:02:45.579> that<00:02:45.670> band

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.449 

I<00:02:49.459> think<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.629> reason<00:02:50.810> why<00:02:51.140> I'm<00:02:51.319> probably<00:02:51.709> more

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
I think the reason why I'm probably more

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.309 
I think the reason why I'm probably more
understanding<00:02:53.209> of<00:02:53.299> this<00:02:53.450> music<00:02:53.900> is<00:02:54.019> because<00:02:54.230> I

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
understanding of this music is because I

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.229 
understanding of this music is because I
know<00:02:54.650> about<00:02:55.099> it<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:55.670> know<00:02:55.819> I<00:02:55.849> know<00:02:56.000> the

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
know about it you know I know the

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.270 
know about it you know I know the
history<00:02:56.420> behind<00:02:56.780> it<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.319> the<00:02:57.590> rhythms<00:02:58.040> and

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
history behind it and the rhythms and

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.319 
history behind it and the rhythms and
the<00:02:59.349> concepts<00:03:00.349> so<00:03:00.739> that<00:03:00.769> way<00:03:01.250> you<00:03:01.310> can<00:03:01.640> imbue

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
the concepts so that way you can imbue

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.390 
the concepts so that way you can imbue
that<00:03:02.569> knowledge<00:03:03.019> to<00:03:03.049> the<00:03:03.290> players<00:03:03.739> I<00:03:06.400> think

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
that knowledge to the players I think

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.880 
that knowledge to the players I think
sometimes<00:03:07.989> orchestras<00:03:08.989> do<00:03:09.200> gigs<00:03:09.470> where<00:03:09.680> they

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
sometimes orchestras do gigs where they

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.500 
sometimes orchestras do gigs where they
get<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.099> conductor<00:03:10.700> that<00:03:10.849> comes<00:03:11.090> up<00:03:11.329> and

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
get a conductor that comes up and

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.690 
get a conductor that comes up and
probably<00:03:12.200> doesn't<00:03:12.530> even<00:03:12.620> own<00:03:12.980> an<00:03:13.370> Eric

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
probably doesn't even own an Eric

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.569 
probably doesn't even own an Eric

Clapton CD let alone joy division and

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.720 
Clapton CD let alone joy division and
then<00:03:17.540> there's<00:03:17.870> no<00:03:18.049> link<00:03:18.829> you<00:03:19.189> know<00:03:19.340> there's<00:03:19.579> no

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
then there's no link you know there's no

then there's no link you know there's no
translation<00:03:20.480> and<00:03:20.629> then<00:03:20.810> it<00:03:20.959> sounds<00:03:21.409> like<00:03:21.470> this

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
translation and then it sounds like this
