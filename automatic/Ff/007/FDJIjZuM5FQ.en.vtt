00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.500
The firing order is the sequence of power
delivery of each cylinder in a multi-cylinder

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.120
reciprocating engine.
This is achieved by sparking of the spark

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.650
plugs in a gasoline engine in the correct
order, or by the sequence of fuel injection

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.530
in a Diesel engine. When designing an engine,
choosing an appropriate firing order is critical

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.690
to minimizing vibration, to improve engine
balance and achieving smooth running, for

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:31.010
long engine fatigue life and user comfort,
and heavily influences crankshaft design.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.390
Ignition
In a gasoline engine, the correct firing order

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.300
is obtained by the correct placement of the
spark plug wires on the distributor. In a

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.530
modern engine with an engine management system
and direct ignition, the Engine Control Unit

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.289
takes care of the correct firing sequence.
Especially on cars with distributors, the

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.640
firing order is usually cast on the engine
somewhere, most often on the cylinder head,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.260
the intake manifold or the valve cover(s).
Various firing orders for different engine

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.839
layouts
Although the vast majority of automobile engines

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.509
rotate clockwise as viewed from the front,
some engines are designed by the manufacturer

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:15.050
to rotate counter-clockwise to accommodate
certain mechanical configurations. In these

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.750
applications, the firing order is shown in
a reverse order. For the most common inline

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:31.890
configurations, this gives firing orders of
1-3-2, 1-2-4-3, and 1-4-2-6-3-5. In addition

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.640
to the reconfiguration of the plug wires or
injector tubes, the valve timing must be accordingly

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.520
modified.
Cylinder numbering and firing order

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.749
Notes on left/right and front/rear
When referring to cars, the left-hand side

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:50.890
of the car is the side that corresponds with
the driver's left, as seen from the driver's

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.369
seat. It can also be thought of as the side
that would be on the left if one was standing

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.350
directly behind the car looking at it.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.780
When referring to engines, the front of the
engine is the part where the pulleys for the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.799
accessories|alternator]] and water pump) are,
and the rear of the engine is where the flywheel

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.980
is, through which the engine connects to the
transmission. The front of the engine may

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.000
point towards the front, side or rear of the
car.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.740
In most rear-wheel drive cars, the engine
is longitudinally mounted and the front of

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.750
the engine also points to the front of the
car. In front-wheel drive cars with a transverse

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.981
engine, the front of the engine usually points
towards the right-hand side of the car. One

00:02:32.981 --> 00:02:37.920
notable exception is Honda, where many models
have the front of the engine at the left-hand

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.200
side of the car.
In front-wheel-drive cars with longitudinally

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.950
mounted engines, most often the front of the
engine will point towards the front of the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.610
car, but some manufacturers have at times
placed the engine 'backwards', with #1 towards

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:59.730
the firewall. One notable car with this layout
is the Citroën Traction Avant. This layout

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.160
is uncommon today.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.830
Cylinder numbering and firing orders for various
engine layouts

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.260
In a straight engine the spark plugs are numbered,
starting with #1, usually from the front of

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
the engine to the rear.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.870
In a radial engine the cylinders are numbered
around the circle, with the #1 cylinder at

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.950
the top. There are always an odd number of
cylinders in each bank, as this allows for

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.300
a constant alternate cylinder firing order:
for example, with a single bank of 7 cylinders,

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:37.680
the order would be 1-3-5-7-2-4-6. Moreover,
unless there is an odd number of cylinders,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.720
the ring cam around the nose of the engine
would be unable to provide the inlet valve

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.290
open - exhaust valve open sequence required
by the four-stroke cycle.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:53.270
In a V engine, cylinder numbering varies among
manufacturers. Generally speaking, the most

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.900
forward cylinder is numbered 1, but some manufacturers
will then continue numbering along that bank

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.450
first while others will number the cylinders
from front to back along the crankshaft, so

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:12.020
one bank would be 1-3-5-7 and the other bank
would be 2-4-6-8.. To further complicate matters,

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.900
manufacturers may not have used the same system
for all of their engines. It is important

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.730
to check the numbering system used before
comparing firing orders, because the order

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:28.210
will vary significantly with crankshaft design.
As an example, the Chevrolet Small-Block engine

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:36.240
has cylinders 1-3-5-7 on the left hand side
of the car, and 2-4-6-8 on the other side,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:44.860
and uses a firing order of 1-8-4-3-6-5-7-2.
Note that the order alternates irregularly

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.940
between the left and right banks; this is
what causes the 'burbling' sound of this type

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.070
of engine.
In most Audi and Ford V8 engines cylinders

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:01.970
1-2-3-4 are on the right hand side of the
car, with 5-6-7-8 are on the left.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:08.610
This means that Chevy Generation 1 Small Block
V8 engines and Ford 302 V8s have an identical

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.940
firing pattern despite having a different
firing order.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.930
Likewise, the firing pattern is the same for
Chevrolet &amp; Chrysler V8 engines with a firing

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:28.300
order of 1-8-4-3-6-5-7-2, and for Ford's V8
engines with a firing order of 1-5-4-2-6-3-7-8.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:35.300
An exception is the Ford Flathead V8 where
the number 1 cylinder is on the right front

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.170
of the engine but this cylinder is not the
front cylinder of the engine. In this case

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:46.889
number 5 is the front cylinder. A similar
situation exists with the Pontiac V8's 455

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:52.170
etc. where the cylinders are numbered like
a Chevrolet V8 but the right side bank is

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:57.110
in front(like a Ford), this puts cylinder
number 2 in front of number 1.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:03.210
Odd and even firing order
Firing order affects the balance, noise, vibration,

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.389
smoothness, and sound of the engine.
Engines that are even-firing will sound more

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:13.340
smooth and steady, while engines that are
odd, or uneven firing will have a burble or

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:19.540
a throaty, growling sound in the engine note,
and, depending on the crankshaft design, will

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:25.130
often have more vibrations due to the change
of power delivery. Most racing engines such

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:30.310
as those in Formula One often have an even
firing order, mostly for quicker acceleration,

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:36.990
less vibrations, and more efficient exhaust
system designs. Most engines that utilize

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.780
the Big-bang firing order system will often
have an uneven firing order.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:49.690
Examples of odd-firing engines are any crossplane
V8, Harley-Davidson Evolution engines, 2009–present

00:06:49.690 --> 00:07:00.160
Yamaha YZF-R1, All Ford V10 engines, Audi
V10 FSI, GM Vortec 3500 Inline 5, Viper V10,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:09.710
Mercedes-AMG V12s, Aston Martin 6.0L V12,
Yamaha V-Max and VMAX, Buick 231 Odd-Fire

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:15.940
V6, and Chevrolet straight-6 engines.
Examples of even-firing engines are most current

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:22.880
production inline 4s, most current production
V6s, all Ferrari production engines, Lotus

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:31.410
Esprit V8, Porsche 918 Spyder, McLaren M838T
engine, Toyota LR engine, and all Lamborghini

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.290
production engines.
Ships

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:39.450
Contrary to most car engines, a ship's engine
or a power plant engine is numbered from the

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:44.420
flywheel end towards the free end.
In ship and power plant V-type engines the

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:50.540
numbering is A1... and B1... where the A-bank
is on the left hand side and the B-bank is

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.560
on the right hand side, looking from the flywheel
end.
