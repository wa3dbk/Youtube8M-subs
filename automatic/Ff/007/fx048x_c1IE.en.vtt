actually<00:01:47.390> I'm<00:01:50.030> I'm<00:01:51.030> hesitant<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.689> getting<00:01:52.020> any

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
actually I'm I'm hesitant on getting any

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.370 
actually I'm I'm hesitant on getting any
good<00:01:52.409> decent<00:01:52.890> results<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:54.140> hoping<00:01:55.140> this

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
good decent results but hoping this

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.170 
good decent results but hoping this
proves<00:01:55.710> me<00:01:55.890> wrong<00:01:56.189> because<00:01:56.520> otherwise<00:01:57.000> all

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
proves me wrong because otherwise all

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.600 
proves me wrong because otherwise all
that<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.570> wasted<00:01:57.990> ninety<00:01:58.259> buck<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.920> at<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
that is wasted ninety buck so at the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.690 
that is wasted ninety buck so at the
moment<00:01:59.790> it's<00:02:00.140> supports<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.259> Nexus<00:02:01.619> 7<00:02:01.829> Galaxy

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700

hmm

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.500 

seems<00:04:57.920> to<00:04:58.040> be<00:04:58.100> a<00:04:58.190> little<00:04:58.400> unstable<00:04:58.820> sometimes

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
seems to be a little unstable sometimes

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.320 
seems to be a little unstable sometimes
it<00:05:00.140> works<00:05:00.620> but<00:05:01.280> it<00:05:01.430> seems<00:05:01.700> to<00:05:01.940> have<00:05:02.090> gotten

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
it works but it seems to have gotten

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.750 
it works but it seems to have gotten
only<00:05:02.770> half<00:05:03.770> the<00:05:04.010> channels<00:05:04.370> doesn't<00:05:04.640> have

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
only half the channels doesn't have

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.710 
only half the channels doesn't have
channel<00:05:05.180> seven<00:05:06.080> and<00:05:06.230> ten<00:05:06.500> Channel<00:05:06.830> nine<00:05:07.100> and<00:05:07.720> I

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
channel seven and ten Channel nine and I

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.080 
channel seven and ten Channel nine and I
need<00:05:09.020> Channel<00:05:09.440> nine<00:05:09.650> the<00:05:09.890> most<00:05:10.310> not<00:05:10.580> right<00:05:10.820> now

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
need Channel nine the most not right now

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:19.930 
need Channel nine the most not right now
but<00:05:11.420> later<00:05:11.570> when<00:05:13.660> NRL<00:05:14.660> season<00:05:14.900> starts<00:05:18.940> let's

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
but later when NRL season starts let's

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:26.320 
but later when NRL season starts let's
try<00:05:20.270> again<00:05:20.570> with<00:05:20.930> the<00:05:21.200> booster<00:05:22.190> antenna<00:05:25.270> hmm

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
try again with the booster antenna hmm

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.490 
try again with the booster antenna hmm
so<00:05:26.900> every<00:05:27.170> scan<00:05:27.530> if<00:05:27.740> the<00:05:28.010> booster<00:05:28.880> antenna

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
so every scan if the booster antenna

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.050 
so every scan if the booster antenna
seems<00:05:30.500> to<00:05:30.680> still<00:05:30.920> have<00:05:31.070> only<00:05:31.220> found<00:05:31.490> nineteen

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
seems to still have only found nineteen

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.710 
seems to still have only found nineteen
channels<00:05:32.540> but<00:05:32.690> I'll<00:05:32.840> see<00:05:33.080> if<00:05:34.420> things<00:05:35.420> a<00:05:35.510> little

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
channels but I'll see if things a little

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:52.420 
channels but I'll see if things a little
bit<00:05:35.840> more<00:05:36.050> stable<00:05:48.040> a<00:05:49.480> much<00:05:50.480> better<00:05:51.430> interest

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
bit more stable a much better interest

00:05:52.430 --> 00:06:09.029 
bit more stable a much better interest
be<00:05:52.580> going<00:05:54.580> what<00:05:55.580> else
