00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.020
 was overlooked that he was also a big one 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.540
 draftsman is his life long 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.180
 not only engaged in the drawing 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.010
 as preparation for these paintings and 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.079
 graphics but as independent 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.370
 work 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.410
 The exhibition starts with the boy 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.820
 Artist of in Paris at the academy 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.850
 studied there the drawing 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.850
 We learn first hand studies 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.640
 Hand and foot objects 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.570
 from everyday life but also images of 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.670
 artist even the mother the sooner 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.670
 Carefully white off the paper 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.670
 works out 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.960
 many drawings that the one to 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.010
 to prepare paintings so studied valuta 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.930
 portraits or the details of his 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.850
 body then goes a lot 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.979
 further and in female nude studies 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.470
 Basically it's about the attitude 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.470
 positions he pursues freely 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.390
 in the foreground are in the exhibition 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.400
 but the independent drawings the 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.530
 not to paint for example 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.720
 the wonderful series of brushes 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.150
 drawings the 19 7 on the island 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.709
 Jersey during a vacation 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.190
 she came to mind her own 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.690
 Japanese brush draftsman the maintenance 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.620
 refined in its own medium too 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.620
 knew how to convict 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.049
 with the ' 98s worked at the 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.849
 satirical portrayal of the parisian 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.980
 life is and woodcuts and 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.310
 Illustrations for magazines he 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.870
 prepared with drawings and for that 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.000
 he developed a new style of 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.420
 radical on the black and white contrasts 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.420
 puts 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.440
 When we wait for letters and diaries 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.299
 then read us up 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.930
 self-critical the artist with him 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.299
 moves 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.580
 nothing is good enough for him only one 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.370
 only times urgently other sounds through 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.500
 so in the winter of 1920 21 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.739
 in the southern French town garnison 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.060
 more the old town draws and paints and 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.170
 also the character of these drawings 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.720
 is a completely different one 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.909
 they are picturesquely beautiful leaves 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.829
 The technology also has something soft 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:34.599
 changed and worked in chalk 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.000
 and also in the still life around these 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:41.040
 Stand times bring the only sound 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.040
 by personally one could say 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.300
 even more so than in his painting 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.830
 we observe in the drawings how 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.760
 Bleeding on art history 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.760
 refers 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.410
 there is not only the realism wrestling there 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.180
 but are also the dutch and the 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.550
 German romance especially in the 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.500
 tree drawings emerge in the 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.740
 senses is really a new world too 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.740
 discover
