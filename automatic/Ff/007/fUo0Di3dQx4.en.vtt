00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.469
 The first thing you should take in 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.870
 to create a quality sound in the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.480
 your car is to make it touch to 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.039
 inside to achieve this effect the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.170
 first step is to make a treatment 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.869
 acoustic we use a kind of 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.090
 special blanket she takes out the vibration 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.400
 the can as often as the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.949
 people want to undo and then some 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.110
 foams that remove the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.059
 plastic releases you get 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.500
 in this environment you have no cancellation 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.719
 of waves inside the car 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.610
 The second step is to choose a sound with a 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.100
 good audio processor this 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.469
 processor does all function of the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.809
 adjustment lemende time time 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.090
 The third step is to choose 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.210
 a set of correct speakers 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.780
 three routes being the most indicated with 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.449
 twitter mid range midi ps and crossover 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.320
 as the speaker are far from one 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.390
 other 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.700
 You need to have three teachers and 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.920
 stopped so you can adjust the 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.590
 sound velocity of each of them 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.450
 it protects and gives the best sound with the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.820
 equipment can take the tape has the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.540
 function of reproducing the frequencies 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.640
 acute 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.530
 It's important that twitter and 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.710
 foot to the frequency of the two cases 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.560
 in exactly in comes at the same time 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.450
 listening to a thousandth of an angel 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.280
 it will work on the part of a medium 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.460
 severe acute would mean that part of the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.619
 a serious comedy can beat and a 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.780
 part of a female voice km of angel 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.119
 you should only install on the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.860
 front of the car the sixth 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.399
 required for your sound will be 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.869
 aligned is the sub uff care it needs 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.299
 be installed in a speaker 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.540
 well dimensioned with a 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.540
 protection 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.789
 are their own speakers to reproduce 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.469
 low frequencies 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.960
 only working on the 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.599
 frequencies it serious pro who tava the 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.790
 much as you can from front to back the 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:15.500
 dream has to play strong precise fast 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.019
 a catch with the system 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.330
 the last piece to generate the power of 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.970
 system is the amplifier 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.819
 it should be in a well-ventilated and well- 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.950
 fixed and if it does not come very 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.810
 amplifies and generates power thereby 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.340
 you have a huge range of 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.760
 amplifiers that when speaking 100 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.790
 watts 200 thousand watts nÃ© this is depending 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.980
 the amplifier's ability good 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.890
 level of installations already gets a 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.360
 of very good quality without spending as much 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.940
 you see that sound at the end of the day 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.239
 You can do something very simple. 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.239
 a lot of quality
