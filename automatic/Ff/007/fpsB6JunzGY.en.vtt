 you are actually provided 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:26.220
 cold and much further to determine 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:29.490
 quite funny where you are such a fool 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.070

 Of course that will work 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.450
 have calculated that precisely and the 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.350
 whole process has several test drives 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.670
 run through 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.900
 how did you test that with lego man 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.900
