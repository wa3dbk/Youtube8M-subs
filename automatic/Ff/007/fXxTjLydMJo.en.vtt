00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.050
 of the work that I did of all the

 compilation that 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.950

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.120
 effective 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.560
 the method that works perfectly 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.560
 that works 100% 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.060
 and everything that we believe in this box 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.060
 the whole process that we are going to do 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.960
 and good if this method does not work 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.220
 can pass the following three others 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.820
 methods that I have 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.350
 method 1 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.300
 methods 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.940
 method 3 this last method is a room 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.380
 good, some say that it has 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.300
 worked perfectly 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.300
 only installing this route 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.360
 and good if it does not work is good if 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.100
 the first one that would be this one does not work 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.090
 try with any of these 3 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.090
 some will serve you 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.260

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:35.080
 another model of sanlÃºcar axis 7 and 9 thousand 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:38.200
 305 that the American version of lte 4g 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.840
 Well, I have bad news. Well, I have 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.350
 good and bad news at the same time the good 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.250
 is that the boss can repair this model 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.360
 and not in 305 but the bad one is that I was 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.270
 operated 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.730
 the best country 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.530
 and as everyone already knows, the file has stopped 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.410
 work has been written off 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.510
 and I had the files but we got into 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.720

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.269
 can find it on the web and can 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.120
 save your cells too so that you do not 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.099
