the fact that the micro SD slot is
nicely<00:01:42.750> covered<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.530> think<00:01:44.490> having<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.820> same

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
nicely covered I think having the same

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.160 
nicely covered I think having the same
cover<00:01:46.140> for<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.829> mini<00:01:47.790> USB<00:01:47.939> connector<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.750> it

cover for the mini USB connector that it

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.780 
cover for the mini USB connector that it
was<00:01:49.290> used<00:01:49.439> for<00:01:49.619> charging<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.189> bit<00:01:50.340> overkill

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
was used for charging is a bit overkill

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.280 
was used for charging is a bit overkill
this<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.329> something<00:01:51.630> you're<00:01:51.750> going<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.229> have

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
this is something you're going to have

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.810 
this is something you're going to have
to<00:01:52.439> use<00:01:52.560> fairly<00:01:52.799> often<00:01:53.070> i<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.490> think<00:01:53.640> having

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
to cover an uncovered consoling is a bit

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.520 
to cover an uncovered consoling is a bit
of<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.100> pain<00:01:56.420> also<00:01:57.420> not<00:01:57.570> real<00:01:57.869> thrilled<00:01:58.170> with
