00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.120 
there we go and there we have a dragon
if<00:02:01.860> only<00:02:02.310> dragons<00:02:02.490> were<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.060> easy<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.540> make

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
if only dragons were this easy to make

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.020 
if only dragons were this easy to make
that<00:02:05.130> probably<00:02:05.310> wouldn't<00:02:05.549> be<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> good<00:02:05.759> thing

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
that probably wouldn't be a good thing

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.219 
that probably wouldn't be a good thing
because<00:02:06.210> people<00:02:06.570> would<00:02:06.689> be<00:02:06.780> making<00:02:07.079> all<00:02:07.140> these

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
because people would be making all these

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.809 
because people would be making all these
dragons<00:02:07.680> they<00:02:07.799> take<00:02:08.009> over<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> earth<00:02:08.340> like

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
dragons they take over the earth like

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.160 
dragons they take over the earth like
rain<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.179> fire<00:02:10.310> and<00:02:11.310> you'd<00:02:11.520> have<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:12.120> have<00:02:12.170> some

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
rain of fire and you'd have to have some

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.940 
rain of fire and you'd have to have some
of<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.500> likes

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
of the likes

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.050

that seem to want to keep on pegging off
they<00:02:54.120> said<00:02:54.390> that<00:02:54.510> they're<00:02:54.660> flexible<00:02:55.220> you

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
they said that they're flexible you

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.979 
they said that they're flexible you
can't<00:02:56.459> bend<00:02:57.209> them<00:02:57.390> or<00:02:57.510> anything<00:02:57.690> they're<00:02:57.959> just

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
can't bend them or anything they're just

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.250 
can't bend them or anything they're just
basically<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.620> softer<00:02:59.190> plastic<00:03:00.079> or<00:03:01.079> like<00:03:01.230> a

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
basically a softer plastic or like a

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.650 
basically a softer plastic or like a
rubbery<00:03:01.920> kind<00:03:02.489> of<00:03:02.610> plastic<00:03:03.000> than<00:03:03.420> anything

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
rubbery kind of plastic than anything

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.270 
rubbery kind of plastic than anything
else<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.910> tail<00:03:06.140> slightly<00:03:07.140> rotates<00:03:07.769> but<00:03:08.190> it

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
else the tail slightly rotates but it

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.699 
else the tail slightly rotates but it
only<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.640> because<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.030> just<00:03:09.329> peg<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.720> in<00:03:09.900> but

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
only is because I just peg that in but

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.470 
only is because I just peg that in but
the<00:03:11.099> real<00:03:11.340> draw<00:03:11.670> is<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.090> fact<00:03:12.269> that<00:03:12.329> these

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
the real draw is the fact that these

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.620 
the real draw is the fact that these
legs<00:03:13.190> can<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.280> see<00:03:14.519> actually<00:03:15.060> move<00:03:15.239> in<00:03:15.450> and

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
legs can you see actually move in and

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.199 
legs can you see actually move in and
out<00:03:15.829> you<00:03:16.829> can<00:03:16.980> also<00:03:17.099> rotate<00:03:17.549> them<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.139> like<00:03:19.139> so

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
out you can also rotate them to like so

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.370 
out you can also rotate them to like so
we'll<00:03:21.209> take<00:03:21.359> them<00:03:21.450> all<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.630> way<00:03:21.720> around<00:03:21.870> maybe

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
we'll take them all the way around maybe

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.680 
we'll take them all the way around maybe
not<00:03:22.590> all<00:03:22.739> now<00:03:23.040> let's<00:03:23.459> see<00:03:23.609> there<00:03:23.910> we<00:03:24.480> go<00:03:24.660> all

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
not all now let's see there we go all

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.910 
not all now let's see there we go all
the<00:03:24.989> way<00:03:25.019> around<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:26.959> of<00:03:27.959> course<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.319> in<00:03:28.500> and

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
the way around and of course it in and

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.870 
the way around and of course it in and
out<00:03:29.040> as<00:03:29.400> well<00:03:30.829> not<00:03:31.829> really<00:03:32.069> all<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:32.310> bad<00:03:32.459> the

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
out as well not really all that bad the

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.379 
out as well not really all that bad the
paint<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.299> pretty<00:03:33.600> good<00:03:34.489> it's<00:03:35.489> not<00:03:35.700> incredibly

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
paint is pretty good it's not incredibly

color than the rest of the Dragon which
is<00:03:48.209> a<00:03:48.540> bit<00:03:48.780> of<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.959> disappointment<00:03:49.769> I<00:03:51.200> would

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
is a bit of a disappointment I would

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.300 
is a bit of a disappointment I would
have<00:03:52.290> preferred<00:03:52.350> if<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:52.769> was<00:03:52.859> the<00:03:52.950> same<00:03:53.069> color

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.000 
have preferred if it was the same color
but<00:03:53.810> again<00:03:54.810> I'm<00:03:54.959> really<00:03:55.410> not<00:03:55.620> going<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.829> lose<00:03:55.950> a

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
but again I'm really not going to lose a

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.460
