what back here that was direct drive
that<00:02:22.670> was<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.880> rectus<00:02:23.240> is<00:02:23.390> back<00:02:23.540> here

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.080 

and<00:02:39.930> that's<00:02:40.620> about<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:41.490> you<00:02:41.580> so<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.940> both

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
and that's about it so you so that both

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.320 
and that's about it so you so that both
axes<00:02:42.660> power<00:02:43.500> feed<00:02:43.740> moving<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.460> saw<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.790> head

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
axes power feed moving you saw the head

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.970 
axes power feed moving you saw the head
go<00:02:45.630> on<00:02:45.930> in<00:02:46.440> both<00:02:47.100> back<00:02:47.460> here<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:47.910> direct<00:02:48.240> drive

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
go on in both back here and direct drive

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.500 
go on in both back here and direct drive
I'll<00:02:49.980> walk<00:02:50.280> around<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.700> Machine<00:02:51.000> once<00:02:51.240> for

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
I'll walk around the Machine once for

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.820 
I'll walk around the Machine once for
you<00:02:53.450> this<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.600> original<00:02:55.050> paint<00:02:55.080> machine<00:02:55.680> by

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
you this is original paint machine by

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.690 
you this is original paint machine by
the<00:02:55.890> way<00:02:57.830> you<00:02:58.830> can<00:02:58.920> see<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.160> one<00:02:59.370> shot

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
the way you can see the one shot

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.820 
the way you can see the one shot
lubrication<00:03:00.270> system<00:03:00.930> right<00:03:01.110> down<00:03:01.320> there<00:03:03.830> so

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
lubrication system right down there so

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:12.460 
lubrication system right down there so
work<00:03:05.040> light<00:03:07.760> down<00:03:08.760> below<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:10.020> have<00:03:10.290> your

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
work light down below you have your

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.040 
work light down below you have your
module<00:03:14.420> which<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.630> basically<00:03:16.050> a<00:03:16.170> PC<00:03:16.530> computer

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
module which is basically a PC computer

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.830 
module which is basically a PC computer
and<00:03:19.050> that's<00:03:19.770> your<00:03:20.010> CRT<00:03:20.820> over<00:03:21.180> here<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:21.630> can

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
and that's your CRT over here you can

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.430 
and that's your CRT over here you can
see<00:03:22.050> that<00:03:22.490> that<00:03:23.490> was<00:03:23.820> reconditioned<00:03:24.570> at<00:03:24.810> 1.8

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
see that that was reconditioned at 1.8

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.700 
see that that was reconditioned at 1.8
2106<00:03:26.400> back<00:03:26.730> at<00:03:26.970> proto<00:03:27.240> track
