00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
cards for these readings because they

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.420 
cards for these readings because they
cover<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:16.350> whole<00:00:16.560> month<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.130> they're<00:00:17.220> about

cover the whole month and they're about

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.480 
cover the whole month and they're about
the<00:00:17.640> underlying<00:00:18.390> energy<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.529> month<00:00:19.770> and

the underlying energy of the month and

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.300 
the underlying energy of the month and
the<00:00:21.150> car<00:00:21.480> that's<00:00:21.720> come<00:00:21.930> out<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.650> balance

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
the car that's come out is the balance

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.300 
the car that's come out is the balance
card<00:00:24.320> which<00:00:26.240> incorporates<00:00:27.240> diamonds<00:00:28.310> secures

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
card which incorporates diamonds secures

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.740 
card which incorporates diamonds secures
on<00:00:29.699> there<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.269> there's<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:31.019> figure<00:00:31.830> balancing

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
on there so there's a a figure balancing

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.049 
on there so there's a a figure balancing
was<00:00:33.750> also<00:00:35.510> an<00:00:36.510> animal<00:00:36.960> balancing<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:38.030> shell<00:00:39.030> or

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
was also an animal balancing a shell or

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.119 
was also an animal balancing a shell or
some<00:00:39.899> kind<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:41.899> mineral<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.050> top<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.530> its<00:00:43.739> nose

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
some kind of mineral on top of its nose

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.750 
some kind of mineral on top of its nose
that<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:46.140> obvious<00:00:46.260> thing<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.770> balancing

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
that so the obvious thing is balancing

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.750 
that so the obvious thing is balancing
more<00:00:48.059> than<00:00:48.239> one<00:00:48.450> thing<00:00:48.660> at<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.870> time<00:00:49.579> and<00:00:50.579> in

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
more than one thing at a time and in

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.400 
more than one thing at a time and in
this<00:00:50.879> case<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.360> probably<00:00:51.719> two<00:00:52.020> things<00:00:52.320> that

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
this case is probably two things that

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.950 
this case is probably two things that
are<00:00:52.500> tangles<00:00:52.980> who<00:00:53.090> represents<00:00:54.090> Libra<00:00:54.780> which

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
are tangles who represents Libra which

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.840 
are tangles who represents Libra which
is<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.289> scales<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> zodiac<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.850> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
is the scales in the zodiac and the the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.579 
is the scales in the zodiac and the the
card<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.620> speaking<00:01:01.620> about<00:01:03.170> taking<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.320> time

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
card is speaking about taking you time

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.399 
card is speaking about taking you time
and<00:01:05.030> planning<00:01:06.030> things<00:01:06.450> through<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.200> that

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
and planning things through so that

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.940 
and planning things through so that
nothing<00:01:07.979> dominates<00:01:09.260> so<00:01:10.260> you've<00:01:10.439> got<00:01:10.470> more

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
nothing dominates so you've got more

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.969 
nothing dominates so you've got more
than<00:01:11.250> one<00:01:11.490> element<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.299> your<00:01:12.780> life<00:01:13.110> or<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.860> your
