00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.070
 so in april is about 8 9 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.779
 It's just got a bit colder 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.490
 but we still have it anyway 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.529
 a spring and are no longer in the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.200
 snow and storm i got into one 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.240
 Book selected on south as the relative 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.119
 It warms up in the spring, I hope 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.590
 that series worms are there with the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.590
 fly or with the spider route 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.640
 Temptation experiences become invalid 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.940
 discarded 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.489
 but well it is clocked on it 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.740
 both and I will take what 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.450
 works and I hope that too 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.850
 function bait tight but bayer 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.900
 I'm in good spirits and I'll go now 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.370
 into the water and hope that you yes 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.079
 silver bars are on the way and mine 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.079
 find children as great as me 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.590
 unfortunately here is my place the wind 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.200
 full-sacrificing brand fortunately I still have 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.849
 had my best and there I am 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.640
 have heard that already isolated 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.040
 I have been spotted year 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.940
 thought I take it out of my rubber 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.480
 series bonification with that is in 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.450
 principle quite simply there are so many 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.340
 gummi krÃ¼ger for example helmut eckl 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.930
 the 1 series are probably similar as well 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.569
 this colleague here i am also honest 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.519
 I do not remember what that means 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:15.360
 has such a small a small behind 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.549
 shovel off clearly correct quite good 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.530
 under water the color fits and you 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.080
 Maybe it already likes it 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.760
 They caught two fish relatively quickly 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.769
 in a row were good together 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.180
 both good 50 cm long and yes 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.349
 So this thing really has 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.209
 I worked that time 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.370
 single so a bit gasthof once 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.750
 then tried again and put away 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.760
 now deal with packing thought 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.200
 Do you take the one with you the whole 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.510
 to modify a bit 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.970
 here mini is smaller in front of fold in it 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.230
 drilling and yes as I said that 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.820
 but it does not look that way yet 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.100
 great you have to look again like 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.480
 It gets better but that afterwards 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.000
 In any case , I will try again 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.690
 have a few other series like 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.730
 migration and this with the color 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.200
 a bit darker in the green 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.180
 let's see sometimes bring 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.100
 the on what in any case that was already 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.090
 very convincing for me and me 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.410
 think 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.239
 are subsequently determined again that 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.709
 bite it because the sun warms you 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.840
 the water and it is actually with 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.450
 every hour warmer and they like that 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.160
 series company come out there waiting 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.160
 the trout and me 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:45.039
 so evening did not bring fish anymore 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:46.300
 the weather is so good from the wind down 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.550
 It was a light case 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.349
 wave only on the water one 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.120
 I saw fish too 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:53.189
 but unfortunately he did not want to take 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.509
 not as I wanted 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:57.909
 Now that can not change me 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:59.740
 I'm on my way home now and yes 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:01.509
 I think the next clips here in the 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.819
 then run out 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:06.189
 warmer fines be florida mexico 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:08.080
 the keywords I think in the 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:10.689
 next two weeks nice material 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.569
 can collect and yes then as I said 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:16.659
 Just look at it 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:20.069
 may be amazed and have fun here 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:20.069
 thanks on my channel
