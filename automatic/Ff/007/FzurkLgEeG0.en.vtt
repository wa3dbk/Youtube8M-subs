00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
have trouble getting a cell phone signal

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.810 
have trouble getting a cell phone signal
sometimes<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.159> you're<00:02:02.340> going<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:02.670> an

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
sometimes that you're going to have an

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.910 
sometimes that you're going to have an
internet<00:02:03.240> signal<00:02:03.450> yeah<00:02:03.990> we<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.530> took<00:02:04.799> it's

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
internet signal yeah we it took it's

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.050 
internet signal yeah we it took it's
about<00:02:05.070> 18<00:02:05.369> months<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.700> develop<00:02:05.850> the

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
about 18 months to develop the

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.760 
about 18 months to develop the
technology<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.719> maintains<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.380> connection

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
technology that maintains a connection

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.199 
technology that maintains a connection
basically<00:02:08.369> we<00:02:08.459> eliminate<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:08.910> drop

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
basically we eliminate the drop

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.520 
basically we eliminate the drop
connections<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.989> would<00:02:10.110> on<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.259> cell

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
connections like you would on a cell

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.360 
connections like you would on a cell
phone<00:02:10.770> how

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
phone how

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.550 
phone how
it's<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:12.030> true<00:02:12.510> technology<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.200> we<00:02:13.260> invented

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
it's a true technology that we invented

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.170 
it's a true technology that we invented
and<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:13.950> eliminates<00:02:14.580> anything<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.060> has<00:02:15.150> to

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
and it eliminates anything that has to

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.240 
and it eliminates anything that has to
do<00:02:15.390> with<00:02:15.510> internet<00:02:15.780> failures<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:17.099> as<00:02:17.159> the

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
do with internet failures and so as the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.890 
do with internet failures and so as the
car<00:02:17.430> moves<00:02:17.459> between<00:02:17.790> towers<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.599> networks

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
car moves between towers and networks

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.470 
car moves between towers and networks
which<00:02:19.170> they<00:02:19.379> constantly<00:02:19.890> do<00:02:20.159> we<00:02:21.120> maintain<00:02:21.299> a

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
which they constantly do we maintain a

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.030 
which they constantly do we maintain a
constant<00:02:21.720> connection<00:02:22.200> makes<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.799> really<00:02:22.920> easy

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
constant connection makes it really easy

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.470 
constant connection makes it really easy
for<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.489> family<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.790> use<00:02:24.030> they<00:02:24.209> don't<00:02:24.239> have<00:02:24.420> to

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
for the family to use they don't have to

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.539 
for the family to use they don't have to
