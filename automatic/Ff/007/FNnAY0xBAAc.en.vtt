Whenever we feel like eating something tempting and delectable then we make stuffed sabzis.

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:22.453
Stuffed sabzis are bit time consuming but taste delicious.

00:00:23.797 --> 00:00:30.679
We have already prepared stuffed brinjals on flame but today we will make them in microwave.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:38.459

You can also use ginger paste instead of ginger powder or grated ginger.

00:02:33.844 --> 00:02:37.133
Now we will stuff these spices in the brinjals.

00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:43.328
Remove the stalk of brinjals.

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:57.561
Make two slits keeping it joint from bottom.

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:08.593
Cut the brinjal like this dividing it into four parts.

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:22.164
Fill the masala with help of a spoon like this.

00:03:23.656 --> 00:03:32.460
Take ½ tsp masala, stuff it and press it gently.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.133
Take some oil in a microwave safe bowl.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.109

Pour some oil as well over the brinjals.

00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:28.469
Cover the bowl and place it in microwave.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.625
Now microwave for 4 minutes on maximum temperature

00:04:40.578 --> 00:04:49.523
After four minutes take out the bowl and flip the brinjals.

00:05:01.842 --> 00:05:05.296
Cover and place back in microwave.

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:08.453
