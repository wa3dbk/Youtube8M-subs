00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.280
 hello good I'm fourteen gamero and today I 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.700
 I bring a new video on how to create 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.440
 our own pokemon just 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:20.330
 discover a page that I will later put 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.800
 the link on how to mix pokemon already 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.840
 from there it will come out 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.470
 monstrosities will come out the best because 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.029
 we have perfect and we will find out by 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.240
 example with pikachu that we can 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.890
 turn pikachu into throwing me 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.600
 the happy face of the case says it 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.269
 everything also connect you 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.420
 well more of the same and five those who 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:50.059
 you want for example with a we sing pica 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.059
 no explanation involved without 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.690
 the creator etc let's see now with the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.300
 Author who writes book in the morning 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.949
 pica coat that is the face of picacho in 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.079
 half and others angry because it is the 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.449
 protagonist but let's go the other way 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.600
 let's try that cult first and 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.840
 then with a pikachu let's see what 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.000
 what we see 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.000
 if the homosexual picacho 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.329
 could stick the back to the new 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.130
 people because five of you want 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.130
 for example concrete so exact 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.380
 with 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.159
 with milk that face the face of more 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.320
 and let's try now with a buddy 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.829
 something has also been taken badly 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.560
 state and random appears more the cruel 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.890
 and more the cruel cruel one is the one who has created 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.470
 the page all the dead as they can 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.020
