I<00:02:43.440> think<00:02:44.640> it's<00:02:45.640> about<00:02:45.730> 10<00:02:46.030> by<00:02:46.180> 10<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.990> middle

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
I think it's about 10 by 10 the middle

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.850 
I think it's about 10 by 10 the middle
is<00:02:47.260> about<00:02:47.470> eight<00:02:47.740> and<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.850> top<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.120> four<00:02:49.860> by

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
is about eight and the top is four by

is about eight and the top is four by
four<00:02:51.160> inches<00:02:51.520> and<00:02:52.770> in<00:02:53.910> making<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:55.150> cake<00:02:55.420> like

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
four inches and in making a cake like

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.500 
four inches and in making a cake like
this<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:56.650> be<00:02:56.770> honest<00:02:57.010> it's<00:02:57.190> not<00:02:57.430> really<00:02:58.180> really

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
this to be honest it's not really really

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.240 
this to be honest it's not really really
that<00:02:58.690> hard<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.590> hardest<00:02:59.860> part<00:02:59.980> would<00:03:00.190> be

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
that hard the hardest part would be

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.720 
that hard the hardest part would be
making<00:03:00.670> them<00:03:01.110> or<00:03:02.110> making<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.500> figures<00:03:02.860> but

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
making them or making the figures but

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.440 
making them or making the figures but
the<00:03:03.880> cake<00:03:04.090> itself<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.870> design<00:03:05.230> itself<00:03:06.270> as<00:03:07.270> you

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
can see it's not really that difficult
