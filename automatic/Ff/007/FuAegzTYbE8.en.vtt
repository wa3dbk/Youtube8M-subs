triangle and you that's where you'll put

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.690 
triangle and you that's where you'll put
water<00:01:11.240> on<00:01:11.420> top<00:01:11.600> of<00:01:11.980> so<00:01:12.980> that<00:01:13.130> runs<00:01:13.370> down<00:01:13.550> into

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
water on top of so that runs down into

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.650 
water on top of so that runs down into

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
basically one away from the edge dig in

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.270 
basically one away from the edge dig in
a<00:01:21.710> direct<00:01:22.420> diagonal<00:01:23.420> line

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
a direct diagonal line

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.860 
a direct diagonal line
so<00:01:25.280> you<00:01:25.370> got<00:01:25.490> that<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:25.910> then<00:01:25.940> you<00:01:26.450> clear<00:01:26.720> out

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
all the rest once you've done that dig

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.270 
all the rest once you've done that dig
three<00:01:29.390> into<00:01:29.780> this<00:01:29.900> hole<00:01:30.140> here

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
three into this hole here

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.490 
three into this hole here
and<00:01:31.400> then<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:32.360> put<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.659> sign<00:01:32.900> there<00:01:32.930> you

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
and then you put the sign there you

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.960 
and then you put the sign there you
don't<00:01:33.650> need<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:33.799> point<00:01:33.979> if<00:01:34.070> you<00:01:34.130> gonna<00:01:34.280> oil<00:01:34.520> if

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970

you want to put anything on it and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.490 
you want to put anything on it and

that's when you dig four down and what
you<00:01:39.530> did<00:01:39.799> fall<00:01:40.009> down<00:01:40.220> you'll<00:01:40.970> need<00:01:41.150> to<00:01:41.240> dig

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
you did fall down you'll need to dig

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.149 
you did fall down you'll need to dig
across<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.080> then<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:42.229> need<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.650> make<00:01:42.830> another

across and then you need to make another

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:43.749 
across and then you need to make another
entrance

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
entrance

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.030 
basically put put here just dig that up
so<00:01:54.970> once<00:01:55.210> you've<00:01:55.360> done<00:01:55.450> that<00:01:55.740> what<00:01:56.740> you<00:01:56.860> need

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
so once you've done that what you need

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.010 
so once you've done that what you need
to<00:01:57.159> do<00:01:57.310> is<00:01:57.780> very<00:01:58.780> simple

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
to do is very simple

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.740 
to do is very simple
actually<00:02:00.890> this<00:02:01.009> whole<00:02:01.700> procedure<00:02:02.119> might<00:02:02.450> take

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
actually this whole procedure might take

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.959 
actually this whole procedure might take
you<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.020> bow<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:03.740> Alex<00:02:04.159> took<00:02:04.460> me<00:02:04.609> nearly<00:02:04.759> an

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
you a bow and Alex took me nearly an

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:06.789 
you a bow and Alex took me nearly an
hour<00:02:05.060> to<00:02:05.179> do<00:02:05.359> all<00:02:05.509> this<00:02:05.659> but<00:02:06.439> once<00:02:06.619> you've<00:02:06.770> done

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
hour to do all this but once you've done

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.210 
hour to do all this but once you've done
that<00:02:06.979> you<00:02:07.850> put<00:02:08.060> water<00:02:08.450> there<00:02:08.810> and<00:02:08.989> water<00:02:09.890> there

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
that you put water there and water there

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.670 
that you put water there and water there
so<00:02:10.819> as<00:02:11.090> you<00:02:11.209> can<00:02:11.330> see<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:12.170> water<00:02:12.319> gets<00:02:12.530> all

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
so as you can see the water gets all

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.530 
so as you can see the water gets all
pointing<00:02:12.980> down<00:02:13.099> into<00:02:13.310> here<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:14.060> gets<00:02:14.269> them

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
pointing down into here and it gets them

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.320 
pointing down into here and it gets them
scream<00:02:14.959> straight<00:02:15.500> down<00:02:15.709> into<00:02:16.010> this<00:02:16.310> down<00:02:17.000> here

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
scream straight down into this down here

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.350 
scream straight down into this down here
so<00:02:18.140> they<00:02:18.290> get<00:02:18.440> pushed<00:02:18.709> down<00:02:18.799> to<00:02:18.920> here<00:02:19.250> now<00:02:20.150> what

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
so they get pushed down to here now what

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.809 
so they get pushed down to here now what
you<00:02:20.480> need<00:02:20.629> is<00:02:21.110> I<00:02:21.470> just<00:02:21.920> put<00:02:22.129> my<00:02:22.280> other<00:02:22.340> buckets

of water down here

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:35.250 
of water down here
now<00:02:25.540> excuse<00:02:26.140> me<00:02:26.170> one<00:02:26.440> second

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.649 

sign<00:02:35.620> books<00:02:36.159> what<00:02:36.459> you<00:02:36.549> need<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:36.909> once<00:02:37.540> you

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659 
sign books what you need is once you

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:38.789 
sign books what you need is once you
come<00:02:37.840> down<00:02:37.989> here<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.349> have<00:02:38.379> to<00:02:38.530> dig<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:38.709> hole

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
come down here you have to dig a hole

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.369 
come down here you have to dig a hole
into<00:02:39.459> either<00:02:39.610> side<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.299> you<00:02:41.019> just<00:02:41.170> put

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
into either side and you just put

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.589 
into either side and you just put
another<00:02:41.739> water<00:02:42.010> into<00:02:42.610> there<00:02:42.819> the<00:02:43.209> reason<00:02:43.390> you

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
another water into there the reason you

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.470 
another water into there the reason you
do<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:43.750> is<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:44.739> they<00:02:45.250> basically<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:46.269> mobs

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
do that is so they basically the mobs

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.600 
do that is so they basically the mobs
get<00:02:46.659> pushed<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.680> then<00:02:48.069> once<00:02:48.310> you've<00:02:48.489> done

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
get pushed and then once you've done

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.229 
get pushed and then once you've done
that<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:49.209> put<00:02:49.450> a<00:02:49.689> glass<00:02:49.959> down<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:51.640> basically

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
that you put a glass down so basically

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.970 
that you put a glass down so basically
what<00:02:52.629> happens<00:02:52.989> is<00:02:53.079> actually<00:02:53.470> no<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.650> don't

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980

is where you I said bring more glass

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.490 
is where you I said bring more glass
just<00:03:06.579> in<00:03:06.730> case<00:03:06.879> you<00:03:06.970> make<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.150> mistake<00:03:07.329> I<00:03:07.810> made<00:03:08.470> a

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
mistake here and what you need to do is

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.539 
mistake here and what you need to do is
just<00:03:10.180> get<00:03:10.299> rid<00:03:10.420> of<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:10.659> and<00:03:10.930> with<00:03:11.799> more<00:03:12.310> water

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
just get rid of that and with more water

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.470 
just get rid of that and with more water
than<00:03:12.879> you<00:03:13.060> put<00:03:13.329> that<00:03:13.540> there<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.799> there<00:03:15.519> the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
than you put that there and there the

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.680 
than you put that there and there the
reason<00:03:16.629> you<00:03:16.840> do<00:03:16.989> that<00:03:17.019> is<00:03:17.200> so<00:03:17.379> once<00:03:17.889> the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
reason you do that is so once the

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.699 
reason you do that is so once the
skeletons<00:03:19.690> or<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.900> zombies<00:03:20.260> or<00:03:20.379> whatever

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
skeletons or the zombies or whatever

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.069 
skeletons or the zombies or whatever
hits<00:03:21.010> they're<00:03:21.310> basically<00:03:22.209> they<00:03:22.599> will<00:03:22.780> drown

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
hits they're basically they will drown

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.830 
hits they're basically they will drown
now<00:03:23.579> this<00:03:24.579> is<00:03:24.730> where<00:03:24.940> end<00:03:25.150> of<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.329> sign<00:03:25.540> comes

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
now this is where end of the sign comes

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.160 
now this is where end of the sign comes
into<00:03:26.170> fact<00:03:26.409> the<00:03:26.920> two<00:03:27.129> signs<00:03:27.400> that<00:03:27.609> you'll<00:03:27.730> need

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
into fact the two signs that you'll need

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.960 
into fact the two signs that you'll need
is<00:03:29.170> where<00:03:29.470> basically<00:03:30.069> you'll<00:03:30.310> just<00:03:30.489> stop<00:03:30.790> the

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
is where basically you'll just stop the

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.460 
is where basically you'll just stop the
water<00:03:31.150> flow<00:03:31.329> where<00:03:31.629> you<00:03:31.659> want<00:03:31.930> it<00:03:32.049> to<00:03:32.139> stop<00:03:32.349> so

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
water flow where you want it to stop so

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.780 
water flow where you want it to stop so
I<00:03:32.560> want<00:03:32.680> it<00:03:32.739> to<00:03:32.829> stop<00:03:33.099> there<00:03:33.280> so<00:03:33.400> we<00:03:33.489> replace

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
I want it to stop there so we replace

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.770 
I want it to stop there so we replace
the<00:03:33.940> sign<00:03:34.150> down<00:03:34.359> there

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
the sign down there

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.199 
the sign down there
don't<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:36.980> then<00:03:37.190> another<00:03:37.460> one<00:03:37.730> there<00:03:38.450> done

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
don't and then another one there done

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.630 
don't and then another one there done
so<00:03:40.810> basically<00:03:41.560> all<00:03:41.920> your<00:03:42.129> equipment<00:03:42.489> will

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
so basically all your equipment will

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.830 
so basically all your equipment will
start<00:03:42.969> there<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.709> that<00:03:44.709> is<00:03:44.980> pretty<00:03:45.459> much<00:03:45.609> it

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
start there and that is pretty much it

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.530 
start there and that is pretty much it
once<00:03:47.349> you<00:03:47.560> make<00:03:48.519> sure<00:03:48.730> this<00:03:48.849> is<00:03:49.030> covered<00:03:49.390> up

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
once you make sure this is covered up

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.289 
once you make sure this is covered up
always<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.590> yeah<00:03:51.250> I'm<00:03:51.400> just<00:03:51.430> gonna<00:03:51.670> sign<00:03:52.120> out

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
always and yeah I'm just gonna sign out

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.259
