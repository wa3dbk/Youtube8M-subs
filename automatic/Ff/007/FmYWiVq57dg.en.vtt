00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.520
 i 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.130
 good android is good the day we go 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.710
 let's apply what is the file of the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.800
 dsp manager of this file if it serves 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.830
 from version 4.0 onwards the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.130
 file if you can tell from s &amp; p points 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.860
 and in 4.3 they did not have it, that 's a name 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.910
 of anyone but this file works 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.830
 from which you can make a 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.199
 ahead what they will need is a 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.900
 modified recovery and what is the 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.750
 point point yes and let's go here the 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.790
 install section unlike 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.769
 cart and go to the section where there 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.229
 downloaded the zip file that will be for 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.330
 all my case download murcia the jumps 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:00.089
 a log and we will locate what is the 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.489
 zip point cp and what they are going to do is give 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:05.280
 here in yes install of seven points and 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.770
 mannara and wait for it to be installed 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.720
 delayed a lot and we are going to give here in Cuba 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.150
 in my case because I do not have a phrase 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.830
 I have it installed and this file is 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.320
 will install an application that is the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.240
 and these leadership manager 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.150
 this application only comes to me 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.710
 they look like roms with a lot of magic mod and 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.270
 others more 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.570
 more so that the application we are going to 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.140
 restart the android device and this 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.380
 application 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.909
 what you are going to do is basically 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.520
 equalize the sound in android or improve 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.240
 also what the base is going to 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.190
 flip over so there's no kind of 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.320
 problem with the sound effects that 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.479
 we will be able to listen at the time of 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.330
 put the headphones or listen to some 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.090
 loud music will also improve 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.680
 what is noise cancellation to the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.570
 what time are we with the hearing aids and 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.990
 we always have the problem that there 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.060
 external noises that disturb us or 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.619
 that give us problems when listening 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.390
 a kind of music that is not that we 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.130
 like this topic nobody is going to 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.830
 improve and it will cancel all the noise 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.950
 outside making it almost nil and 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.230
 that we can hear clear music 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.480
 without any problem and as you will see here 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.959
 the file that we have failed has not 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.300
 applied an application that is the dsp and 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.060
 that in this case I'm going to say equalizer 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.220
 knx so there is no problem 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.739
 and as you see here I already have what is the 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.840
 application itself is what it is from manager 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.150
 and here we will be able to configure everything 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.280
 which is the sounds improve what is the 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.900
 bass as I am communicating we are going to 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.209
 can also improve the headphones 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.940
 now that we have it connected and improve 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.380
 manually so what is this 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.080
 this bar of faith defined that for 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.599
 show the effects or the best of what 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.650
 is the conversation sound and this 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.530
 application we also bring you the 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.150
 advantages for example the sound is going to 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.410
 be much clearer and also not going to 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.600
 save a lot we 're going to save us 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.700
 a lot of battery because many applications 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.650
 they tell us an almost equal promise 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.420
 than this application but in royal what 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.310
 what they do is use almost all 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.049
 speaker to the maximum and they left almost without 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.930
 battery what is this this application 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.420
 of s &amp; p manager who is very well known is 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.880
 know how to post I do not think it's the sound 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.760
 but without losing what is the battery and 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.280
 also have an efficient saving as 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.989
 that lasts of the day because not so it has been 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.970
 all for the video and he likes the video 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.350
 leave the essence for the community 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.680
 keep growing and invited them to spend 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.269
 channel so you can see 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.590
 this has been all if I do not fire up 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.590
