00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:07.850
 at night guys 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.010
 one more time, right? 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.010
 making a video there for you 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.500
 testing me there 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:27.089
 the sun 431 stainless pipe 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.250
 Let's see how the bike got 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.600
 after that exchange this exhaust pipe 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.600
 only the cloth 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:45.370
 how she got right 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.370
 shadyac goodness to see how she is 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.580
 the traffic was quite busy 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.360
 let's see how it goes this 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.840
 O 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.949
 Hmm 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.439
 noise is boxing 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.650
 the busy traffic 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.340
 the cover has the notion né 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.340
 Let's put the 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:09.740
 the noise 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:12.140
 we put filter kayani there 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.690
 candles in rhythm each one better 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.650
 performance 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.650
 ae 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.340
 like the little dog screams 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.320
 so the staff 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:45.760
 Are you seeing there, then, how then? 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:50.320
 says load put it on and dont put it on 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:55.140
 with the sports field is the kayani filter 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:58.580
 and the sail drove the bike loses a lot 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.500
 power up 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:05.650
 nene and then advice to anyone 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.650
 change and I do not rule out the end 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:19.590
 remember that you are playing and also the 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:21.689
 filter and the candles because if not your 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.989
 bike will be losing performance 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:23.989
 her 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.110
 so we 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.110
 attested 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.959
 ah 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.190
 the noise is dies 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.840
 8 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.440
 ae 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.150
 walking 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.730
 the bike was made some adjustments in the 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.959
 own brand 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:12.450
 because that's how I put this barrel 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:15.030
 sports exhaust four in one 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.370
 it got a little usp when reducing 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.810
 the accelerator jumped 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.470
 after I did irregular voter 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.470
 or rather 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.099
 an is 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:27.099
 ae 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:03.479
 now when 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.479
 reduces it no longer those little more 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.540
 that's because 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.780
 I have not put the bike in the vineyard 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.780
 moto 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.229
 and I did not put the rapid biking 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:25.049
 reason why they say that the 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:25.049
 motorcycle performance 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:34.229
 a lot more 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:41.009
 I was happy to put the profile of 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:43.710
 cayenne and the iridium candles I feel 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:48.870
 when I changed the candex caó 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:52.770
 the sport by the original the bike she 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:55.660
 lost flight and performance 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:59.380
 I thought it was half a shit. 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:02.050
 the noise was beautiful but in 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:05.590
 compensation she lost a lot 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.890
 it made a lot of noise and 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:14.260
 did not perform like you do now 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:18.940
 so it 's remarkable the difference you make to 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:23.430
 exchange of a sport year of an original 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:26.590
 of the sports we see the difference 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:29.590
 notably throughout the county 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:33.520
 little boy who's thinking 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:36.160
 and exchange the exchange of the original car by 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.860
 already has in mind that it will have 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.190
 to replace the filter and the 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.190
 candles 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.430
 and today it's more that I just want to thank 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:07:00.110
 and 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:05.630
 everyone watching the video 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:08.080
 if they liked and there is no favorite given gives a 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:11.759
 jewelry 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.759
 and sign up for the channel 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.920
 and the others are not 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.290
 the lost connection in your home 

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.260
 thanks
