00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.019
 hello everyone and madam puff pastry I 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.759
 you find today for a 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.080
 new tutorial which will be the 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.910
 soccer ball keychain 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.439
 so it's a tutorial last two 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.090
 minutes for Father's Day I had 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.939
 completely forgot to make it a 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.010
 I found you this little tutorial 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.320
 so I really hope he will you 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.150
 so please to start you take 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.369
 a small piece of white dough so 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.509
 to be able to take a bigger one according to the 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.100
 size of footballs you 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.570
 want to do 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.129
 you then take the white paw 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.760
 you make a sausage standing cut 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.320
 in several small pieces you go in 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.180
 to make small balls every time 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.420
 and you will do the same with the 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:52.820
 black fimo paste then we will come 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.980
 started by placing the little balls 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.449
 black and then the little dresses 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.000
 white around so the goal is to make 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.000
 a flower each time with five petals 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.660
 we always put a black ball and have 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.910
 makes a five-petal flower of course 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.270
 there we just add the petals that 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.950
 missing 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.180
 so I say petals because that 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.550
 looks like a flower but it does not 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.770
 is not called petals so you 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:27.570
 do it until you've filled 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:28.950
 fully the balloon tried to leave 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.860
 the balls well round to have a 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.310
 best effect in the end then we will 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.360
 roll the ball between our apples tomorrow 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.340
 is not completely wrong that this 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.300
 to completely mix must when 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.850
 even that they have the marks for 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.040
 really make it a soccer ball 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.900
 so like this then I'll take 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.180
 a small peak so it's a small screw 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.410
 like these i'm going to start 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.070
 slip into my balloon that is not 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.810
 still cooked 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.160
 so you go vice is half 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.600
 you then put it in the oven 30 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.600
 minutes at 110 degrees 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.710
 and once it is cooked you go 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.850
 finish the draw and of course you 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.619
 wait for him to cool down 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:15.489
 if you are in a hurry past the underwater 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:17.700
 cold so we vice to the end and 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.200
 we will then ride it in keychains 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.840
 so you need a little ring a 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.319
 keychain simply of pliers and 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.319
 it will be finished 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.510
 you just have to close 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.200
 and here is your little keychain 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.690
 determine if you wish you can 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.690
 varnish with matte varnish or 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.360
 glossy lacquer and that's it over 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.050
 good weekend finally big kisses and good 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.050
