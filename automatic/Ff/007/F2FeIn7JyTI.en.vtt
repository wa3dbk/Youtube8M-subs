00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
I'm going to be taking a look at the

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.289 
I'm going to be taking a look at the
crossbow<00:00:04.980> in<00:00:05.220> battlefield<00:00:05.700> 3<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:06.060> more

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
crossbow in battlefield 3 and more

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.970 
crossbow in battlefield 3 and more
specifically<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.960> standard<00:00:07.620> bolt<00:00:07.830> that

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
specifically the standard bolt that

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.400 
specifically the standard bolt that
comes<00:00:08.220> with<00:00:08.429> it<00:00:08.719> initially<00:00:09.719> at<00:00:09.840> first<00:00:10.170> I

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
comes with it initially at first I

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.600 
comes with it initially at first I
thought<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:10.860> this<00:00:11.010> weapon<00:00:11.340> was<00:00:11.460> either

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
thought that this weapon was either

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.610 
thought that this weapon was either
going<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.940> be<00:00:12.120> just<00:00:12.360> completely<00:00:12.620> blatantly

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
going to be just completely blatantly

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.189 
going to be just completely blatantly
overpowered<00:00:14.340> or<00:00:14.580> it<00:00:15.120> was<00:00:15.150> going<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.929> be

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
overpowered or it was going to be

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.599 
overpowered or it was going to be
useless<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.949> didn't<00:00:17.130> really<00:00:17.220> think<00:00:17.340> there<00:00:17.520> was

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
useless I didn't really think there was

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.490 
useless I didn't really think there was
gonna<00:00:17.670> be<00:00:17.789> much<00:00:18.000> middle<00:00:18.150> ground<00:00:18.270> here<00:00:18.539> but<00:00:19.470> I

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
gonna be much middle ground here but I

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.019 
gonna be much middle ground here but I
have<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.830> give<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.189> dice<00:00:20.340> because<00:00:20.789> they

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
have to give it to dice because they

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.420 
have to give it to dice because they
seem<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.420> have<00:00:21.660> managed<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.680> balance<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.220> very

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
seem to have managed to balance it very

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.220 
seem to have managed to balance it very
well<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.850> after<00:00:24.420> getting<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.840> couple<00:00:25.109> hundred

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
thought the normal boat was gonna

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.920 
thought the normal boat was gonna
resemble<00:00:47.730> something<00:00:48.059> like<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> bolt-action

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
resemble something like the bolt-action

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.900 
resemble something like the bolt-action
rifles<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.649> game<00:00:49.829> where<00:00:50.190> if<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.460> wanted

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
rifles in the game where if you wanted

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.880 
rifles in the game where if you wanted
to<00:00:50.969> get<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.090> one<00:00:51.329> shot<00:00:51.539> kill<00:00:51.600> up<00:00:52.020> close<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.770> would

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
to get a one shot kill up close it would

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.010 
to get a one shot kill up close it would
require<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.760> get<00:00:53.969> an<00:00:54.090> upper<00:00:54.420> chest<00:00:54.750> or<00:00:54.960> a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
require you to get an upper chest or a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.619 
require you to get an upper chest or a
headshot<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.100> do<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.430> but<00:00:57.239> that's<00:00:57.420> not<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
headshot to do so but that's not the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.990 
headshot to do so but that's not the
case<00:00:57.780> because<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.739> normal<00:00:59.309> boat<00:00:59.489> actually

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
case because the normal boat actually

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.750 
case because the normal boat actually
has<00:01:00.180> an<00:01:00.420> extremely<00:01:00.899> high<00:01:01.440> damage<00:01:01.770> model<00:01:02.280> it's

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
going to it's going to do a hundred

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.010 
going to it's going to do a hundred
damage<00:01:04.710> up<00:01:04.860> close<00:01:05.159> or<00:01:05.460> about<00:01:05.700> 220<00:01:06.600> meters<00:01:06.689> out

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
and then after that it's going to drop

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.480 
and then after that it's going to drop
down<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.390> around<00:01:09.750> or<00:01:10.320> actually<00:01:10.770> 60<00:01:11.130> damage<00:01:11.430> a

damage and really what this means for

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.760 
damage and really what this means for
you<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.299> as<00:01:15.720> long<00:01:15.930> as<00:01:16.170> you're<00:01:16.320> able<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.619> get<00:01:16.740> a

reason<00:01:31.049> being<00:01:31.290> as<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.650> mentioned<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.159> does<00:01:32.430> a

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
reason being as I mentioned it does a

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.399 
reason being as I mentioned it does a
hundred<00:01:32.970> damage<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.390> shot<00:01:33.630> within<00:01:33.869> 20<00:01:34.320> meters

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
hundred damage a shot within 20 meters

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.109 
hundred damage a shot within 20 meters
and<00:01:34.770> that's<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.979> one<00:01:35.220> shot<00:01:35.549> kill<00:01:35.610> or

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
and that's a one shot kill or

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.390 
and that's a one shot kill or
potentially<00:01:37.020> two<00:01:37.229> or<00:01:37.560> maybe<00:01:37.710> even<00:01:37.860> three<00:01:38.280> I've

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
potentially two or maybe even three I've

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.330 
potentially two or maybe even three I've
never<00:01:38.610> I've<00:01:38.790> never<00:01:38.820> gotten<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.600> three<00:01:40.560> or<00:01:40.799> three

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
never I've never gotten a three or three

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.530 
never I've never gotten a three or three
in<00:01:41.430> one<00:01:41.640> I've<00:01:41.850> definitely<00:01:42.000> gotten<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.420> couple

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
in one I've definitely gotten a couple

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.020 
in one I've definitely gotten a couple
collaterals<00:01:43.170> with<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.530> but<00:01:44.340> if<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.729> are<00:01:44.759> up

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
collaterals with it but if you are up

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.300 
collaterals with it but if you are up
close<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.630> going<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> one<00:01:46.950> shot<00:01:47.250> kill

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
close it's going to be a one shot kill

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.609 
close it's going to be a one shot kill
which<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.909> its<00:01:48.060> main<00:01:48.329> strength<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.439> other

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
which is its main strength the other

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.340 
which is its main strength the other
reason<00:01:49.860> being<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.640> has<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> very<00:01:51.659> slow

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
reason being is that it has a very slow

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.980 
reason being is that it has a very slow
velocity<00:01:52.740> its<00:01:53.369> velocity<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.450> hundred

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
velocity its velocity is a hundred

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.410 
velocity its velocity is a hundred
meters<00:01:55.259> per<00:01:55.409> second<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.420> extremely

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
meters per second and that is extremely

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.940 
meters per second and that is extremely
slow<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.930> really<00:01:58.200> what<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:58.409> means<00:01:58.649> for<00:01:58.710> you

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
slow and really what this means for you

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.069 
slow and really what this means for you
is<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.130> if<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.399> do<00:01:59.579> try<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.000> line<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:00.689> one<00:02:00.960> of

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
is that if you do try to line up one of

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.050 
is that if you do try to line up one of
those<00:02:01.140> long<00:02:01.469> range<00:02:01.860> shots<00:02:02.189> it's<00:02:02.520> going<00:02:03.030> to

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
those long range shots it's going to

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.399 
those long range shots it's going to
have<00:02:03.450> an<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.719> very<00:02:04.500> very<00:02:05.189> high<00:02:05.810> bullet<00:02:06.810> drop<00:02:07.140> and

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
have an a very very high bullet drop and

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.550 
have an a very very high bullet drop and
trying<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.369> kind<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.819> accommodate<00:02:09.420> for<00:02:09.810> the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
trying to kind of accommodate for the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.080 
trying to kind of accommodate for the
travel<00:02:10.950> speed<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.310> going<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.640> be<00:02:11.760> extremely

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
travel speed is going to be extremely

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.860 
travel speed is going to be extremely
challenging<00:02:12.510> so<00:02:13.200> if<00:02:13.319> you<00:02:13.440> do<00:02:13.590> see

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
challenging so if you do see

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.750 
challenging so if you do see
someone<00:02:14.049> off<00:02:14.170> in<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.349> distance<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:14.920> would<00:02:15.430> not

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
someone off in the distance I would not

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.339 
someone off in the distance I would not
recommend<00:02:15.970> going<00:02:16.450> for<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.780> target<00:02:16.959> if<00:02:17.200> they

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
recommend going for the target if they

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.140 
recommend going for the target if they
are<00:02:17.590> moving<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.220> even<00:02:18.519> if<00:02:18.610> they're<00:02:18.760> standing

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
are moving and even if they're standing

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.899 
are moving and even if they're standing
still<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:20.129> when<00:02:21.129> I<00:02:21.159> was<00:02:21.370> using<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.760> standard

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
still I when I was using the standard

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.729 
still I when I was using the standard
Bolton<00:02:22.480> it's<00:02:22.629> the<00:02:22.720> standard<00:02:22.900> bolt<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.260> would

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
Bolton it's the standard bolt I would

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.199 
Bolton it's the standard bolt I would
more<00:02:23.980> often<00:02:24.159> than<00:02:24.310> not<00:02:24.370> just<00:02:24.819> completely

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
more often than not just completely

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.990 
more often than not just completely
ignore<00:02:25.629> them<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:25.959> try<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.560> close<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.670> gap<00:02:27.819> on

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
ignore them and try to close the gap on

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.729 
ignore them and try to close the gap on
them<00:02:28.239> because<00:02:28.420> trying<00:02:28.959> to<00:02:29.110> line<00:02:29.290> up<00:02:29.409> that<00:02:29.530> shot

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
them because trying to line up that shot

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.490 
them because trying to line up that shot
is<00:02:29.890> going<00:02:30.099> to<00:02:30.190> just<00:02:30.400> be<00:02:30.519> just<00:02:30.970> stupid<00:02:31.480> hard<00:02:31.690> so

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
is going to just be just stupid hard so

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.020 
is going to just be just stupid hard so
another<00:02:32.799> pretty<00:02:33.159> substantial<00:02:33.760> disadvantage

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
another pretty substantial disadvantage

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.970 
another pretty substantial disadvantage
of<00:02:34.420> this<00:02:34.480> weapon<00:02:34.750> is<00:02:34.989> that<00:02:35.049> it<00:02:35.260> does<00:02:35.440> have<00:02:35.470> a

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
of this weapon is that it does have a

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.100 
of this weapon is that it does have a
lengthy<00:02:36.940> reload<00:02:37.269> time<00:02:37.510> it's<00:02:37.750> going<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.930> take

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
lengthy reload time it's going to take

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.140 
lengthy reload time it's going to take
you<00:02:38.260> 4.7<00:02:39.190> seconds<00:02:39.519> to<00:02:39.640> go<00:02:39.730> through<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.060> entire

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
you 4.7 seconds to go through the entire

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.360 
you 4.7 seconds to go through the entire
animation<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.349> if<00:02:41.860> you're<00:02:42.010> getting<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.310> a

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
animation and if you're getting to a

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.580 
animation and if you're getting to a
tight<00:02:42.519> situation<00:02:42.700> where<00:02:43.480> you're<00:02:43.810> not<00:02:44.079> able<00:02:44.319> to

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
tight situation where you're not able to

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.250 
tight situation where you're not able to
get<00:02:44.769> a<00:02:45.010> collateral<00:02:45.760> on<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.060> couple<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:46.959> enemies

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
get a collateral on a couple the enemies

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.080 
get a collateral on a couple the enemies
that<00:02:47.410> are<00:02:47.470> nearby<00:02:47.709> which<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.579> usually<00:02:48.849> not<00:02:48.970> the

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
that are nearby which is usually not the

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.190 
that are nearby which is usually not the
case<00:02:49.120> you're<00:02:49.510> going<00:02:49.629> to<00:02:49.690> need<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.870> switch<00:02:50.049> on

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
case you're going to need to switch on

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.080 
case you're going to need to switch on
over<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.530> your<00:02:50.650> secondary<00:02:51.129> or<00:02:51.430> your<00:02:51.670> primary

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
over to your secondary or your primary

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.300 
over to your secondary or your primary
weapon<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:53.200> know<00:02:53.290> finish<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.739> job<00:02:53.980> and

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
weapon to you know finish the job and

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.150 
weapon to you know finish the job and
you<00:02:55.000> know<00:02:55.120> this<00:02:55.450> is<00:02:55.480> really<00:02:55.780> where<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.799> weapon

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
you know this is really where the weapon

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.119 
you know this is really where the weapon
kind<00:02:57.489> of<00:02:57.700> is<00:02:58.090> meant<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:59.079> not<00:02:59.290> really<00:02:59.530> be<00:02:59.680> a

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
kind of is meant to not really be a

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:01.800 
kind of is meant to not really be a
primary<00:03:00.489> weapon<00:03:01.000> while<00:03:01.209> it's<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.510> lot<00:03:01.659> of<00:03:01.690> fun

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
primary weapon while it's a lot of fun

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.930 
primary weapon while it's a lot of fun
and<00:03:02.049> that's<00:03:02.140> basically<00:03:02.379> what<00:03:02.799> i<00:03:02.829> was<00:03:03.010> doing<00:03:03.310> to

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
and that's basically what i was doing to

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.809 
and that's basically what i was doing to
in<00:03:04.060> today's<00:03:04.359> video<00:03:04.599> it's<00:03:05.560> it's<00:03:05.829> really<00:03:06.549> meant

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
in today's video it's it's really meant
