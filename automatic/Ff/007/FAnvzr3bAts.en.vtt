00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.150

 also cut a hole for standard 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.610
 philips bat and you can use it as 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.470
 an adapter for the tool was taken from 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.200

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.410

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:15.390

 in circulation they are bastards 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.209
 make 300 pieces of which model 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.030
 they diverge like hot cakes nobody 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.700
 Unfortunately, no time to understand except 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.400
 KARAMBIT of my eyes everything was not 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.129
 of course, but this one is like a rajah 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.890
 from cold steel but somehow 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.170
 watched anyway the soul does not lie 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.519
 ceramides were good 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.950
 just the other day they turned off 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:51.129
 another knife that finally looks like 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.440
 knife usually their knives seem like a bunch 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.840
 water parts perfectly 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.530
 incomprehensible thing here is a great 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.500
 flipper chic hilt and my favorite 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.349
 blade with a flat cutting edge 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.440
 This flipper I probably would even imagine 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.489
 bought for sale they arrived already there on 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.609
 west 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:15.310
 as you see on the passport it is written 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:18.729
 such a number of 300 made only 300 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.709
 pieces for the whole world and will reach at least 12 to 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.560
 Russia 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.960
 incomprehensible but interesting suddenly you never know 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.050
 who can grab I recommend 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.700
 they collect well and the form certainly 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:37.200
 like a nice interesting knife from very 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:40.210
 strange but reliable manufacturer 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:44.460

 so much eichman is like steel which is not 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.580
 afraid of salt water specifically was 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.710
 designed to user 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.479

 plastic sheath evening kayfovy 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:17.680
 and the last one gets me pictures 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:20.500
 what was in my hand I was hoping if I did not 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.110
 that he is at least 2 times more 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.750
 for all that, such a petty cunning. 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:29.380
 also has the right to live with us deep 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.919
 spring soon summer will not bathe these 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:36.700
 knives exactly will be in demand perhaps 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:39.460
 next season is the concept of 2015 and 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:43.690
 this summer is unlikely to have time but I hope 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.639
 the series will come interesting our with you 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.650
