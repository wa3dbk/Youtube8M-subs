the<00:01:09.150> first<00:01:09.330> thing<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.750> noticed<00:01:09.780> when

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the first thing that I noticed when

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.679 
the first thing that I noticed when
taking<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.710> out<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.390> taking<00:01:12.390> out<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
taking it out of the taking out of the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.580 
taking it out of the taking out of the
box<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:14.570> I<00:01:15.570> don't<00:01:15.720> know<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.200> tell<00:01:16.530> but

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
box and I don't know if you can tell but

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.390 
box and I don't know if you can tell but
the<00:01:17.630> it's<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:19.200> quite<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> bit<00:01:19.770> faster<00:01:20.250> but

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
the it's a it's quite a bit faster but

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.249 
the it's a it's quite a bit faster but
that<00:01:20.520> could<00:01:20.670> be<00:01:20.700> because<00:01:20.790> I've<00:01:21.240> done<00:01:21.270> some

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
that could be because I've done some

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.010 
that could be because I've done some
unforgivable<00:01:22.590> things<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.369> phone

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
unforgivable things of this phone

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.539 
unforgivable things of this phone
jailbreaking<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.380> tweaking<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.130> all<00:01:26.250> kinds

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
jailbreaking and tweaking and all kinds

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.280 
jailbreaking and tweaking and all kinds
of<00:01:26.610> stuff<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.240> sometimes<00:01:27.960> that'll

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
of stuff to it and sometimes that'll

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.780 
of stuff to it and sometimes that'll
slow<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.650> down<00:01:28.680> just<00:01:29.040> bog<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.430> down<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.579> little

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
slow it down just bog it down a little

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.910 
slow it down just bog it down a little
bit<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> lot<00:01:31.290> faster<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
bit so this is a lot faster the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.789 
bit so this is a lot faster the
resolution<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.700> whole<00:01:32.970> lot<00:01:33.150> better<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:34.079> I

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
resolution is a whole lot better and I

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.380 
resolution is a whole lot better and I

nothing changed their other than the
color<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:52.549> headphone<00:01:53.549> jack<00:01:53.579> there<00:01:54.060> has

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
color and the headphone jack there has

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.649 
color and the headphone jack there has
moved<00:01:54.840> from<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.200> top<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.130> iphone<00:01:56.579> down<00:01:57.299> to

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
moved from the top of the iphone down to

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.080 
moved from the top of the iphone down to
the<00:01:57.930> bottom<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.649> iphone<00:01:59.070> which<00:01:59.850> i<00:02:00.030> think

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
the bottom of the iphone which i think

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.859 
the bottom of the iphone which i think
was<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.360> good<00:02:00.540> move<00:02:00.719> by<00:02:00.750> Apple<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:01.530> because

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
was a good move by Apple just because

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.510 
was a good move by Apple just because
rather<00:02:03.869> than<00:02:04.020> having<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.890> phone<00:02:05.130> or<00:02:05.369> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
rather than having the phone or the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.399 
rather than having the phone or the
headphone<00:02:05.880> jack<00:02:05.909> up<00:02:06.360> here<00:02:06.600> plugged<00:02:06.930> in<00:02:07.170> and

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
headphone jack up here plugged in and

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.660 
headphone jack up here plugged in and
you're<00:02:07.740> sitting<00:02:07.890> there<00:02:08.069> trying<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.429> navigate

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
you're sitting there trying to navigate

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.550 
you're sitting there trying to navigate
your<00:02:09.030> phone<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.599> cords<00:02:09.959> all<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.410> way

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
your phone and the cords all in the way

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.229 
your phone and the cords all in the way
and<00:02:11.009> you're<00:02:11.129> trying<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.459> move<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.790> cord<00:02:12.030> hold

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
and you're trying to move the cord hold

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.140 
and you're trying to move the cord hold
the<00:02:12.300> cord<00:02:12.540> back

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
the cord back

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.309 
the cord back
now<00:02:13.239> you<00:02:13.299> don't<00:02:13.569> have<00:02:13.599> that<00:02:13.840> problem<00:02:14.019> that

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
now you don't have that problem that

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.130 
now you don't have that problem that
should<00:02:14.439> that<00:02:14.500> should<00:02:14.799> solve<00:02:15.189> that<00:02:15.400> problem

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
should that should solve that problem

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.300 
should that should solve that problem
also<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.230> does<00:02:17.379> have<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.650> mic<00:02:17.829> and<00:02:18.010> the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
also it does have the mic and the

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.949 
also it does have the mic and the
speaker<00:02:18.730> down<00:02:18.909> here<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.180> little<00:02:19.269> bit<00:02:19.599> of<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.810> new

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
speaker down here a little bit of a new

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.559 
speaker down here a little bit of a new
design<00:02:20.319> and<00:02:20.879> haven't<00:02:21.879> actually<00:02:22.000> tested<00:02:22.269> those

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
design and haven't actually tested those

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:23.789 
design and haven't actually tested those
out<00:02:22.750> yet<00:02:22.959> hopefully<00:02:23.319> it's<00:02:23.439> a<00:02:23.470> little<00:02:23.680> more

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
out yet hopefully it's a little more

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.740 
out yet hopefully it's a little more
clear<00:02:24.099> hopefully<00:02:24.519> a<00:02:24.579> little<00:02:24.819> more<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.689> little

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
clear hopefully a little more a little

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.270 
clear hopefully a little more a little
more<00:02:26.439> louder<00:02:27.209> that<00:02:28.209> would<00:02:28.360> be<00:02:28.480> nice<00:02:28.629> and

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
more louder that would be nice and

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.339 
more louder that would be nice and
obviously<00:02:30.280> it<00:02:30.640> has<00:02:30.849> changed<00:02:31.540> from<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.900> 30-pin

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
obviously it has changed from the 30-pin

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.170 
obviously it has changed from the 30-pin
connector<00:02:32.409> to<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:32.950> 8-pin<00:02:33.549> connector<00:02:33.609> which

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
connector to the 8-pin connector which

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.819 
connector to the 8-pin connector which
they're<00:02:34.359> calling<00:02:34.659> the<00:02:34.780> Lightning<00:02:35.170> connector

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
they're calling the Lightning connector

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.250 
they're calling the Lightning connector
or<00:02:36.250> lightning<00:02:36.640> cable<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:37.810> is<00:02:37.930> reversible

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
or lightning cable and it is reversible

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.199 
or lightning cable and it is reversible
so<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.340> haven't<00:02:39.640> checked<00:02:39.849> that<00:02:39.939> out<00:02:40.030> either

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
so and I haven't checked that out either

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.160 
so and I haven't checked that out either
you<00:02:41.170> guys<00:02:41.319> are<00:02:41.379> I'm<00:02:42.340> here<00:02:43.120> figuring<00:02:43.959> all<00:02:44.109> this

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
that's pretty much all the differences

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.589 
that's pretty much all the differences
