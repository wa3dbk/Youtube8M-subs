00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hi guys, I'm here again with 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.379
 same face in the same clothes you want 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.500
 in the face does not change, but the same 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.990
 makeup and I came to talk how was the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.179
 the first week of my 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.970
 cruise that is the second phase of diet 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.270
 dukan the first phase was on the 15th in the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.480
 on the 19th, it was a Monday until 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.810
 Friday and the cruise phase began 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.810
 on the 21st Saturday as every Monday 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.890
 I want to put the video on how it went 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.420
 the phase of the cruise as it was every week 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.899
 of the cruise phase 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.719
 so I'm going to do Monday to Monday 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.450
 also on Saturday on Sunday confess that 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.149
 There is no end to the academy, which is where I 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.500
 then you have to know how much 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.789
 Your losing why I'm going to do it 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.530
 Monday to Monday 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.440
 talking a little about the phase of the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.350
 cruise is equal to the phase of the attack 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.329
 only so one day you do only to 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.809
 train this one day you only eat 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.080
 what makes the attack and another day 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.590
 you eat more protein and vegetables 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.560
 vegetables with the exception of some 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.460
 potato stew, whatever 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:21.600
 carbohydrate considered carbohydrate 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:24.150
 so it 's the same thing as the attack but 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.220
 There are some tolerated ones like that 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.320
 so for example you know that 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.740
 pollen that you want a 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.320
 square so you can comest 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.420
 up to 2 per day 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.220
 I'll leave the list of tolerated there 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.189
 blog because now I do not know 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.500
 head then it's that super easy same 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.290
 thing that only attacks it is one day only 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.290
 protein just to quote here another day 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.740
 proteins plus vegetables or vegetables 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.369
 cruise you eat two daily 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.590
 tablespoons of oat bran in the 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.610
 attack was a spoon and a half on the good map 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.299
 It was also quiet for me. 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.630
 the first week of the Saturday cruise I 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.710
 I was super excited looking 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:17.330
 I was so excited to eat salad 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:20.420
 carrot broccoli your stuff but then 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.880
 I eat or find anything too well 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.820
 I was super- willing to change 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.030
 a bit on the menu but at the end of the year on 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.770
 She even knows if I eat only meat and fish. 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.780
 I do not know if it would be the same as eating with 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.800
 carrot salad because I'm not much 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.680
 Arrival if I like but not that thing 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.640
 I love roni, it was quiet, it did not have any 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.560
 The day I got there, I'm super precise. 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.910
 My God, I need to charge something. 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:56.780
 You know, you had no day, yes , on the 22nd. 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.240
 from July until July 29 I lost 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.270
 one kilo and 300 see but I stayed a lot 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:06.020
 happy and I was no longer those 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:09.200
 days then my body has already swallowed me 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:13.040
 I measured my belly but my butt 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.310
 changed it was just the same I do not know what 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.280
 but it's still the same as 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.600
 measures then entered calcini 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:27.320
 I was very well but I'm happy I lost 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.300
 one hundred and three hundred in a week and 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.590
 Friday that was the last day of the 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:36.020
 attack July 19 to 22 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.980
 Monday that was when I 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:43.310
 Sorry again I lost 350 grams 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.380
 so I was super happy at the end of that 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.400
 cruise phase in that first week 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:53.120
 one kilo 650 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.850
 I was super happy in the total of the day 15 of 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.459
 July was the need and is up to the 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.700
 last day of the first week of the 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:05.990
 cruise that was July 29 I missed 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:09.290
 two pounds 550 then ours already stayed 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:12.680

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.800
 by the super excited diet with the diet and 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.350
 This week of the cruise I found 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.450
 zero fat curd that I had not 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.480
 key you can eat at will 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.620

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:32.640

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:35.580

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.920
 I put cottage cheese hard but 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.490
 Ballack mix was tasty 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:46.380
 Changed a little, you did not have a key. 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:50.670
 I made a whole milk pudding in the method 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:53.970
 than but his stew did not 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:58.970
 gives to do was going to have a staff that 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.970
 teach with talk 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.610
 but the teacher is on the run way not 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.940
 gives to make a broth with sweetener and 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.940

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.940

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:24.090
