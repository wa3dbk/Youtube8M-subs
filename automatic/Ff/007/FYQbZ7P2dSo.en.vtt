00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.380
 have always been undecided in understanding if 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.230
 my favorite moment of the week 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.390
 both on Friday evenings when everything still 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.050
 the weekend ahead or Sunday 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.399
 morning 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.230
 especially when the weather 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.489
 give me a brunch well I would say da 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.560
 when I'm a mom 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.570
 I choose Sunday morning I like it 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.640
 invite my friend Anna who comes with 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.860
 children and make a classic brunch 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.110
 American style with a large menu e 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.600
 obviously with the inevitable pancakes 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.340
 those of today, however, so that they are not 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.770
 just always the same I want to do with 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.500
 spelled flour and then with the seeds of 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.140
 poppy and I will serve them with maple tops 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.079
 blacksmiths unite with spelled flour also 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.910
 a little plain 00 flour so as to 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.710
 make them a little lighter a 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.549
 little bit of sugar but cannes 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.040
 so they will have an even more golden color 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:11.310
 the amount is roughly two tablespoons 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.530
 then obviously the yeast to make them 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.670
 inflate but also a pinch of salt and 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.670
 half a teaspoon of baking soda 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.680
 finally the poppy seeds 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.650
 here too the quantity is enough 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.420
 free depends on how much you want to hear 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.740
 the seeds under the teeth are enough 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.840
 details 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.450
 ok the dry ingredients are ready 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.400
 now liquids to make pancakes 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.530
 it would be better to get buttermilk 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.420
 but it's not easy to find so if not 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.760
 you find it no fear you can do it from 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.070
 at home it is enough to combine half the quantity 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.430
 of whole skimmed milk and it makes me 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:57.750
 amount of yogurt therefore for 230 billion 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.750
 buttermilk 115 of yogurt and 115 of milk 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.410
 finally two eggs separate the whites from the 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.170
 red so you can whip up i 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.970
 white and go create some 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.700
 diary inside my pancakes 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.830
 this will make them much softer and 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.720
 much more beautiful to see also add 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.110
 a little bit of vegetable oil in place and 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.110
 hard 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.280
 and now very white and snow well 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.280
 firm with an electric whisk 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.400
 that's it done now to give it one more 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.050
 a little more flavor I also add 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.390
 a little grated rind of fine 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.390
 lemon and then pancakes are almost ready 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.840
 now it's time to add i 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:59.650
 egg whites and then heat the 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:01.080
 pan wants I'm ready and now me 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.820
 prepares for cooking 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.530
 there are pans made especially for 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.360
 cook the pancakes that already have four 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.100
 holes though if you don't have one and then 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.620
 use a normal pan for cracks 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.700
 and a ladle trying to make pancakes 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.590
 more or less the same pancakes yes 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.780
 they can really do so many 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.340
 versions and if you are intolerant to 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.290
 gluten that you can also make them with 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.360
 rice flour and the flour of those who do not have 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.700
 the recipe is the same as replacing 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.520
 the spelled flour and the normal one with 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.540
 50 per cent of rice flour and 50 per 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.540
 hundred of flour of whom not 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.950
 that is why I keep them stacked so they stay 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.800
 in hot and now I'm going to get some 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.870
 raspberry berries and I'm ready 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.519
 to prepare the dishes a rule 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.200
 could be to use three 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.300
 pancakes for each dish but of course 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.170
 everyone can follow the rules of the 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:00.010
 own appetite 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:02.760
 add a few raspberries and finally the top 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.760
 acer fabbri 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.590
 this time instead of sugar a 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.590
 veil to give some more 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.690
 consistency dusting with a little bit of 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.730
 sugar cane 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.730
 here is ready to go to the table
