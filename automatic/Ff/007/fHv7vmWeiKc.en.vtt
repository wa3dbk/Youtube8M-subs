seniors<00:06:51.110> that<00:06:51.350> have<00:06:52.070> come<00:06:52.370> early<00:06:52.790> but<00:06:53.479> on<00:06:54.080> the

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.290 
seniors that have come early but on the

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.340 
seniors that have come early but on the
same<00:06:54.500> token<00:06:55.300> it<00:06:56.300> certainly<00:06:56.690> some<00:06:56.930> challenge

same token it certainly some challenge

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.629 
same token it certainly some challenge
there<00:06:57.650> are<00:06:57.710> certainly<00:06:57.949> some<00:06:58.040> challenges

00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 
there are certainly some challenges

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:00.460 
there are certainly some challenges
there<00:06:58.669> because<00:06:59.210> they<00:06:59.780> don't<00:07:00.020> really<00:07:00.200> have<00:07:00.440> the

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:00.470 
there because they don't really have the

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.350 
there because they don't really have the
same<00:07:00.830> foundation<00:07:01.550> some<00:07:01.820> of<00:07:01.910> the<00:07:01.970> other<00:07:02.120> guys

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
same foundation some of the other guys

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.060 
same foundation some of the other guys
do<00:07:02.630> so<00:07:03.229> when<00:07:03.380> you<00:07:03.470> don't<00:07:03.710> have<00:07:03.860> that

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.070 
do so when you don't have that

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.670 
do so when you don't have that
foundation<00:07:04.330> you<00:07:05.330> know<00:07:05.450> you're<00:07:05.690> trying<00:07:05.900> to<00:07:06.050> lay

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 
foundation you know you're trying to lay

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.710 
foundation you know you're trying to lay
the<00:07:06.860> groundwork<00:07:06.970> but<00:07:07.970> trying<00:07:08.240> to<00:07:08.270> keep<00:07:08.540> up

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 
the groundwork but trying to keep up

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.690 
the groundwork but trying to keep up
with<00:07:08.960> what<00:07:09.229> our<00:07:09.320> plan<00:07:09.620> was<00:07:09.860> when<00:07:10.190> Steven<00:07:10.550> was

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:10.700 
with what our plan was when Steven was

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.030 
with what our plan was when Steven was
going<00:07:10.850> to<00:07:10.910> be<00:07:11.030> in<00:07:11.180> so<00:07:12.020> you<00:07:12.560> know<00:07:12.650> we're<00:07:12.860> just

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:13.040 
going to be in so you know we're just

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.219 
going to be in so you know we're just
trying<00:07:13.250> to<00:07:13.280> get<00:07:13.460> the<00:07:13.610> offense<00:07:14.000> in<00:07:14.750> and

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:15.229 
trying to get the offense in and

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:17.650 
trying to get the offense in and
continue<00:07:15.950> to<00:07:16.310> build<00:07:16.910> off<00:07:17.120> of<00:07:17.150> what<00:07:17.419> we<00:07:17.510> did

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:17.660 
continue to build off of what we did

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.140 
continue to build off of what we did
last<00:07:17.770> fall<00:07:18.770> but<00:07:18.830> there<00:07:19.160> was<00:07:19.310> no<00:07:19.460> last<00:07:19.669> fall<00:07:19.940> for

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:20.150 
last fall but there was no last fall for

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.450 
last fall but there was no last fall for
that<00:07:20.180> so<00:07:20.960> there's<00:07:21.200> there's<00:07:21.680> those<00:07:22.039> growing

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:22.460 
that so there's there's those growing

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.820 
that so there's there's those growing
pains<00:07:22.490> but<00:07:22.850> they're<00:07:23.479> doing<00:07:23.690> a<00:07:23.750> nice<00:07:23.960> job<00:07:23.990> they

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:24.830 
pains but they're doing a nice job they

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.800 
pains but they're doing a nice job they
really<00:07:25.070> are<00:07:25.690> letting<00:07:26.690> us<00:07:26.870> run<00:07:27.350> the<00:07:27.410> offense
