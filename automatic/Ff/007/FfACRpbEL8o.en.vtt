so<00:02:27.950> by<00:02:28.100> creating<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.580> cap<00:02:28.819> at<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.030> lexan<00:02:29.390> which

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
so by creating a cap at a lexan which

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.870 
so by creating a cap at a lexan which
again<00:02:29.810> is<00:02:29.959> bulletproof<00:02:30.290> we<00:02:31.160> allow<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.459> barrel

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
again is bulletproof we allow the barrel

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.150 
again is bulletproof we allow the barrel
to<00:02:32.000> flex<00:02:32.300> at<00:02:32.540> its<00:02:32.660> maximum<00:02:33.110> potential<00:02:33.470> giving

to flex at its maximum potential giving

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.230 
to flex at its maximum potential giving
you<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.370> most<00:02:34.520> performance<00:02:35.060> you<00:02:35.150> can
