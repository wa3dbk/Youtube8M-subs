that the worms will day once the
material<00:01:50.040> goes<00:01:50.310> through<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> worm<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.689> comes

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
material goes through the worm it comes

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.859 
material goes through the worm it comes
out<00:01:52.229> as<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> perfect<00:01:53.130> ph7<00:01:54.350> balance<00:01:55.909> also<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.299> it

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
out as a perfect ph7 balance also the it

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.080 
out as a perfect ph7 balance also the it
will<00:01:58.140> enrich<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.829> parent<00:01:59.250> material<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.969> if

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
will enrich the parent material so if

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.569 
will enrich the parent material so if
you<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.329> two<00:02:00.630> percent<00:02:01.110> nitrogen<00:02:01.579> phosphorus

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
you have two percent nitrogen phosphorus

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.080 
you have two percent nitrogen phosphorus
potassium<00:02:03.320> whatever<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:05.219> material<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.790> going

potassium whatever the material is going

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.600 
potassium whatever the material is going
to<00:02:06.210> come<00:02:06.420> out<00:02:06.450> as<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> higher<00:02:07.200> percentage<00:02:07.610> once

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
to come out as a higher percentage once

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.220 
to come out as a higher percentage once
it<00:02:08.789> goes<00:02:08.940> through<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.420> worm<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:10.500> kind<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.009> a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
it goes through the worm it kind of a

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.670 
it goes through the worm it kind of a
alchemical<00:02:11.920> sense<00:02:12.280> i<00:02:12.580> would<00:02:12.760> say<00:02:13.409> the<00:02:14.409> worm

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
alchemical sense i would say the worm

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.430 
alchemical sense i would say the worm
castings<00:02:15.519> also<00:02:16.030> will<00:02:16.330> not<00:02:16.540> hurt<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.140> plant

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
castings also will not hurt the plant

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.309 
castings also will not hurt the plant
you<00:02:17.709> can<00:02:17.739> use<00:02:18.159> as<00:02:18.430> much<00:02:18.730> as<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.150> want<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:19.720> it

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
you can use as much as you want and it

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.160 
you can use as much as you want and it
it<00:02:20.920> will<00:02:21.159> never<00:02:21.459> burn<00:02:21.879> the<00:02:22.150> plant<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.989> will

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
it will never burn the plant and it will

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.979 
it will never burn the plant and it will
enrich<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.860> plant<00:02:24.159> a<00:02:24.519> little<00:02:25.150> bit<00:02:25.659> of<00:02:25.690> this

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
enrich the plant a little bit of this

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.320 
then over winter this is the drawback of
the<00:04:47.810> red<00:04:48.050> worm<00:04:48.350> they<00:04:49.130> will<00:04:49.370> not<00:04:49.550> survive<00:04:50.090> the

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
the red worm they will not survive the

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.350 
the red worm they will not survive the
winter<00:04:50.690> unless<00:04:50.900> you<00:04:51.320> mulch<00:04:51.620> over<00:04:51.950> them

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
winter unless you mulch over them

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.840 
winter unless you mulch over them
creating<00:04:53.360> insulation<00:04:54.320> for<00:04:54.680> them<00:04:55.010> there's

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
creating insulation for them there's

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.260 
creating insulation for them there's
also<00:04:56.120> three<00:04:56.630> things<00:04:57.020> you<00:04:57.140> should<00:04:57.290> know<00:04:57.680> about

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
also three things you should know about

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.760 
also three things you should know about
raising<00:04:59.270> your<00:04:59.419> worms<00:04:59.720> whether<00:05:00.169> you're<00:05:00.470> doing

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
raising your worms whether you're doing

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.630 
raising your worms whether you're doing
them<00:05:00.919> indoors<00:05:01.430> or<00:05:01.760> out<00:05:01.940> so<00:05:02.660> they<00:05:02.870> can<00:05:02.900> survive

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
them indoors or out so they can survive

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.780 
them indoors or out so they can survive
number<00:05:04.640> one<00:05:04.910> the<00:05:05.300> worm<00:05:05.540> needs<00:05:06.410> moisture<00:05:06.919> if

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
number one the worm needs moisture if

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.840 
number one the worm needs moisture if
their<00:05:08.360> parent<00:05:09.200> material<00:05:09.320> dries<00:05:10.070> out<00:05:10.370> the<00:05:10.640> worm

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
their parent material dries out the worm

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.200 
their parent material dries out the worm
will<00:05:11.150> dry<00:05:11.450> out<00:05:11.480> and<00:05:11.900> die<00:05:12.400> also<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.580> worm<00:05:13.790> needs

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
will dry out and die also the worm needs

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.990 
will dry out and die also the worm needs
food<00:05:14.660> if<00:05:15.260> they<00:05:15.500> don't<00:05:15.740> have<00:05:16.010> enough<00:05:16.340> food<00:05:16.669> they

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
food if they don't have enough food they

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.150 
food if they don't have enough food they
will<00:05:17.210> die<00:05:17.419> so<00:05:18.169> you<00:05:18.230> need<00:05:18.560> to<00:05:18.710> have<00:05:18.890> an

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
will die so you need to have an

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.909 
will die so you need to have an
abundance<00:05:19.760> of<00:05:19.940> organic<00:05:20.600> material<00:05:21.169> to<00:05:21.680> keep

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
abundance of organic material to keep

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.610 
abundance of organic material to keep
feeding<00:05:22.400> it<00:05:22.520> to<00:05:22.550> the<00:05:22.880> worm<00:05:23.090> the<00:05:24.020> other<00:05:24.229> thing

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
feeding it to the worm the other thing

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.370 
feeding it to the worm the other thing
that<00:05:24.650> can<00:05:25.070> arm<00:05:25.370> the<00:05:25.490> worm<00:05:25.850> is<00:05:26.150> if<00:05:26.870> your<00:05:27.080> pear

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
that can arm the worm is if your pear

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.050 
that can arm the worm is if your pear
material<00:05:27.950> over<00:05:28.280> time<00:05:28.600> becomes<00:05:29.600> compact<00:05:31.060> the

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
material over time becomes compact the

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.080 
material over time becomes compact the
worm<00:05:32.330> needs<00:05:32.690> loose<00:05:33.680> material<00:05:34.040> so<00:05:34.669> you<00:05:34.729> need<00:05:34.970> to

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
worm needs loose material so you need to

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.680 
worm needs loose material so you need to
use<00:05:35.240> a<00:05:35.270> garden<00:05:36.160> for<00:05:37.160> to<00:05:37.520> loosen<00:05:38.000> them<00:05:38.180> up<00:05:38.210> so

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
use a garden for to loosen them up so

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.570 
use a garden for to loosen them up so
they<00:05:38.720> can<00:05:39.050> thrive<00:05:39.640> thank<00:05:40.640> you<00:05:40.790> very<00:05:40.850> much<00:05:41.150> for

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
they can thrive thank you very much for

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.450 
they can thrive thank you very much for
