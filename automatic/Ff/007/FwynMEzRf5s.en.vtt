00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.720
 corrupter of minors because he made it 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.140
 made dishonest abuse is not one of a 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.600
 Integrative rape crime 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.210
 rape was not rape 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.040
 then he is not innocent 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.560
 and they make it up that if there's action from the 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.720
 attempt and not violation 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.030
 I conformed it because if the supreme court 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.740
 has ruled it so we can do 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.890
 us that we do not have 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:53.010
 we are ordinary people we do not have friends 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.860
 that is, we have to abide by what 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.020
 says the law is not true although me and the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.300
 Mr. Beira knows positively what he has 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.720
 happened from the nine members of the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.720
 cut and 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.680
 after eleven months and six days in the cell 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.900
 vip of the devotee jail everything indicates 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.180
 to regain freedom as the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.490
 bambino will redirect to san lorenzo 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.229
 from almagro we could do very well to 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.540
 we because we already know there 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.780
 boys who were two two or three 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.300
 years good but first the principal does not 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.520
 that the good that came out and that 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.290
 really rehabilitate everything that 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.840
 happened in there really that has been 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.630
 very ugly good then he will tell us and 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.640
 back to san lorenzo the band does not come and 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.050
 not welcome be to because they are one 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.450
 for me he is the best technician of the 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.240
 Argentine does not interest me now if they give 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:48.100
 freedom or not because the damage is already 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.619
 done but there were other ways 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.780
 of preventing this kind of thing and this 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.149
 same subject who puts it on 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.179
 psychiatric treatment so that it does not continue 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:02.550
 hurting me is a man 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:04.470
 normal a common citizen 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.290
 only that he wants a little bit of 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.990
 advertising for me is guilty and has 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.960
 that being in jail is a rapist I would say 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.940
 serve his sentence as other prisoners do not 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.070
 because I have money this 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.770
 I was free and I believe in what 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.020
 he says what is and innocent and all that 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.510
 that he says he repeats so much is 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.680
 true, the only thing I can give is a 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.990
 visceral opinion 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.610
 and I feel that he is guilty and if the 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.260
 justice sets them free is 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.940
 precisely because justice 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.190
 establishes that this type of crime has 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.960
 freedom to me does not seem good to me because 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.590
 I would not like just that a grandchild 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.480
 mine or a son will run into a being like that 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.540
 How will a person not be punished? 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:51.760
 that you have behind the other bars 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.530
 he must be a psychopath and as a psychopath 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.420
 it should be treated first and then 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.700
 let it go we are really 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.620
 outraged with this failure and with so many 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.500
 others in which we realize that 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.560
 our representatives in court 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.120
 they have a judgment sometimes inclined to 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.930
 favor 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.209
 the president or a government that does not 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.940
 we feel supported in this with this 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:20.180
 current camera medications 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.500
 presumptively by medication that he 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.840
 I usually took to lose weight 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.730
 as it refers 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.209
 we believe that it is because he never was 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.209
 depressed 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.090
 we can not talk about poisoning because 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.579
 never presented clinical manifestations 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.689
 of a certain poisoning your 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:43.249
 serious picture doctor is not mild 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:45.620
 well I had a nervous breakdown because 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:48.310
 there was a colleague of yours I do not know if you can 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.230
 call colleagues 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.780
 they started to make fun at the door of 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.260
 house was a photojournalist and two 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.540
 women took the pills so no no 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.569
 the truth that I do not know why I do not know 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.220
 when I saw these people from the 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.489
 reporters I saw that they were laughing 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.069
 even a totally ironic way 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.290
 of action is related to the 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.580
 situation of beira that would be about to leave 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.040
 in freedom you understand that there 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.049
 some relationship read me know what happens 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.700
 that psychically that I do not 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.880
 then from the ebro of that what 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.950
 I mean, maybe it can be but 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.290
 I now when he is restored 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.450
 completely I'm going to talk to him 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.200
 alone to see what happened is much more 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.940
 quiet 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.940
 as parents receive when I was 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.980
 in the house here he was never nervous 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.560
 they went well , they put the probe 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.990
 nasogastric and it was done 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.020
 and hydration as we do 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.180
 what yes given the background and everything 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.710
 the environment 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.930
 and the things that you know very well 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.009
 that are in the public domain we ask for the 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.229
 collaboration of the unit 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:56.770
 psychopathology of the alvear hospital for 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.770
 give him support
