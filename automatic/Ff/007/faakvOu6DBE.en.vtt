00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.839 
of my favorite builder figures actually
although<00:00:24.439> it<00:00:24.830> does<00:00:24.980> have<00:00:25.189> some<00:00:25.340> problems<00:00:25.519> I'll

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
although it does have some problems I'll

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.210 
although it does have some problems I'll
point<00:00:26.060> those<00:00:26.210> out<00:00:26.510> but<00:00:27.080> I<00:00:27.140> just<00:00:27.230> love<00:00:27.949> this

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
point those out but I just love this

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.550

figure<00:00:28.490> I<00:00:28.670> don't<00:00:28.970> know<00:00:29.060> why<00:00:29.240> I<00:00:29.570> don't<00:00:30.380> have<00:00:30.500> a

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
figure I don't know why I don't have a

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.050 
figure I don't know why I don't have a
particular<00:00:31.070> fondness<00:00:31.250> for<00:00:31.460> the<00:00:31.670> character

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.060 
particular fondness for the character

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.240 
particular fondness for the character
but<00:00:32.330> this<00:00:32.509> figured<00:00:32.840> is<00:00:33.140> just<00:00:33.410> really<00:00:33.890> cool<00:00:34.070> in

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
but this figured is just really cool in

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.990 
but this figured is just really cool in
my<00:00:34.280> opinion

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
my opinion

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.229 
my opinion

he stands 9 inches tall and of course

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:39.760 
he stands 9 inches tall and of course
you<00:00:38.480> can<00:00:38.629> make<00:00:38.750> him<00:00:38.989> either<00:00:39.170> taller<00:00:39.500> or

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
you can make him either taller or

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.680 
you can make him either taller or
shorter<00:00:39.800> with<00:00:40.430> those<00:00:40.640> reversed<00:00:41.090> jointed<00:00:41.510> legs

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
you can get them relatively tall if you

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.439 
you can get them relatively tall if you
want<00:00:45.110> to<00:00:45.370> straighten<00:00:46.370> them<00:00:46.489> out<00:00:46.579> or<00:00:46.910> you<00:00:47.300> can

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
it's not the traditional onslaught that

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.720 
it's not the traditional onslaught that
looks<00:01:09.080> more<00:01:09.380> like<00:01:09.560> a<00:01:09.590> guy<00:01:09.800> in<00:01:09.980> a<00:01:10.070> suit<00:01:10.220> of<00:01:10.340> armor

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
looks more like a guy in a suit of armor

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.180 
looks more like a guy in a suit of armor
it's<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.510> more<00:01:11.750> kind<00:01:12.080> of<00:01:12.200> like<00:01:12.380> bug<00:01:12.920> like

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
it's the more kind of like bug like

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.310 
it's the more kind of like bug like
beetle<00:01:13.550> looking<00:01:13.880> kind<00:01:14.150> but<00:01:14.780> I<00:01:14.810> still<00:01:15.050> think

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
beetle looking kind but I still think

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.260 
beetle looking kind but I still think
it's<00:01:15.440> really<00:01:15.680> cool<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.250> sculpt<00:01:16.550> is<00:01:16.700> great<00:01:17.000> the

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
it's really cool the sculpt is great the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.570 
it's really cool the sculpt is great the
paintwork<00:01:17.570> is<00:01:17.870> great<00:01:18.140> it's<00:01:18.800> the<00:01:19.010> whole<00:01:19.190> body's

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
paintwork is great it's the whole body's

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.690 
paintwork is great it's the whole body's
textured<00:01:20.150> kind<00:01:20.750> of<00:01:20.930> it's<00:01:21.440> not<00:01:21.620> smooth<00:01:22.070> plastic

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
textured kind of it's not smooth plastic

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.870 
textured kind of it's not smooth plastic
so<00:01:23.090> that's<00:01:23.240> really<00:01:23.450> cool<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:25.610> head<00:01:25.760> is

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
so that's really cool the head is

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.940 
so that's really cool the head is
articulated<00:01:26.600> in<00:01:26.720> there<00:01:26.900> on<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:27.050> ball<00:01:27.350> joint<00:01:27.380> and

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
articulated in there on a ball joint and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.300 
articulated in there on a ball joint and
so<00:01:28.250> it<00:01:28.580> also<00:01:28.730> has<00:01:28.970> a<00:01:29.030> 360<00:01:29.720> you<00:01:30.650> can<00:01:30.710> raise<00:01:31.100> it<00:01:31.250> up

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
so it also has a 360 you can raise it up

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.800 
so it also has a 360 you can raise it up
and<00:01:31.460> down<00:01:31.580> just<00:01:31.760> a<00:01:31.880> little<00:01:31.910> bit<00:01:32.210> but<00:01:32.600> that's

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
and down just a little bit but that's

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.840 
and down just a little bit but that's
enough<00:01:33.050> for<00:01:33.200> me<00:01:33.260> the<00:01:33.470> way<00:01:33.590> sculpted<00:01:34.580> it's<00:01:34.700> just

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
enough for me the way sculpted it's just

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.910 
enough for me the way sculpted it's just
really<00:01:35.030> cool<00:01:35.300> I<00:01:35.330> like<00:01:35.570> that<00:01:35.750> a<00:01:35.870> lot<00:01:35.960> he<00:01:36.740> does

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
really cool I like that a lot he does

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.430 
really cool I like that a lot he does
have<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.400> ab<00:01:37.820> crunch<00:01:37.850> torso<00:01:38.660> articulation

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440

we'll<00:01:40.340> talk<00:01:40.550> about<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.880> arm<00:01:41.030> falling<00:01:41.300> off<00:01:41.540> in

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
we'll talk about the arm falling off in

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.010 
we'll talk about the arm falling off in
a<00:01:41.750> second<00:01:42.490> it<00:01:43.490> is<00:01:43.730> kind<00:01:44.090> of<00:01:44.210> an<00:01:44.330> ugly<00:01:44.450> joint<00:01:44.840> but

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
a second it is kind of an ugly joint but

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.510 
a second it is kind of an ugly joint but
at<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.200> same<00:01:45.380> time<00:01:45.620> it's<00:01:45.770> also<00:01:45.920> kind<00:01:46.370> of

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
at the same time it's also kind of

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.400 
at the same time it's also kind of
hidden<00:01:46.730> really<00:01:47.300> well<00:01:47.480> at<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.720> same<00:01:47.900> time

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
hidden really well at the same time

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.310 
hidden really well at the same time
which<00:01:48.980> I<00:01:49.100> just<00:01:49.280> said<00:01:49.460> twice<00:01:49.700> but<00:01:50.420> it<00:01:50.780> ranches

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
which I just said twice but it ranches

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.290 
which I just said twice but it ranches
it<00:01:51.440> ratchets<00:01:51.800> Jesus<00:01:52.730> I<00:01:52.760> can't<00:01:52.880> talk<00:01:53.150> it

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.290 
it ratchets Jesus I can't talk it
ratcheted<00:01:53.750> as<00:01:53.840> visited<00:01:54.290> it<00:01:54.800> ratchets<00:01:55.300> like

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
ratcheted as visited it ratchets like

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.990 
ratcheted as visited it ratchets like
that<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:57.230> it's<00:01:57.440> really<00:01:57.830> nice<00:01:58.070> joint<00:01:58.340> nice

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
that so it's really nice joint nice

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.300 
that so it's really nice joint nice
range<00:01:59.360> of<00:01:59.510> motion<00:01:59.570> look<00:01:59.990> pretty<00:02:00.230> far<00:02:00.440> down<00:02:00.650> and

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
range of motion look pretty far down and

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.450 
range of motion look pretty far down and
you<00:02:02.210> can<00:02:02.330> fold<00:02:02.570> this<00:02:02.810> thing<00:02:02.870> down<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.680> this

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
you can fold this thing down to this

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.510 
you can fold this thing down to this
back<00:02:04.790> part<00:02:05.090> of<00:02:05.180> this<00:02:05.270> shell<00:02:05.890> it's<00:02:06.890> got<00:02:07.010> a<00:02:07.040> pivot

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
back part of this shell it's got a pivot

or a hinge in there so you can kind of
do<00:02:10.310> with<00:02:10.520> it<00:02:10.640> what<00:02:10.789> you<00:02:10.880> need<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.270> for<00:02:11.630> the

range of motion in there and one thing I

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.500 
range of motion in there and one thing I
need<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.460> mention<00:02:25.580> I<00:02:26.000> don't<00:02:26.060> know<00:02:26.180> if<00:02:26.270> this<00:02:26.390> is

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
need to mention I don't know if this is

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.570 
need to mention I don't know if this is
a<00:02:26.540> common<00:02:26.990> problem<00:02:27.170> but<00:02:27.470> mine<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:28.160> left<00:02:28.370> arm

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
a common problem but mine the left arm

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.440 
a common problem but mine the left arm
comes<00:02:28.760> off<00:02:29.030> pretty<00:02:29.270> easily<00:02:29.540> as<00:02:30.020> you<00:02:30.410> saw<00:02:31.450> it's

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
comes off pretty easily as you saw it's

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.300 
comes off pretty easily as you saw it's
not<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.840> problem<00:02:33.200> enough<00:02:33.770> to<00:02:33.920> where<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.070> wouldn't

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
not a problem enough to where I wouldn't

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.220 
not a problem enough to where I wouldn't
want<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.460> get<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.670> figure<00:02:34.970> but<00:02:35.210> it<00:02:36.080> is

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
want to get the figure but it is

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.450 
want to get the figure but it is
something<00:02:36.440> worth<00:02:36.680> mentioning

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
something worth mentioning

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.400 
something worth mentioning
he's<00:02:37.910> got<00:02:38.120> single<00:02:38.480> jointed<00:02:38.750> elbows<00:02:38.900> but

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
he's got single jointed elbows but

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.050 
he's got single jointed elbows but
you've<00:02:39.530> got<00:02:39.680> just<00:02:39.950> over<00:02:40.130> 90<00:02:40.550> degrees<00:02:40.850> of

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
you've got just over 90 degrees of

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.630 
you've got just over 90 degrees of
movement<00:02:41.510> there<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:42.770> I<00:02:42.800> think<00:02:43.130> that's<00:02:43.400> fine

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
movement there so I think that's fine

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.060 
movement there so I think that's fine
we'll<00:02:43.940> just<00:02:44.120> leave<00:02:44.210> that<00:02:44.270> off<00:02:44.540> for<00:02:44.720> now<00:02:45.070> it

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
we'll just leave that off for now it

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.460 
we'll just leave that off for now it
does<00:02:46.280> have<00:02:46.490> a<00:02:46.730> pivot<00:02:47.180> or<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.570> swivel<00:02:48.020> inside

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
does have a pivot or a swivel inside

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.199 
does have a pivot or a swivel inside
there<00:02:48.770> it's<00:02:49.190> really<00:02:49.520> tight<00:02:49.820> though<00:02:49.970> this<00:02:50.120> is

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
there it's really tight though this is

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.580 
there it's really tight though this is
one<00:02:50.330> of<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.480> older<00:02:50.750> ones<00:02:50.870> so<00:02:51.080> he's<00:02:51.410> probably

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
one of the older ones so he's probably

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.260 
one of the older ones so he's probably
gonna<00:02:51.860> get<00:02:52.040> sticky<00:02:52.400> joints<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.790> while<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:53.060> lot

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
gonna get sticky joints a while a lot

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.930 
gonna get sticky joints a while a lot
plus<00:02:54.020> it's<00:02:54.350> a<00:02:54.500> more<00:02:54.860> of<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:55.010> finely<00:02:55.490> plastic

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
plus it's a more of a finely plastic

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.060 
plus it's a more of a finely plastic
than<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.090> hard<00:02:56.360> plastic<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:57.680> tends<00:02:57.980> to

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
than a hard plastic so that tends to

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.530 
than a hard plastic so that tends to
happen<00:02:58.520> he<00:02:59.090> has<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.890> wrist<00:03:00.890> rotation<00:03:01.480> not<00:03:02.480> a

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
happen he has a wrist rotation not a

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.760 
happen he has a wrist rotation not a
whole<00:03:02.780> lot<00:03:03.020> of<00:03:03.050> movement<00:03:03.290> there<00:03:03.500> but<00:03:03.650> it's

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
whole lot of movement there but it's

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
whole lot of movement there but it's
there<00:03:03.950> or<00:03:04.130> his<00:03:04.580> pivot<00:03:05.620> thumb<00:03:06.620> pivot<00:03:07.190> little

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
there or his pivot thumb pivot little

you're a Marvel Legends collector let's

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.180 
you're a Marvel Legends collector let's
stop<00:03:47.660> trying<00:03:47.900> to<00:03:48.110> settle<00:03:48.470> for<00:03:48.500> whatever<00:03:48.920> we

get and try to get some more really cool
figures<00:03:51.200> let's<00:03:52.190> get<00:03:52.370> back<00:03:52.519> to<00:03:52.610> the<00:03:52.700> figure<00:03:52.940> and

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
figures let's get back to the figure and

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.780 
figures let's get back to the figure and
I'll<00:03:53.180> stop<00:03:53.420> ranting<00:03:54.040> he<00:03:55.040> does<00:03:55.250> not<00:03:55.459> have<00:03:55.730> a

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
I'll stop ranting he does not have a

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.910 
I'll stop ranting he does not have a
waist<00:03:56.180> swivel<00:03:56.720> because<00:03:57.230> of<00:03:57.350> the<00:03:57.440> sculpt<00:03:57.799> and

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
waist swivel because of the sculpt and

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.080 
waist swivel because of the sculpt and
everything<00:03:58.250> it<00:03:58.370> just<00:03:58.519> doesn't<00:03:58.790> fit<00:03:58.940> the

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
everything it just doesn't fit the

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.539 
everything it just doesn't fit the
character<00:03:59.540> to<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.810> figure<00:04:00.140> but<00:04:00.920> I'm<00:04:01.340> gonna

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
character to the figure but I'm gonna

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.070 
character to the figure but I'm gonna
let<00:04:01.700> it<00:04:01.730> slide<00:04:01.820> this<00:04:02.090> time<00:04:02.330> because<00:04:02.900> it's

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
let it slide this time because it's

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.770 
let it slide this time because it's
simply<00:04:03.410> just<00:04:03.440> a<00:04:03.709> function<00:04:04.160> over<00:04:04.489> form<00:04:04.970> form

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
simply just a function over form form

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.750 
simply just a function over form form
over<00:04:06.019> function<00:04:06.310> functional<00:04:07.310> reform<00:04:07.640> I<00:04:07.730> think

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
over function functional reform I think

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.030 
over function functional reform I think
fits<00:04:08.180> it<00:04:09.080> just<00:04:09.260> doesn't<00:04:09.530> work<00:04:09.620> with<00:04:09.860> that

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
fits it just doesn't work with that

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.960 
fits it just doesn't work with that
sculpt<00:04:10.610> unfortunately<00:04:11.390> he's<00:04:12.049> got<00:04:12.970> standard

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
sculpt unfortunately he's got standard

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.400 
sculpt unfortunately he's got standard
hip<00:04:14.120> joints<00:04:14.650> which<00:04:15.650> are<00:04:16.419> I<00:04:17.419> don't<00:04:18.080> remember<00:04:18.200> if

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
hip joints which are I don't remember if

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.110 
hip joints which are I don't remember if
they're<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:18.560> Y<00:04:18.799> or<00:04:19.010> a<00:04:19.040> t<00:04:19.280> they're<00:04:19.609> so<00:04:19.790> stiff

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
they're a Y or a t they're so stiff

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.630 
they're a Y or a t they're so stiff
right<00:04:20.330> now<00:04:20.620> I'm<00:04:21.620> pretty<00:04:21.799> sure<00:04:22.010> it's<00:04:22.160> a<00:04:22.220> T<00:04:22.400> joint

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
right now I'm pretty sure it's a T joint

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.060 
right now I'm pretty sure it's a T joint
in<00:04:22.910> there

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
in there

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.240 
in there
yeah<00:04:25.490> it's<00:04:25.820> almost<00:04:26.450> exceeds<00:04:27.110> leaning<00:04:27.980> towards

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
yeah it's almost exceeds leaning towards

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.560 
yeah it's almost exceeds leaning towards
the<00:04:28.340> Y<00:04:28.490> but<00:04:28.700> it's<00:04:28.820> really<00:04:28.940> close<00:04:29.090> to<00:04:29.300> being<00:04:29.510> a

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
the Y but it's really close to being a

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.260 
the Y but it's really close to being a
tea<00:04:29.720> so<00:04:30.050> yeah<00:04:30.950> you<00:04:31.490> should<00:04:31.670> be<00:04:31.760> fine<00:04:32.000> with<00:04:32.030> it

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
tea so yeah you should be fine with it

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.150 
tea so yeah you should be fine with it
it<00:04:32.480> works<00:04:32.690> just<00:04:32.840> like<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:33.050> tea<00:04:33.290> joint<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:33.770> theis

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
it works just like a tea joint the theis

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.670 
it works just like a tea joint the theis
level<00:04:34.610> is<00:04:34.760> right<00:04:35.060> there<00:04:35.330> it's<00:04:36.110> got<00:04:36.320> a<00:04:36.350> neat

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
level is right there it's got a neat

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.480 
level is right there it's got a neat
articulation<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:38.210> a<00:04:39.110> knee<00:04:39.260> pad<00:04:39.560> so<00:04:40.340> it's

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
articulation and a knee pad so it's

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.490 
articulation and a knee pad so it's
single<00:04:40.970> jointed<00:04:41.210> knee<00:04:41.420> which<00:04:41.990> actually<00:04:42.380> goes

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
single jointed knee which actually goes

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.170 
single jointed knee which actually goes
more<00:04:42.740> than<00:04:42.890> 90<00:04:43.280> it<00:04:43.580> doesn't<00:04:43.820> go<00:04:43.880> all<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.150> way

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
more than 90 it doesn't go all the way

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.990 
more than 90 it doesn't go all the way
out<00:04:44.470> but<00:04:45.470> it<00:04:45.980> goes<00:04:46.160> more<00:04:46.310> than<00:04:46.460> 90<00:04:46.670> this<00:04:46.820> way

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
out but it goes more than 90 this way

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.480 
out but it goes more than 90 this way
the<00:04:47.510> knee<00:04:47.690> pad<00:04:47.930> has<00:04:48.170> its<00:04:48.350> own<00:04:48.530> articulation

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
the knee pad has its own articulation

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.670 
the knee pad has its own articulation
which<00:04:50.090> is<00:04:50.270> also<00:04:50.450> sculpted<00:04:51.020> really<00:04:51.290> well<00:04:51.440> and

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
which is also sculpted really well and

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.210 
which is also sculpted really well and
then<00:04:52.220> it<00:04:52.340> has<00:04:52.550> a<00:04:52.970> second<00:04:53.600> knee<00:04:53.750> joint<00:04:54.220> which

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
then it has a second knee joint which

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.460 
then it has a second knee joint which
has<00:04:55.490> that<00:04:55.790> range<00:04:56.000> of<00:04:56.180> motion<00:04:56.240> almost<00:04:56.840> a<00:04:57.230> full

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
has that range of motion almost a full

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.620 
has that range of motion almost a full
90<00:04:58.010> degrees<00:04:58.430> well<00:04:58.670> over<00:04:58.910> 90<00:04:59.270> but<00:04:59.420> then<00:04:59.540> it

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
90 degrees well over 90 but then it

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.080 
90 degrees well over 90 but then it
doesn't<00:04:59.750> go<00:04:59.900> completely<00:05:00.050> straight<00:05:00.940> then<00:05:01.940> we

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
doesn't go completely straight then we

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.480 
doesn't go completely straight then we
have<00:05:02.240> the<00:05:02.390> foot<00:05:02.630> articulation<00:05:03.410> which<00:05:04.070> it's

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
have the foot articulation which it's

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.220 
have the foot articulation which it's
kind<00:05:04.730> of<00:05:04.760> like<00:05:04.910> a<00:05:04.940> McFarland<00:05:05.570> halo<00:05:05.900> figure

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
kind of like a McFarland halo figure

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.840 
kind of like a McFarland halo figure
where<00:05:06.440> it<00:05:06.560> swivels<00:05:06.950> at<00:05:07.100> the<00:05:07.190> top<00:05:07.400> of<00:05:07.580> the<00:05:07.670> ball

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
where it swivels at the top of the ball

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.730 
where it swivels at the top of the ball
joint<00:05:08.030> and<00:05:08.330> at<00:05:08.900> the<00:05:09.020> bottom<00:05:09.350> of<00:05:09.440> the<00:05:09.530> ball

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
joint and at the bottom of the ball

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.190 
joint and at the bottom of the ball
joint<00:05:09.950> and<00:05:10.250> then<00:05:10.790> it<00:05:10.880> has<00:05:11.060> the<00:05:11.300> similar<00:05:11.900> to<00:05:12.110> the

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
joint and then it has the similar to the

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.260 
joint and then it has the similar to the
shoulder<00:05:12.590> articulation<00:05:13.280> so<00:05:13.460> you<00:05:13.520> can<00:05:13.730> rotate

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
shoulder articulation so you can rotate

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.630 
shoulder articulation so you can rotate
it<00:05:14.570> however<00:05:14.870> you<00:05:15.080> want<00:05:15.260> and<00:05:15.740> you<00:05:16.310> can<00:05:16.340> position

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
it however you want and you can position

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.850 
it however you want and you can position
the<00:05:17.000> feet<00:05:17.210> however<00:05:17.630> you<00:05:17.810> want<00:05:18.050> so<00:05:18.620> that<00:05:18.770> you

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
the feet however you want so that you

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.740 
the feet however you want so that you
can<00:05:19.040> really<00:05:19.250> put<00:05:19.490> them<00:05:19.610> in<00:05:19.700> some<00:05:19.880> crazy<00:05:20.090> poses

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
can really put them in some crazy poses

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.070 
can really put them in some crazy poses
and<00:05:21.020> get<00:05:21.140> the<00:05:21.260> feet<00:05:21.500> to<00:05:22.100> be<00:05:22.250> perfectly<00:05:22.670> flat

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
and get the feet to be perfectly flat

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.860 
and get the feet to be perfectly flat
which<00:05:24.080> i<00:05:24.290> think<00:05:24.350> is<00:05:24.950> absolutely<00:05:25.610> awesome<00:05:26.510> it's

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
which i think is absolutely awesome it's

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.240 
which i think is absolutely awesome it's
better<00:05:27.050> than<00:05:27.230> an<00:05:27.350> ankle<00:05:27.680> rocker
