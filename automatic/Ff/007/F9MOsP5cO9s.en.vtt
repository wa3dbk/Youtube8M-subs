00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello friends today I will teach you in what 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.440
 consists of cycling the aquarium and how 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.480
 do it most people 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.849
 novices commit this error by not 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.250
 consult information and only assemble their 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.890
 aquarium and they put their fish without realizing 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.430
 the cycle this is a big mistake because 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.500
 the fish will die by poisoning the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.900
 cic side consists of letting the water 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.849
 have its maturation process so that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.279
 the formation of bacteria is carried out 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.109
 beneficial in our aquarium these 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.390
 help control ammonia and 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.750
 nitrite that is produced by waste 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.879
 of the fish the cycle begins when 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.489
 we filled the aquarium for the first time and 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.620
 it takes about a month depending 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.809
 the size of the aquarium during the process 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.149
 of maturation it is not advisable to have 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.430
 no fish in the aquarium because during 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.289
 this ammonia levels rise and the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.170
 fish that are inside the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.690
 aquarium die only need to put 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.120
 food for fish flakes pellets 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.460
 any food that decomposes and 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.769
 generate food for the bacteria and if 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.450
 there is not this food the bacteria do not 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.869
 they will reproduce and the cycle 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.969
 it will not help at all it is very simple this 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.130
 only process is to leave the aquarium without 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:15.509
 no fish and place food every 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.820
 third day for a month 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.179
 approximately so that the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.549
 bacteria and reproduce follows these 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:27.060
 simple steps for you to succeed 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.659
 with the cycle of your aquarium step 1 arm 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.590
 decorate and fill with water the step aquarium 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.179
 2 put heating filters to work 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.630
 lighting and any other device that 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:42.179
 place in the aquarium step 3 place 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.429
 a little bit of food as if there 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.530
 two or three fish inside the aquarium and 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:50.429
 every third day while the process lasts 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.590
 of cycled step 4 have patience and not 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.979
 place fish until it does not go through 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.560
 minus one month step 5 if you can 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.030
 measures the water levels once a 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.189
 week 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.770
 step 6 once past the time the 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.899
 water levels will be normal if it is 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.710
 possible measures the water levels for 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.410
 avoid problems 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.530
 step 7 you can start to put your 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.930
 fish inside the aquarium if you keep 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.000
 properly these steps you will not have 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.890
 problems in your aquarium will improve the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.700
 quality of life of your fish and your 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.410
 aquarium will look with more crystalline water 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.890
 I hope you serve this little video 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:33.990
 greetings, take care, subscribe.
