00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.869
 three times 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.220

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.189
 way 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.530

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.860
 against them 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.150
 and an agreement in addition 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.070

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.510
 the clarity of the explanations of this video 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.710
 thirsty big part 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.119

 duchamp goals but please 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.660
 the position of agreement 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.320
 and then 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.990
 Switzerland is already receiving a bide 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.110
 so I start 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.270
 the first verse 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.270
 e after four missions 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:12.999
 serge 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:17.139
 why am I 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:20.139
 that is to say 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:22.899
 rens 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:24.539
 mayor 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:27.539
 since gold 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.529
 no 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:40.239
 harp 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.649
 nobody 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:43.579
 my country 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.579
 it will not be 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.309
 % 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:55.309
 on this point 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.659
 % 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:20.359
 and in attack this the the following one 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:24.529
 so release the chords 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.019
 for the moment his rank the lyrics 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.089
 so 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:31.110
 first site for France 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.300
 his first verse of the war his role 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:39.349
 the first two lines the chords are the same 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:42.859
 in german swiss 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:43.999
 On the other hand 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.999
 for the chorus both 

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:50.669

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.029
 e pass the ancient 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:57.029
 the first verse for them the first phase 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:59.120
 c sole 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.120
 the islands 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.729
 So here I have you 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:08.059
 by tapping the agreement once 

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:09.979
 I will take care to place 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.729
 when to wear it 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:16.150
 while sole 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.479
 m 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.349
 m 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.629
 m 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:27.659
 the 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:31.120
 she 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.139
 it 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.099
 some water 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.099
 so 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.229
 % go 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.110
 an engine 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.490
 so 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.960
 otherwise 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.960
 m 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:57.939
 1 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:01.689
 13 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:05.339
 see 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.610
 even 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.360
 the 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.039
 e 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:27.689
 m 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:29.949
 he turns 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:31.279
 m 

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:34.279
 so these six points 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:39.779
 but beware come back police council 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:45.080
 his two ears and the sequence of taxes so the principle in 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:52.010
 m main agree it's without the criminal our soil with Nigerian 2 

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:54.539
 poor workers 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:57.319
 then you take your time for well placed 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:59.869
 cornelia 

00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:02.869
 Cecile the system goes out quickly 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.619
 the 

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:11.150
 the world 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.150
 % 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.990
 dre 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.759
 the 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:22.150
 m 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.059
 % 

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:28.059
 small 

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:34.199
 So 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.379
 I repeat 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:39.379
 the first two sentences of the chords are killed in cicc 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:43.509
 the 3rd 4th spaziale changes all the time change 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:46.529
 a little rhythm 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:49.549
 the fourth is what here second sentence 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:53.120
 11 26 the small screen sound 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.419
 and 7 and 8 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:55.220
 only 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.220
 these are the sentences for each other 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:02.669
 2 for the rest 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:05.210
 we will have to watch the second video 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.289
 so 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:09.559
 I invite you 

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:11.829
 but we will immediately wake up
