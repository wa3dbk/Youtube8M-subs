00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
off actually first is just to draw the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.380 
off actually first is just to draw the
face<00:00:16.560> um<00:00:16.859> I'm<00:00:17.430> actually<00:00:17.550> not<00:00:17.850> good<00:00:18.090> at<00:00:18.210> drawing

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
that and and out of it I I draw I had

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.189 
that and and out of it I I draw I had
painted<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:28.199> base<00:00:28.619> color<00:00:29.010> only<00:00:29.720> so<00:00:30.720> like<00:00:30.929> play

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
painted the base color only so like play

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.799 
painted the base color only so like play
around<00:00:31.230> quite<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> lot<00:00:31.890> with<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.600> the<00:00:33.600> base

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
around quite a lot with the the base

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.860 
around quite a lot with the the base
color<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.380> add<00:00:34.800> some<00:00:35.100> light<00:00:35.730> needed<00:00:36.000> to

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
color and add some light needed to

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.290 
color and add some light needed to
basically<00:00:37.440> mini<00:00:37.890> color<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.340> has<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.700> be<00:00:38.850> really

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
basically mini color it has to be really

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.040 
basically mini color it has to be really
really<00:00:39.680> right<00:00:41.570> for<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.719> one<00:00:44.600> this<00:00:45.600> hobo<00:00:45.809> is

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
really right for this one this hobo is

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.569 
really right for this one this hobo is
actually<00:00:46.350> about<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.710> 1<00:00:47.039> 1<00:00:47.660> hour<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.050> half<00:00:49.579> to

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
actually about a 1 1 hour and a half to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.639 
actually about a 1 1 hour and a half to
around<00:00:50.969> 1<00:00:51.120> 1<00:00:51.300> 1<00:00:51.840> hour<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.230> half

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
around 1 1 1 hour and a half

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.180 
around 1 1 1 hour and a half
not<00:00:52.860> not<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.129> long<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:54.770> think<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.829> problem

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
not not that long I think the problem

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.119 
not not that long I think the problem
will<00:00:56.309> be<00:00:56.340> with<00:00:57.230> reflection<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.350> your<00:00:58.469> eyes<00:00:58.770> as

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
will be with reflection on your eyes as

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.299 
will be with reflection on your eyes as
well<00:00:59.699> as<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.899> web<00:01:01.109> lines<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.070> would

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
well as the the web lines that I would

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.580 
well as the the web lines that I would
draw<00:01:02.489> letter<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.750> body

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.770 

so<00:01:08.470> so<00:01:09.470> yeah<00:01:09.710> I'm<00:01:09.799> gonna<00:01:10.009> start<00:01:10.310> with<00:01:10.520> a

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
so so yeah I'm gonna start with a

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.139 
so so yeah I'm gonna start with a
reflection<00:01:11.780> on<00:01:12.079> the<00:01:12.170> eyes<00:01:12.850> right<00:01:13.850> now

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
reflection on the eyes right now

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.770 
reflection on the eyes right now
yeah<00:01:14.450> yes<00:01:15.549> it<00:01:16.549> has<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:16.850> be<00:01:16.970> really<00:01:17.270> correct<00:01:17.659> you

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
yeah yes it has to be really correct you

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.190 
yeah yes it has to be really correct you
can<00:01:17.960> it

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
can it

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.749 
can it
if<00:01:18.289> you<00:01:18.500> look<00:01:18.680> around<00:01:18.829> so<00:01:19.189> you<00:01:19.490> get<00:01:19.610> the

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
if you look around so you get the

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.480 
if you look around so you get the
reflection<00:01:20.149> is<00:01:20.539> actually<00:01:20.810> curved<00:01:21.490> according

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
reflection is actually curved according

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.060 
reflection is actually curved according
to<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:23.479> eyes<00:01:23.720> that<00:01:23.750> because<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:24.320> eyes<00:01:24.530> is<00:01:24.770> is

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
to the eyes that because the eyes is is

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.660 
to the eyes that because the eyes is is
curved

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
curved

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.850 
curved
these<00:01:25.880> are<00:01:26.060> actually<00:01:26.539> new<00:01:26.810> eyes<00:01:27.140> that<00:01:27.500> spider

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
these are actually new eyes that spider

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.770 
these are actually new eyes that spider
my<00:01:28.039> god<00:01:28.310> oh<00:01:29.590> it's<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.799> new<00:01:31.070> movie<00:01:31.720> it's<00:01:32.720> just

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
my god oh it's a new movie it's just

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.580

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
that the things coming out as I'm done

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.070 
that the things coming out as I'm done
with<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.799> eyes<00:01:37.119> now<00:01:38.119> move<00:01:38.360> on<00:01:38.539> to<00:01:38.569> therefore

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
with the eyes now move on to therefore

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.649 
with the eyes now move on to therefore
the<00:01:39.140> lines<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:40.009> lines<00:01:40.039> is<00:01:40.429> very<00:01:40.509> difficult<00:01:41.509> I

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
the lines the lines is very difficult I

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.710 
the lines the lines is very difficult I
would<00:01:41.750> say<00:01:42.020> you<00:01:42.229> have<00:01:42.259> to<00:01:42.830> really<00:01:43.100> enjoy<00:01:43.720> right

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
would say you have to really enjoy right

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.380 
would say you have to really enjoy right
no<00:01:44.990> you<00:01:45.170> cannot<00:01:45.409> just<00:01:45.729> just<00:01:46.729> draw<00:01:46.970> a<00:01:47.000> straight

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
no you cannot just just draw a straight

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.999 
no you cannot just just draw a straight
line<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:47.810> already<00:01:47.990> has<00:01:48.140> to<00:01:48.259> curve<00:01:48.560> according

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
line and already has to curve according

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.730 
line and already has to curve according
to<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.429> body<00:01:49.670> because<00:01:50.149> let's<00:01:51.020> know<00:01:51.229> that<00:01:51.409> the

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
to the body because let's know that the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.679 
to the body because let's know that the
costume<00:01:52.310> that<00:01:52.459> spider-man<00:01:52.849> where<00:01:53.479> it's

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
costume that spider-man where it's

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.080 
costume that spider-man where it's
actually<00:01:53.810> a<00:01:54.049> spandex<00:01:54.740> so<00:01:55.399> it<00:01:55.549> I<00:01:55.640> can<00:01:55.819> speak<00:01:56.060> to

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
actually a spandex so it I can speak to

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.419 
actually a spandex so it I can speak to
the<00:01:56.209> body<00:01:56.479> so<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.259> lines<00:01:57.500> has<00:01:57.740> a<00:01:57.770> actually

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
the body so the lines has a actually

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.130 
the body so the lines has a actually
curve<00:01:58.929> according<00:01:59.929> to<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:01.280> shape<00:02:02.090> of

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
curve according to the shape of

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.520 
curve according to the shape of
spider-man's<00:02:03.140> body<00:02:04.780> so<00:02:05.780> it<00:02:05.929> has<00:02:06.110> to<00:02:06.259> really

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
spider-man's body so it has to really

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.490 
spider-man's body so it has to really
really<00:02:07.189> look<00:02:08.000> right<00:02:08.479> for<00:02:09.080> example<00:02:09.380> the

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
really look right for example the

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.400 
really look right for example the
shoulder<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.789> line<00:02:11.030> should<00:02:11.359> actually<00:02:11.780> curve

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
shoulder the line should actually curve

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.970 
shoulder the line should actually curve
along<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.850> shoulder<00:02:14.390> as<00:02:14.750> well<00:02:15.709> as<00:02:15.829> other

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
along the shoulder as well as other

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.710 
along the shoulder as well as other
parts<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:18.370> for<00:02:19.370> this<00:02:19.459> one<00:02:19.640> I'm<00:02:19.760> just<00:02:19.790> adding

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
parts so for this one I'm just adding

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.770 
parts so for this one I'm just adding
some<00:02:20.959> lightnings<00:02:21.970> someone<00:02:22.970> pick<00:02:23.299> shadows

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
some lightnings someone pick shadows

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.380 
some lightnings someone pick shadows
until<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.739> line<00:02:25.640> itself

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
until the line itself

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.170 
until the line itself
it<00:02:27.569> looks<00:02:27.810> more<00:02:28.140> off<00:02:28.290> medicine<00:02:28.770> but<00:02:29.520> I<00:02:29.550> didn't

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
it looks more off medicine but I didn't

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.120 
it looks more off medicine but I didn't
really<00:02:30.360> put<00:02:30.630> much<00:02:30.810> attention<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:31.740> just

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
really put much attention to it so just

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:41.600 
really put much attention to it so just
anyhow<00:02:35.130> um<00:02:38.030> that<00:02:39.030> light<00:02:39.360> comes<00:02:39.900> oh<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.610> won't

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
anyhow um that light comes oh it won't

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.290 
anyhow um that light comes oh it won't
really<00:02:41.880> look<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.290> much<00:02:43.530> good<00:02:44.190> anyway

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.190 

so<00:02:48.300> now<00:02:48.709> having<00:02:49.709> more<00:02:50.130> shadows<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.870> more

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
so now having more shadows to a more

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.010 
so now having more shadows to a more
look<00:02:52.470> more<00:02:52.680> contrast<00:02:53.310> as<00:02:54.180> I'm<00:02:54.360> adding<00:02:54.600> some

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
look more contrast as I'm adding some

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.550 
look more contrast as I'm adding some
texture<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:57.770> database<00:02:58.850> costume<00:03:00.320> so<00:03:01.320> it

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
texture to the database costume so it

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.670 
texture to the database costume so it
doesn't<00:03:01.980> look<00:03:02.160> like<00:03:02.400> it's<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.860> CGI<00:03:04.860> anyway<00:03:05.580> and

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
doesn't look like it's a CGI anyway and

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.949 
doesn't look like it's a CGI anyway and
just<00:03:07.680> feel<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.370> it's<00:03:09.030> your<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.420> cloth<00:03:09.690> of

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
just feel that it's your the cloth of

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.000 
just feel that it's your the cloth of
that<00:03:10.550> so<00:03:11.550> it<00:03:11.760> is<00:03:11.910> not<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.450> smooth<00:03:13.230> that's<00:03:13.769> it

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
that so it is not that smooth that's it

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.090 
that so it is not that smooth that's it
that's<00:03:14.700> what<00:03:14.880> I'm<00:03:14.970> done<00:03:15.209> with<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.510> oh<00:03:16.100> I'm

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
that's what I'm done with it oh I'm

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.910 
that's what I'm done with it oh I'm
doing<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.489> background<00:03:17.940> I<00:03:18.120> have<00:03:18.840> it<00:03:19.650> just

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
doing a background I have it just

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.680 
doing a background I have it just
anyhow<00:03:20.160> draw<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.459> because<00:03:20.670> I'm<00:03:21.030> gonna<00:03:21.180> blur<00:03:21.510> it

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
anyhow draw it because I'm gonna blur it

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.280 
anyhow draw it because I'm gonna blur it
anyway<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.620> create<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:23.010> depth<00:03:23.459> of<00:03:23.730> field<00:03:24.720> into

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
anyway to create a depth of field into

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
anyway to create a depth of field into
this<00:03:25.620> picture

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.140 

yeah<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.580> they're<00:03:30.060> more<00:03:30.209> or<00:03:30.300> less<00:03:30.450> ugly

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
yeah and they're more or less ugly

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
having some like a color to the sky

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.170 
having some like a color to the sky
there's<00:03:40.620> some<00:03:40.769> final<00:03:41.130> touch<00:03:41.310> up<00:03:41.519> and<00:03:41.910> yep

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
there's some final touch up and yep
