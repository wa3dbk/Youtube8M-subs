00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
and it's a very intuitive piece of

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:51.829 
and it's a very intuitive piece of
equipment<00:00:49.100> I<00:00:50.210> think<00:00:51.210> they<00:00:51.300> loved<00:00:51.569> the<00:00:51.690> fact

equipment I think they loved the fact

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:53.630 
equipment I think they loved the fact
that<00:00:51.929> they<00:00:52.019> could<00:00:52.289> touch<00:00:52.499> it<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.069> they<00:00:53.519> could

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
that they could touch it and they could

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.369 
that they could touch it and they could
all<00:00:53.819> touch<00:00:54.089> it<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.629> when<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.199> were<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.319> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
all touch it and when you were on the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.779 
all touch it and when you were on the
attract<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.100> they<00:00:56.159> could<00:00:56.309> all<00:00:56.399> play<00:00:56.609> about

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
attract and they could all play about

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.309 
attract and they could all play about
with<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.999> it's<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:57.899> different<00:00:58.079> from

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:58.319 
with it it's just so different from

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:00.200 
with it it's just so different from
anything<00:00:58.499> that<00:00:58.710> they've<00:00:58.800> seen<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.609> then<00:00:59.729> what

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
anything that they've seen and then what

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.910 
anything that they've seen and then what
we<00:01:00.539> thought<00:01:00.749> would<00:01:00.899> happen<00:01:00.929> did<00:01:01.530> happen<00:01:01.559> which

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
we thought would happen did happen which

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.439 
we thought would happen did happen which
is<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.219> accidentally<00:01:02.789> somebody<00:01:03.120> press<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
is that accidentally somebody press the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.450 
is that accidentally somebody press the
menu<00:01:03.690> button<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.650> was<00:01:04.769> great<00:01:05.100> because

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
menu button and that was great because

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.730 
menu button and that was great because
then<00:01:05.610> they<00:01:05.729> got<00:01:05.940> the<00:01:06.090> menu<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.690> realized<00:01:07.500> how

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
then they got the menu and realized how

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
then they got the menu and realized how
how<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.220> works

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
how it works

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.910 
how it works
it's<00:01:08.940> math<00:01:09.210> sequences<00:01:12.439> what's<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.619> simple

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
it's math sequences what's the simple

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.560 
it's math sequences what's the simple
one<00:01:14.070> sector<00:01:14.399> mass<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.790> we're<00:01:14.909> doing<00:01:15.000> here<00:01:15.360> to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
one sector mass that we're doing here to

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.510 
one sector mass that we're doing here to
each<00:01:15.689> number<00:01:16.079> I<00:01:16.200> didn't<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.680> which<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.310> not

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
each number I didn't to which it not

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.219 
each number I didn't to which it not

that would be threatened wouldn't it

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.899 
that would be threatened wouldn't it
with<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.869> surface<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:23.130> children<00:01:23.430> happen<00:01:23.700> to

what<00:01:55.500> we<00:01:55.710> do<00:01:55.859> is<00:01:56.039> it<00:01:56.280> tends<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.609> be<00:01:56.729> more

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
what we do is it tends to be more

control<00:02:05.909> with<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.899> surface<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.439> course<00:02:07.590> we

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:07.859 
control with the surface of course we

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:09.859 
control with the surface of course we
can<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:08.039> multiple<00:02:08.369> children<00:02:09.119> all<00:02:09.509> working

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
can have multiple children all working

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.750 
can have multiple children all working
at<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:09.990> same<00:02:10.050> time<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:11.130> really<00:02:11.370> great<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
at the same time it's really great the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.240 
at the same time it's really great the
children<00:02:12.150> can<00:02:12.780> sit<00:02:13.320> together<00:02:13.470> they<00:02:13.980> can<00:02:14.130> work

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
children can sit together they can work

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.619 
children can sit together they can work
collaborative<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:14.819> think<00:02:14.970> they<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:15.180> discuss

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
collaborative I think they can discuss

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.630 
collaborative I think they can discuss
what's<00:02:16.379> happening<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:17.190> it's<00:02:17.340> helping<00:02:17.580> to

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
what's happening so it's helping to

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.900 
what's happening so it's helping to
improve<00:02:17.940> their<00:02:18.120> talking<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.629> this

skills as well as their ICT skills the
children<00:02:21.970> just<00:02:22.120> basically<00:02:22.450> took<00:02:22.660> over<00:02:22.810> after

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
children just basically took over after

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
a while we were able to stand back and

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.130 
a while we were able to stand back and
the<00:02:25.240> children<00:02:25.570> were<00:02:25.660> just<00:02:25.690> running<00:02:26.050> it

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
the children were just running it

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.690 
the children were just running it
themselves<00:02:26.710> and<00:02:26.890> working<00:02:27.010> together<00:02:27.280> on<00:02:27.670> it

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700

the sentence work in the finger istic s'
worked<00:02:29.890> really<00:02:30.040> well<00:02:30.130> because<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.640> children

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
worked really well because the children

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.370 
worked really well because the children
had<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.090> listen<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.750> help<00:02:31.870> him<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.080> improve

their listening skills they had to

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.030 
their listening skills they had to
listen<00:02:33.850> and<00:02:34.150> then<00:02:34.390> transfer<00:02:35.020> their<00:02:35.620> sentence

were<00:02:40.960> really<00:02:41.200> good<00:02:42.240> Korean<00:02:43.240> where<00:02:43.390> did<00:02:43.540> you

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
were really good Korean where did you

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.030 
were really good Korean where did you
think<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:43.900> was<00:02:43.990> that<00:02:44.140> one<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.470> not<00:02:44.590> this<00:02:44.710> one

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
think it was that one and not this one

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.580 
think it was that one and not this one
because<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:46.000> one's<00:02:46.210> got<00:02:46.390> captain<00:02:46.810> ER<00:02:46.930> so

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
because this one's got captain ER so

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.350 
because this one's got captain ER so
we've<00:02:47.740> got<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.950> ear<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.580> I<00:02:48.850> think<00:02:49.060> think

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
we've got the ear and I think think

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.270 
we've got the ear and I think think
Wessex<00:02:49.720> Maine<00:02:49.960> helps<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.500> teach<00:02:50.650> them<00:02:50.830> would

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
Wessex Maine helps to teach them would

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.910 
Wessex Maine helps to teach them would
be<00:02:51.490> if<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:52.000> could<00:02:52.150> program<00:02:52.360> in<00:02:52.690> what<00:02:53.260> words<00:02:53.710> it

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
be if you could program in what words it

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.380 
be if you could program in what words it
was<00:02:54.040> asking<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.490> children<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.940> spell<00:02:55.180> then

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
was asking the children to spell then

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.850 
was asking the children to spell then
you<00:02:55.510> could<00:02:55.660> consolidate<00:02:56.020> learning<00:02:56.740> on

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
you could consolidate learning on

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.680 
you could consolidate learning on
spelling<00:02:57.550> objectives<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.210> then<00:02:58.300> in<00:02:58.510> the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
spelling objectives and then in the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.780 
spelling objectives and then in the
national<00:02:59.470> strategy<00:02:59.530> so<00:03:00.400> that<00:03:00.550> would<00:03:00.670> be

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
national strategy so that would be

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.380 
national strategy so that would be
really<00:03:01.000> handy<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.740> it's<00:03:02.940> sounding<00:03:03.940> out<00:03:04.090> words

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
really handy and it's sounding out words

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.090 
really handy and it's sounding out words
and<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.990> fact<00:03:05.170> that<00:03:05.230> they<00:03:05.380> can<00:03:05.530> see<00:03:05.770> it<00:03:05.920> as

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
and the fact that they can see it as

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.040 
and the fact that they can see it as
well<00:03:06.130> it<00:03:06.430> builds<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.120> word<00:03:07.270> as<00:03:07.510> they<00:03:07.690> select

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
well it builds the word as they select

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.560 
well it builds the word as they select
the<00:03:08.140> tiles

he's<00:03:10.570> right<00:03:11.410> you<00:03:11.530> need<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:11.770> find<00:03:11.920> a<00:03:11.980> capital<00:03:12.720> if

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
he's right you need to find a capital if

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.060 
he's right you need to find a capital if
you<00:03:13.930> have<00:03:14.080> been<00:03:14.230> in<00:03:14.350> every<00:03:14.560> single<00:03:14.590> classroom

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
you have been in every single classroom

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.820 
you have been in every single classroom
I<00:03:15.520> expect<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.020> best<00:03:17.170> way<00:03:17.350> to<00:03:17.380> use<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:17.740> will

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
I expect the the best way to use it will

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.090 
I expect the the best way to use it will
probably<00:03:17.950> be<00:03:18.550> to<00:03:18.700> have<00:03:18.850> groups<00:03:19.210> on<00:03:19.420> it<00:03:19.740> as<00:03:20.740> kind

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
probably be to have groups on it as kind

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.980 
probably be to have groups on it as kind
of<00:03:21.190> either<00:03:21.520> intervention<00:03:22.300> or<00:03:22.480> as<00:03:22.630> part<00:03:22.810> of

their literacy or numeracy lesson if you

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
had a program that was suited to a

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.100 
had a program that was suited to a
particular<00:03:27.400> aspect<00:03:28.240> of<00:03:28.510> learning<00:03:28.690> that<00:03:29.050> you

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
particular aspect of learning that you

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.750 
particular aspect of learning that you
were<00:03:29.290> covering<00:03:29.590> at<00:03:29.770> that<00:03:29.920> time<00:03:30.160> then<00:03:30.610> you

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
were covering at that time then you

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.940 
were covering at that time then you
could<00:03:30.940> have<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.090> group<00:03:31.270> around<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:31.950> initially

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
could have a group around it initially

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.170 
could have a group around it initially
it<00:03:33.010> might<00:03:33.100> be<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.310> bit<00:03:33.430> distracting<00:03:33.580> to<00:03:34.000> the

it might be a bit distracting to the

it might be a bit distracting to the
rest<00:03:34.330> of<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.450> class<00:03:34.660> but<00:03:34.959> obviously<00:03:35.380> with<00:03:35.530> all

nothing outside the school if I said

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.449 
nothing outside the school if I said

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
that after the normal because in turn

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.740 
that after the normal because in turn
around<00:03:55.819> like<00:03:56.090> maybe<00:03:56.360> normal<00:03:56.989> worker<00:03:57.370> games<00:03:58.370> or

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.770 

any<00:04:02.750> gun<00:04:03.230> oh<00:04:03.819> the<00:04:04.819> drums<00:04:05.030> in<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.269> middle<00:04:05.510> oh

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.280 

they<00:04:14.550> certainly<00:04:15.390> felt<00:04:15.930> that<00:04:16.019> they<00:04:16.230> were

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
they certainly felt that they were

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.770 
they certainly felt that they were
playing<00:04:16.620> as<00:04:17.280> opposed<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.910> learning<00:04:18.450> it<00:04:18.570> didn't

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
playing as opposed to learning it didn't

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.020 
playing as opposed to learning it didn't
seem<00:04:18.930> like<00:04:19.140> hard<00:04:19.410> work<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:20.010> yet<00:04:20.670> when<00:04:20.910> you

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
seem like hard work and yet when you

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.430 
seem like hard work and yet when you
speak<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.329> them<00:04:21.510> at<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.720> end<00:04:21.840> of<00:04:22.140> their

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
speak to them at the end of their

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.170 
speak to them at the end of their
sessions<00:04:22.920> they<00:04:23.190> clearly<00:04:23.550> learnt<00:04:23.820> quite<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.090> lot

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
sessions they clearly learnt quite a lot

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.860 
sessions they clearly learnt quite a lot
I<00:04:24.860> mean<00:04:25.860> we<00:04:25.980> haven't<00:04:26.190> got<00:04:26.400> a<00:04:26.540> very<00:04:27.540> large<00:04:27.660> range

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
I mean we haven't got a very large range

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.170 
I mean we haven't got a very large range
of<00:04:27.990> specimens<00:04:28.350> in<00:04:28.680> in<00:04:29.100> our<00:04:29.310> class

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
of specimens in in our class

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.300 
of specimens in in our class
particularly<00:04:30.660> but<00:04:31.290> there<00:04:31.440> are<00:04:31.590> some<00:04:31.740> you<00:04:32.280> know

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
particularly but there are some you know

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.370 
particularly but there are some you know
ability<00:04:32.940> groups<00:04:33.180> that<00:04:33.450> are<00:04:33.600> quite<00:04:33.840> far<00:04:33.870> apart

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
ability groups that are quite far apart

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.170 
ability groups that are quite far apart
and<00:04:34.590> yet<00:04:34.950> all<00:04:35.190> of<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.460> children<00:04:35.790> want<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.090> play

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
and yet all of the children want to play

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.820 
and yet all of the children want to play
and<00:04:36.450> they<00:04:36.570> want<00:04:36.750> to<00:04:36.810> go<00:04:36.930> on<00:04:37.050> it<00:04:37.170> and<00:04:37.200> I<00:04:37.560> think

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
and they want to go on it and I think

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:48.380 
and they want to go on it and I think
will<00:04:38.070> be<00:04:38.130> quite<00:04:38.250> sad<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:39.090> say<00:04:39.240> go

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390
