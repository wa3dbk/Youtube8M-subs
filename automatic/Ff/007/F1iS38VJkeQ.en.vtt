why are people uncomfortable with it I

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.169 
why are people uncomfortable with it I
think<00:00:59.649> it's<00:00:59.800> because<00:00:59.890> of<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.460> difference<00:01:01.030> in

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
think it's because of the difference in

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.299 
think it's because of the difference in
the<00:01:01.300> storytelling<00:01:01.960> art<00:01:02.289> between<00:01:02.739> a<00:01:02.769> novel
