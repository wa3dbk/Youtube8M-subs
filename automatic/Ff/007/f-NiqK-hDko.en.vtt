 fourth week in a row and no neither 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.800
 the slightest sign that they will soon 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.120
 stop the recent attempt by the police 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.730
 clear streets did not bring results 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.039
 she only strengthened people's resolve 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.779
 will have to go through the protester 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.150
 re-erected barricades which police 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.279

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.019
 even more barricades left 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.490

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.730
 trunk capital 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.579
 but as authorities say undermined 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.770
 the country's economy, the Prime Minister of Ukraine 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.180
 said that because of the ongoing siege 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.160
 government buildings budget for 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.520
 next year has not been adopted today 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.140
 a budget of 14 years is formed therefore 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.289
 the province should be able to 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.440
 work again going back to the topic 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.969
 Maidan 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.340
 euromaidan european integration 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.600

 on the economy is felt and significant 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.059
 distance from Kiev for one of 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.500
 Ukraine's largest plants in a thousand 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.309
 kilometers from Kiev came heavy 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.610
 time 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.950
 then November 27th at the champagne factory 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.140
 license expired 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.570
 export which is necessary annually 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.220
 extend and of course in a timely manner we 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.049
 appealed to the Ministry of Economic 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.409
 development and trade in order to 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.659
 get a license and we are faced with 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.790

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.450
 razdra in this barricaded

 Khreshchatyk and really there was a breakdown 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.759
 shortfall in income 250 euros you 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.270
 understand that this is very substantial 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.549
 the sum 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.100
 and in the global leave we can today 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.380
 say that our Russian partners 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.470
 they do not see stability in us today 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.479
