00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
capsule you guys notice right here the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.529 
capsule you guys notice right here the
gear<00:00:49.500> will<00:00:49.800> be<00:00:49.950> pushing<00:00:50.190> up<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.640> light<00:00:51.210> level

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
gear will be pushing up to light level

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.959 
gear will be pushing up to light level
39<00:00:51.930> which<00:00:52.649> means<00:00:52.949> with<00:00:53.129> maybe<00:00:53.340> one<00:00:53.579> exotic

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
39 which means with maybe one exotic

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.420 
39 which means with maybe one exotic
piece<00:00:54.329> you'll<00:00:54.539> probably<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:55.199> like<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.649> level

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
piece you'll probably be like a level

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.099 
piece you'll probably be like a level
that<00:00:56.610> without<00:00:56.850> an<00:00:57.030> exotic<00:00:57.510> piece<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.809> be<00:00:57.960> at

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
that without an exotic piece to be at

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.099 
that without an exotic piece to be at
like<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.469> light<00:00:58.920> level<00:00:59.280> 33<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.030> then<00:01:00.629> maxing<00:01:01.050> it

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
like a light level 33 and then maxing it

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.049 
like a light level 33 and then maxing it
out<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.500> light<00:01:01.710> level<00:01:02.039> 34<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.760> doesn't

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
out to light level 34 so that doesn't

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.000 
out to light level 34 so that doesn't
seem<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.449> has<00:01:03.570> changed<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.110> fact<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.860> its

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
seem like it has changed in fact to its

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.830 
seem like it has changed in fact to its
total<00:01:05.430> total<00:01:05.729> pneus<00:01:06.000> from<00:01:06.570> what<00:01:06.720> we

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
total total pneus from what we

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.200 
total total pneus from what we
previously<00:01:07.080> known<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.729> new<00:01:08.880> raid<00:01:09.060> would

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
previously known that the new raid would

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.690 
previously known that the new raid would
probably<00:01:09.570> be<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> level<00:01:10.290> 30<00:01:10.500> for<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.310> new<00:01:11.490> light

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
probably be a level 30 for the new light

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.420 
probably be a level 30 for the new light
level<00:01:12.000> cap<00:01:12.600> level<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.979> house<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.310> us

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
level cap level of the the house of us

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.490 
level cap level of the the house of us
will<00:01:14.610> be<00:01:14.640> 34<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.930> doesn't<00:01:16.080> really<00:01:16.290> change

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
will be 34 so that doesn't really change

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.890 
will be 34 so that doesn't really change
much<00:01:16.860> from<00:01:16.920> what<00:01:17.189> we've<00:01:17.369> seen<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:17.729> we<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.720> have
