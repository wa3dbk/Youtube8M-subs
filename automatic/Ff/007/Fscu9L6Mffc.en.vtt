00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
factorial based game type you have as

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.570 
factorial based game type you have as
your<00:00:16.690> campaign<00:00:17.290> you've<00:00:17.710> got<00:00:17.950> your<00:00:18.220> first

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
your campaign you've got your first

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.190 
your campaign you've got your first
steps<00:00:18.820> campaign<00:00:19.240> which<00:00:19.420> will<00:00:19.600> teach<00:00:19.930> you<00:00:20.170> a

steps campaign which will teach you a

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.600 
steps campaign which will teach you a
little<00:00:20.470> bit<00:00:20.680> about<00:00:20.740> the<00:00:20.980> game<00:00:21.160> and<00:00:21.400> then<00:00:21.490> your

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
little bit about the game and then your

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.320 
little bit about the game and then your
new<00:00:21.760> hook<00:00:21.970> which<00:00:22.720> is<00:00:22.960> basically<00:00:23.620> a<00:00:24.330> pretty

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
new hook which is basically a pretty

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.250 
new hook which is basically a pretty
decent<00:00:26.020> play<00:00:26.590> through<00:00:26.860> the<00:00:27.039> game<00:00:27.150> but<00:00:28.260> that's

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
decent play through the game but that's

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.080 
decent play through the game but that's
not<00:00:29.590> where<00:00:29.770> the<00:00:29.920> fun<00:00:30.100> in<00:00:30.220> factorio<00:00:30.699> is<00:00:30.789> the<00:00:30.880> fun

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
not where the fun in factorio is the fun

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.910 
not where the fun in factorio is the fun
in<00:00:31.119> factorial<00:00:31.720> as<00:00:31.930> the<00:00:32.410> new<00:00:33.370> game<00:00:33.610> or<00:00:34.920> custom
