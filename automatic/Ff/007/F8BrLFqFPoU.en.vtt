00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
love it i would recommend it if you have

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.330 
love it i would recommend it if you have
dry<00:01:29.790> skin<00:01:30.180> or<00:01:30.240> dry<00:01:30.420> patches<00:01:30.750> because<00:01:31.340> this

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
dry skin or dry patches because this

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.440 
dry skin or dry patches because this
does<00:01:32.970> tend<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:34.939> like<00:01:35.939> dry<00:01:36.240> up<00:01:36.390> i<00:01:36.540> guess<00:01:38.329> it's<00:01:39.329> a

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
does tend to like dry up i guess it's a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.050 
does tend to like dry up i guess it's a
liquid<00:01:39.600> powder<00:01:40.020> foundation<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.250> when<00:01:41.970> you

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
liquid powder foundation so when you

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.120 
liquid powder foundation so when you
first<00:01:42.299> put<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.170> liquid<00:01:43.470> form<00:01:43.829> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
first put it on it's a liquid form and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.219 
first put it on it's a liquid form and
then<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.460> dries<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> powder<00:01:45.840> finish

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
then it dries it's like a powder finish

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.679 
then it dries it's like a powder finish
so<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.189> would<00:01:47.460> actually<00:01:47.579> not<00:01:48.119> need<00:01:48.420> any

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
so you would actually not need any

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.990 
so you would actually not need any
powder<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.560> set<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:50.040> foundation<00:01:50.700> which<00:01:50.880> is

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
powder to set this foundation which is

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.770 
powder to set this foundation which is
something<00:01:52.460> really<00:01:53.460> good<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.850> know<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.240> it

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
something really good you know and it

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.330 
something really good you know and it
think<00:01:55.049> it'll<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.439> perfect<00:01:55.530> for<00:01:56.070> summer

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
think it'll be perfect for summer

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.249 
think it'll be perfect for summer
because<00:01:56.790> since<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.119> does<00:01:57.299> dry<00:01:57.570> up<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> powder

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
because since it does dry up to a powder

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.719 
because since it does dry up to a powder
finish<00:01:59.899> you<00:02:00.899> won't<00:02:01.049> have<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.350> worry<00:02:01.380> about<00:02:01.729> it

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
finish you won't have to worry about it

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.209 
finish you won't have to worry about it
you<00:02:03.210> know<00:02:03.240> BM<00:02:03.780> i<00:02:04.079> guess<00:02:04.619> just<00:02:04.770> running<00:02:05.130> off

foundation and then I'll go over and
buff<00:03:11.599> it<00:03:11.720> out<00:03:11.870> but<00:03:12.620> with<00:03:12.769> this<00:03:12.950> one<00:03:13.250> since<00:03:13.549> it

buff it out but with this one since it

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.360 
buff it out but with this one since it
it<00:03:14.239> kind<00:03:14.569> of<00:03:14.630> dries<00:03:14.930> pretty<00:03:14.959> fast<00:03:15.650> so<00:03:15.950> I<00:03:16.069> would

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
it kind of dries pretty fast so I would

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.349
