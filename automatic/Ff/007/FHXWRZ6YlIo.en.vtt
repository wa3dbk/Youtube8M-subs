when you hurl the block it'll go that

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.209 
when you hurl the block it'll go that
far<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.240> goes<00:02:03.689> about<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.409> same<00:02:04.619> distance<00:02:05.070> in

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
far it goes about the same distance in

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.059 
far it goes about the same distance in
height<00:02:05.700> maximum<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.409> have<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.829> remember

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
height maximum and you have to remember

height maximum and you have to remember
that<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.489> does<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.879> much<00:02:09.149> damage<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.840> as<00:02:09.989> much

you hold it in your one slot it'll hold

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.690 
you hold it in your one slot it'll hold
it<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.810> block<00:02:16.050> super<00:02:16.500> close<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.190> but

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
it the block super close to you but

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.000 
it the block super close to you but
it'll<00:02:17.850> go<00:02:18.150> faster<00:02:18.840> when<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.290> release<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.680> and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
it'll go faster when you release it and

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.860 
it'll go faster when you release it and
at<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.640> same<00:02:20.820> time<00:02:21.030> if<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.390> hold<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:21.720> in<00:02:21.810> your

at the same time if you hold it in your

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.050 
at the same time if you hold it in your
9<00:02:22.230> slot<00:02:22.620> it'll<00:02:22.950> be<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.160> farthest<00:02:23.760> away<00:02:23.940> from

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
9 slot it'll be the farthest away from

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.030 
9 slot it'll be the farthest away from
you<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.600> it'll<00:02:24.810> go<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.110> little<00:02:25.380> bit<00:02:25.620> slower

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
you and it'll go a little bit slower

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.890 
you and it'll go a little bit slower
when<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.790> release<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.600> will<00:02:27.750> go<00:02:27.870> a

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
when you release it and it will go a

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.110 
when you release it and it will go a
tiny<00:02:28.410> bit<00:02:28.740> farther<00:02:29.160> depending<00:02:29.820> on<00:02:29.910> how<00:02:30.060> you

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
tiny bit farther depending on how you

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.330 
tiny bit farther depending on how you
throw<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.660> then<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.260> will<00:02:31.410> when<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:31.980> hold<00:02:32.160> it

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
throw it then it will when you hold it

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.450 
throw it then it will when you hold it
in<00:02:32.430> your<00:02:32.520> one<00:02:32.850> slot<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:33.450> keep<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.690> in<00:02:33.870> mind

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
in your one slot so keep that in mind

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
in your one slot so keep that in mind
just<00:02:35.460> make<00:02:35.610> sure<00:02:35.640> if<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.000> come<00:02:36.240> across

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
just make sure if you come across

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.510 
just make sure if you come across
somebody<00:02:36.780> randomly<00:02:37.350> don't<00:02:37.680> throw<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.070> block<00:02:38.280> at

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
somebody randomly don't throw a block at

somebody randomly don't throw a block at
them<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.790> hit<00:02:39.000> them<00:02:39.210> when<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.450> could<00:02:39.660> just

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
them to hit them when you could just

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.510

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
ravine or in a tower then it's perfect

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.610 
ravine or in a tower then it's perfect
to<00:02:45.090> try<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:45.390> knock<00:02:45.510> them<00:02:45.600> off<00:02:45.750> also<00:02:46.380> if<00:02:46.470> you're

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
to try and knock them off also if you're

to try and knock them off also if you're
standing<00:02:46.860> at<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.160> base<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.580> tower<00:02:47.820> it

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
standing at the base of the tower it

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.780 
standing at the base of the tower it
won't<00:02:48.600> go<00:02:48.780> all<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.320> way<00:02:49.350> up<00:02:49.620> on<00:02:49.800> most<00:02:50.310> towers

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
won't go all the way up on most towers

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.340 
won't go all the way up on most towers
you'll<00:02:51.000> have<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.330> tower<00:02:51.540> up<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.990> a<00:02:52.020> bit<00:02:52.170> to

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
you'll have to tower up to a bit to

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.350 
you'll have to tower up to a bit to
knock<00:02:52.590> people<00:02:52.620> off<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.310> if<00:02:53.700> someone<00:02:53.940> builds<00:02:54.300> a

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
knock people off and if someone builds a

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.880 
knock people off and if someone builds a
barrier<00:02:54.750> around<00:02:54.870> themselves<00:02:55.200> it'll<00:02:55.620> make<00:02:55.740> it

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
barrier around themselves it'll make it

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.880 
barrier around themselves it'll make it
a<00:02:55.950> bit<00:02:56.220> harder<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.670> take<00:02:57.090> them<00:02:57.300> out<00:02:57.450> all<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.740> all

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
a bit harder to take them out all in all

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.640 
a bit harder to take them out all in all
