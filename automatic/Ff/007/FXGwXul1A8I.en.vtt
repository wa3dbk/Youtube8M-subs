00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.070
 and a new day dawns in minecraft 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.660
 the people I am want to grow too 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.060
 known as the greenwich meridian 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.400
 and I'm here to tell you one thing that 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.009
 is very morona and that I discovered the other 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.680
 day so let's teach him already because 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.640
 I'm going to make a pretty short video 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.309
 it is simply for you to see it and 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.470
 flipeis as I myself have blown and everything 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.520
 the world flip to let's see 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.200
 the thing is this is the cool thing 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.370
 but great I've never done it then 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.370
 I will be the first to do it 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.489
 so you go there we do not do this and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.890
 we collect do 1 2 3 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.430
 you saw then this is what happens guys 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.430
 you see 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.720
 and it's not any way it's a texture fac 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.309
 what he does is what you are seeing 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.350
 right here that the walls are crazy 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.350
 good walls as is the grass too 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.210
 it goes crazy look at the berries good the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.670
 close are some things that do not 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.229
 they go crazy but it's a real 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.970
 madness because it seems to make you dizzy and everything 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.250
 this is good this me this to play in 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.520
 your rival is impossible but look at this 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.520
 line 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.740
 taca taca good, this is what he does 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.830
 I've made the jetpack text a 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.150
 american I saw it in a video of a 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.330
 American and the truth did I do not know 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.740
 much joke and so I say I'm going to record a 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.570
 video to show it because here you have it 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.370
 it's textures so you're going to have it 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.590
 to download 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.870
 it's only good for one good for 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.150
 1.5 snapshot is not valid for 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:52.300
 others because each block comes by 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.300
 separated as you see is crazy 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.880
 the one from europe that is funny but play 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.369
 this in survival would be fine I do not know 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.869
 I even have the idea of putting one as 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.450
 for adventure it would be cool to put something 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.939
 so that all this moves, you know 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.440
 how it is done what I did is a good 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.149
 that you can animate the structure to 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.030
 I do not know if you saw some text and pack 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.920
 with torches that smoke comes out of 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.239
 torches or something like that and that's good 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.250
 easy to do you just have to do 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.290
 as a kind of online animation and 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.300
 then introduce it, change the name 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.280
 and you create this animation is a 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.530
 sequence of 5 frames or something like that 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.930
 it repeats itself constantly then it is 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.360
 doing a circle all the time good 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.430
 Well, what else was I going to tell you? 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.260
 that I would be going to make a rival with 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.200
 this bad with this pack text or what 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.840
 do you think guys 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.930
 firm and it would not be cool to do something like that 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.660
 Well, what else I will discuss a couple 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.670
 of things this video is short because 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.670
 well I wanted to tell you not only and not 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.310
 I wanted to make a very long video 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.840
 Well the only fault is that there are some 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.940
 items look at this for example it works 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.349
 ok but it's a bit shabby but because 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.720
 As you can see, the ovens do not work 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.760
 they work only sideways the chests do not 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.170
 work there are some good ones and you give 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.819
 to the inventory you can see here all the 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.590
 items that move 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.100
 but there are some that we do not admit to 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:13.490
 single grace the rest see why 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.500
 and putting it like this is quiet but 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.940
 now for us and it is moving and 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.910
 it's a bit elegant to make say 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.720
 rest systems would be curious 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.820
 make them like this 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.920
 it hurt my head more assured 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.410
 good water is another fault that water 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.230
 it is not 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.510
 you see it the water does not move 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.980
 it's good it's static 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.230
 migration up here is as always 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.300
 good 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.680
 but neither is the 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.500
 truth is quite original look at a 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.110
 egg here we're going to get in here and nothing 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.450
 I am going to comment that this Friday 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.980
 premiere map so I hope that what 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.629
 download and have the toys to know if 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.370
 is molas is freak to win 2 the second 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:57.110
 part of a game of jumps to do 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.110
 this twice 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.780
 A) Yes 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.840
 and so go jumping like this all followed 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.750
 when you already know how it works and apart 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.549
 of that for the week then you will have a 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.980
 new chapter of sling hunters by 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.620
 end but that is bad because it's going to be 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.239
 focus a little long and nothing this week 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.840
 It will be difficult to upload videos 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.610
 because 'no exams and part of 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.400
 I am going through exams with the 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.500
 map of the week before making a map 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.199
 not only upload videos then I play these 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.590
 that I will not upload many videos this 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.810
 week I do not know to see that what fits like this 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.210
 what 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.980
 nothing guys hope you enjoy 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.290
 these textures download and test them 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.960
 because it's a bit good if you feel like it 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:47.669
 to throw up you know 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:50.030
 and nothing like we always see in as 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.030
 I always say 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.139
 and well, see you in the 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:04.940
 next video of whatever and here I 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.940
 dismissal a greeting wants kripper 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.900
 for
