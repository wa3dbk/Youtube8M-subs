twigs<00:00:40.750> that's<00:00:41.079> all<00:00:41.260> attached<00:00:41.800> already<00:00:42.280> in<00:00:42.610> the

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
twigs that's all attached already in the

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.900 
twigs that's all attached already in the
container<00:00:43.480> so<00:00:44.170> with<00:00:44.410> foam<00:00:44.710> in<00:00:45.070> that<00:00:45.130> and

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.900 
container so with foam in that and
slipped<00:00:46.660> over<00:00:47.079> Thomas<00:00:47.500> vase<00:00:47.800> you<00:00:48.400> actually

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
slipped over Thomas vase you actually

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.540 
slipped over Thomas vase you actually
have<00:00:49.210> that<00:00:49.510> start<00:00:50.050> already<00:00:50.380> without<00:00:51.130> having

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
have that start already without having

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.760 
have that start already without having
to<00:00:51.640> do<00:00:51.790> all<00:00:51.940> that<00:00:52.120> handiwork<00:00:52.570> yourself<00:00:53.110> so

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
to do all that handiwork yourself so

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.700 
to do all that handiwork yourself so
basically<00:00:54.250> what<00:00:54.520> I<00:00:54.550> do<00:00:55.149> now<00:00:55.630> is<00:00:55.660> to<00:00:56.140> design<00:00:56.500> on

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
basically what I do now is to design on

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.950 
basically what I do now is to design on
top<00:00:56.920> of<00:00:57.160> it<00:00:57.280> to<00:00:57.460> give<00:00:57.640> it<00:00:57.790> that<00:00:57.970> sort<00:00:58.300> of<00:00:58.630> a<00:00:58.750> look

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
top of it to give it that sort of a look

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.549 
top of it to give it that sort of a look
and<00:00:59.850> naturally<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:01.270> whole<00:01:01.300> look<00:01:01.809> is<00:01:02.079> sort<00:01:02.500> of

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
and naturally the whole look is sort of

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.209 
and naturally the whole look is sort of
the<00:01:02.680> rounded<00:01:03.190> clustered<00:01:04.119> grouped<00:01:05.219> material

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:06.219 
the rounded clustered grouped material

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:08.969 
the rounded clustered grouped material
and<00:01:06.460> we're<00:01:06.700> working<00:01:07.090> well<00:01:07.479> here<00:01:07.990> in<00:01:08.770> the

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
and we're working well here in the

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.399 
and we're working well here in the
sample<00:01:09.820> that<00:01:09.939> was<00:01:10.060> done<00:01:10.299> ahead<00:01:10.600> of<00:01:10.780> time<00:01:11.140> it

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
sample that was done ahead of time it

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.100 
sample that was done ahead of time it
really<00:01:11.439> is<00:01:11.829> about<00:01:11.979> contrast<00:01:12.729> using<00:01:13.270> black<00:01:13.840> and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
really is about contrast using black and

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.559 
really is about contrast using black and
white<00:01:14.290> opposites<00:01:15.009> and<00:01:15.490> I<00:01:16.000> think<00:01:16.240> that<00:01:16.390> is

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:16.569 
white opposites and I think that is

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:19.199 
white opposites and I think that is
something<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:18.189> look<00:01:18.399> that's<00:01:18.609> becoming<00:01:19.090> very

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:19.209 
something the look that's becoming very

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:21.899 
something the look that's becoming very
very<00:01:19.689> big<00:01:19.959> dealing<00:01:20.950> with<00:01:21.069> colors<00:01:21.490> that<00:01:21.759> are

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
very big dealing with colors that are

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.190 
very big dealing with colors that are
all<00:01:22.270> about<00:01:22.740> opposites<00:01:23.740> and<00:01:24.310> contrast<00:01:24.929> in<00:01:25.929> the

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
all about opposites and contrast in the

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.050 
all about opposites and contrast in the
core<00:01:26.530> home<00:01:26.679> decor<00:01:27.009> and<00:01:27.130> so<00:01:27.369> on<00:01:27.429> so<00:01:27.609> forth<00:01:27.639> you

were showing in all these different
issues<00:02:01.990> that<00:02:02.759> different<00:02:03.759> episodes<00:02:04.209> is<00:02:04.679> that<00:02:05.679> a

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
issues that different episodes is that a

now<00:02:19.640> my<00:02:19.850> vision<00:02:20.210> is<00:02:20.390> something<00:02:20.600> that<00:02:20.870> it's<00:02:21.800> so

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
now my vision is something that it's so

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.490 
now my vision is something that it's so
sad<00:02:22.490> to<00:02:22.520> see<00:02:23.000> that<00:02:23.270> it's<00:02:23.540> been<00:02:23.720> discriminated

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
sad to see that it's been discriminated

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.040 
sad to see that it's been discriminated
on<00:02:24.650> by<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:24.920> forest<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:26.510> know<00:02:26.630> there's<00:02:26.840> a<00:02:26.900> lot

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
on by the forest you know there's a lot

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.830 
on by the forest you know there's a lot
of<00:02:27.080> floors<00:02:27.410> say<00:02:27.620> no<00:02:27.830> carnations<00:02:28.460> no<00:02:28.730> no

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
of floors say no carnations no no

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.700 
of floors say no carnations no no
glads<00:02:30.230> no<00:02:30.650> moms<00:02:30.950> as<00:02:31.520> they're<00:02:31.850> sort<00:02:32.180> of<00:02:32.710> what

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
glads no moms as they're sort of what

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.560 
glads no moms as they're sort of what
they<00:02:33.860> do<00:02:33.920> in<00:02:34.130> their<00:02:34.250> shops<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:34.940> it's<00:02:35.330> such<00:02:35.540> a

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
they do in their shops and it's such a

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.420 
they do in their shops and it's such a
shame<00:02:35.900> because<00:02:35.930> carnations<00:02:36.860> are<00:02:37.040> certainly

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
shame because carnations are certainly

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.120 
shame because carnations are certainly
some<00:02:38.150> of<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.330> most<00:02:38.540> long<00:02:39.230> lasting<00:02:39.260> and

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
some of the most long lasting and

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.330 
some of the most long lasting and
textually<00:02:40.910> most<00:02:41.270> beautiful<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.260> as<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.220> will

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
textually most beautiful and as you will

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.840 
textually most beautiful and as you will
see<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:44.300> contrast<00:02:44.900> of<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:46.040> grouping<00:02:46.670> of

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
see the contrast of that grouping of

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.610 
see the contrast of that grouping of
carnations<00:02:47.210> and<00:02:47.690> grouping<00:02:48.050> of<00:02:48.140> roses<00:02:48.470> how

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
carnations and grouping of roses how

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.210 
carnations and grouping of roses how
distinct<00:02:49.220> they<00:02:49.340> look<00:02:49.580> to<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:49.940> side-by-side

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
distinct they look to the side-by-side

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.280 
distinct they look to the side-by-side
now<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.250> finished<00:02:52.780> designing<00:02:53.780> all<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.170> way

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
now I finished designing all the way

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.620 
now I finished designing all the way
around<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:55.010> that<00:02:55.250> it's<00:02:55.550> a<00:02:55.700> it's<00:02:55.940> a<00:02:56.030> nice<00:02:56.240> tight

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
around so that it's a it's a nice tight

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.780 
around so that it's a it's a nice tight
around<00:02:57.380> mound<00:02:57.830> that's<00:02:58.040> really<00:02:58.520> quite

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
around mound that's really quite

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.150 
around mound that's really quite
beautiful<00:02:59.000> with<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.290> all<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.680> textures

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
beautiful with the all the textures

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.890 
beautiful with the all the textures
showing<00:03:01.610> up<00:03:01.730> beautifully<00:03:02.330> between<00:03:02.780> the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
showing up beautifully between the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.290 
showing up beautifully between the
flowers<00:03:03.320> and<00:03:03.740> to<00:03:04.190> make<00:03:04.520> it<00:03:04.670> just<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.940> little<00:03:05.180> bit

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
flowers and to make it just a little bit

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.990 
flowers and to make it just a little bit
more<00:03:05.420> interesting<00:03:06.050> and<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:07.010> go<00:03:07.190> with<00:03:07.460> the<00:03:07.760> the

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
more interesting and to go with the the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000 
more interesting and to go with the the
height<00:03:08.240> of<00:03:08.390> this<00:03:08.540> container<00:03:08.960> as<00:03:09.260> well<00:03:09.590> as<00:03:09.860> the

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
height of this container as well as the

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.130 
height of this container as well as the
linearity<00:03:10.340> of<00:03:10.640> all<00:03:10.940> these<00:03:11.120> these<00:03:11.810> twigs

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
linearity of all these these twigs

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.530 
linearity of all these these twigs
that's<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.040> Twiggy<00:03:13.370> pot<00:03:13.580> I'm<00:03:14.060> going<00:03:14.390> to

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
that's of the Twiggy pot I'm going to

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.480 
that's of the Twiggy pot I'm going to
add<00:03:14.660> in<00:03:14.960> the<00:03:14.990> middle<00:03:15.380> lino<00:03:15.710> just<00:03:16.160> in<00:03:16.310> little

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
add in the middle lino just in little

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.430 
add in the middle lino just in little
segments<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.360> we're<00:03:17.750> just<00:03:17.900> going<00:03:18.020> to<00:03:18.080> fit<00:03:18.320> it

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
segments and we're just going to fit it

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.310 
segments and we're just going to fit it
in<00:03:18.680> between<00:03:19.240> some<00:03:20.240> of<00:03:20.270> these<00:03:20.450> flowers<00:03:20.780> and

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
in between some of these flowers and

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.490 
in between some of these flowers and
we're<00:03:22.160> going<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.400> take<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:24.680> you<00:03:25.550> glue<00:03:25.880> and

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
we're going to take the you glue and

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.949 
we're going to take the you glue and
actually<00:03:27.500> attach<00:03:27.830> these<00:03:28.330> these<00:03:29.330> little<00:03:29.780> bits

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
actually attach these these little bits

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.140 
actually attach these these little bits
to<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:31.370> pot<00:03:32.150> so<00:03:32.930> that<00:03:33.110> it<00:03:33.770> stays<00:03:34.160> in<00:03:34.489> very

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
to the pot so that it stays in very

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.930 
to the pot so that it stays in very
nicely<00:03:35.420> so<00:03:36.290> that<00:03:36.320> way<00:03:36.739> it<00:03:37.130> really<00:03:37.520> continues

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
nicely so that way it really continues

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.630 
nicely so that way it really continues
that<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.660> use<00:03:38.989> of<00:03:39.290> this<00:03:39.530> container<00:03:40.130> it<00:03:40.459> makes

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
that the use of this container it makes

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.310 
that the use of this container it makes
more<00:03:40.850> sense<00:03:40.910> of<00:03:41.330> the<00:03:41.450> use<00:03:41.600> of<00:03:41.780> this<00:03:41.870> container

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
more sense of the use of this container

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.699 
more sense of the use of this container
so<00:03:42.470> that's<00:03:42.770> its<00:03:43.250> natal<00:03:43.820> container<00:03:44.690> because<00:03:45.230> we

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
so that's its natal container because we

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.860 
so that's its natal container because we
want<00:03:45.920> to<00:03:46.010> show<00:03:46.250> how<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.510> lines<00:03:47.750> work<00:03:48.050> together

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
want to show how the lines work together

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.580 
want to show how the lines work together
so<00:03:51.700> again<00:03:52.700> this<00:03:53.120> makes<00:03:53.390> it<00:03:53.690> so<00:03:54.200> much<00:03:54.230> more

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
so again this makes it so much more

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.740 
so again this makes it so much more
simpler<00:03:54.950> that<00:03:55.130> we<00:03:55.250> have<00:03:55.430> this<00:03:55.580> new<00:03:56.360> little

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
simpler that we have this new little

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.750 
simpler that we have this new little
gloomy<00:03:57.260> units<00:03:58.130> here<00:03:58.780> and<00:04:00.040> this<00:04:01.040> one<00:04:01.280> here<00:04:01.610> we

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
gloomy units here and this one here we

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.740 
gloomy units here and this one here we
also<00:04:01.880> swing<00:04:02.390> it<00:04:02.570> over<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:03.020> the<00:04:03.140> side

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.210 

so<00:04:08.680> maybe<00:04:09.520> something<00:04:09.850> like<00:04:10.000> this<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:11.500> you<00:04:12.070> can

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
so maybe something like this and you can

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.650 
so maybe something like this and you can
see<00:04:12.430> that<00:04:12.610> there's<00:04:12.880> a<00:04:12.970> little<00:04:13.210> bit<00:04:13.330> of<00:04:13.510> glue

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
see that there's a little bit of glue

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.560 
see that there's a little bit of glue
showing<00:04:14.170> this<00:04:14.740> is<00:04:14.980> where<00:04:15.220> I'm<00:04:15.520> going<00:04:15.700> to<00:04:15.820> go

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
showing this is where I'm going to go

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.940 
showing this is where I'm going to go
and<00:04:16.930> put<00:04:17.320> another<00:04:18.190> you<00:04:18.760> glue<00:04:19.030> over<00:04:19.239> this

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
and put another you glue over this

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.280 
and put another you glue over this
little<00:04:20.950> bit<00:04:21.070> bigger<00:04:21.310> and<00:04:21.910> finish<00:04:22.390> it<00:04:22.540> off<00:04:22.630> now

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
little bit bigger and finish it off now

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.560 
little bit bigger and finish it off now
this<00:04:23.530> one<00:04:23.740> here<00:04:24.100> would<00:04:24.310> be<00:04:24.490> more<00:04:24.850> for<00:04:25.090> a<00:04:25.150> party

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
this one here would be more for a party

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.720 
this one here would be more for a party
treatment<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:26.440> upper<00:04:26.770> part<00:04:27.070> could<00:04:27.310> be<00:04:27.370> for

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
treatment the upper part could be for

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.720 
treatment the upper part could be for
any<00:04:27.880> use<00:04:28.180> but<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:29.380> lower<00:04:29.650> part<00:04:30.070> if<00:04:30.490> you're

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
any use but the lower part if you're

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.640 
any use but the lower part if you're
going<00:04:30.850> to<00:04:30.940> incorporate<00:04:31.180> this<00:04:31.630> idea<00:04:32.080> you're

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
going to incorporate this idea you're

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.170 
going to incorporate this idea you're
going<00:04:32.800> to<00:04:32.890> do<00:04:33.010> it<00:04:33.160> only<00:04:33.370> for<00:04:33.550> party<00:04:34.000> work

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
going to do it only for party work

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.210 
going to do it only for party work
because<00:04:34.540> this<00:04:34.660> is<00:04:34.840> just<00:04:35.050> simple<00:04:35.410> gluing<00:04:36.100> a

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
because this is just simple gluing a

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.900 
because this is just simple gluing a
flower<00:04:36.490> out<00:04:37.180> of<00:04:37.420> water<00:04:37.630> so<00:04:38.350> it's<00:04:38.560> just

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
flower out of water so it's just

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.000 
flower out of water so it's just
accentuating<00:04:39.910> for<00:04:40.240> an<00:04:40.510> event<00:04:41.140> for<00:04:41.710> one

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
accentuating for an event for one

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.480 
accentuating for an event for one
evening

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
evening

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.940 
evening
so<00:04:42.850> it<00:04:42.970> holds<00:04:43.180> up<00:04:43.450> for<00:04:43.480> that<00:04:43.840> evening<00:04:44.260> and<00:04:44.470> that

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
so it holds up for that evening and that

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.730 
so it holds up for that evening and that
would<00:04:45.130> be<00:04:45.250> all<00:04:46.020> but<00:04:47.020> I'm<00:04:47.140> going<00:04:47.290> to<00:04:47.320> add<00:04:47.440> one

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
would be all but I'm going to add one

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.710 
would be all but I'm going to add one
more<00:04:47.940> so<00:04:48.940> that<00:04:49.210> we<00:04:49.240> can<00:04:49.600> have<00:04:49.750> another<00:04:50.580> little

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
more so that we can have another little

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.010 
more so that we can have another little
orchid<00:04:52.720> blossom<00:04:53.220> to<00:04:54.220> end<00:04:54.640> off<00:04:54.910> on<00:04:55.240> that<00:04:55.630> side

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
orchid blossom to end off on that side

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:04.550 
orchid blossom to end off on that side
perhaps<00:04:57.750> so<00:04:58.750> I'm<00:04:58.930> going<00:04:59.110> to<00:04:59.140> add<00:04:59.260> that<00:05:01.110> glue<00:05:02.110> it

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.440 

and<00:05:05.560> another<00:05:06.040> piece

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.840 

it's<00:05:12.020> that<00:05:12.290> one<00:05:14.530> need<00:05:15.530> to<00:05:15.680> add<00:05:15.860> in<00:05:16.100> another

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
it's that one need to add in another

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.830 
it's that one need to add in another
market<00:05:18.220> just<00:05:19.220> add<00:05:19.760> it<00:05:20.000> on<00:05:20.120> like<00:05:20.360> that<00:05:20.570> so

market just add it on like that so
that's<00:05:20.990> kind<00:05:21.260> of<00:05:21.290> how<00:05:21.410> it<00:05:21.530> finishes

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.419
