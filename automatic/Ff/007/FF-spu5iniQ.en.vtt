00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
can pretty much do this with as long as

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.219 
can pretty much do this with as long as
you're<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.729> arcade<00:01:21.299> mode<00:01:21.509> just<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:21.930> someone

three<00:01:25.470> throw<00:01:25.890> three<00:01:26.430> ten<00:01:27.360> throws<00:01:27.720> within<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
three throw three ten throws within the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.980 
three throw three ten throws within the
realm<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.950> set<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.670> round<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.360> five<00:01:30.750> rounds

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
because I found that even if I threw him

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.679 
because I found that even if I threw him
all<00:01:33.780> times<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.430> little<00:01:35.549> bit<00:01:35.820> uh<00:01:35.850> more<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.630> a
