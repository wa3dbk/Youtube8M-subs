00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.450 

there's<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.960> lot<00:00:07.290> of<00:00:07.319> ways<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.830> get<00:00:07.980> smoked<00:00:08.280> in

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
there's a lot of ways to get smoked in

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.370 
there's a lot of ways to get smoked in
the<00:00:08.490> mountains<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.030> it's<00:00:09.180> not<00:00:09.389> just<00:00:09.660> upright

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
the mountains and it's not just upright

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:33.650 
the mountains and it's not just upright
in<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.590> NAR<00:00:31.160> and<00:00:32.160> we<00:00:32.820> figured<00:00:33.150> that's<00:00:33.330> a<00:00:33.450> good

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
in the NAR and we figured that's a good

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.010 
in the NAR and we figured that's a good
place<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.170> check<00:00:34.440> out<00:00:35.310> the<00:00:36.000> snowpack<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.570> little

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
place to check out the snowpack a little

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.920 
place to check out the snowpack a little
bit<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:38.000> get<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> sense<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.450> what's<00:00:39.600> going<00:00:39.690> on

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
bit and get a sense of what's going on

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.300 
bit and get a sense of what's going on
up<00:00:40.170> there<00:00:40.290> because<00:00:40.470> it's<00:00:40.590> just<00:00:40.680> been<00:00:40.890> dumping

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
up there because it's just been dumping

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.430 
up there because it's just been dumping
for<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.550> last<00:00:41.840> couple<00:00:42.840> weeks

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
for the last couple weeks

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.220 
for the last couple weeks
we're<00:00:44.400> a<00:00:44.430> little<00:00:44.550> bit<00:00:44.790> afraid<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.780> had<00:00:45.930> our

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
we're a little bit afraid we had our

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.650 
we're a little bit afraid we had our
concerns<00:00:47.130> as<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:47.760> always<00:00:47.940> do<00:00:48.150> going<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
concerns as we always do going in the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.360 
concerns as we always do going in the
backcountry<00:00:49.080> and<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:49.830> a<00:00:49.860> lot<00:00:50.040> of<00:00:50.070> them<00:00:50.250> were

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
backcountry and but a lot of them were

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.550 
backcountry and but a lot of them were
the<00:00:50.550> sliver<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.480> were<00:00:51.540> like<00:00:51.840> want<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.410> know

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560 
the sliver we were like want you know

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.400 
the sliver we were like want you know
concerned<00:00:53.460> with<00:00:53.700> if<00:00:53.880> the<00:00:54.030> top<00:00:54.240> was<00:00:54.540> loaded<00:00:55.140> and

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
concerned with if the top was loaded and

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.900 
concerned with if the top was loaded and
what-have-you<00:00:56.040> and<00:00:56.130> we<00:00:56.190> got<00:00:56.340> into<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> sliver

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
what-have-you and we got into the sliver

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.030 
what-have-you and we got into the sliver
and<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.180> actually<00:00:57.440> really<00:00:58.440> good<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.920> was<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
and is actually really good it was a

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.500 
and is actually really good it was a
hard<00:00:59.550> surface<00:00:59.820> with<00:01:00.420> some<00:01:00.450> well<00:01:01.290> bonded<00:01:02.510> four

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
hard surface with some well bonded four

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.890 
hard surface with some well bonded four
to<00:01:03.840> eight<00:01:04.470> inches<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:05.280> top<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:06.450> felt<00:01:06.659> really

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
to eight inches on top it felt really

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.350 
to eight inches on top it felt really
good<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> sliver<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.340> know<00:01:08.520> perfect

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
good in the sliver you know perfect

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.780 
good in the sliver you know perfect
conditions<00:01:09.960> for<00:01:10.050> for<00:01:10.620> hiking<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.310> cool<00:01:11.610> are

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
conditions for for hiking that cool are

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.360 
conditions for for hiking that cool are
on<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.240> day<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.930> writing<00:01:16.260> down<00:01:16.410> felt<00:01:16.740> really

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
on that day the writing down felt really

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.540 
on that day the writing down felt really
good<00:01:17.550> bit<00:01:18.030> firm<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:18.740> but<00:01:19.740> really<00:01:20.010> a<00:01:20.040> chaplain

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
good bit firm but but really a chaplain

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
and nice to shame because that we wrote

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.070 
and nice to shame because that we wrote
it<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.460> fully<00:01:23.730> storm<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.720> know<00:01:24.930> it's

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
get out of the mountains we'd spent you

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.240 
get out of the mountains we'd spent you
know<00:01:36.510> the<00:01:36.690> better<00:01:37.110> half<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.440> the<00:01:37.500> day<00:01:37.710> up<00:01:38.040> high

know the better half of the day up high
and<00:01:38.550> high<00:01:38.729> elevation<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.810> deep<00:01:40.200> what<00:01:41.130> I

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
and high elevation in this deep what I

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.520 
and high elevation in this deep what I
would<00:01:41.340> say<00:01:41.520> more<00:01:41.880> serious<00:01:42.420> terrain<00:01:42.840> all<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
would say more serious terrain all the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.350 
would say more serious terrain all the
while<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.979> low<00:01:44.159> elevation<00:01:44.850> which<00:01:45.000> we<00:01:45.150> didn't

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
while the low elevation which we didn't

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.860 
while the low elevation which we didn't
realize<00:01:45.720> had<00:01:45.900> been<00:01:46.050> getting<00:01:46.350> Sun<00:01:46.590> all<00:01:46.979> morning

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
it was much more heated it was a just a

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.760 
it was much more heated it was a just a
totally<00:01:51.390> different<00:01:51.810> world

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.149 

really<00:01:55.430> warm<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:56.140> all<00:01:57.140> we<00:01:57.350> expected<00:01:57.860> on<00:01:57.979> that

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
really warm and all we expected on that

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.030 
really warm and all we expected on that
south-facing<00:01:58.490> face<00:01:59.180> was<00:01:59.450> uh<00:01:59.710> you<00:02:00.710> know<00:02:00.799> like

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
south-facing face was uh you know like

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.520 
south-facing face was uh you know like
basically<00:02:01.579> slow<00:02:02.240> slides<00:02:02.840> you<00:02:03.049> know<00:02:03.170> that<00:02:03.350> you

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
basically slow slides you know that you

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.350 
basically slow slides you know that you
can<00:02:03.680> really<00:02:03.979> easily<00:02:04.340> manage<00:02:04.759> what<00:02:05.210> I<00:02:05.240> never

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
can really easily manage what I never

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.749 
can really easily manage what I never
thought<00:02:05.869> was<00:02:06.259> that<00:02:06.290> it<00:02:06.560> would<00:02:06.649> create<00:02:06.890> a<00:02:07.310> slab

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
thought was that it would create a slab

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.160 
thought was that it would create a slab
and<00:02:08.119> that's<00:02:08.270> exactly<00:02:08.780> what<00:02:08.899> happened<00:02:09.110> to

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
and that's exactly what happened to

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:18.729

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
snap in front of me the weight I felt

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.759 
snap in front of me the weight I felt
that<00:02:53.269> my<00:02:53.450> body<00:02:53.720> was<00:02:56.470> unbearable<00:02:57.470> like<00:02:57.650> I

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
that my body was unbearable like I

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.500 
that my body was unbearable like I
thought<00:02:57.980> I<00:02:58.040> was<00:02:58.250> basically<00:02:58.640> gonna<00:02:59.030> explode

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
thought I was basically gonna explode

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.900 
thought I was basically gonna explode
look<00:02:59.930> see<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.829> slapper<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.400> just<00:03:01.670> thought<00:03:01.790> it

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
look see the slapper I just thought it

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.849 
look see the slapper I just thought it
was<00:03:02.000> like<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.180> little<00:03:02.420> famine<00:03:04.780> yeah<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.019> then

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
was like a little famine yeah and then

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.699 
was like a little famine yeah and then
at<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.579> very<00:03:07.609> end<00:03:08.150> I<00:03:08.810> could<00:03:09.290> feel<00:03:09.530> myself

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
at the very end I could feel myself

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.539 
at the very end I could feel myself
coming<00:03:10.130> out<00:03:10.340> of<00:03:10.459> it<00:03:10.579> and<00:03:10.790> I<00:03:11.030> basically<00:03:12.549> popped

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
coming out of it and I basically popped

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.910 
coming out of it and I basically popped
out<00:03:13.850> on<00:03:14.180> top<00:03:14.420> right<00:03:14.900> at<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.380> toe<00:03:15.590> of<00:03:15.620> this

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
out on top right at the toe of this

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.160 
out on top right at the toe of this
thing<00:03:16.359> after<00:03:17.359> riding<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:17.870> for<00:03:17.900> 2,000<00:03:18.590> feet<00:03:20.170> I'm

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
thing after riding it for 2,000 feet I'm

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.080 
thing after riding it for 2,000 feet I'm
not<00:03:21.350> taking<00:03:21.680> credit<00:03:21.799> that<00:03:22.100> I<00:03:22.160> fought<00:03:22.760> my<00:03:22.790> way

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
not taking credit that I fought my way

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.809 
not taking credit that I fought my way
out<00:03:23.239> of<00:03:23.269> it<00:03:23.450> I<00:03:24.130> gotta<00:03:25.130> let<00:03:25.310> go

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
out of it I gotta let go

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.479 
out of it I gotta let go
it<00:03:26.269> wasn't<00:03:26.569> really<00:03:26.930> my<00:03:27.049> decision<00:03:27.560> it's<00:03:28.069> tricky

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
it wasn't really my decision it's tricky

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.550 
it wasn't really my decision it's tricky
out<00:03:28.760> there<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.329> know<00:03:29.450> you<00:03:29.540> get<00:03:29.750> reinforced<00:03:30.410> in

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
out there you know you get reinforced in

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.270 
out there you know you get reinforced in
all<00:03:30.680> these<00:03:30.799> different<00:03:30.920> ways<00:03:31.220> about<00:03:33.280> thinking

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
all these different ways about thinking

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.309 
all these different ways about thinking
you're<00:03:34.489> in<00:03:34.609> control<00:03:34.940> or<00:03:35.450> thinking<00:03:36.049> that<00:03:36.109> you

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
you're in control or thinking that you

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.460 
you're in control or thinking that you
can<00:03:36.500> manage<00:03:36.709> something<00:03:37.459> that<00:03:38.120> was<00:03:38.239> dangerous

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.480 

and<00:03:40.620> then<00:03:40.860> at<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:41.760> most<00:03:41.940> unlikely<00:03:42.600> moment<00:03:43.490> you

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
and then at the most unlikely moment you

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.250 
and then at the most unlikely moment you
can<00:03:44.640> get<00:03:44.790> caught<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.600> know<00:03:45.690> I<00:03:45.720> thought<00:03:45.960> I<00:03:46.020> was

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
can get caught you know I thought I was

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.000 
can get caught you know I thought I was
in<00:03:46.380> complete<00:03:46.950> control<00:03:47.360> until<00:03:48.360> I<00:03:48.420> wasn't<00:03:49.010> it

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
in complete control until I wasn't it

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.470 
in complete control until I wasn't it
just<00:03:50.160> goes<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.580> show<00:03:50.640> you<00:03:50.850> got<00:03:50.970> to<00:03:51.060> be<00:03:51.150> on<00:03:51.270> your

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
just goes to show you got to be on your

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
game the whole way through and there's a

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.130 
game the whole way through and there's a
lot<00:03:53.970> of<00:03:54.120> ways<00:03:54.270> to<00:03:54.480> get<00:03:54.570> smoked<00:03:54.930> in<00:03:55.110> the

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
lot of ways to get smoked in the

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.140 
lot of ways to get smoked in the
mountains<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.680> it's<00:03:55.830> not<00:03:56.010> just<00:03:56.310> up<00:03:56.640> right<00:03:57.000> in

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
mountains and it's not just up right in

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.000 
mountains and it's not just up right in
the<00:03:57.180> gnar<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:58.530> know<00:03:58.650> an<00:03:58.800> incident<00:03:59.220> like<00:03:59.370> that

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
the gnar you know an incident like that

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.060 
the gnar you know an incident like that
changes<00:04:02.010> your<00:04:02.430> life<00:04:02.490> and<00:04:02.970> it<00:04:03.630> changes<00:04:04.200> how<00:04:05.010> you

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
changes your life and it changes how you

changes your life and it changes how you

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
look at the mountains from that point on

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:19.190 
look at the mountains from that point on
and<00:04:06.750> if<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.350> doesn't<00:04:07.800> then<00:04:08.690> you're<00:04:09.690> an<00:04:09.810> idiot
