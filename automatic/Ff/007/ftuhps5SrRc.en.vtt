00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hi jose techno fan dotcom and 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 today we are going to talk about 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.010
 some news of what it conditioned 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.780
 in the world and technology during this 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.780
 week so let's go forget 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.580
 before starting this video I wanted to 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.170
 tell them something about the draws 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.940
 as you know during this year I have 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.880
 been making several draws either 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.489
 of tablets as well as accessories 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.360
 like boxes also what comes to be 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.970
 money and what is a watch that I have 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.460
 done internationally and the day 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.530
 Monday I will be doing a 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.860
 draw that is sponsored by a company 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.440
 here in the usa and it's only the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.370
 lottery is for the residents are the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.630
 who live here in the usa 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.309
 I want you to know before you 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.290
 bother with me that I 'm not here 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.780
 gaining absolutely nothing the only 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.309
 benefit that I have to be you is 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.930
 the fact that they are going to provide me with a 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.539
 device so you can do them 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.100
 the unpacked as the review and 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:11.090
 other analyzes such as the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.090
 camera of this device 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.759
 I know that many people possibly 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.960
 have been disgusted but I want 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.979
 apologize in advance because 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.350
 that does not really depend on me for the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.090
 fact that the device is not mine and 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.759
 the company that is officiating this 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.579
 video is from a carlos usa therefore 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.470
 I follow the guidelines to be able to perform 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.299
 this raffle in case you guys 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.399
 have a family member who lives here in the 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.259
 us then to vicens so they can 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.439
 participate in this raffle that as you 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.310
 I'm going to present on Monday 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.200
 you know that I am very 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.060
 grateful to you for the support that 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.770
 they give me and in any case this 2013 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.170
 We are going to continue making draws in 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.610
 international form and in turn what 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.369
 I'm going to do is try to communicate with 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.959
 any company from other countries or that 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.640
 work internationally as per 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:57.689
 clear example movistar that work in 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.880
 many countries of South America 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.860
 Central America as well as in Europe and 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.990
 give the possibility to perform with 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.030
 them a lottery 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.509
 let's say international so that 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.459
 way we are all happy 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.560
 so do not be discouraged that this 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.989
 2013 or understanding of surprises now if 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.670
 we go with the news the first 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.489
 news is with respect to samsung that 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.310
 I would be presenting a 5.5 screen 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:27.290
 flexible inches with a resolution of 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.360
 thousand 280 x 720 hd with 267 pp and pixels 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.970
 per inch it is said that this 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.400
 screen would be presented in 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.950
 this event that I will attend the xi is 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.049
 in lives 2013 so stay tuned 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.000
 to my videos that soon we are going to 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.500
 be with this scoop 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.300
 we go with the second news and this one 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.640
 comes from Huawei that would also be 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.980
 presenting three new devices in 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.350
 this fair is like this is in the tracks we are 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.110
 talking about the do of two that would come 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.960
 with a 5-inch screen at 1080p 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.400
 a quad-core processor a camera of 3 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.950
 megapixels and the operating system 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.260
 Android 4.1 the other devices 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.260
 we are talking about the second one that would be 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.930
 the ascend e-mail that would have a 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.540
 6.1 inch screen and also 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.440
 we talk about w 1 that would be a device 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.480
 that would come with operating system 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.280
 windows with a lot 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.019
 we go to the third news and it is with 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.150
 with respect to is the one that possibly 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.000
 would be presenting soon and to 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.480
 start of next year a tablet of 7 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.700
 inches to a value of 99 dollars this 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.190
 report has left what it comes to be 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.260
 the fsc and a benchmark but if it has come out 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.450
 of the fcc that would come to be the federation 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.970
 that I do not have a federal commission 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.260
 communication is because it effectively goes 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.879
 to be and within the web page 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.069
 you can see my information there 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.620
 with respect to this tablet would come with 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.769
 a 1.2 different processor was at 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.530
 body the android 4.1 operating system 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:54.349
 and a 1024 x 600 screen 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.359
 resolution so there's no 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.989
 spectacular features we are 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:01.579
 talking a mid-range tablet does not and 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.680
 does not come with cameras so I've 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.500
 could see the model so 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.329
 possibly this product is found 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.470
 available early next year 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.810
 and I would be doing the competition 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.879
 also in a possible tablet that 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.130
 It would also be presenting to talk 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.019
 a new annexes of $ 99 and that 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.329
 looks forward to next year in what 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.130
 which refers to the segment of tablets 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.260
 Low value 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.030
 under the fourth news and this very 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.980
 interesting because it's a report that 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.500
 has filtered out that he talks about 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.960
 new processor nvidia tegra 4 this 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.440
 new processor would attract a processor 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.390
 graphic with six times more cores than in 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.740
 teherÃ£ 3 with respect to what comes to 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.630
 being the cpu would be the same 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.000
 we are talking about four or three more 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.850
 one that one would be responsible for performing 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.800
 minor tasks and other advantages 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.470
 with respect to this professor is that he's going to 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:56.000
 have support for screens with resolution 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:58.310
 of 2560 x 1080p now imagine the 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.410
 games that we will be able to use with 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.870
 this processor is going to be something really 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.790
 amazing 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.650
 with the fifth news and this is also 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.050
 looks very interesting and comes from sonny 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.090
 which would be possibly presenting 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.800
 in this fair also if it is the area 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.820
 where are we going to be for 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.220
 can transmit all this 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.200
 information would be presenting a new 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.500
 device called place that's the 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.450
 code name and I would have five for one 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.070
 5 inch screen at 1080p paris and 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:28.420
 that now this is the standard that goes to 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.670
 be news for 2013 where now 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.050
 all the new ones or the companies would be 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.750
 presenting your new positives with 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.800
 5-inch screens and not only 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.000
 we're talking about this 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.420
 device in code with a processor 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.580
 snapdragon s4 or the pro I imagine is from 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.560
 four cores a camera of 12 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.260
 megapixels as well as the system 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.300
 operative android 4.1 and the ibi I do not know what 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.850
 and let's see what it is that presents us 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.320
 are and in this fair and especially the 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.700
 next year that is going to look very 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.900
 interesting with regard to what they are 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.120
 mobile devices 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.639
