00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.060 

then<00:01:14.780> with<00:01:14.960> our<00:01:14.990> finger<00:01:15.409> we're<00:01:15.590> gonna<00:01:15.680> go<00:01:15.890> into

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
then with our finger we're gonna go into

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.859 
then with our finger we're gonna go into
the<00:01:16.190> color<00:01:16.400> beige<00:01:16.760> and<00:01:17.119> we're<00:01:17.390> just<00:01:17.540> gonna<00:01:17.659> be

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
the color beige and we're just gonna be

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.780 
the color beige and we're just gonna be
pumping<00:01:18.260> this<00:01:18.470> right<00:01:18.799> and<00:01:19.040> not<00:01:19.190> tear<00:01:19.520> ducts

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
pumping this right and not tear ducts

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.480 
pumping this right and not tear ducts
and<00:01:20.000> I<00:01:20.689> think<00:01:20.930> using<00:01:21.200> just<00:01:21.650> your<00:01:21.830> finger<00:01:22.189> is<00:01:22.430> a

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
and I think using just your finger is a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.520 
and I think using just your finger is a
little<00:01:23.119> better<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.570> intensify<00:01:23.930> that<00:01:24.260> look<00:01:24.409> a

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
little better to intensify that look a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.289 
little better to intensify that look a
little<00:01:24.650> more<00:01:24.830> and<00:01:25.130> then<00:01:25.670> after<00:01:25.880> that<00:01:26.000> you<00:01:26.119> want

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299

to<00:01:26.360> go<00:01:26.479> back<00:01:26.689> in<00:01:26.900> there<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.080> blend<00:01:27.500> out

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
to go back in there and blend out

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.300 
to go back in there and blend out
everything<00:01:28.630> now<00:01:29.630> as<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.810> liquid<00:01:30.229> eyeliner<00:01:30.409> I<00:01:31.010> am
