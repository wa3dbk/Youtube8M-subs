00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:06.370
 we have come to the valley local 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.720
 where citizens have collected all 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.760
 the receipts of the property they 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.290
 they show discontent for the high 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.040
 costs for example here we have a 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.230
 receipt that arrives for 126 thousand pesos in 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.710
 an area where families were located 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.210
 of scarce resources and charges come so 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.189
 exaggerated but this is not the only 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.230
 problematic let's take a tour 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.329
 for the different towers because it has 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.369
 manifested here there are built towers 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.770
 about other water births that 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.930
 they find their walls cracked and 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.379
 the most serious thing there is humidity that is 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.269
 filtering in several apartments the 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.640
 We invite you to join us to visit 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:46.260
 the problem of the orthigram 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.690
 accompanied by the citizenship the team 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.430
 journalistic journal toured the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.800
 most of the towers of the valley of 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.899
 the ortigal finding that the greatest 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.510
 part of the apartments have the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.300
 slabs of floors broken to the walls 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.850
 Stuffed with plastic paper columns 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.750
 made with icopor and three towers that 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.070
 they have underground lagoons running 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.229
 the roads of this problem of 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.259
 Ortegal Valley we arrived at Tower 10 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.780
 apartment 303 we go with the owner 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.210
 remember is a clear man to the owner 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.830
 floral her last name was in sleep 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.330
 floral back tovar good what is the 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.640
 problematic that is presented here in 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.500
 this apartment then elena in the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.030
 floor cracks are getting good no 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.850
 you can wash or anything because once the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.560
 water goes to the other apartment you 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.690
 have spoken with the builders that 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.690
 they have told them for themselves 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.909
 most part after they come and in 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.800
 other towers have gone and have half covered 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.310
 but they still follow 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.950
 they have done him like a lean tantico 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.050
 right now from tower 13 but equal one 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.880
 look and the state crack whether or not it has 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.250
 cured that then then suddenly 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.590
 a review not to not know if there 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.240
 danger not because one what worries you 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.840
 is that marine says no because it's going to 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.450
 to drop in there to the other apartment and 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.450
 so we also get to tower 11 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.500
 already reaching the third floor we 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.230
 we find elsa vargas thinks 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.740
 because there is a wall where the column 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.690
 it has like inside because because 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.390
 these days that we are doing toilet 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.450
 because the piece of wall fell and then 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.580
 we realized that there was that 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.040
 icopor there then then it is assumed that 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.170
 I believe that the towers are not not 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.080
 well done as for a foundation of that 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.040
 neither do I see that it is not not suitable 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.530
 neither for housing because good but 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.980
 where we are looking, there is a 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.659
 column 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.590
 if there is a column pass has a 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:50.349
 rod I think less than measuring or 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.690
 length then minimum minimum is 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.870
 rod that is there and this one is filled 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.430
 I do not know why I think that 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.430
 is not fit to be doing 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.010
 well a five story building images 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.620
 and then friends that transited because of 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.110
 logic that scares me not so much 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.500
 but almost all of those we inhabit 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.410
 in tower 11 we are not afraid to be 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.739
 watching because some if one goes up very hard 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.129
 and it starts to sound everywhere who 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.690
 the one who is going down is going up 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.250
 to highlight all this problem in 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.370
 the valley of el Ortegal we find ourselves with 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.349
 one of the spokesmen is Carlos Salazar 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.060
 you who are willing in the 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.370
 different instances of government not 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.109
 they give solution to the claims that 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.329
 you are doing while they are houses 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.579
 regulated is a danger as we could 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:42.700
 evidence in the notes good we 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:45.010
 here we need the output of all 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.840
 of all the people here the most if the most 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.060
 convenient 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.370
 the Pan American as people do 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.989
 the Indians, the indigenous, it's our turn to 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.370
 we also make ourselves feel that 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.379
 way because the only way that 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.660
 we have we are displaced 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.819
 victims of violence and possibly 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.440
 they can be victims of one of the 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.170
 irresponsibility in the construction of 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.760
 these apartments clear you there are 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.280
 the evidences we are not 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.319
 They are lying there anybody you same 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.569
 they have the other half takes also 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.700
 he came to do the takes also all 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.470
 those at the level of all the blocks 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.209
 violating at all because in general 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.489
 we have moisture problems of 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.500
 leakage water filtration good 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.260
 in front of the subject the property that they are going to 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.900
 do you here draw attention to me 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.970
 I make a special call to the government 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.670
 national who realizes that here is 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.820
 people 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:38.220
 no work people people who live 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.200
 scarcely in poverty and people who 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.220
 He goes out to beg, there are people who come 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.440
 of the 20 minutes of your sales of 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.560
 empanadas we live all of the rebusque 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.650
 here nobody has work we do not need 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.820
 that they consider us well in the dwellings 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.800
 dignified that the government did not deliver and 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.600
 look what we are 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.060
 paying 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.800
 look at the value we are paying if 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.230
 we pay property taxes we send the children to 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.820
 study I ask with Spain 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.440
 national government that takes letter in the 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.970
 affair 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.950
 well this is the problem that 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.390
 lives in the valley of the nettle les 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.150
 We expect a quick response from 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.730
 from the different authorities we will be 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.610
 pending and vigilant to the development of 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.830
 the solutions for these citizens of the 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.990
 nettle valley we have reached the 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.560
 most critical point of all these 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:32.370
 complaints under the first slab 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.250
 floor in tower 13 an underground as 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.780
 we can see it here in the images 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.780
 they are approximately 20 centimeters 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.280
 of this body of water but this one 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.740
 extends throughout all 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.800
 apartments according to neighbors 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.900
 here came the aqueduct to see if it was 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.700
 a failure of the tubes there was a break 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.850
 and there was loss of pressure they 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.890
 They stated that it had not been like this 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:03.500
 some of the workers had 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:06.620
 confirmed they had certified and here 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:10.040
 there was possibly a water handhold what 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:14.660
 which would complicate all this theme of the herd 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:17.540
 because the foundations would not be firm 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.580
 let's keep walking let's continue 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.050
 researching all the problems 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.910
 in the valley of the nettle 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.090
 meanwhile we leave you with these 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.090
 images
