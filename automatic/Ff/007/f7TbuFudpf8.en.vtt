 AndrÃ© Street I set out to make a 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.660
 small tutorial of the song of glory 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:19.510
 in glory what I plan to show you today 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.869
 I hope that I will help them in their growth 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.640
 playing the piano so first I'm going to 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.070
 play the singing the to then explain 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.789
 the notes that the base song of 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.320
 glory 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.320
 in guri 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.390
 the more you 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.239
 I want to know more 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.380
 is the first part of the song the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.120
 notes or the scale on which this is 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.040
 song on the scale of the king 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.500
 and the song starts in network 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.110
 the first note in the note king and man 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.860
 invested in this hand and a hostage in the 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.920
 low 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:08.420
 then it would sound like that and then it happens to be 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:12.450
 one side and I make one the most one hand 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.869
 right then the note of the yes 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.920
 and usually yes but I always the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.759
 they gave 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:25.890
 this is the best and then makes a pass 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.620
 to fall in sun 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.600
 the first would be the when the dow 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.260
 invested in this greater invested in 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.300
 this right hand and then it would happen to be 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.350
 a fa in the left hand held sharp 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.500
 with an inverted king to then fall that 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.500
 Sun 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.390
 and then lowers by sustained fa with network 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.130
 it comforted me 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.770
 and then wing 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.770
 of glory 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.770
 unity 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:09.390
 no more but I want to know more 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.390
 and me 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.760
 m 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.690
 your image 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.690
 good 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.460
 ok then those would be the chords for 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.460
 the first part then the second part 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.460
 would be 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.840
 I want 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.930
 two 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.450
 do not 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.290
 ok the chorus would then be sun but then 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.879
 the 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.110
 for sustained with the most as if it runs 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.680
 here 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.680
 plus 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.460
 of ever one more lap 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.460
 others 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.890
 capture 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.890
 after 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.549
 efe 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.870
 the world 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.800
 now if you want to repeat the choir what 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.990
 only thing you have to do is 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.069
 in the sun instead of in the end 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.420
 make 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:48.940
 for me 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.940
 and with sun and your love 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.690
 I want it not to repeat itself with 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.180
 so 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.600
 those are the chords of this song 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.570
 glory in glory I hope you serve 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.680
 and you can put it into practice ok god you 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.680
