00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.430
 People alex party here and I am whole 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.470
 warmly before the game tonight never 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.189
 long against parma for a little match 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.900
 preview 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.880
 I just want to give you a quick one 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.259
 let me tell you what you can do 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.049
 like to comment on what you believe 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.670
 how it runs out if milan the february 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.980
 starts better than we did in january 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.010
 have denied it goes with a 4-4-2 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.680
 what I really wanted in the 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.080
 february in the second half after now 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.519
 yes, the transfer window as good as to 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.050
 tomorrow but one more day to look 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.360
 if there is something else but the total 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.760
 yes, there will be separate transfers 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.530
 king football is quite successful 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.239
 from mister galliani we start today 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.550
 I said yes with a 4-4-2 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.530
 gate with diego lopez then from left to right 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.960
 right book chain gets its immediately 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.730
 startelf-deployment because simply with us in 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.010
 the back four chain hurt everything 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.899
 So that's what you're doing now 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.640
 hearing is the same all you are 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.039
 to have at the moment so available 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.649
 bocchetti on left rami alex and 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.320
 zaccardo 's allowed the right-back 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.059
 give times look where he has in 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.880
 lately what's been that lately 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.680
 he does not have when he came in 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.920
 done so badly then we have that 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.260
 four-middle field consisting of left 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.140
 chelsea poly in the middle and van ginkel 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.750
 and right honda the young injured 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.310
 montolivo must be injured so 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.470
 Mittelfeld we actually have to 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.939
 on s yen i believe and muntari so good 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.759
 like no player available 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.320
 but still, then it stops already 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.390
 but I find polly and van ginkel 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.150
 in principle if van ginkel his 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.070
 Achievement finally calls a lot 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.380
 very good midfield for this 442 you 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.909
 just need for this chain of four 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.689
 in midfield two very agile agile 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.490
 midfielder and poly and van 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.770
 Ginkel think I can do that 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.990
 represent supported by honda 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.299
 and chelsea on the way back 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.740
 jiechi on the left because simply as I said 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.380
 no one else is not an older one 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.270
 camcorder ventura and then the must 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.700
 Colleague just sometimes on the left 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.009
 then help out the two strikers 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.740
 before - and the more composed of a 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.719
 startelf debut there I think serve 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.910
 that can be pretty good from the idea 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.459
 work look whether honda and 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.500
 chi x the side you have to change 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.150
 Let's see what the game looks like in the game 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.239
 play against parma the last table 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.190
 and yes, what should I say 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.500
 here a victory must be clear that would have it 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.959
 but also knew against the others 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.580
 I'm still convinced that 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.430
 we will make a good game today 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.989
 that we win today with 3 to 1 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.819
 are thus in fact I do not trust us 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.620
 sometimes gates too I believe that 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.620
 trio will meet from the beginning if it is 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.300
 will make his goal and honda 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.700
 perhaps honda gets even one 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.200
 as the three scorers of 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.150
 me as a tip more should it synonymous 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.069
 Do not give if you have a tip for 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.260
 this game hides him in the video 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.030
 description otherwise should like under 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.250
 the video leave your comment 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.629
 even better during the game 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.340
 better of course on twitter because there 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.330
 I can react directly and see that 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.409
 Maybe I or write 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.519
 I will most likely write here 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.379
 a short statement in the 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.209
 half-time break so that's interesting 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.879
 look at the video at half past time 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.940
 Once again in 2045 it starts 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.280
 on a canal at about us or channel 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.099
 info is the link to the page where 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.800
 I quasi call the streams for the 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.560
 that is still interested and yes alex is 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.300
 today captain honda vice-captain so far 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.680
 it actually came with the 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.530
 we still have players available 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.819
 it does not matter the madness three to one 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.110
 my tip for today i am right 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.760
 positive I hope I will 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.230
 not disappointed again and I'm happy 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.599
 me on the more and bocchetti than 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.220
 new arrivals charity course the 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.260
 today ran on left from the start 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.670
 may 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.709
 that should have been the first one me 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.890
 go though a jersey pick up or 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.120
 Slap over and then it's called milan 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.099
 thumb press that we again in the 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.720
 Maybe this is still Europe on 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.180
 but the end of the season is over 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.439
 We'll start today at the latest today 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.180
 long overdue it should be 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:56.159
 been on my three videos today 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.849
 you had fun until then yours 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.849
