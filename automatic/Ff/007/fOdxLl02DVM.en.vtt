00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.350
 will congratulate you on this again 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:27.820
 does not consider as a remarkable achievement that 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:35.170
 this achievement is a big matis medium is not 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:41.470
 were strained such equal and bound 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:48.850
 special relationship and not very nice that 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:52.290
 set and taste this fabric will still 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.290
 harder than that 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.210
 to be quoted 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.079
 I am of course very long ago with the Soviet 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:25.020
 Union and Russia I actually grew up with 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:28.020
 the arrest of a regular cultural city 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.020
 ran around 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.460
 I will tell in part and of course should 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:43.110
 recognize that Russian chess players 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.110
 chess to very much taught me 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:51.369

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.380
 hurts and of course every time is very pleased 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.179
 when I come to the Russian currency once himself 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.190
 I do not want to say that the organization was on 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:03.479
 top level 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:03.479
 swum out on play chess 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.380
 surely enjoyed 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:30.380
 I grew up in Minsk and every time I come to 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:32.510
 Moscow gallery is wonderful museums and not 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.330
 could even dream that when pushing 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.970
 the colossus of the kohen country in the walls of this 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.120
 wonderful multi vault Russian 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.120
 arts 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:03.819
 and in the last years of russia moscow in 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.319
 features are back to their 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:10.569
 practical capital of the chess world and 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.940
 happiness in this match which i think is 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:18.849
 would be better organized match to the story 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:24.360
