I<00:01:52.750> found<00:01:53.750> this<00:01:53.900> out<00:01:54.140> because<00:01:54.350> I<00:01:54.830> was<00:01:55.010> thinking

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
I found this out because I was thinking

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.750 
I found this out because I was thinking
of<00:01:55.520> how<00:01:55.730> to<00:01:56.240> make<00:01:57.050> a<00:01:57.290> synchro<00:01:58.070> mod<00:01:58.310> of<00:01:58.370> metal

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
of how to make a synchro mod of metal

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.060 
of how to make a synchro mod of metal
fury<00:01:58.970> without<00:01:59.330> buying<00:01:59.660> the<00:01:59.930> line<00:02:00.110> so<00:02:01.010> I

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
fury without buying the line so I

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.360 
fury without buying the line so I
figured<00:02:01.430> out<00:02:02.350> this<00:02:03.350> looks<00:02:03.650> like<00:02:03.830> this<00:02:04.040> why

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
figured out this looks like this why

figured out this looks like this why
don't<00:02:04.550> I<00:02:04.700> find<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:05.180> screw<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.630> looks<00:02:05.840> similar

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
don't I find a screw that looks similar

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.030 
don't I find a screw that looks similar
to<00:02:06.440> it<00:02:06.590> so<00:02:06.890> I<00:02:07.100> found<00:02:07.520> one<00:02:07.580> and<00:02:08.560> my<00:02:09.560> back<00:02:09.770> porch
