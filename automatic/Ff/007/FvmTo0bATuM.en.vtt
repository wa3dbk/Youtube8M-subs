00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.830
 one 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:18.439
 one of the things that you also indicate 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:20.150
 bodies is to unstitch a lot in the kitchen 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.930
 yes I am a sewing machine with the 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.730
 girl who called music then to the 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.829
 machine costar of her and I always 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.000
 I felt like if I was closer to the 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.820
 machine like that was near her 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.930
 it was something that clear everything I knew 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.520
 when I was packed from me 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.860
 I counted my aunt was something that approached me 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.329
 so much so that I adopted it for myself and 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.489
 I started to know how to sew to cost and I 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.559
 short without mobile should you go short pompÃ­n 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.190
 and it comes out but I really love that 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:49.300
 it's a therapy and you started boy 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.300
 with dolls 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.030
 everyone 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.660
 and things that I'm hard to hide 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.110
 this is very difficult 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.780
 but there is no love I think nothing 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.579
 it is also another time now now the 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.310
 people do not care I think it's already 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:15.530
 how that topic is overcome 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:22.670
 12 years ago this happened to me more or 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:25.310
 less and it's difficult we never talk to 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.039
 dad's theme 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.860
 because I think it took a long time 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.909
 overcome what happened to me he think 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.259
 that I always believe that parents 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.700
 they always know what happens icons 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.530
 I thought never loved a lie that 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.229
 being a dad does not know how he will not know 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.549
 parents know you of the right and the 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.869
 backwards so he always knew what I 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.090
 passed from the garden because apart from 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.399
 me is not that I found out I say good 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.869
 was playing us in the third of 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.619
 chicago and I said well I wear a wig 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.860
 not him low cardillo went to the mouth mouth and 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:58.160
 I was an awesome thing 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:01.670
 gardening ring there was a trunk with 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.030
 wigs pens everything imagine how I 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.030
 called 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.130
 naturally that that trunk with the pen and 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.130
 the wigs that were there fascinated me 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.709
 I was tired of feathers but we protested 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.240
 all day and limited in the garden 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.640
 all good because it's still like that 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.640
 supposedly does not reason you see say 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.280
 good healthy healthy but then with the 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.360
 pass the time and continue to rafaela more 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.860
 valera that one day they gave me a cache 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:44.750
 so much that they accommodated me to rafaela 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:45.920
 ended because it was the teacher who 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.790
 He said what I was doing with 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.790
 bitch tonic 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.359
 of woman
