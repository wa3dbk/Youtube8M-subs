camera and an LED flash let's see if I

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.750

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.310 
can get the sim tray opener to work
really<00:02:54.760> curious<00:02:55.150> about<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.750> sim<00:02:56.019> tray

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
really curious about the sim tray

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.910 
really curious about the sim tray
because<00:02:57.269> it's<00:02:58.269> supposed<00:02:58.810> to<00:02:58.930> be<00:02:59.079> a<00:02:59.320> dual<00:02:59.620> sim

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
because it's supposed to be a dual sim

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.690 
because it's supposed to be a dual sim
card<00:03:00.269> so<00:03:01.269> this<00:03:01.660> is<00:03:01.810> probably<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.680> longest<00:03:03.040> sim

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
card so this is probably the longest sim

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.460 
card so this is probably the longest sim
tray<00:03:04.000> I've<00:03:04.299> ever<00:03:04.660> seen<00:03:05.730> cool<00:03:06.870> anyway<00:03:07.870> I'll<00:03:08.170> do
