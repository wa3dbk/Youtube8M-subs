00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.740

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.910
 value expression 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.210
 us even technically distressed 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.450
 - they 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.530
 a series of year dvds 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.090
 I thought he and the 12 euros 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.730
 appeared 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.730
 all respect 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.510
 in a round that she expected was that of December 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.990
 even so unfortunately 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.990
 the gang arrested 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.399
 A lot of joy that São Paulo is here. 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.799
 Similarly 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:11.949

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:14.949

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.199
 much joy 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:32.799
 on the 19th 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.129
 they threw them 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.129
 poor football 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:56.309
 never 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:59.309
 depending on the business 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:02.929
 in general 

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:22.309
 helio barboza 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:25.309
