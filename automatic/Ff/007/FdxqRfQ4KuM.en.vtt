fast we're gonna talk about the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.320 
fast we're gonna talk about the
different<00:00:17.100> stats<00:00:17.310> for<00:00:17.550> this<00:00:17.699> gun<00:00:17.910> how<00:00:18.210> it

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
different stats for this gun how it

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.960 
different stats for this gun how it
works<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.750> all<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.230> stuff<00:00:19.850> starting<00:00:20.850> now

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
works and all of that stuff starting now

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.040 
works and all of that stuff starting now
so<00:00:21.150> let's<00:00:21.270> go<00:00:21.390> ahead<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.570> look<00:00:21.720> at<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.930> in

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
so let's go ahead and look at the in

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.320 
so let's go ahead and look at the in
game<00:00:22.170> stats<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:22.560> we<00:00:22.680> got<00:00:22.800> up<00:00:22.980> 3<00:00:23.640> damage<00:00:23.910> and

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
game stats so we got up 3 damage and

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.839 
game stats so we got up 3 damage and
down<00:00:25.019> three<00:00:25.590> accuracy<00:00:25.949> pretty<00:00:26.369> much<00:00:26.580> the

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
down three accuracy pretty much the

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.269 
down three accuracy pretty much the
simplest<00:00:27.570> elite<00:00:28.289> variant<00:00:28.800> out<00:00:28.890> there<00:00:29.130> it's

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
simplest elite variant out there it's

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.790 
simplest elite variant out there it's
very<00:00:29.310> very<00:00:29.730> simple<00:00:29.840> but<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.900> in-game<00:00:31.439> stocks

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
very very simple but the in-game stocks

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.040 
very very simple but the in-game stocks
proved<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.640> be<00:00:32.730> really<00:00:33.210> really<00:00:33.510> frickin

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
proved to be really really frickin

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.299 
proved to be really really frickin
awesome<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.469> hopefully<00:00:34.739> by<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.920> end<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.219> this

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
awesome so hopefully by the end of this

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.069 
awesome so hopefully by the end of this
video<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.760> can<00:00:36.090> show<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.450> best<00:00:36.630> xmg

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
video I can show you the best xmg

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.650 
video I can show you the best xmg
variant<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.829> talk<00:00:38.399> about<00:00:38.550> why<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.000> one<00:00:39.480> is

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
variant and talk about why this one is

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.360 
variant and talk about why this one is
really<00:00:39.930> really<00:00:40.170> good<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.860> as<00:00:40.920> far<00:00:41.010> as<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
really really good so as far as the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.090 
really really good so as far as the
damage<00:00:41.730> goes<00:00:41.760> for<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.180> XM<00:00:42.480> g<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:42.960> 25<00:00:43.800> at

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
damage goes for the XM g it is 25 at

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.940 
damage goes for the XM g it is 25 at
close<00:00:44.640> range<00:00:44.969> 20<00:00:45.719> at<00:00:45.840> mid<00:00:46.020> range<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.350> 28<00:00:46.770> long

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
close range 20 at mid range of 28 long

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.190 
close range 20 at mid range of 28 long
range<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> four<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.420> five<00:00:48.690> bullet

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
range so that is a four to five bullet

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.290 
range so that is a four to five bullet
kill<00:00:49.469> what<00:00:50.190> has<00:00:50.280> changed<00:00:50.670> with<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.879> bacon<00:00:51.180> and

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
kill what has changed with the bacon and

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.470 
kill what has changed with the bacon and
eggs<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.690> its<00:00:51.960> 25<00:00:52.559> up<00:00:52.710> close<00:00:53.059> 25<00:00:54.059> at<00:00:54.300> mid-range

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
eggs is its 25 up close 25 at mid-range

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.290 
eggs is its 25 up close 25 at mid-range
and<00:00:55.050> 20<00:00:55.890> at<00:00:56.010> long<00:00:56.219> range<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.730> yes<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.210> still

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
and 20 at long range so yes it's still

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.860 
and 20 at long range so yes it's still
for<00:00:57.480> 25<00:00:57.989> bullet<00:00:58.350> kill<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:59.579> but<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.390> important

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
for 25 bullet kill but but the important

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.470 
for 25 bullet kill but but the important
part<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.199> here<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:02.250> at<00:01:02.489> mid-range<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.359> is

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
part is here is that at mid-range it is

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.299 
part is here is that at mid-range it is
now<00:01:03.629> affordable<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.290> kill<00:01:04.439> instead<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.070> five

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
now affordable it kill instead of a five

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.710 
now affordable it kill instead of a five
bullet<00:01:05.670> Kelso<00:01:05.939> that's<00:01:06.090> super<00:01:06.450> super

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
bullet Kelso that's super super

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.660 
bullet Kelso that's super super
important<00:01:07.110> now<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.799> thing<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.280> makes<00:01:08.520> this

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
important now the thing that makes this

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.080 
important now the thing that makes this
gun<00:01:08.939> really<00:01:09.450> really<00:01:10.200> good<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.640> fact<00:01:11.909> that

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
gun really really good is the fact that

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.170 
gun really really good is the fact that
the<00:01:12.270> fire<00:01:12.600> rate<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.080> 600<00:01:13.439> rpm<00:01:14.010> wait<00:01:15.000> you're

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
the fire rate is 600 rpm wait you're

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.789 
the fire rate is 600 rpm wait you're
probably<00:01:15.420> thinking<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.990> whoa<00:01:16.290> whoa<00:01:16.500> whoa

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
probably thinking that whoa whoa whoa

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.969 
probably thinking that whoa whoa whoa
that's<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.759> low<00:01:17.970> rpm<00:01:18.479> but<00:01:19.080> that's<00:01:19.259> for<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:19.860> of

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
that's a low rpm but that's for one of

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.770 
that's a low rpm but that's for one of
the<00:01:20.100> X<00:01:20.220> MGS<00:01:20.610> when<00:01:20.729> you're<00:01:20.850> using<00:01:21.060> two<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.570> them

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the X MGS when you're using two of them

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.999 
the X MGS when you're using two of them
it's<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:23.570> 1200<00:01:24.570> RPM<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.439> right<00:01:25.680> that

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
it's a 1200 RPM that is right that

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.850 
it's a 1200 RPM that is right that
frickin<00:01:26.610> high<00:01:26.970> then<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:28.170> top<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.650> when

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
frickin high then on top of that when

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.380 
frickin high then on top of that when
it's<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.100> lockdown<00:01:29.369> mode<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.880> fire<00:01:30.060> rate<00:01:30.240> goes

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
it's in lockdown mode the fire rate goes

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.810 
it's in lockdown mode the fire rate goes
up<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.600> 800<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.560> yes<00:01:31.740> that's<00:01:31.979> right<00:01:32.159> one<00:01:32.490> that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
up to 800 so yes that's right one that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.030 
up to 800 so yes that's right one that
was<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.119> 600<00:01:33.930> rpm<00:01:34.320> that's<00:01:34.590> how<00:01:34.799> high<00:01:34.979> this

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
was in 600 rpm that's how high this

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.100 
was in 600 rpm that's how high this
thing<00:01:35.220> goes<00:01:35.400> up<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.030> lockdown<00:01:36.479> mode<00:01:36.659> so

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
thing goes up to and lockdown mode so

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.920 
thing goes up to and lockdown mode so
the<00:01:37.229> key<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.860> using<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.400> gun<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.939> staying

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930

doesn't mean anything and here's why so

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.719

recoil<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.530> do<00:02:10.709> not<00:02:10.860> even<00:02:11.160> notice<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.970> plus

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
recoil you do not even notice the plus

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.850

twenty-five<00:02:12.629> percent<00:02:12.750> recoil<00:02:13.230> if<00:02:13.319> I'm<00:02:13.440> being

twenty-five percent recoil if I'm being

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
really honest you don't even notice it

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.210 
really honest you don't even notice it
so<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:16.080> means<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.470> only<00:02:16.650> thing<00:02:16.950> that<00:02:17.100> is

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
so that means the only thing that is

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.550 
so that means the only thing that is
improved<00:02:17.700> on<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.060> weapon<00:02:18.240> is<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:19.230> damage

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
improved on this weapon is the damage

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.440 
improved on this weapon is the damage
and<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.950> one<00:02:20.400> other<00:02:20.670> thing<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.150> haven't

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
and the one other thing that I haven't

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.230 
and the one other thing that I haven't
mentioned<00:02:21.690> yet<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.920> other

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
mentioned yet is that the other

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.340 
mentioned yet is that the other
improvement<00:02:24.240> you<00:02:24.330> get<00:02:24.540> from<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.840> damage<00:02:25.170> is

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
improvement you get from the damage is

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.680 
improvement you get from the damage is
that<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.650> headshot<00:02:26.130> multiplier<00:02:26.280> goes<00:02:26.940> from

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
that the headshot multiplier goes from

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.590 
that the headshot multiplier goes from
one<00:02:27.990> point<00:02:28.230> four<00:02:28.560> times<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.130> 1.6<00:02:30.060> times<00:02:30.390> with

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
one point four times to 1.6 times with

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.300 
one point four times to 1.6 times with
this<00:02:30.750> variance<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.710> is<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.040> only

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
this variance so that is the only

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.130 
this variance so that is the only
variant<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:32.970> does<00:02:33.210> that<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:33.540> with<00:02:33.720> this<00:02:33.870> gun

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
variant that does that so with this gun

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.930 
variant that does that so with this gun
you're<00:02:34.350> gonna<00:02:34.530> aim<00:02:34.800> for<00:02:34.830> headshots<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.670> if

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
you're gonna aim for headshots and if

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.970 
you're gonna aim for headshots and if
you<00:02:36.060> do<00:02:36.240> so<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.690> might<00:02:37.260> get<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.470> two<00:02:37.650> bullet

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
you do so you might get a two bullet

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.520 
you do so you might get a two bullet
kill<00:02:38.160> which<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.430> super<00:02:38.700> super<00:02:39.060> super

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
kill which is super super super

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.530 
kill which is super super super
incredible<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.400> giving<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:42.030> very<00:02:42.300> very

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
incredible so this giving is very very

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.640 
incredible so this giving is very very
good<00:02:42.720> if<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.050> want<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.290> know<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.380> best

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
good if you want to know the best

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.310 
good if you want to know the best
variant<00:02:44.070> overall<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:44.880> is<00:02:45.060> either<00:02:45.510> probably

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
variant overall it is either probably

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.320 
variant overall it is either probably
the<00:02:46.709> bacon<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:47.190> eggs<00:02:47.370> or<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.970> meat<00:02:48.209> and

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
the bacon and eggs or the meat and

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.510 
the bacon and eggs or the meat and
potatoes<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:49.080> love<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.530> variant<00:02:50.130> names<00:02:50.310> for

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
potatoes I love that variant names for

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.000 
potatoes I love that variant names for
this<00:02:50.610> gun<00:02:50.820> but<00:02:51.600> anyway<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.320> reason<00:02:52.500> why<00:02:52.739> I<00:02:52.770> say

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
this gun but anyway the reason why I say

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.280 
this gun but anyway the reason why I say
that<00:02:53.040> is<00:02:53.190> because<00:02:53.310> yes<00:02:54.180> if<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.630> notice<00:02:55.110> the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
that is because yes if you notice the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.020 
that is because yes if you notice the
recoil<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.920> bacon<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.340> eggs<00:02:56.550> isn't<00:02:56.790> very

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
recoil the bacon and eggs isn't very

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.210 
recoil the bacon and eggs isn't very
good<00:02:57.180> but<00:02:57.239> I<00:02:57.510> don't<00:02:57.840> if<00:02:58.050> you<00:02:58.440> do<00:02:58.620> notice<00:02:58.860> it<00:02:59.100> the

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
good but I don't if you do notice it the

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.470 
good but I don't if you do notice it the
meat<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.520> potatoes<00:02:59.580> is<00:03:00.030> pretty<00:03:00.270> much<00:03:00.420> the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
meat and potatoes is pretty much the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.810 
meat and potatoes is pretty much the
same<00:03:00.840> thing<00:03:00.900> except<00:03:01.890> instead<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.250> twenty-five

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
same thing except instead of twenty-five

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.280 
same thing except instead of twenty-five
percent<00:03:03.030> more<00:03:03.360> recoil<00:03:03.600> it's<00:03:03.840> only<00:03:04.080> ten

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
percent more recoil it's only ten

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.110 
percent more recoil it's only ten
percent<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:05.070> only<00:03:05.310> difference<00:03:05.489> is<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.880> don't

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
percent the only difference is you don't

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.090 
percent the only difference is you don't
get<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:06.510> one<00:03:06.690> point<00:03:06.930> six<00:03:07.230> times<00:03:07.590> headshot

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
get that one point six times headshot

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.040 
get that one point six times headshot
multiplier<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.730> like<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.390> one<00:03:09.570> point<00:03:09.840> six

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
multiplier I like that one point six

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.170 
multiplier I like that one point six
times<00:03:10.739> headshot<00:03:11.190> multiplier<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:11.880> don't

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
times headshot multiplier and I don't

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.660 
times headshot multiplier and I don't
notice<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.660> extra<00:03:12.780> coil<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:13.890> i<00:03:14.130> prefer<00:03:14.640> the

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
notice the extra coil so i prefer the
