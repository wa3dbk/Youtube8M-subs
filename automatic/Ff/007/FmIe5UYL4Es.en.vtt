00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.230 
is a lazy susan and then I put this on
just<00:00:09.690> so<00:00:09.929> that<00:00:10.110> my<00:00:10.139> tray<00:00:11.040> doesn't<00:00:11.099> slide<00:00:11.700> this

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
just so that my tray doesn't slide this

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.530 
just so that my tray doesn't slide this
tray<00:00:12.540> goes<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.590> my<00:00:13.679> go<00:00:13.799> hydrator<00:00:14.219> this<00:00:14.610> was<00:00:14.849> an

tray goes to my go hydrator this was an

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.800 
tray goes to my go hydrator this was an
idea<00:00:15.900> from<00:00:16.139> Wailua<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.130> it's<00:00:18.060> it's<00:00:18.480> amazing

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
idea from Wailua and it's it's amazing

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.370 
idea from Wailua and it's it's amazing
but<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:20.010> generally<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.699> start<00:00:21.240> out<00:00:21.390> with<00:00:22.020> I

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
but in generally I start out with I

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
don't worry about the top because that

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.070 
don't worry about the top because that
gets<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.900> trim

with small bags as you can see this is a
very<00:01:12.850> large<00:01:13.320> canvas<00:01:14.320> bag<00:01:14.560> but<00:01:15.520> it<00:01:16.060> works

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
very large canvas bag but it works

part<00:01:20.650> of<00:01:20.680> my<00:01:20.800> hands<00:01:20.979> were<00:01:21.160> shaking<00:01:21.190> just<00:01:21.610> like

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
part of my hands were shaking just like

part of my hands were shaking just like
that<00:01:23.550> also<00:01:24.550> in<00:01:25.450> another<00:01:25.960> tutorial<00:01:26.229> I<00:01:26.770> show<00:01:27.750> how

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
that also in another tutorial I show how

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.450 
that also in another tutorial I show how
to<00:01:28.810> vibrate<00:01:29.260> the<00:01:29.380> bubbles<00:01:29.680> out<00:01:29.800> of<00:01:29.860> your<00:01:30.070> icing

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
to vibrate the bubbles out of your icing

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.640 
to vibrate the bubbles out of your icing
knock<00:01:31.180> on<00:01:31.360> wood<00:01:31.570> I<00:01:31.810> very<00:01:32.080> seldom<00:01:32.320> ever

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
knock on wood I very seldom ever

something<00:01:33.100> I<00:01:33.250> sing<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.930> a<00:01:34.960> bag<00:01:35.170> this<00:01:35.410> size

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
something I sing with a bag this size

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.990 
something I sing with a bag this size
you'll<00:01:35.830> find<00:01:36.010> that<00:01:36.100> if<00:01:36.220> you<00:01:36.340> get<00:01:36.490> towards<00:01:36.850> the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
you'll find that if you get towards the

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.450 
you'll find that if you get towards the
bottom<00:01:37.420> of<00:01:37.510> the<00:01:37.600> bag<00:01:37.780> you<00:01:38.650> get<00:01:38.830> more<00:01:38.979> bubbles<00:01:39.369> I

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
bottom of the bag you get more bubbles I

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.410 
bottom of the bag you get more bubbles I
don't<00:01:39.610> know<00:01:39.670> why<00:01:39.820> that<00:01:39.970> is

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
don't know why that is

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.320 
don't know why that is
I<00:01:40.590> usually<00:01:41.590> just<00:01:41.800> dump<00:01:42.610> that<00:01:42.640> back<00:01:42.910> into<00:01:43.119> the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
I usually just dump that back into the

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.230 
I usually just dump that back into the
regular<00:01:43.720> icing<00:01:44.310> mix<00:01:45.310> it<00:01:45.460> up<00:01:45.610> and<00:01:45.850> then<00:01:48.179> stir<00:01:49.179> it

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
regular icing mix it up and then stir it

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.190 
regular icing mix it up and then stir it
again<00:01:49.479> with<00:01:49.660> our<00:01:50.440> vibrate<00:01:50.950> if<00:01:51.070> you<00:01:51.190> have<00:01:51.369> to

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
again with our vibrate if you have to

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.719 
again with our vibrate if you have to
this<00:01:53.200> is<00:01:53.380> a<00:01:53.410> fast<00:01:53.710> enough<00:01:53.890> process<00:01:54.490> that

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
this is a fast enough process that

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.410 
this is a fast enough process that
rather<00:01:55.060> than<00:01:55.330> then<00:01:55.780> go<00:01:56.080> through<00:01:56.380> and<00:01:57.240> hook<00:01:58.240> out

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
rather than then go through and hook out

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.480 
rather than then go through and hook out
bubbles<00:01:58.750> if<00:01:58.869> you<00:01:58.990> do<00:01:59.140> get<00:01:59.320> them<00:01:59.470> I<00:01:59.649> do<00:02:00.190> all<00:02:00.399> the

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
bubbles if you do get them I do all the

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.860 
bubbles if you do get them I do all the
cookies<00:02:00.759> and<00:02:00.940> then<00:02:01.060> go<00:02:01.210> back<00:02:01.450> through

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.780 

they'd<00:02:05.410> like<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:05.740> see<00:02:06.130> where<00:02:06.580> they're<00:02:06.700> gonna

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
they'd like to see where they're gonna

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.310 
they'd like to see where they're gonna
settle<00:02:07.210> before<00:02:07.390> I<00:02:07.570> waste<00:02:07.750> my<00:02:07.960> time<00:02:08.170> trying<00:02:08.470> to

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
settle before I waste my time trying to

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.050 
settle before I waste my time trying to
pop<00:02:11.320> bubbles<00:02:11.710> and<00:02:11.860> in<00:02:12.070> general<00:02:12.490> this<00:02:12.610> icing

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
pop bubbles and in general this icing

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.660 
pop bubbles and in general this icing
the<00:02:13.210> way<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.360> make<00:02:14.170> my<00:02:14.380> flood<00:02:14.710> you<00:02:15.370> don't<00:02:15.520> have

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
the way I make my flood you don't have

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.360 
the way I make my flood you don't have
to<00:02:15.850> shake<00:02:16.570> out<00:02:16.750> each<00:02:16.900> cookie<00:02:17.350> I<00:02:17.680> mean

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
to shake out each cookie I mean

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.320 
to shake out each cookie I mean
certainly<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:18.760> can<00:02:19.090> but<00:02:19.390> I<00:02:20.970> guess<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.180> this

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
certainly you can but I guess that this

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.900 
certainly you can but I guess that this
is<00:02:22.510> more<00:02:22.690> for<00:02:23.310> mass-produced<00:02:24.310> if<00:02:24.520> you<00:02:24.610> have<00:02:24.820> an

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
is more for mass-produced if you have an

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.620 
is more for mass-produced if you have an
order<00:02:25.240> of<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.660> hundred<00:02:26.190> wedding<00:02:27.190> cookies<00:02:27.580> or<00:02:28.570> if

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
order of a hundred wedding cookies or if

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.370 
order of a hundred wedding cookies or if
you<00:02:28.720> want<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.900> make<00:02:29.020> your<00:02:29.110> own<00:02:29.230> wedding

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380

cookies<00:02:29.770> they<00:02:29.890> do<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.990> anyway<00:02:32.640> don't<00:02:33.640> so<00:02:34.240> yeah

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
cookies they do it anyway don't so yeah

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.060

generally<00:02:34.810> by<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.170> time<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:35.410> get<00:02:35.560> towards<00:02:35.980> the

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
generally by the time I get towards the

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.590 
generally by the time I get towards the
end<00:02:36.190> they've<00:02:36.550> already<00:02:36.700> settled<00:02:37.210> if<00:02:37.330> I<00:02:37.420> have

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600

any<00:02:37.750> bubbles<00:02:38.140> as<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.350> can<00:02:38.530> see<00:02:38.680> this<00:02:38.830> flood

any bubbles as you can see this flood

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.120 
any bubbles as you can see this flood
just<00:02:39.370> settled<00:02:40.260> perfectly<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.740> can<00:02:41.800> drag

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
just settled perfectly you can drag

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.650 
just settled perfectly you can drag
anything<00:02:42.520> to<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.730> corners

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
anything to the corners

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.900 
anything to the corners
I<00:02:43.720> don't<00:02:44.260> just<00:02:44.530> put<00:02:44.830> my<00:02:44.980> icing<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.580> I<00:02:45.700> try<00:02:45.880> to

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
I don't just put my icing and I try to

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.040 
I don't just put my icing and I try to
get<00:02:46.090> as<00:02:46.240> close<00:02:46.360> to<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.720> edge<00:02:46.840> as<00:02:46.990> possible

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
get as close to the edge as possible

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.960 
get as close to the edge as possible
because<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.800> like<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.160> look<00:02:48.310> of<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.580> that<00:02:48.760> way

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
because I like the look of it that way

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.510 
because I like the look of it that way
but<00:02:49.320> pretty<00:02:50.320> much<00:02:52.890> that's<00:02:53.890> what<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.220> get<00:02:54.340> and

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
but pretty much that's what you get and

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.160 
but pretty much that's what you get and
then<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:54.790> can<00:02:54.970> go<00:02:55.090> from<00:02:55.270> here<00:02:55.510> to<00:02:55.570> the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
then I can go from here to the

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.780 
then I can go from here to the
dehydrator<00:02:56.740> and<00:02:57.550> ready<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.000> go<00:02:58.150> thank<00:02:58.720> you
