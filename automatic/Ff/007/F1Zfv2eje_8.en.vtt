00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.360
 hello everyone I'm jose and in this video 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:10.160
 I'm going to open 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.380
 a box of 18 envelopes 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.410
 of the expansion of the card game 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:19.270
 collectibles of pokemon borders 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.940
 crusades in Spanish 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.420
 I have another box of these borders 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:29.560
 crossed and I have two plasma storm 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.970
 the salt will go in the near future too 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.329
 I have an announcement to make 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:39.260
 from now on the channel is going to be more 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:42.670
 directed towards analysis items 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.510
 cards analysis of decks analysis of 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.760
 new expansions that will come out 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.690
 etcetera that openings 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:54.519
 this means that 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.350
 the openings will continue to be raised to 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:00.730
 same rhythm that are being raised is 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.510
 now about a week or so can 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.549
 what else 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.799
 in between instead of you do not do any 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.680
 video because I thought that I could upload 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.780
 the videos of my games that I do for 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.060
 try mallets that's all it does not mean 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.159
 that is not going to do more openings like that 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.020
 do not worry because you will have the 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.509
 two types of videos 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.869
 I will also do what is called the letter 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.460
 of the day I'll pick up a letter too 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.619
 I will accept petitions if you want 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.280
 analyze a particular letter through 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:36.469
 about its characteristics life cost of 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:39.140
 withdrawal attacks etcetera and if I can 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.329
 I will make a deck in which I play that card 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.850
 and I will upload a game to prove 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:46.010
 that letter is useful or not and we will draw a 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.620
 conclusion 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.900
 I will do analysis of expansions like 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:55.560
 said is to say now in august goes to 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:59.040
 leave the boards on the 14th when it leaves 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.420
 I will present you in bb search the letters 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.630
 I think that is ten 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.270
 better and I would tell you about them what 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.800
 everyone does what makes each the 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.390
 possible combos etcetera and I also have 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.680
 an important announcement to make and is 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.750
 that quite possibly almost 90% I'm going to 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.360
 go to the world of pokemon cards in 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.750
 Vancouver Canada 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.520
 this is an excuse for my family and 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.730
 I can take a trip and well these 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.730
 holidays 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:36.940
 and go back to Canada that we like a lot and 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:39.130
 so I take advantage and I try to have 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.380
 luck and participate in the World Cup to 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.610
 through the big ones that are rounds in 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.330
 what I think you have to do 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.720
 six games won and 00 lost for 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.150
 win an invitation to the world tournament 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.310
 since the current system is going you receive 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.100
 an invitation if you have enough 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.570
 points in the game organized but as 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.510
 in spain we have not played organized 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.200
 since obviously no Spanish receives 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.209
 an invitation 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.790
 and so that's what I'm going to go to 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:12.230
 worldwide very probably I am very 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.450
 excited with that and I'm going to upload videos 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.610
 of analysis letters games 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.959
 expansions and so on and let's see this 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.420
 letter this cross border box in 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:28.110
 Spanish 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:31.140
 and I have caught if you know me you know that 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.890
 once I said that this expansion did not 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.210
 I liked it and it was true I did not like anything 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.280
 but 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.680
 to the holiday state and observe more 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.270
 closely letters there because I have been 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.580
 realized that combos can be made 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.970
 pretty good and not only with the 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:53.150
 typical that may be that the finger and not 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.150
 I know what else is here that is very typical 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.599
 well 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.390
 I do not remember very well what came out 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.470
 exactly like that in toys not only 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.200
 with that of the toys in 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.940
 a darys closet but there is also very 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.750
 good cards that have their use and their 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.550
 utility 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.280
 I'll make them let mallets 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.570
 so I start with this and not for 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.130
 plasma storm that life and 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.000
 soon because I need also 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.299
 letters of support and other things as 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.299
 let's see 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.690
 of the envelopes I think directly because 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.169
 if it's not going to be a bit heavy and I'll go 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.120
 opening envelopes 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.720
 without doing the trick is to put the 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.120
 letters at the end to buy time 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.280
 then the code 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:45.410
 there are no contests harness 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.470
 the one with the best online 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.500
 for example 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.680
 that is an original deck that is not a 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.160
 known mallet 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.949
 then it will take some code about two or 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.600
 three how can any letter that 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:04.600
 I have spare 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.880
 let's see in this phone envelope is 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.210
 sounding but I do not care in this envelope 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:14.800
 we have album abbey energy search 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.190
 arcimboldo and dove without show the ibex those 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.830
 awards 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.120
 the network of the graph is a 6 which 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.040
 it's okay 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.820
 firefox and message 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.970
 a wolf or nobody left that seconds 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.970
 on 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:38.480
 al andalus the code then that's 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.880
 I will make this series of contests the idea 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.050
 principal is that as I said with the 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.620
 do the trick but since I am 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:49.000
 doing so I do 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.110
 here we have google cotton and silver 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.240
 is 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.820
 blitzer 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:59.300
 Felix 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:02.060
 firefox is Lord the chs is carl mori 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.810
 the rivas is bad eta and the rare is a 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.810
 fast man 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.480
 from the envelope 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:25.160
 here we have two cool 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.750
 vp 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.889
 position I did not know they had made 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:33.500
 in this barrel set it is point that the finger 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.260
 rivers 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:39.050
 the rare one is a loud toxic we have it a 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:41.720
 parapet and a simple spice that 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:46.000
 called the ngöbe gym and a map is 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.000
 good to know the prizes you have 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.750
 the next about 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.880
 what I mainly look for here in this 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:59.680
 bone the jealous collection is that it is 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:02.530

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:32.530
 accountants and an accountant sorry 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.530
 sad feels about 

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:41.939
 I 'm not going to do the trick
