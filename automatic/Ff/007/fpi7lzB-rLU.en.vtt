00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.050 

the<00:01:45.680> scary<00:01:46.039> part<00:01:46.130> is<00:01:46.520> that<00:01:46.670> it<00:01:46.789> will<00:01:46.880> probably

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
the scary part is that it will probably

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.499 
the scary part is that it will probably
be<00:01:47.390> at<00:01:47.570> least<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:48.110> month<00:01:48.880> before<00:01:49.880> I<00:01:50.119> can<00:01:50.329> take

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
be at least a month before I can take

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.789 
be at least a month before I can take
these<00:01:50.750> things<00:01:51.020> outside<00:01:53.590> so<00:01:54.590> I'm<00:01:54.679> gonna

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
these things outside so I'm gonna

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.480 
these things outside so I'm gonna
replant<00:01:55.399> them<00:01:55.670> or<00:01:56.060> repot<00:01:56.509> them<00:01:56.689> and<00:01:57.490> probably

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
replant them or repot them and probably

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.219 
replant them or repot them and probably
have<00:01:58.729> them<00:01:58.909> growing<00:01:59.210> halfway<00:01:59.689> across<00:01:59.929> my

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
have them growing halfway across my

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.690 
have them growing halfway across my
basement<00:02:00.530> before<00:02:01.039> I<00:02:01.100> can<00:02:01.280> even<00:02:01.429> take<00:02:01.549> them

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
basement before I can even take them

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.200 
basement before I can even take them
outside<00:02:03.280> same<00:02:04.280> way<00:02:04.460> with<00:02:04.610> all<00:02:04.759> those<00:02:04.909> zucchini
