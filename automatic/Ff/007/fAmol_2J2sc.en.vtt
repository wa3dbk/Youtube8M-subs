don't be disappointed if you get it I
mean<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:34.559> only<00:00:34.710> about<00:00:34.920> as<00:00:35.130> long<00:00:35.309> as<00:00:35.460> my<00:00:35.579> metal

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
mean it's only about as long as my metal

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.799 
mean it's only about as long as my metal
finger<00:00:36.120> there<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.920> tiny<00:00:38.129> little<00:00:38.309> thing

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
finger there so it's a tiny little thing

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.209 
finger there so it's a tiny little thing
the<00:00:39.809> thumb<00:00:40.050> studs<00:00:40.350> on<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.920> my<00:00:41.070> opinion

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
the thumb studs on this in my opinion

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.000 
the thumb studs on this in my opinion
are<00:00:41.579> pretty<00:00:41.790> much<00:00:41.940> useless<00:00:42.899> okay<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.739> don't

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
are pretty much useless okay I don't

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.049 
are pretty much useless okay I don't
even<00:00:44.070> know<00:00:44.219> why<00:00:44.340> they<00:00:44.460> put<00:00:44.489> them<00:00:44.700> on<00:00:44.789> there

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
even know why they put them on there

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.569 
even know why they put them on there
because<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.079> can't<00:00:46.379> get<00:00:47.100> your<00:00:47.219> thumb<00:00:47.550> on

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
because you can't get your thumb on

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.069 
because you can't get your thumb on
there<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.300> almost<00:00:48.420> done<00:00:48.660> safe<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.020> open

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
there and it's almost done safe to open

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.229 
there and it's almost done safe to open
it<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.500> way<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:49.710> if<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.550> use<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.670> paddle<00:00:51.180> on

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
it that way so if you use the paddle on

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.760 
it that way so if you use the paddle on
the<00:00:51.300> back<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.780> does<00:00:51.960> open<00:00:52.079> very<00:00:52.410> very<00:00:52.920> quickly

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
the back it does open very very quickly

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.139 
the back it does open very very quickly
it's<00:00:55.770> kind<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.309> hard<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.520> get<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.699> grip<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.059> a

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
it's kind of hard to get a grip on a

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.610 
it's kind of hard to get a grip on a
specialist<00:00:57.539> if<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.840> had<00:00:57.960> sweaty<00:00:58.289> hands

there's no jumping at all on the handles
maybe<00:01:01.440> two<00:01:01.710> three<00:01:01.920> fingers<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.550> know

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.050 
that may be part of it price range on
this<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.409> actually<00:01:52.649> bought<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.430> knife<00:01:53.670> with

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
this I actually bought this knife with

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.880 
this I actually bought this knife with
the<00:01:54.240> holster<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.140> think<00:01:55.350> with<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> holster

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
the holster and I think with the holster

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.569 
the holster and I think with the holster
i<00:01:55.920> paid<00:01:56.130> about<00:01:56.250> 30<00:01:56.670> bucks<00:01:56.909> shipped<00:01:57.710> which<00:01:58.710> to

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
i paid about 30 bucks shipped which to

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.889 
i paid about 30 bucks shipped which to
me<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.790> seemed<00:02:00.030> almost<00:02:00.119> like<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.450> little<00:02:00.689> bit<00:02:00.810> of

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
me it seemed almost like a little bit of

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.719 
me it seemed almost like a little bit of
a<00:02:00.990> lot<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.350> pay<00:02:01.500> for<00:02:01.530> such<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.159> small<00:02:02.369> little

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
a lot to pay for such a small little

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.959 
a lot to pay for such a small little
knife<00:02:03.229> but<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.500> guess<00:02:05.310> if<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.549> compare<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:05.880> to

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
knife but I guess if you compare it to

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.869 
knife but I guess if you compare it to
like<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.090> sog<00:02:06.360> twitch<00:02:06.659> one<00:02:06.990> or<00:02:07.530> blink<00:02:07.950> size

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
like a sog twitch one or blink size

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.630

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.900 
is a good choice for that a knife comes
out<00:02:31.740> really<00:02:32.010> quick<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.490> was<00:02:32.580> one<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.850> my

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
out really quick to that was one of my

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.580 
out really quick to that was one of my
concerns<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.420> did<00:02:33.540> hold<00:02:33.690> at<00:02:33.900> type<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.260> was

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
concerns it did hold at type I was

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.420 
concerns it did hold at type I was
worried<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:34.830> wouldn't<00:02:35.010> come<00:02:35.160> out<00:02:35.220> without

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
worried it wouldn't come out without

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.400 
worried it wouldn't come out without
pulling<00:02:35.670> pulling<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.600> clip<00:02:36.810> out<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.080> off<00:02:37.230> the

pulling pulling the clip out it off the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.160 
pulling pulling the clip out it off the
pocket<00:02:37.860> but<00:02:38.490> it<00:02:38.820> actually<00:02:39.030> seemed<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.900> hold<00:02:39.990> it

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
pocket but it actually seemed to hold it

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.810 
pocket but it actually seemed to hold it
in<00:02:40.230> there<00:02:40.320> pretty<00:02:40.380> good<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:41.250> construction

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
in there pretty good the construction

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.030 
in there pretty good the construction
the<00:02:42.450> construction<00:02:42.480> of<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:45.480> nut<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.750> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
the construction of the the nut of the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.830 
the construction of the the nut of the
holster<00:02:47.040> itself<00:02:47.700> i<00:02:47.850> would<00:02:48.030> say<00:02:48.270> is<00:02:49.730> good<00:02:50.840> very

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840

holster itself i would say is good very
good<00:02:52.050> could<00:02:52.860> be<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.010> lot<00:02:53.220> better<00:02:54.320> but<00:02:55.320> for<00:02:55.620> such

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
good could be a lot better but for such
