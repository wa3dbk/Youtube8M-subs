00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.979
 about 70 pesos 45 kilos 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.400
 I am not anorexic as some believe 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.919
 I do not love myself 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:24.990
 I do not feel comfortable with my body 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.990
 I can not look in the mirror without being firm 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.789
 i 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.800
 what can be done when nobody understands 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.940
 that you feel sad to have a 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.940
 34 of the pants 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.559
 I know that everyone aspires to that 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.640
 but I'm not happy 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.110
 I'm not like they do not want to go to 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.480
 buy my clothes and not find a 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.720
 size xs 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.650
 or not 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:11.930
 I do not want to be looked at with disgust 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.960
 because of my thinness I want to be happy 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.730
 and remove our complexes by having 45 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.230
 kilos 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:22.190
 I want to go out and say this I am 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.710
 me with my 45 kilos and I can with everything 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.440
 I want to stop feeling myself observed by 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.380
 all the world 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.469
 I'm not sick 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.039
 I have complexes like you but I want 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.039
 overcome them 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.250
 because I'm like you and of course 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.770
 I'm not a black sheep 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:52.090
 that nobody prevents you from being happy despite what 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.990
 It is that despite anyone stop you from deciding 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:59.820
 for yourself and above all that nobody 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:03.600
 judge your health without knowing you 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.300
 after all we are all victims of 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.390
 this fucking society let's think what 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.390
 let's think 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.350
 and nobody is a black sheep 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.350
 I'm not a black sheep
