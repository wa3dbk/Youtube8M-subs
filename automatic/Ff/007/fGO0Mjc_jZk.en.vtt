 In a 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:12.110
 It's just I'd think well it's you know the person who Zonchi

 I am fit everyone thank you tooth extraction focus is the guy 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.790
 I think this is what 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.790
 This I was will to go to detective 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.110
 How 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.870
 This button 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.160
 There 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.300
 Of course this is the guy of that power source 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.860
 this 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.860
 What is it? 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.920
 What comes with, such as the goods power 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:01:00.980
 This section describes the placement of the button in the Yes 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.980
 I 'm sorry more than once q button 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.250
 It is q button 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.689
 In the next 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.689
 Loop button 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.800
 the next one 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:22.950
 It is sample dispersion etc. It is Kaneko 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:24.890
 The user user is a frame that says that he should use anything appropriate for 22 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.310
 I wonder 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:32.240
 First 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.330
 2 No. 3 No. 4 No. 5 No. 6 No. 7 No. 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.670
 Stand 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.810
 Say 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.810
 The feeling is that there will be a button 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:50.600
 If you say what this is what you do, old people may feel like that 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.020
 I 'm sorry but recent people yes yes yes yes 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.039
 It may be like 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.039
 That's it for me 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.960
 scratch live 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.740
 is not it 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.730
 scratch live 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.080
 of 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:10.270
 I will be in the controller position and of course the tractor 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:16.819
 You can go with 2 scratch and yes 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:19.420
 Well in short right now it feels like yes 8 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.530
 This is a building 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:27.640
 Well now it's the screen with Edo seller 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.890
 midi controller the attached turntable to midi 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:36.740
 It will be with a controller 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:38.430
 In eight like a place where I'm what about me this idea 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.760
 There is a reason 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.550
 Migration also by people who have ever considered 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:49.060
 I think maybe it was not there 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:52.420
 So I'm worried about the vibration on the turntable 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.540
 Is not it or courted the needle jump and give 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.490
 Say was do what flame in also Toka such a place 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.040
 a 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:04.450
 The place I'm worried about 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.840
 I would like to do it for a while 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.840
 Bip 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.460
 Yes 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.850
 The box flows like this 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.440
 wood 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.020
 Ha 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.950
 re 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:26.150
 This is ok yes 8 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:31.230
 It's a great convenience but to 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:34.010
 Suddenly the place of 9 q button 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.010
 Make it light 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.290
 This is 1234 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.860
 56 7 up to or up to 5 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.310
 8 serato scratch live can be set up to 5 to 9 points 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.439
 so 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:51.450
 You can use from here to here in now 81 and already the 2 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:56.130
 Assigning 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:04:00.060
 In Etoh I wonder if I can do it now 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:03.380
 Would you like to be a little C'mon C'mon set 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.380
 Is it a new sentence? 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:12.040
 And if you press number 1 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:15.740
 Nde have most brought in to you I most the beginning of the song a sweat 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:19.540
 In 3rd place dad 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.540
 Dee example of course you are playing 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.540
 I feel like it's won 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.690
 Umma 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:46.910
 It is a feeling of yes 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:51.510
 In that we would like to one attention to everyone 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:57.600
 At all I'd had a two to quite how is I'm getting now 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:05:01.810
 It is feeling that there is no influence at all in this one 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:05.950
 In 8 Made up of Deaf lined fan for a long time 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:10.300
 It is a feeling that I feel dumb, I say that it is other than having turntable vibration 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:13.480
 It feels like it's getting lost, but there's something like scratch live there 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.950
 Anyway , I 'll do it with a tractor scratch 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.050
 8 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:21.349
 Time is coming now 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:26.659
 If it is a state that is normally sent satisfactorily 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:28.849
 It means that there is almost nothing to do with sound quality 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:30.610
 Because 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:35.229
 Oh dear 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.639
 To change the kind Well dvs scratch live Toka tractor scratch 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:40.990
 Therefore 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:47.340
 The turntable and this right Ikaki oil fusion was played 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:47.340
 I always had to Tteyuu'm okay to various operation on the turn table
