00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello everyone welcome to the channel 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.859
 easy game with you riza and today 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.290
 unusual to the real because many 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.330
 people ask questions in all sorts of forums 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.670
 how to play the two and became well 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.100
 sweet them on the same computer and in this 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.900
 little reviewers I'll tell you this 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.260
 because I was looking for the best in a long time 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.240
 all sorts of forums and so I found the answer 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.570
 you will first need a google browser 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.990
 chrome or opera there or everyone there 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:34.530
 mozilla firefox and so go to 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.059
 site 1 file sharing more precisely g canvas 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.559
 the link will be in the description and click 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.180
 download button on this file hosting service 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.129
 there are no viruses there and almost no advertising 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.260
 annoying to wait a minute 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.950
 more then captcha led you pushing 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.010
 download button and wait and now we have it 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.690
 downloaded and see xbox price and . rar 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.670
 you will need the archiver winrar and 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.820
 blackberry there any sort of archiver 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.649
 open and here we are given a hint 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.199
 need to throw these files 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.570
 where is with the game where is them and 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.720
 This is the game file I have in 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.820
 which file am i just moving here 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.380
 as I have already moved them I already have 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.270
 present so for me the shadow 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:22.439
 Although I can not worse, it will not be until all 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.390
 and it moves here and so 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.920
 should look like this 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.590
 here 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.810
 cast them and and here these two files should 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.790
 be in one daddy then you 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.970
 run either from here or through 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.450
 shortcut on the desktop lawsuit and run 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.030
 still a game and before how 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.939
 already enter the menu you should output a sound 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.579
 so I bought a shorter sound 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.759
 so systemic you immediately recognize it 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.729
 Means that this split joystick and you about 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.490
 escalator to these ios files should be 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.040
 good and everything will go to play at all 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.689
 two just go into any mode and 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.140
 select characters click on the joystick 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.390
 button a or just inter or struck there 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.729
 and you will be fine 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.580
 everything is good and you can calmly play 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.500
 without lags and everything like that so everyone 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.890
