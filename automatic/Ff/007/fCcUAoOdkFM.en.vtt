like<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.720> here's<00:00:33.720> the<00:00:33.960> trick<00:00:35.330> underneath

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330 
like that here's the trick underneath

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.840 
like that here's the trick underneath
your<00:00:36.540> seat<00:00:38.570> if<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.630> have<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.960> vader's<00:00:40.700> it<00:00:41.700> has

your seat if you have the vader's it has

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.100 
your seat if you have the vader's it has
this<00:00:42.000> little<00:00:42.150> extension<00:00:42.390> if<00:00:42.780> not<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
this little extension if not the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.740 
this little extension if not the
probably<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.560> this<00:00:43.710> bracket<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:45.180> bracket

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
probably just this bracket this bracket

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.130 
probably just this bracket this bracket
here<00:00:45.990> is<00:00:46.110> held<00:00:46.380> down<00:00:46.590> by<00:00:46.650> four<00:00:49.160> bolts<00:00:51.140> okay

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
here is held down by four bolts okay

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.240 
here is held down by four bolts okay
they<00:00:52.350> are<00:00:52.470> a<00:00:52.500> Torx<00:00:53.210> thirty<00:00:54.860> you<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.100> get

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
they are a Torx thirty you have to get

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.810 
they are a Torx thirty you have to get
in<00:00:56.370> between<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.820> cushion<00:00:57.210> here<00:00:58.580> while<00:00:59.580> it's

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
in between the cushion here while it's

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.550 
in between the cushion here while it's
still<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.150> the<00:01:00.240> car<00:01:00.450> and<00:01:00.720> take<00:01:00.960> those<00:01:01.230> four

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 
still in the car and take those four

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.380 
still in the car and take those four
bolts<00:01:01.950> on<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.190> which<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.580> pretty<00:01:02.850> tricky<00:01:03.090> put

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
bolts on this which is pretty tricky put

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.870 
bolts on this which is pretty tricky put
the<00:01:03.510> one<00:01:03.630> all<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> way<00:01:03.960> across<00:01:04.640> one<00:01:05.640> little

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the one all the way across one little

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.389 
the one all the way across one little
tip<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.420> if<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.719> do<00:01:07.109> it<00:01:07.289> start<00:01:08.039> with<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.189> one

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
tip is if you do it start with the one

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:09.709 
tip is if you do it start with the one
closest<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.149> as<00:01:09.359> you<00:01:09.479> go<00:01:09.630> across

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:09.719 
closest to you and as you go across

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:12.770 
closest to you and as you go across
you'll<00:01:10.679> get<00:01:10.859> more<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.219> more<00:01:11.369> space<00:01:11.719> this<00:01:12.719> is

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
you'll get more and more space this is

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.800 
you'll get more and more space this is
what<00:01:12.929> they<00:01:13.170> look<00:01:13.320> like

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
what they look like

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.190 
what they look like
torque<00:01:15.810> thirty<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.880> t30<00:01:18.329> Torx<00:01:18.689> screw<00:01:18.960> and

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
torque thirty the t30 Torx screw and

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.819 
torque thirty the t30 Torx screw and
they're<00:01:20.009> screwed<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.429> just<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.829> that's

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
they're screwed in just like that that's

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:28.880 
they're screwed in just like that that's
the<00:01:23.159> location<00:01:23.520> one<00:01:23.850> here<00:01:24.859> here<00:01:26.450> here<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.890> here

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the location one here here here in here

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.109 
the location one here here here in here
so<00:01:29.069> that's<00:01:29.219> how<00:01:29.399> you<00:01:29.460> have<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.700> reach<00:01:29.850> them<00:01:30.030> up

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
so that's how you have to reach them up

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.419 
so that's how you have to reach them up
underneath<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.749> they're<00:01:30.869> holding<00:01:31.079> down<00:01:31.429> this

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
underneath and they're holding down this

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.069 
underneath and they're holding down this
metal<00:01:32.819> bracket<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.450> middle<00:01:33.719> page<00:01:33.899> you<00:01:34.049> have

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
metal bracket this middle page you have

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.899 
metal bracket this middle page you have
to<00:01:34.200> go<00:01:34.289> in<00:01:34.409> between<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.710> pushing<00:01:35.130> here<00:01:35.399> then

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
to go in between the pushing here then

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.899 
to go in between the pushing here then
this<00:01:36.030> metal<00:01:36.299> bracket<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.780> loosen<00:01:37.590> those<00:01:37.740> up

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
this metal bracket and loosen those up

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.380 
this metal bracket and loosen those up
once<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.060> get<00:01:39.210> those<00:01:39.450> out<00:01:40.789> there's<00:01:41.789> two<00:01:42.119> more
