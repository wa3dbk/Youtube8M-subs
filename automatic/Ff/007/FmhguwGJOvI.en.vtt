00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.720
 68 UN General Assembly sessions and in style and 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.189
 in content was very different from 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.590
 what we used to see on this 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.509
 international president of usa 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.299
 which traditionally feels on 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.180
 meeting to he as master this time 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.430
 looked uncertainly why his 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.430
 heavily criticized the American not 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.670
 Athos and current neighbors on assembly 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.900
 turned into a public spanking of Obama 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.179
 wrote a commentator went stender 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.790
 charleses crowd hummer president 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.649
 looked like a beaten dog and constantly 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.899
 justified for the action of the United States 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.910
 But if he behaved on the world 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.010
 the arena is a bit more strongly criticized 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.590
 America would hardly have looked up 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.140
 on the eve of the meeting broke out loud 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.030
 scandal member of the Venezuelan delegation 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.309
 did not issue US visas 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.660
 and it happened right after that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.910
 how the united states refused 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.000
 pass through the American air 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.070
 the territory of the plane of the president of venezuela 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.809
 Nicolas Maduro who was heading to 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.820
 China 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.510
 the visa was also not received by members of the Ecuadorian 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.010
 delegations 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.020
 who were to perform on 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.970
 General Assembly meeting with a report on 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.010
 environmental pollution 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.010
 american oil company chevron 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.799
 the text maduro declared that the Americans are leading 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.320
 themselves as if they were masters of a 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.869
 he does not hesitate to violate the Viennese 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.270
 convention which obliges them to allow 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.070
 at the meeting of the General Assembly of all members 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.710
 delegations of foreign countries 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.659
 regardless of the state of the US relationship with 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.340
 their countries session began with 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.979
 emotional speech of the president 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.340
 Brazil Dilma Rusov who sued 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.750
 us for electronic espionage and 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.159
 recommended obama apologize to 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.380
 of the world 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.270
 Obama did not heed her advice devoting his 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.820
 speech to justify american 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.390
 exclusivity 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.570
 felt what he wanted 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.070
 to refute the words of the Russian leader 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.950
 allowed himself to doubt the special 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.729
 US rights on the world stage to intercept 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.049
 Putin's initiative Obama narcissus writes 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.119
 magazine nco americans 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.490
 who can't come to terms with that 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.649
 someone managed to beat him and let 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.450
 even temporarily relegate to the background 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:15.030
 with me still some possible with 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.220
 this does not agree but I think America and 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.069
 inclusive because we have shown 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.290
 willingness to donate blood and wealth not 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.849
 and defend not only their narrow 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.459
 interests but the interests of the whole world 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.599
 danger to the world will appear if the united states 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.970
 step aside and create 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:36.079
 vacuum which leadership is not ready 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.849
 fill in no other country 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:42.060
 consonants with Obama's philosophy turned 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:45.060
 much that essentially said the president of the us in 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.640
 he writes a journal neshny i ​​suzeren 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.239
 and you vassals I have exceptional 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.760
 none of you have rights 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.100
 This is a typical imperial approach. 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.690
 Chinese newspaper global times for 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.760
 there is no exclusive nation 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.430
 international law nor moral 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.769
 restrictions not state borders and 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.319
 very symbolic that obama subjected 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.299
 criticized the concept of sovereignty which 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.190
 defend Russia and China 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.230
 world community according to 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.200
 american president interested 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.480
 in the continuation of the Arab spring and Washington 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.239
 obliged to help democratize the neighbor 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.840
 using all possible 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.989
 leverage 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.299
 including military force if only 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.950
 America considers it fair any 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.430
 dictator should be punished 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.200
 Here perhaps the main thesis of Obama that 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.569
 concerns the Syrian crisis in his 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.139
 resolving the key role according to obama 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.430
 the efforts of the Russian diplomats did not play 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:44.549
 American threat to start military 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.799
 actions however insisting on the right of us 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.169
 use military force in their own way 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.060
 discretion as they already did in 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:53.370
 Yugoslavia Iraqi and Libya 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.810
 Obama undermines his image of the winner 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.940
 Nobel Peace Prize 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.680
 especially against the background of the diplomatic 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.750
 initiatives let her on syria and 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.150
 weighted speeches that are made in

 words began his speech leader

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.169
 creates them hopefully that connected 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.889
 states do not go the way that meets

 interests 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.570
 war mongering groups as opposed to 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.700
 its predecessor who 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.729
 famous for denying from the podium 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.550
 un fact holocaust ruhani uttered 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.280

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.650
 Iran is ready to negotiate with the West 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.970
 same earned for the new media nicknames anti

 UN General Assembly 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.050
 turned out to be very eventful but in 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.150
 first of all she will be remembered desperate 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.190
 Obama's desire to insist on 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.620
 exclusivity of the united states 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.260
 however, it was hardly possible 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.789
 choose the best stand
