00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
notably the sights on the guns so we're

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.950 
notably the sights on the guns so we're
going<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.520> break<00:00:17.670> down<00:00:17.790> the<00:00:17.850> reflex<00:00:18.360> the<00:00:18.599> ACOG

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
going to break down the reflex the ACOG

going to break down the reflex the ACOG
the<00:00:19.560> eotech<00:00:20.189> which<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.550> my<00:00:20.670> new<00:00:20.849> favorite<00:00:21.210> and

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
the eotech which is my new favorite and

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.570

we're<00:00:22.110> going<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.260> talk<00:00:22.439> about<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.740> hybrid<00:00:23.070> so

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
we're going to talk about the hybrid so

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.569 
we're going to talk about the hybrid so
couple<00:00:24.240> things<00:00:24.360> early<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:25.040> this<00:00:26.040> year<00:00:26.310> more

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:26.579 
couple things early on this year more

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.540 
couple things early on this year more
than<00:00:26.610> any<00:00:26.790> of<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.090> year<00:00:27.300> attachments<00:00:28.200> are

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
than any of the year attachments are

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.760 
than any of the year attachments are
allegedly<00:00:29.550> going<00:00:29.759> to<00:00:29.880> provide<00:00:30.270> a<00:00:30.599> bonus<00:00:31.590> to

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
allegedly going to provide a bonus to

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.560 
allegedly going to provide a bonus to
your<00:00:31.800> attached<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.520> your<00:00:32.700> accuracy<00:00:33.060> and<00:00:33.210> stuff

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
your attached to your accuracy and stuff

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.930 
your attached to your accuracy and stuff
so<00:00:34.079> let's<00:00:34.200> take<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.380> look<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.610> M<00:00:35.700> time

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
so let's take a look this is the M time

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.940 
so let's take a look this is the M time
with<00:00:36.090> no<00:00:36.210> attachments<00:00:36.810> obviously<00:00:37.680> if<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.890> is

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
with no attachments obviously if I is

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.520 
with no attachments obviously if I is
pretty<00:00:38.280> clean<00:00:38.460> anyways<00:00:38.850> not<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> lot<00:00:39.720> of<00:00:39.750> kick

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
pretty clean anyways not a lot of kick

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.680 
pretty clean anyways not a lot of kick
on<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.739> gun<00:00:40.950> as<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.910> I'm<00:00:42.450> going<00:00:42.630> to

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
on the gun as it is I'm going to

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.060 
on the gun as it is I'm going to
highlight<00:00:42.810> the<00:00:43.080> area<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.410> red<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:43.830> to<00:00:43.920> show

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
highlight the area in red just to show

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.510 
highlight the area in red just to show
you<00:00:44.990> what<00:00:45.990> the<00:00:46.110> spray<00:00:46.320> radius<00:00:46.680> was<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.370> let's

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
you what the spray radius was so let's

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.100 
you what the spray radius was so let's
take<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> look<00:00:47.850> at<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> MTA<00:00:48.360> me<00:00:48.540> down<00:00:48.750> scope

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
take a look at the MTA me down scope

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.590 
take a look at the MTA me down scope
with<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> reflex<00:00:50.460> sight<00:00:50.700> now<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.180> reflex

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
with the reflex sight now the reflex

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.000 
with the reflex sight now the reflex
sight<00:00:51.720> is<00:00:51.810> the<00:00:51.900> first<00:00:52.080> sight<00:00:52.320> unlocked<00:00:52.740> in<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
sight is the first sight unlocked in the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.940 
sight is the first sight unlocked in the
game<00:00:53.330> as<00:00:54.330> you<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.510> see<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.870> little<00:00:55.560> bit<00:00:55.740> of<00:00:55.800> an

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
game as you can see a little bit of an

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.160 
game as you can see a little bit of an
improvement<00:00:56.070> there<00:00:56.550> not<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> lot<00:00:57.540> not<00:00:57.780> not<00:00:58.050> as

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
improvement there not a lot not not as

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.680 
improvement there not a lot not not as
much<00:00:58.290> as<00:00:58.470> I<00:00:58.530> would<00:00:58.590> expect<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> amount<00:00:59.400> of

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
much as I would expect for the amount of

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.569 
much as I would expect for the amount of
accuracy<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.990> is<00:01:01.140> supposedly<00:01:01.680> gives<00:01:01.950> you<00:01:02.070> now

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
accuracy it is supposedly gives you now

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.460 
accuracy it is supposedly gives you now
let's<00:01:02.790> take<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.060> look<00:01:03.120> at<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> eotech<00:01:03.840> now<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
let's take a look at the eotech now the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.440 
let's take a look at the eotech now the
eotech<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.009> new<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.519> supposed<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.090> replace

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
eotech is new it's supposed to replace

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.359 
eotech is new it's supposed to replace
the<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:07.049> guess<00:01:07.950> what<00:01:08.070> would<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.250> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
the I guess what would be the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.880 
the I guess what would be the
holographic<00:01:08.790> sight<00:01:09.180> although<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.140> think<00:01:10.590> it

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
holographic sight although I think it

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.960 
holographic sight although I think it
gives<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.250> little<00:01:11.340> bit<00:01:11.460> more<00:01:11.610> than<00:01:11.820> that

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
gives you a little bit more than that

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.309 
gives you a little bit more than that
take<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> look<00:01:13.460> what<00:01:14.460> smaller<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.420> circle

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:16.319 
take a look what smaller of a circle

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:17.989 
take a look what smaller of a circle
there<00:01:16.499> to<00:01:17.189> demonstrate<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.819> much<00:01:17.969> more

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:17.999 
there to demonstrate it's a much more

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:20.389 
there to demonstrate it's a much more
accurate<00:01:18.299> gun<00:01:18.630> now<00:01:19.259> finally<00:01:19.829> we<00:01:19.890> got<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> ACOG

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
accurate gun now finally we got the ACOG

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.209 
accurate gun now finally we got the ACOG
now<00:01:20.579> the<00:01:20.640> ACOG<00:01:20.999> is<00:01:21.179> more<00:01:21.509> for<00:01:21.719> long-range

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.219 
now the ACOG is more for long-range

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:25.190 
now the ACOG is more for long-range
however<00:01:23.219> it<00:01:23.850> gives<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.539> accuracy<00:01:24.960> bonus

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
however it gives you accuracy bonus

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.319 
however it gives you accuracy bonus
according<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.950> title<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:26.939> let's<00:01:27.149> take<00:01:27.270> a

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
according to the title so let's take a

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.690 
according to the title so let's take a
look<00:01:27.539> and<00:01:27.960> as<00:01:28.649> you<00:01:28.770> can<00:01:28.889> see<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.130> really<00:01:29.249> it's

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
look and as you can see it's really it's

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.879 
look and as you can see it's really it's
a<00:01:29.789> lot<00:01:29.939> bigger<00:01:30.090> than<00:01:30.439> what<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.530> would<00:01:31.619> expect

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:31.889 
a lot bigger than what you would expect

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:34.760 
a lot bigger than what you would expect
from<00:01:32.009> an<00:01:32.189> acog<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.759> don't<00:01:33.060> know<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:34.590> then<00:01:34.710> we

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
from an acog I don't know and then we

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.879 
from an acog I don't know and then we
get<00:01:34.859> the<00:01:34.920> hybrid<00:01:35.369> which<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:36.319> back<00:01:37.319> from<00:01:37.530> modern

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:37.889 
get the hybrid which is back from modern

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.550 
get the hybrid which is back from modern
warfare<00:01:38.039> 3<00:01:38.219> it's<00:01:39.179> got<00:01:39.359> two<00:01:39.539> sites<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:40.289> is<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
warfare 3 it's got two sites this is the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.559 
warfare 3 it's got two sites this is the
reflex<00:01:40.950> portion<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.399> the<00:01:41.490> site<00:01:41.639> and<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.509> can

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
reflex portion of the site and you can

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.239 
reflex portion of the site and you can
see<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:43.079> didn't<00:01:43.469> give<00:01:43.590> me<00:01:43.679> all<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.920> bullets

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.249 
see I didn't give me all the bullets

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:46.459 
see I didn't give me all the bullets
spray<00:01:44.429> on<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.700> wall<00:01:44.969> there<00:01:45.179> but<00:01:45.389> you<00:01:46.289> get<00:01:46.409> the

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
spray on the wall there but you get the

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.980 
spray on the wall there but you get the
idea<00:01:46.729> smaller<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.999> noticed<00:01:48.630> with<00:01:48.749> this<00:01:48.869> one

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
idea smaller I noticed with this one

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.080 
idea smaller I noticed with this one
with<00:01:49.109> the<00:01:49.200> ACOG<00:01:49.530> there's<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.100> lot<00:01:50.280> less<00:01:50.490> kick<00:01:50.759> on

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
with the ACOG there's a lot less kick on

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.719 
with the ACOG there's a lot less kick on
the<00:01:51.119> ACOG<00:01:51.569> on<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.779> hybrid<00:01:52.109> for<00:01:53.009> some<00:01:53.189> reason<00:01:53.520> I

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
the ACOG on the hybrid for some reason I

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.099 
the ACOG on the hybrid for some reason I
don't<00:01:54.240> know<00:01:54.329> if<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.539> a<00:01:54.659> glitch<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:54.929> the

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109 
don't know if this is a glitch in the

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:57.260 
don't know if this is a glitch in the
game<00:01:55.139> but<00:01:55.590> I'll<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.639> look<00:01:56.789> into<00:01:56.999> the<00:01:57.090> further

I put the eotech up there again just so

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.190 
I put the eotech up there again just so
you<00:02:01.889> can<00:02:02.009> see<00:02:02.069> how<00:02:02.219> much<00:02:02.459> better<00:02:02.609> it<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.170> now<00:02:04.170> I

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
you can see how much better it is now I

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.599 
you can see how much better it is now I
broke<00:02:04.499> them<00:02:04.590> all<00:02:04.709> down<00:02:04.920> zoomed<00:02:05.279> in<00:02:05.490> and

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609 
broke them all down zoomed in and

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:07.399 
broke them all down zoomed in and
equally<00:02:05.939> in<00:02:06.119> all<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.389> them<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:07.109> can<00:02:07.229> see

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
equally in all of them and you can see

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.809 
equally in all of them and you can see
the<00:02:07.590> eotech<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.190> reflex<00:02:08.520> are<00:02:08.670> pretty

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
the eotech and the reflex are pretty

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.930 
the eotech and the reflex are pretty
close<00:02:09.349> I<00:02:10.349> just<00:02:11.039> felt<00:02:11.220> like<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.430> eotech<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:11.910> a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
close I just felt like the eotech have a

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.730 
close I just felt like the eotech have a
better<00:02:12.150> feel<00:02:12.360> for<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.410> guess<00:02:13.590> the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
better feel for it and I guess the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.110 
better feel for it and I guess the
