game and didn't break so that was the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:24.770 
game and didn't break so that was the
moment<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.699> decided<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.180> match

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:24.780 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.710 

he<00:00:25.350> played<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:26.070> well<00:00:26.100> in<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.520> first<00:00:26.790> set<00:00:27.210> it

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
he played so well in the first set it

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.390 
he played so well in the first set it
seemed<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.020> change<00:00:28.200> a<00:00:28.380> bit<00:00:28.530> in<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.770> second<00:00:29.190> set

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
seemed to change a bit in the second set

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.640 
seemed to change a bit in the second set
how<00:00:29.670> crucial<00:00:30.030> was<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.660> not<00:00:30.900> getting<00:00:31.410> up<00:00:31.620> that

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
how crucial was you not getting up that

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.290 
how crucial was you not getting up that
break<00:00:32.130> point<00:00:32.400> that<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.640> had<00:00:32.790> earlier<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.150> the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
break point that you had earlier in the

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.340 
break point that you had earlier in the
set<00:00:34.940> well<00:00:35.940> i<00:00:36.180> started<00:00:36.480> chance<00:00:36.810> and<00:00:37.080> the<00:00:37.140> third

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
set well i started chance and the third

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.770 
set well i started chance and the third
sir<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.770> mean<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.010> would<00:00:38.130> hope<00:00:38.310> that<00:00:38.510> one<00:00:39.510> game

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
sir I mean you would hope that one game

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.560 
sir I mean you would hope that one game
wouldn't<00:00:40.760> decide<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.910> outcome<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.420> whole

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
wouldn't decide the outcome of a whole

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.330 
wouldn't decide the outcome of a whole
match<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:43.050> mean<00:00:43.170> maybe<00:00:43.380> that<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.890> set<00:00:44.160> he

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
match I mean maybe that that set he

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.860 
match I mean maybe that that set he
started<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.730> play<00:00:44.880> a<00:00:44.910> bit<00:00:45.090> better<00:00:45.239> afterwards

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
started to play a bit better afterwards

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.049 
started to play a bit better afterwards
but<00:00:46.670> yeah<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.700> mean<00:00:47.730> he<00:00:47.940> hit<00:00:49.489> drive<00:00:50.489> volley<00:00:50.790> on

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
but yeah I mean he hit drive volley on

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.930 
but yeah I mean he hit drive volley on
the<00:00:51.180> back<00:00:51.390> edge<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.840> line<00:00:52.080> so<00:00:52.530> what<00:00:53.489> what

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
the back edge of the line so what what

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.229 
the back edge of the line so what what
my<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.150> do<00:00:54.360> about<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.629> not<00:00:55.200> much<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:56.239> he

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
my to do about that not much so he

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.970 
my to do about that not much so he
played<00:00:57.690> better<00:00:57.900> in<00:00:58.019> the<00:00:58.170> second<00:00:58.530> set<00:00:58.769> and<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
played better in the second set and the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:07.630 
played better in the second set and the
third<00:00:59.160> set<00:00:59.460> was<00:00:59.699> was<00:01:00.059> tight

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.870 

Andy<00:01:08.360> when<00:01:08.510> you<00:01:08.540> play<00:01:09.280> Novak<00:01:10.280> now<00:01:10.460> is<00:01:10.700> there

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
Andy when you play Novak now is there

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.230 
Andy when you play Novak now is there
almost<00:01:11.090> like<00:01:11.450> a<00:01:11.479> different<00:01:11.930> dynamic<00:01:12.140> to<00:01:13.240> when

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
almost like a different dynamic to when

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.140 
almost like a different dynamic to when
you<00:01:14.390> play<00:01:14.659> anybody<00:01:14.930> else<00:01:15.260> ah<00:01:17.560> I<00:01:18.880> don't<00:01:19.880> know<00:01:20.030> I

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
you play anybody else ah I don't know I

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.550 
you play anybody else ah I don't know I
mean<00:01:20.300> I<00:01:20.360> think<00:01:20.420> both<00:01:20.750> of<00:01:20.780> us<00:01:20.990> probably<00:01:21.170> see

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
mean I think both of us probably see

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.880 
mean I think both of us probably see
each<00:01:21.590> other's<00:01:22.040> games<00:01:22.340> pretty<00:01:22.790> well<00:01:23.060> so

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
each other's games pretty well so

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.930 
each other's games pretty well so
especially<00:01:24.890> this<00:01:25.040> year<00:01:25.190> actually<00:01:25.310> played<00:01:25.700> so

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
especially this year actually played so

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.160 
especially this year actually played so
much<00:01:28.240> so<00:01:29.240> you<00:01:29.300> kind<00:01:29.509> of<00:01:29.570> know<00:01:29.750> a<00:01:29.780> little<00:01:29.840> bit

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
much so you kind of know a little bit

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.540 
much so you kind of know a little bit
what<00:01:30.350> to<00:01:30.500> expect<00:01:30.920> and<00:01:31.130> I<00:01:31.220> think<00:01:31.400> that's

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
what to expect and I think that's

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.800 
what to expect and I think that's
probably<00:01:31.700> why<00:01:31.970> all<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.150> matches<00:01:32.659> especially

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
probably why all the matches especially

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.960 
probably why all the matches especially
last<00:01:33.409> few<00:01:33.680> being<00:01:33.979> extremely<00:01:34.340> close<00:01:34.670> and

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
last few being extremely close and

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.499 
last few being extremely close and
decided<00:01:35.390> by<00:01:35.570> by<00:01:36.229> a<00:01:36.259> few<00:01:36.530> points<00:01:36.740> um<00:01:37.390> you<00:01:38.390> know

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
decided by by a few points um you know

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.749 
decided by by a few points um you know
the<00:01:38.540> intensity<00:01:39.140> of<00:01:39.290> my<00:01:39.409> matches<00:01:39.649> with<00:01:40.550> him

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
the intensity of my matches with him

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.130 
the intensity of my matches with him
have<00:01:40.910> been<00:01:41.060> extremely<00:01:41.570> high<00:01:41.930> this<00:01:41.990> year<00:01:44.140> let's

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
have been extremely high this year let's

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.740 
have been extremely high this year let's
say<00:01:45.320> with<00:01:45.440> Rafa<00:01:45.890> you<00:01:46.369> know<00:01:46.520> on<00:01:46.700> on<00:01:47.539> these

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
say with Rafa you know on on these

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.620 
say with Rafa you know on on these
surfaces<00:01:48.289> in<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.800> past<00:01:49.039> of<00:01:49.250> how<00:01:49.369> lot<00:01:49.610> of<00:01:49.700> very

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
surfaces in the past of how lot of very

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.740 
surfaces in the past of how lot of very
intense<00:01:50.960> it<00:01:51.710> course<00:01:52.009> matched<00:01:52.280> with<00:01:52.520> him<00:01:52.750> as

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
intense it course matched with him as

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.669 
intense it course matched with him as
well<00:01:54.289> but<00:01:55.539> the<00:01:56.539> one<00:01:56.929> thing<00:01:57.110> I'd<00:01:57.229> says<00:01:57.440> this

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
well but the one thing I'd says this

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.109 
well but the one thing I'd says this
year<00:01:57.860> I<00:01:57.890> think<00:01:57.979> both<00:01:58.310> of<00:01:58.340> us<00:01:58.580> probably<00:01:58.880> have

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
year I think both of us probably have

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.320 
year I think both of us probably have
seen<00:01:59.390> things<00:02:00.350> in<00:02:00.500> each<00:02:00.590> other's<00:02:00.920> games

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
seen things in each other's games

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.540 
seen things in each other's games
probably<00:02:02.330> improve<00:02:02.979> and<00:02:03.979> that's<00:02:04.130> why<00:02:04.310> there's

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
probably improve and that's why there's

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.889 
probably improve and that's why there's
a<00:02:04.610> lot<00:02:04.729> of<00:02:04.759> long<00:02:05.030> rallies<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.570> matches

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
a lot of long rallies and the matches

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.039 
a lot of long rallies and the matches
are<00:02:06.020> incredibly<00:02:06.830> tight
