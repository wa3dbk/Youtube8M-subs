super high damage but it also once you
get<00:00:48.500> down<00:00:48.649> you're<00:00:49.039> probably<00:00:49.370> not<00:00:49.670> going<00:00:49.820> to

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
get down you're probably not going to

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.610 
get down you're probably not going to
get<00:00:49.969> up<00:00:50.120> unless<00:00:50.269> you<00:00:50.510> have<00:00:50.660> something<00:00:50.870> our

get up unless you have something our
teammate<00:00:51.980> to<00:00:52.100> do<00:00:52.219> so<00:00:52.370> this<00:00:52.460> is<00:00:52.609> kind<00:00:52.789> of<00:00:52.820> a

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
teammate to do so this is kind of a

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.529 
teammate to do so this is kind of a
group<00:00:53.239> play<00:00:54.070> build<00:00:55.070> so<00:00:55.999> we're<00:00:56.149> going<00:00:56.239> to<00:00:56.359> do<00:00:56.420> is

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
group play build so we're going to do is

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.090 
group play build so we're going to do is
start<00:00:56.809> is<00:00:56.989> you're<00:00:57.260> going<00:00:57.410> to<00:00:57.499> go<00:00:57.620> into<00:00:57.769> motion

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
start is you're going to go into motion

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.619 
start is you're going to go into motion
you're<00:00:58.489> going<00:00:58.609> to<00:00:58.670> get<00:00:58.730> accelerate<00:00:59.359> for<00:00:59.539> that

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
you're going to get accelerate for that

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.649 
you're going to get accelerate for that
increased<00:00:59.929> gun<00:01:00.260> damage<00:01:00.589> and<00:01:00.739> bullet<00:01:00.980> speed

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
increased gun damage and bullet speed

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:03.610 
increased gun damage and bullet speed
increase<00:01:02.659> the<00:01:02.780> duration<00:01:02.960> of<00:01:03.170> phase<00:01:03.350> lock

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
increase the duration of phase lock

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.930 
increase the duration of phase lock
since<00:01:03.859> it's<00:01:04.010> going<00:01:04.129> to<00:01:04.190> be<00:01:04.309> a<00:01:04.339> main<00:01:04.550> part<00:01:04.790> of

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
since it's going to be a main part of

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.860 
since it's going to be a main part of
this<00:01:05.030> bill<00:01:06.160> converge<00:01:07.160> it'll<00:01:08.000> make<00:01:08.120> a<00:01:08.150> poll<00:01:08.480> so

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
this bill converge it'll make a poll so

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.110 
this bill converge it'll make a poll so
more<00:01:09.410> CC<00:01:09.710> on<00:01:09.830> them<00:01:10.010> needs<00:01:10.220> more<00:01:10.520> of<00:01:10.700> time<00:01:10.910> on

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
more CC on them needs more of time on

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.000 
more CC on them needs more of time on
your<00:01:11.150> i'm<00:01:11.480> using<00:01:11.720> a<00:01:11.750> be<00:01:11.900> shield<00:01:12.170> so<00:01:12.410> more<00:01:12.800> time

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
your i'm using a be shield so more time

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.090 
your i'm using a be shield so more time
and<00:01:13.130> your<00:01:13.220> be<00:01:13.340> shield<00:01:14.320> inertia<00:01:15.320> there<00:01:16.010> was

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
and your be shield inertia there was

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.190 
and your be shield inertia there was
really<00:01:16.220> nothing<00:01:16.340> else<00:01:16.550> to<00:01:16.670> pick<00:01:17.000> so<00:01:17.630> i<00:01:17.660> kind<00:01:18.170> of

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
really nothing else to pick so i kind of

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.530 
really nothing else to pick so i kind of
just<00:01:18.260> grab<00:01:18.620> that<00:01:18.890> reload<00:01:19.790> speeds<00:01:20.060> nice<00:01:20.300> i

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
just grab that reload speeds nice i

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.470 
just grab that reload speeds nice i
suppose<00:01:20.900> but<00:01:21.910> faisal<00:01:22.910> I<00:01:22.940> cool<00:01:23.150> down<00:01:23.180> right

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
suppose but faisal I cool down right

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.060 
suppose but faisal I cool down right
since<00:01:23.840> this<00:01:23.960> big<00:01:24.200> parts<00:01:24.470> is<00:01:24.620> really<00:01:24.860> going<00:01:25.010> to

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
since this big parts is really going to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.780 
since this big parts is really going to
help<00:01:25.270> subsequence<00:01:27.040> it<00:01:28.040> makes<00:01:28.310> it<00:01:28.430> seek<00:01:28.610> out<00:01:28.760> a

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
help subsequence it makes it seek out a

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.700 
help subsequence it makes it seek out a
new<00:01:29.000> target<00:01:29.240> when<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.720> target<00:01:30.080> is<00:01:30.230> dead<00:01:30.440> so

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
new target when the target is dead so

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.250 
new target when the target is dead so
again<00:01:31.400> that<00:01:31.580> I'll<00:01:31.700> jerk<00:01:32.450> them<00:01:32.660> around<00:01:32.750> quite<00:01:33.200> a

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
again that I'll jerk them around quite a

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.410 
again that I'll jerk them around quite a
bit<00:01:33.350> if<00:01:33.560> you<00:01:33.650> keep<00:01:33.860> killing<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.220> target<00:01:34.610> but

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
bit if you keep killing the target but

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.280 
bit if you keep killing the target but
it<00:01:35.870> will<00:01:36.020> eventually<00:01:36.520> die<00:01:37.520> midair<00:01:38.030> or<00:01:38.300> go<00:01:39.170> into

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
it will eventually die midair or go into

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.920 
it will eventually die midair or go into
a<00:01:39.380> new<00:01:39.530> target<00:01:40.060> thought<00:01:41.060> like<00:01:41.240> this<00:01:41.390> is<00:01:41.450> a<00:01:41.600> part

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
a new target thought like this is a part

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.690 
a new target thought like this is a part
another<00:01:42.110> thing<00:01:42.350> makes<00:01:42.590> an<00:01:42.830> L<00:01:43.160> or<00:01:43.370> an<00:01:43.550> enemy

another thing makes an L or an enemy

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.690 
another thing makes an L or an enemy
essentially<00:01:44.390> like<00:01:44.630> a<00:01:44.660> kind<00:01:45.380> of<00:01:45.410> tank<00:01:45.770> they

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
essentially like a kind of tank they

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.640 
essentially like a kind of tank they
just<00:01:46.940> though<00:01:47.540> you're<00:01:47.930> their<00:01:48.050> enemies<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.470> turn

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
just though you're their enemies to turn

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.100 
just though you're their enemies to turn
on<00:01:48.800> them<00:01:48.980> and<00:01:49.100> you'll<00:01:49.970> be<00:01:50.150> spared<00:01:50.660> the<00:01:50.900> bullet

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110

when<00:02:08.060> you<00:02:08.179> get<00:02:08.420> down<00:02:08.599> it's<00:02:08.899> a<00:02:09.170> little<00:02:09.440> bit

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
when you get down it's a little bit

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.840 
when you get down it's a little bit
harder<00:02:09.860> to<00:02:09.890> get<00:02:10.100> up<00:02:10.280> it's<00:02:10.490> actually<00:02:10.759> really

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
harder to get up it's actually really

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.810 
harder to get up it's actually really
hard<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:11.120> go<00:02:11.210> but<00:02:11.900> adds<00:02:12.560> fire<00:02:12.860> damage<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.400> don't

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820

hard to go but adds fire damage I don't
know<00:02:13.880> I<00:02:13.910> just<00:02:14.000> didn't<00:02:14.420> really<00:02:14.570> like<00:02:14.780> it<00:02:14.810> I

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
know I just didn't really like it I

that<00:02:15.710> phase<00:02:15.890> locking<00:02:16.160> might<00:02:16.880> do<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.150> little<00:02:17.480> bit

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660

that phase locking might do a little bit
more<00:02:17.810> damage<00:02:18.200> than<00:02:18.550> going<00:02:19.550> down<00:02:19.820> I<00:02:19.850> suppose

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
more damage than going down I suppose

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.550 
more damage than going down I suppose
since<00:02:20.690> all<00:02:20.870> your<00:02:21.020> damage<00:02:21.230> is<00:02:21.320> going<00:02:21.440> to<00:02:21.500> be

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
you see I didn't take cloud kill so it's

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.450 
you see I didn't take cloud kill so it's
just<00:02:26.990> not<00:02:27.230> as<00:02:27.440> good<00:02:27.530> it's<00:02:27.800> not<00:02:27.890> an<00:02:28.010> elemental

my build that makes this good is the

I should I suppose but so we're starting
with<00:03:02.510> mines<00:03:02.750> I<00:03:02.989> increase<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.470> critical<00:03:03.739> hit

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
with mines I increase the critical hit

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.830 
with mines I increase the critical hit

obviously<00:03:44.299> the<00:03:44.510> B<00:03:44.630> is<00:03:44.750> overpowered<00:03:45.320> but<00:03:45.530> I

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
obviously the B is overpowered but I

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.949 
obviously the B is overpowered but I
only<00:03:46.010> 260<00:03:46.459> version<00:03:46.700> didn't<00:03:46.880> promise<00:03:47.030> 61<00:03:47.660> so

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
only 260 version didn't promise 61 so

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.920 
only 260 version didn't promise 61 so
that's<00:03:48.230> that<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:49.340> still<00:03:49.670> helps<00:03:49.880> quite<00:03:50.630> a<00:03:50.660> bit

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
that's that it still helps quite a bit

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.080 
that's that it still helps quite a bit

testing the catapult entry to see how

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.969

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
much I could do I don't know I just

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.700

didn't<00:04:37.460> like<00:04:37.669> I<00:04:38.110> just<00:04:39.110> did<00:04:39.320> not<00:04:39.650> like<00:04:39.919> the

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
didn't like I just did not like the

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.170 
didn't like I just did not like the
Cataclysm<00:04:42.710> tree<00:04:42.830> it<00:04:42.919> feels<00:04:43.100> really<00:04:43.400> weak<00:04:43.729> at

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
Cataclysm tree it feels really weak at

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.939 
Cataclysm tree it feels really weak at
level<00:04:44.449> 61<00:04:44.780> play<00:04:45.080> but<00:04:45.289> yeah<00:04:45.410> this<00:04:45.590> is<00:04:45.740> for<00:04:45.919> a

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
level 61 play but yeah this is for a

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.560 
level 61 play but yeah this is for a
group<00:04:46.250> so<00:04:47.500> solo<00:04:48.500> play<00:04:48.800> you<00:04:49.130> can<00:04:49.370> do<00:04:49.580> it<00:04:49.729> but<00:04:50.090> you

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
group so solo play you can do it but you

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.840 
group so solo play you can do it but you
will<00:04:50.840> probably<00:04:51.169> go<00:04:51.440> down<00:04:51.470> quite<00:04:51.949> a<00:04:51.979> bit<00:04:52.100> just

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
will probably go down quite a bit just

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.580 
will probably go down quite a bit just
