when<00:00:00.719> I<00:00:00.750> was<00:00:00.960> in<00:00:01.110> Los<00:00:01.290> Angeles<00:00:01.530> I<00:00:01.860> took<00:00:02.040> this

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
when I was in Los Angeles I took this

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.010 
when I was in Los Angeles I took this
picture<00:00:02.429> of<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.879> moon<00:00:03.090> Jupiter<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:03.990> Venus

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
picture of the moon Jupiter and Venus

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.920 
picture of the moon Jupiter and Venus
are<00:00:05.000> through<00:00:06.000> is<00:00:06.150> still<00:00:06.359> in<00:00:06.509> Salt<00:00:06.750> Lake<00:00:06.810> City

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
are through is still in Salt Lake City

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.140 
are through is still in Salt Lake City
and<00:00:07.259> I<00:00:07.500> had<00:00:07.710> him<00:00:07.919> take<00:00:08.130> this<00:00:08.340> picture<00:00:08.639> at<00:00:09.000> the

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
and I had him take this picture at the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.200 
and I had him take this picture at the
same<00:00:09.179> time<00:00:10.190> afterwards<00:00:11.190> we<00:00:11.400> used<00:00:11.580> Photoshop

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
same time afterwards we used Photoshop

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.829 
same time afterwards we used Photoshop
to<00:00:12.450> scale<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.080> overlay<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.769> pictures<00:00:14.630> due<00:00:15.630> to

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
to scale and overlay the pictures due to

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.810 
to scale and overlay the pictures due to
the<00:00:15.960> curvature<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.590> earth<00:00:16.830> we<00:00:17.190> had<00:00:17.550> to

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
the curvature of the earth we had to

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.730 
the curvature of the earth we had to
rotate<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.420> pictures<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:19.050> order<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.380> line<00:00:19.560> up

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
rotate the pictures in order to line up

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.070 
rotate the pictures in order to line up
the<00:00:19.890> two<00:00:20.039> planets<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:21.090> moon<00:00:21.150> however<00:00:21.779> you'll

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
the two planets the moon however you'll

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.720 
the two planets the moon however you'll
notice<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.740> actually<00:00:23.250> offset<00:00:23.939> from<00:00:24.240> itself

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
notice is actually offset from itself

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.849 
notice is actually offset from itself
this<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.970> because<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.720> two<00:00:27.930> widely<00:00:28.470> spaced

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
this is because the two widely spaced

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.550 
this is because the two widely spaced
viewpoints<00:00:29.699> created<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.300> parallax<00:00:30.810> shift<00:00:31.199> and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
viewpoints created a parallax shift and

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.440 
viewpoints created a parallax shift and
the<00:00:31.949> moon<00:00:32.160> relative<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.090> distant

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
the moon relative to the distant

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.650 
the moon relative to the distant
background<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:34.940> you<00:00:35.940> can<00:00:36.120> see<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.480> this

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
background as you can see in this

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.410 
background as you can see in this
diagram<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.469> I've<00:00:37.590> drawn<00:00:37.860> up<00:00:38.270> since<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
diagram that I've drawn up since the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.299 
diagram that I've drawn up since the
moon<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.840> over<00:00:39.989> two<00:00:40.260> hundred<00:00:40.290> thousand<00:00:41.100> miles

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
moon is over two hundred thousand miles

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.490 
moon is over two hundred thousand miles
away<00:00:41.700> I'm<00:00:42.059> actually<00:00:42.300> pretty<00:00:42.780> impressed<00:00:42.989> that

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
away I'm actually pretty impressed that

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.020 
away I'm actually pretty impressed that
we<00:00:43.710> were<00:00:43.800> able<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.129> actually<00:00:44.370> see<00:00:44.789> anything

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
we were able to actually see anything

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.900 
we were able to actually see anything
but<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.989> suppose<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.440> makes<00:00:46.590> sense<00:00:46.739> if<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.460> look

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
but I suppose it makes sense if you look

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.380 
but I suppose it makes sense if you look
at<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> angles<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.700> if<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.789> think<00:00:51.000> about<00:00:51.210> it

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
at the angles and if you think about it

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.290 
at the angles and if you think about it
the<00:00:51.600> moon<00:00:51.809> should<00:00:52.320> be<00:00:52.530> shifted<00:00:53.100> as<00:00:53.309> much<00:00:53.610> as<00:00:53.879> we

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the moon should be shifted as much as we

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.750 
the moon should be shifted as much as we
were<00:00:54.449> shifted<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> Earth's<00:00:55.260> surface<00:00:55.760> so

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
were shifted on the Earth's surface so

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.450 
were shifted on the Earth's surface so
if<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.390> were<00:00:57.510> six<00:00:58.079> hundred<00:00:58.140> miles<00:00:58.530> apart<00:00:59.010> then

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
if we were six hundred miles apart then

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.029 
if we were six hundred miles apart then
the<00:00:59.670> moon's<00:00:59.940> image<00:01:00.570> should<00:01:01.050> be<00:01:01.260> shifted<00:01:01.620> by

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
the moon's image should be shifted by

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.100 
the moon's image should be shifted by
six<00:01:02.609> hundred<00:01:02.850> miles

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.870 

so<00:01:06.110> I<00:01:06.140> analyzed<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:06.860> image<00:01:07.220> assuming<00:01:07.760> that

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
so I analyzed the image assuming that

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.810 
so I analyzed the image assuming that
the<00:01:08.000> moon's<00:01:08.240> diameter<00:01:08.510> is<00:01:09.130> 2,100<00:01:10.130> miles<00:01:10.400> and

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
the moon's diameter is 2,100 miles and

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.980 
the moon's diameter is 2,100 miles and
the<00:01:11.390> shift<00:01:11.660> that<00:01:11.900> I<00:01:12.110> see<00:01:12.650> is<00:01:12.980> about<00:01:13.990> 1,000

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
the shift that I see is about 1,000

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.510 
the shift that I see is about 1,000
miles<00:01:15.280> something<00:01:16.280> like<00:01:16.570> 980<00:01:17.920> which<00:01:18.920> is<00:01:19.130> more

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
miles something like 980 which is more

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.580 
miles something like 980 which is more
than<00:01:19.760> 600<00:01:20.360> that's<00:01:20.570> more<00:01:20.780> than<00:01:20.990> we<00:01:21.110> are<00:01:21.230> apart

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
than 600 that's more than we are apart

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.030 
than 600 that's more than we are apart
but<00:01:22.300> given<00:01:23.300> our<00:01:23.420> experimental<00:01:23.990> error<00:01:24.440> I<00:01:24.680> think

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
but given our experimental error I think

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.490 
but given our experimental error I think
that's<00:01:25.220> pretty<00:01:25.400> close

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
that's pretty close

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.270 
that's pretty close
eventually<00:01:27.500> I'd<00:01:27.620> like<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:28.010> do<00:01:28.130> this

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
eventually I'd like to do this

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.580 
eventually I'd like to do this
experiment<00:01:28.670> again<00:01:29.270> from<00:01:29.600> more<00:01:29.840> than<00:01:30.260> two

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
experiment again from more than two

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.770 
experiment again from more than two
locations<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:31.550> with<00:01:31.730> a<00:01:31.760> bit<00:01:32.000> better<00:01:32.210> cameras

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
locations and with a bit better cameras

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.050 
locations and with a bit better cameras
and<00:01:33.230> see<00:01:33.500> if<00:01:33.620> we<00:01:33.770> can<00:01:34.010> actually<00:01:34.220> get<00:01:34.580> a<00:01:34.640> 3d

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
and see if we can actually get a 3d

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.359 
and see if we can actually get a 3d
image<00:01:35.300> of<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.480> moon<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:35.990> well<00:01:36.979> a<00:01:37.010> better

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
image of the moon and well a better

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.130 
image of the moon and well a better
picture<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.119> better<00:01:38.330> reading<00:01:38.930> of<00:01:39.050> the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
picture and a better reading of the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.700 
picture and a better reading of the
distance<00:01:40.300> I've<00:01:41.300> already<00:01:41.690> asked<00:01:42.020> my<00:01:42.140> Mars<00:01:42.410> one

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
distance I've already asked my Mars one

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.500 
distance I've already asked my Mars one
friends<00:01:43.190> take<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.520> picture<00:01:43.910> of<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.090> moon<00:01:44.300> at

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
friends take a picture of the moon at

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.750 
friends take a picture of the moon at
about<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.810> same<00:01:45.050> time<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:45.710> this<00:01:46.460> is<00:01:46.640> the

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
about the same time and this is the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.760 
about the same time and this is the
result<00:01:47.210> it's<00:01:47.990> kind<00:01:48.200> of<00:01:48.260> hard<00:01:48.470> to<00:01:48.530> coordinate

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
result it's kind of hard to coordinate

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.710 
result it's kind of hard to coordinate
it<00:01:49.220> around<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.550> world<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.090> some<00:01:50.300> of<00:01:50.330> them<00:01:50.540> are

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
it around the world so some of them are

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.370 
it around the world so some of them are
several<00:01:51.350> hours<00:01:52.160> apart<00:01:52.580> but<00:01:53.090> I<00:01:53.390> think<00:01:54.140> this<00:01:54.229> is

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
several hours apart but I think this is

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.870 
several hours apart but I think this is
a<00:01:54.410> pretty<00:01:54.619> cool<00:01:54.860> image<00:01:55.190> nonetheless

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.420 

anyway<00:02:00.880> I<00:02:01.090> hope<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:01.329> guys<00:02:01.570> enjoyed<00:02:02.049> it<00:02:02.350> is<00:02:02.979> now

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed it is now
