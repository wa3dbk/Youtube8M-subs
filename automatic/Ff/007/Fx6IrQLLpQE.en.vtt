my approach to glass is trying to

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:27.560 
my approach to glass is trying to
understand<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> material<00:00:20.130> for<00:00:20.340> what<00:00:26.570> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
understand the material for what the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.390 
understand the material for what the
host<00:00:27.750> glass<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.380> really<00:00:28.680> everything<00:00:29.160> is

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
host glass is really everything is

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.970 
host glass is really everything is
beautiful<00:00:30.029> about<00:00:30.210> glass<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.990> has<00:00:31.529> everything

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
beautiful about glass is has everything

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.660 
beautiful about glass is has everything
to<00:00:32.279> do<00:00:32.399> with<00:00:32.430> light<00:00:34.219> and<00:00:35.219> that's<00:00:35.399> something

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
to do with light and that's something

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.750 
to do with light and that's something
that<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.480> think<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:37.079> really<00:00:37.320> important<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.129> how

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
that I think is really important and how

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.830 
that I think is really important and how
I<00:00:38.790> think<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.480> approach<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.140> material<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
I think and approach the material and

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.900 
I think and approach the material and
try<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.870> work<00:00:43.200> with<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.829> definitely<00:00:44.579> not

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
we get enough material to make the piece

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.169 
we get enough material to make the piece
that<00:01:59.899> we're<00:02:00.079> trying<00:02:00.289> to<00:02:00.439> make

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.550 

definitely<00:02:08.179> a<00:02:08.239> team<00:02:08.390> process<00:02:08.899> you<00:02:09.140> can't<00:02:09.379> do

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
definitely a team process you can't do

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.410 
definitely a team process you can't do
by<00:02:09.800> yourself<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.459> especially<00:02:10.640> as<00:02:10.970> technical

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
by yourself and especially as technical

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.009 
by yourself and especially as technical
as<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:11.720> can<00:02:11.930> be<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:13.580> scale<00:02:13.879> and<00:02:14.150> size<00:02:14.330> of<00:02:14.870> the

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
as it can be the scale and size of the

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.979 
as it can be the scale and size of the
pieces<00:02:15.410> or<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.709> complexity<00:02:16.220> but<00:02:17.090> it

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
pieces or the complexity but it

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.070 
pieces or the complexity but it
definitely<00:02:18.230> takes<00:02:18.709> a<00:02:19.510> takes<00:02:20.510> all<00:02:20.690> of<00:02:20.720> us<00:02:20.900> to
