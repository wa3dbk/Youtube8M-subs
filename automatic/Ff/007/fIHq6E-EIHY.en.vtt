00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
hopefully this one turns out better I

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.230 
hopefully this one turns out better I
think<00:01:43.829> there<00:01:44.100> was<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.250> fold<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.759> my<00:01:44.790> plate<00:01:45.119> out

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
think there was a fold in my plate out

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.840 
think there was a fold in my plate out
last<00:01:45.420> time<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:46.110> time<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.380> rolled<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.520> into

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
last time so this time I rolled it into

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.660 
last time so this time I rolled it into
more<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.210> smooth<00:01:48.630> ball<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:50.040> hopefully<00:01:50.310> this

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
more of a smooth ball so hopefully this

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.219 
more of a smooth ball so hopefully this
turtle<00:01:51.060> turns<00:01:51.329> out<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.540> little<00:01:51.750> better
