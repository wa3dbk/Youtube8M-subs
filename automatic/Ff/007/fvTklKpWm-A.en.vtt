detail<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> double<00:00:20.699> wide<00:00:20.910> map<00:00:21.150> and

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
detail and this is a double wide map and

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.939 
detail and this is a double wide map and
just<00:00:21.570> very<00:00:21.779> well<00:00:22.020> made<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.289> thought<00:00:22.650> he<00:00:22.769> did<00:00:22.920> a

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
just very well made I thought he did a

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.800 
just very well made I thought he did a
great<00:00:23.220> job<00:00:23.369> with<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.850> map<00:00:24.060> I'd<00:00:24.300> never<00:00:24.570> heard

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
great job with this map I'd never heard

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.540 
great job with this map I'd never heard
about<00:00:24.930> SG<00:00:25.350> detail<00:00:25.650> before<00:00:25.769> he<00:00:26.070> submitted<00:00:26.430> this

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
about SG detail before he submitted this

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.310 
about SG detail before he submitted this
map<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.240> think<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:27.510> awesome<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.960> have<00:00:28.170> some

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
map so I think it's awesome to have some

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.929 
map so I think it's awesome to have some
unknown<00:00:28.590> forgers<00:00:28.980> already<00:00:29.369> making<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:29.849> the

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
unknown forgers already making it in the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.609 
unknown forgers already making it in the
top<00:00:30.119> 10<00:00:30.330> i<00:00:30.359> thought<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.599> was<00:00:30.689> amazing<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.230> mean

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
top 10 i thought it was amazing I mean

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.959 
top 10 i thought it was amazing I mean
Fredrik<00:00:31.980> here<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.160> driving<00:00:32.489> backwards<00:00:32.880> i'm

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
Fredrik here is driving backwards i'm

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.250 
Fredrik here is driving backwards i'm
not<00:00:33.149> really<00:00:33.300> sure<00:00:33.390> why<00:00:33.660> he<00:00:33.840> ends<00:00:33.989> up<00:00:34.020> falling

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
not really sure why he ends up falling

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260 
not really sure why he ends up falling
off<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.620> map<00:00:34.800> but<00:00:35.219> anyway<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.640> main<00:00:35.820> problem

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
off the map but anyway the main problem

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.160 
off the map but anyway the main problem
with<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.510> map<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.899> really<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> only

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
with this map and really the only

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.139 
with this map and really the only
problem<00:00:37.620> i<00:00:37.710> actually<00:00:38.129> saw<00:00:38.309> was<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:38.670> this

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
problem i actually saw was just this

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.940 
problem i actually saw was just this
turn<00:00:39.390> right<00:00:39.600> here<00:00:39.750> it's<00:00:40.170> super<00:00:40.530> angled<00:00:40.829> as<00:00:40.890> you

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
turn right here it's super angled as you

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.319 
turn right here it's super angled as you
can<00:00:41.070> see<00:00:41.219> he's<00:00:41.399> got<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.640> shield<00:00:41.879> or<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.180> try

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
can see he's got this shield or to try

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.420 
can see he's got this shield or to try
to<00:00:42.390> kind<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.629> help<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.960> from<00:00:43.590> falling<00:00:43.800> off<00:00:44.040> but

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
to kind of help you from falling off but

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.799 
to kind of help you from falling off but
the<00:00:44.520> thing<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.090> get<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.450> much<00:00:45.570> speed

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the thing is that you get so much speed

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.119 
the thing is that you get so much speed
going<00:00:46.110> down<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.379> turn<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.710> even<00:00:46.950> when<00:00:47.070> you

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
going down that turn that even when you

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.680 
going down that turn that even when you
do<00:00:47.340> hit<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.520> shield<00:00:47.879> or<00:00:48.059> you'll<00:00:48.180> get<00:00:48.300> bounced

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
do hit that shield or you'll get bounced

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.299 
do hit that shield or you'll get bounced
off<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> other<00:00:49.230> side<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.710> fall<00:00:50.100> off<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
off to the other side and fall off the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.889 
off to the other side and fall off the
track<00:00:50.550> for<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> most<00:00:50.969> part<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.600> that's<00:00:51.780> really

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
track for the most part so that's really

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.240 
track for the most part so that's really
the<00:00:52.079> only<00:00:52.140> problem<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.680> map<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.160> was

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
the only problem that map is that it was

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.709 
the only problem that map is that it was
just<00:00:53.430> super<00:00:53.550> angled<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.149> think<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.539> could<00:00:54.629> have

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
just super angled I think you could have

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:55.850 
just super angled I think you could have
done<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.840> little<00:00:55.020> bit<00:00:55.199> better<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.649> one

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
done a little bit better with that one

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.439 
done a little bit better with that one
term<00:00:56.070> maybe<00:00:56.309> put<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> few<00:00:56.910> more<00:00:56.940> gravity

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
term maybe put a few more gravity

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.520 
term maybe put a few more gravity
volumes<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.020> try<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.199> keep<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.500> from

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
volumes in to try to keep you from

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.349 
volumes in to try to keep you from
falling<00:00:58.770> off<00:00:59.039> or<00:00:59.219> anything<00:00:59.730> like<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.030> but

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
falling off or anything like that but

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.599 
falling off or anything like that but
the<00:01:00.629> rest<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.989> map<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.340> rest<00:01:02.520> of

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
the rest of the map is just the rest of

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.369 
the rest of the map is just the rest of
map<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.850> amazing<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.449> thought<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.780> was<00:01:03.899> just

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
map is amazing and I thought it was just

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.649 
map is amazing and I thought it was just
a<00:01:04.500> fantastic<00:01:04.890> mapped<00:01:05.280> extremely<00:01:06.060> smooth<00:01:06.360> and

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
a fantastic mapped extremely smooth and

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.719 
a fantastic mapped extremely smooth and
well<00:01:07.229> made<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.100> did<00:01:08.310> right<00:01:08.670> there

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
well made and I like we did right there

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.280 
well made and I like we did right there
back<00:01:09.090> there<00:01:09.299> with<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.810> rocks<00:01:10.049> and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
back there with the the rocks and

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
back there with the the rocks and
everything<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.680> thought<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.920> was<00:01:11.010> awesome

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
everything I thought that was awesome

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.310 
everything I thought that was awesome
but<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.790> never<00:01:12.180> again<00:01:12.479> I'd<00:01:12.600> never<00:01:12.840> heard<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.049> SG

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
but I never again I'd never heard of SG

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.630 
but I never again I'd never heard of SG
detail<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.710> no<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.159> one<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.310> his<00:01:14.460> first

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
detail so no this is one of his first

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.130 
detail so no this is one of his first
maps<00:01:14.939> or<00:01:15.150> he's<00:01:15.270> made<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> lot<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.750> maps<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.110> halo

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
maps or he's made a lot of maps in halo

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.870 
maps or he's made a lot of maps in halo
4<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:16.920> either<00:01:17.040> way<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.250> thought<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.640> just

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
4 but either way I thought this is just

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.760 
4 but either way I thought this is just
a<00:01:17.939> fantastic<00:01:18.299> map<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.900> again<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.439> think<00:01:19.650> it's

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
a fantastic map and again I think it's

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.260 
a fantastic map and again I think it's
awesome<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.159> have<00:01:20.369> some<00:01:20.580> unknown<00:01:20.880> foragers

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
awesome to have some unknown foragers

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.789 
awesome to have some unknown foragers
already<00:01:21.600> making<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.990> into<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.170> top<00:01:22.320> 10<00:01:22.590> and

along it's just kind of I guess been a

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.130 
along it's just kind of I guess been a
common<00:01:48.149> theme<00:01:48.390> for<00:01:48.420> some<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.840> those<00:01:48.899> maps

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
which is completely fine i guess it's

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.740 
which is completely fine i guess it's
almost<00:01:50.939> kind<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.270> almost<00:01:51.570> just

made I actually played this map about
two<00:02:43.760> weeks<00:02:43.910> ago<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.420> I<00:02:44.660> wasn't<00:02:44.959> expecting

two weeks ago and I wasn't expecting

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.840 
two weeks ago and I wasn't expecting
them<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.530> submit<00:02:45.800> this<00:02:46.070> for<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.370> top<00:02:46.550> ten<00:02:46.820> i

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
them to submit this for the top ten i

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.250 
them to submit this for the top ten i
was<00:02:47.060> planning<00:02:47.360> on<00:02:47.390> making<00:02:47.570> just<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:47.930> separate

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
was planning on making just a separate

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.509 
was planning on making just a separate
video<00:02:48.380> for<00:02:48.680> this<00:02:48.739> map<00:02:48.950> because<00:02:49.100> i<00:02:49.220> found<00:02:49.340> it

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
video for this map because i found it

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.430 
video for this map because i found it
really<00:02:49.670> enjoyable<00:02:50.090> race<00:02:50.360> on<00:02:50.570> they<00:02:51.050> submitted

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
really enjoyable race on they submitted

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.780 
really enjoyable race on they submitted
it<00:02:51.530> for<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.680> top<00:02:51.860> ten<00:02:52.070> it<00:02:52.190> made<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.489> voting

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
it for the top ten it made the voting

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.250 
it for the top ten it made the voting
video<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.209> now<00:02:53.300> here<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:53.600> isn't<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.840> top<00:02:54.019> ten

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
video and now here it isn't the top ten

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.870 
video and now here it isn't the top ten
which<00:02:54.650> i<00:02:54.769> think<00:02:54.830> is<00:02:54.950> really<00:02:55.160> awesome<00:02:55.430> seeing

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
which i think is really awesome seeing

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.520 
which i think is really awesome seeing
as<00:02:56.000> though<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.480> red-eye<00:02:56.690> devil<00:02:57.140> in<00:02:57.260> Schenck

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
as though the red-eye devil in Schenck

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.650 
as though the red-eye devil in Schenck
1289<00:02:57.980> in<00:02:58.250> my<00:02:58.370> opinion<00:02:58.640> are<00:02:58.819> very<00:02:59.000> unfortunate

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
1289 in my opinion are very unfortunate

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.180 
1289 in my opinion are very unfortunate
i<00:02:59.780> really<00:03:00.050> had<00:03:00.140> not<00:03:00.319> heard<00:03:00.500> too<00:03:01.010> much<00:03:01.130> about

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
i really had not heard too much about

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.610 
i really had not heard too much about
them<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:02.209> red<00:03:02.360> devil<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.989> red-eye<00:03:03.140> devil<00:03:03.530> had

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
them the red devil the red-eye devil had

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.690 
them the red devil the red-eye devil had
heard<00:03:03.769> a<00:03:03.860> little<00:03:03.980> bit<00:03:04.069> more<00:03:04.250> about<00:03:04.489> but<00:03:04.670> I

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
heard a little bit more about but I

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.240 
heard a little bit more about but I
never<00:03:04.970> heard<00:03:05.180> shank<00:03:05.810> 1289<00:03:06.200> name<00:03:06.560> before<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:07.220> I

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
never heard shank 1289 name before so I

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.380 
never heard shank 1289 name before so I
think<00:03:07.340> it's<00:03:07.489> awesome<00:03:07.640> i<00:03:07.850> have<00:03:07.970> some<00:03:08.120> unknown

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
think it's awesome i have some unknown

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.270 
think it's awesome i have some unknown
forgers<00:03:08.780> up<00:03:08.989> here<00:03:09.170> in<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.290> top<00:03:09.470> 10<00:03:09.680> i<00:03:09.709> just<00:03:10.130> i

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
forgers up here in the top 10 i just i

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.949 
forgers up here in the top 10 i just i
think<00:03:10.340> it's<00:03:10.610> wonderful<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:11.030> have<00:03:11.660> a<00:03:11.720> lot<00:03:11.930> of

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
think it's wonderful to have a lot of

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.870 
think it's wonderful to have a lot of
unfortunate<00:03:12.560> in<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.739> top<00:03:12.920> set<00:03:13.130> right<00:03:13.250> now<00:03:13.310> but

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
unfortunate in the top set right now but

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.280 
unfortunate in the top set right now but
here's<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.150> little<00:03:14.360> cool<00:03:14.540> dominion<00:03:15.019> shield

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
here's a little cool dominion shield

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.570 
here's a little cool dominion shield
jump<00:03:15.590> i<00:03:15.680> thought<00:03:15.830> that<00:03:15.890> was<00:03:15.950> really<00:03:16.340> awesome

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
jump i thought that was really awesome

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.310 
jump i thought that was really awesome
now<00:03:17.150> it's<00:03:17.300> not<00:03:17.450> too<00:03:17.569> smooth<00:03:17.840> this<00:03:17.959> thing<00:03:18.170> or

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
now it's not too smooth this thing or

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.020 
now it's not too smooth this thing or
most<00:03:18.470> consistent<00:03:18.980> jump<00:03:19.100> in<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.310> world<00:03:19.489> but<00:03:19.880> it

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
most consistent jump in the world but it

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.400 
most consistent jump in the world but it
is<00:03:20.120> a<00:03:20.150> lot<00:03:20.420> of<00:03:20.450> fun<00:03:20.750> you<00:03:20.930> know<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.079> go<00:03:21.290> off<00:03:21.350> that

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
is a lot of fun you know to go off that

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.750 
is a lot of fun you know to go off that
jump<00:03:21.620> especially<00:03:22.130> when<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:22.310> hit<00:03:22.430> it<00:03:22.549> just

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
jump especially when you hit it just

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.310 
jump especially when you hit it just
right<00:03:22.910> and<00:03:23.209> you<00:03:23.480> know<00:03:23.510> it's<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:23.840> smooth<00:03:24.140> landing

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
right and you know it's a smooth landing

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.780 
right and you know it's a smooth landing
everything<00:03:24.799> it's<00:03:24.890> just<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:25.100> lot<00:03:25.310> of<00:03:25.340> fun<00:03:25.579> to<00:03:25.700> go

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
everything it's just a lot of fun to go

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.340 
everything it's just a lot of fun to go
off<00:03:25.850> that<00:03:25.910> job<00:03:26.239> and<00:03:26.540> it's<00:03:26.720> really<00:03:26.900> unique<00:03:27.079> you

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
off that job and it's really unique you

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.840 
off that job and it's really unique you
don't<00:03:27.500> really<00:03:27.650> see<00:03:27.829> many<00:03:28.220> jumps<00:03:28.640> that<00:03:28.730> are

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
don't really see many jumps that are

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.789 
don't really see many jumps that are
like<00:03:29.030> that<00:03:29.269> in<00:03:29.450> halo<00:03:29.780> 4<00:03:30.049> so<00:03:30.260> i<00:03:30.440> thought<00:03:30.739> that

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
like that in halo 4 so i thought that

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.530 
like that in halo 4 so i thought that
was<00:03:30.920> an<00:03:31.040> awesome<00:03:31.160> jump<00:03:31.519> now<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.030> jump<00:03:32.390> at<00:03:32.510> that

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
was an awesome jump now the jump at that

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.509 
was an awesome jump now the jump at that
very<00:03:32.810> end<00:03:33.049> of<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.140> map<00:03:33.380> is<00:03:33.590> actually<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.370> little

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
very end of the map is actually a little

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.360 
very end of the map is actually a little
bit<00:03:34.760> more<00:03:34.910> inconsistent<00:03:35.299> than<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.370> Dominion

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
bit more inconsistent than the Dominion

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.220 
bit more inconsistent than the Dominion
chill<00:03:37.579> jump<00:03:37.850> so<00:03:37.970> that's<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.239> really<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:38.959> only

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
chill jump so that's the really the only

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.750 
chill jump so that's the really the only
problems<00:03:39.680> with<00:03:39.860> this<00:03:39.950> map<00:03:40.190> are<00:03:40.459> just<00:03:40.670> the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
problems with this map are just the

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.890 
problems with this map are just the
jumps<00:03:41.090> there<00:03:41.209> a<00:03:41.239> little<00:03:41.390> bit<00:03:41.510> inconsistent

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
jumps there a little bit inconsistent

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.180 
jumps there a little bit inconsistent
but<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.260> can't<00:03:42.410> really<00:03:42.530> expect<00:03:42.890> to<00:03:42.980> make

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
but you can't really expect to make

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.530 
but you can't really expect to make
jumps<00:03:43.549> you<00:03:43.820> know<00:03:43.910> one<00:03:44.000> hundred<00:03:44.239> percent<00:03:44.269> or

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
jumps you know one hundred percent or

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.340 
jumps you know one hundred percent or
anything<00:03:44.720> like<00:03:44.750> that<00:03:44.840> so<00:03:45.109> i'm<00:03:45.200> not<00:03:45.290> really

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
anything like that so i'm not really

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.170 
anything like that so i'm not really
complaining<00:03:45.530> about<00:03:45.980> that<00:03:46.190> too<00:03:46.310> much<00:03:46.340> overall

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
complaining about that too much overall

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.000 
complaining about that too much overall
I<00:03:47.209> thought<00:03:47.390> was<00:03:47.540> a<00:03:47.570> very<00:03:47.840> very<00:03:48.410> fun<00:03:48.650> map<00:03:48.859> to

tracks be a lot of fun but this map the
map<00:04:36.330> itself<00:04:36.539> is<00:04:36.870> not<00:04:37.050> necessarily<00:04:37.919> a<00:04:38.009> really

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
map itself is not necessarily a really

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.010 
map itself is not necessarily a really
long<00:04:38.460> double<00:04:38.820> wide<00:04:38.970> it's<00:04:39.270> it's<00:04:39.570> not<00:04:39.720> a<00:04:39.750> short

long double wide it's it's not a short
one<00:04:40.229> it's<00:04:40.590> like<00:04:40.680> an<00:04:40.770> average<00:04:41.130> length<00:04:41.340> I<00:04:41.490> guess

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
one it's like an average length I guess

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.339 
one it's like an average length I guess
and<00:04:41.940> it's<00:04:42.150> just<00:04:42.270> a<00:04:42.330> lot<00:04:42.570> of<00:04:42.599> fun<00:04:42.870> I<00:04:43.080> really

didn't find any flaws in this map at all
I<00:04:45.060> thought<00:04:45.330> he<00:04:45.479> made<00:04:45.630> this<00:04:45.780> just<00:04:46.050> just<00:04:46.889> amazing

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
I thought he made this just just amazing

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.890 
I thought he made this just just amazing
it<00:04:47.490> was<00:04:47.550> all<00:04:47.759> smooth<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:48.360> I<00:04:48.509> just<00:04:48.690> couldn't

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
it was all smooth and I just couldn't

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.450 
it was all smooth and I just couldn't
find<00:04:49.139> anything<00:04:49.470> that's<00:04:49.740> wrong<00:04:49.919> the<00:04:50.130> map<00:04:50.310> at

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
find anything that's wrong the map at

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.439 
find anything that's wrong the map at
all<00:04:50.550> I'm<00:04:50.669> sure<00:04:50.699> there<00:04:51.000> are<00:04:51.030> a<00:04:51.090> few<00:04:51.240> problems

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
all I'm sure there are a few problems

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:52.879 
all I'm sure there are a few problems
with<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:51.840> map<00:04:52.020> here<00:04:52.440> and<00:04:52.590> there<00:04:52.710> but<00:04:52.740> I

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
with the map here and there but I

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:54.320 
with the map here and there but I
honestly<00:04:53.190> could<00:04:53.550> not<00:04:53.580> find<00:04:53.880> anything<00:04:54.060> wrong

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
honestly could not find anything wrong

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.760 
honestly could not find anything wrong
and<00:04:54.539> I<00:04:54.599> just<00:04:54.720> thought<00:04:54.810> the<00:04:55.110> private<00:04:55.410> parts<00:04:55.620> did

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
and I just thought the private parts did

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.070 
and I just thought the private parts did
just<00:04:55.949> a<00:04:56.099> fantastic<00:04:56.759> job<00:04:57.210> so<00:04:57.509> I'm<00:04:57.750> definitely

as you see from the overview it doesn't

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.900 
as you see from the overview it doesn't
really<00:05:07.889> have<00:05:08.009> any<00:05:08.130> aesthetics<00:05:08.580> which<00:05:08.639> I<00:05:08.820> was

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
really have any aesthetics which I was

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.339 
really have any aesthetics which I was
kind<00:05:09.090> of<00:05:09.150> bummed<00:05:09.419> about<00:05:09.509> i<00:05:09.660> actually<00:05:10.169> hit<00:05:10.289> the

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
kind of bummed about i actually hit the

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:12.170 
kind of bummed about i actually hit the
budget<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:10.889> was<00:05:11.490> not<00:05:11.669> able<00:05:11.699> to<00:05:11.970> put<00:05:12.150> any

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
budget and was not able to put any

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.820 
budget and was not able to put any
aesthetics<00:05:12.750> in<00:05:12.900> here<00:05:13.080> because<00:05:13.289> i<00:05:13.320> was<00:05:13.500> really

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
aesthetics in here because i was really

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.740 
aesthetics in here because i was really
going<00:05:14.009> for<00:05:14.160> just<00:05:14.400> a<00:05:14.550> really<00:05:15.000> long<00:05:15.270> smooth

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
going for just a really long smooth

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.540 
going for just a really long smooth
double-wide<00:05:16.169> map<00:05:16.440> and<00:05:16.650> i<00:05:17.039> kind<00:05:17.250> of<00:05:17.280> wanted<00:05:17.460> to

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
double-wide map and i kind of wanted to

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.800 
double-wide map and i kind of wanted to
make<00:05:17.639> one<00:05:17.789> of<00:05:17.849> the<00:05:17.910> longest<00:05:18.270> double-wide<00:05:18.570> maps

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
make one of the longest double-wide maps

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.740 
make one of the longest double-wide maps
in<00:05:18.960> halo<00:05:19.169> 4<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:19.919> while<00:05:20.759> doing<00:05:20.970> that<00:05:21.180> obviously

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
in halo 4 and while doing that obviously

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.350 
in halo 4 and while doing that obviously
I<00:05:21.840> hit<00:05:22.050> the<00:05:22.169> budget<00:05:22.500> and<00:05:22.650> was<00:05:22.770> unable<00:05:23.039> to

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
I hit the budget and was unable to

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.460 
I hit the budget and was unable to
unable<00:05:24.360> to<00:05:24.509> make<00:05:24.659> any<00:05:24.690> aesthetics<00:05:25.259> which<00:05:25.289> I

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
unable to make any aesthetics which I

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.570 
unable to make any aesthetics which I
was<00:05:25.590> really<00:05:25.680> bummed<00:05:25.889> about<00:05:26.099> because<00:05:26.340> again

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
was really bummed about because again

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.100 
was really bummed about because again
you<00:05:26.729> know<00:05:26.820> aesthetics<00:05:27.210> are<00:05:27.300> such<00:05:27.449> a<00:05:27.479> huge<00:05:27.840> part

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
you know aesthetics are such a huge part

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.170 
you know aesthetics are such a huge part
of<00:05:28.320> racetracks<00:05:29.190> and<00:05:29.430> stuff<00:05:29.639> and<00:05:29.820> just<00:05:30.000> like

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
of racetracks and stuff and just like

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.640 
of racetracks and stuff and just like
the<00:05:30.300> visual<00:05:30.659> part<00:05:30.720> of<00:05:31.020> it<00:05:31.110> and<00:05:31.229> really<00:05:31.409> just

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
the visual part of it and really just

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.770 
the visual part of it and really just
kind<00:05:31.860> of<00:05:31.889> makes<00:05:32.130> map<00:05:32.520> stand<00:05:32.970> out<00:05:33.150> and<00:05:33.330> makes

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
kind of makes map stand out and makes

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.719 
kind of makes map stand out and makes
them<00:05:33.990> look<00:05:34.199> even<00:05:34.320> better<00:05:34.620> so<00:05:35.250> I<00:05:35.280> was<00:05:35.430> really<00:05:35.610> I

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
them look even better so I was really I

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:36.890 
them look even better so I was really I
was<00:05:35.849> really<00:05:35.970> disappointed<00:05:36.180> I<00:05:36.539> couldn't<00:05:36.570> make

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
was really disappointed I couldn't make

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.240 
was really disappointed I couldn't make
any<00:05:37.050> aesthetics<00:05:37.500> but<00:05:37.620> even<00:05:38.159> without

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
any aesthetics but even without

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.620 
any aesthetics but even without
aesthetics<00:05:38.789> I<00:05:38.909> still<00:05:39.090> think<00:05:39.240> this<00:05:39.300> is<00:05:39.389> a<00:05:39.449> great

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
aesthetics I still think this is a great

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:40.969 
aesthetics I still think this is a great
map<00:05:39.900> and<00:05:40.169> I'm<00:05:40.229> very<00:05:40.380> proud<00:05:40.620> of<00:05:40.710> it<00:05:40.830> it's

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
map and I'm very proud of it it's

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.310 
map and I'm very proud of it it's
actually<00:05:41.250> my<00:05:41.340> very<00:05:41.400> first<00:05:41.789> map<00:05:42.000> in<00:05:42.120> Halo<00:05:42.360> 4<00:05:42.599> you

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
actually my very first map in Halo 4 you

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.600 
actually my very first map in Halo 4 you
know<00:05:43.409> I<00:05:43.440> just<00:05:43.560> sucks<00:05:44.099> that<00:05:44.159> I'm<00:05:44.310> just<00:05:44.490> not

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
know I just sucks that I'm just not

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.920 
know I just sucks that I'm just not
getting<00:05:44.759> around<00:05:44.940> and<00:05:45.240> making<00:05:45.360> him<00:05:45.509> a<00:05:45.659> pen<00:05:45.810> here

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
getting around and making him a pen here

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.480 
getting around and making him a pen here
before<00:05:46.229> but<00:05:46.380> I<00:05:46.590> thought<00:05:46.979> I<00:05:47.039> did<00:05:47.190> a<00:05:47.250> great<00:05:47.460> job

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
before but I thought I did a great job

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.339 
before but I thought I did a great job
with<00:05:47.699> it<00:05:47.940> the<00:05:48.030> really<00:05:48.509> the<00:05:48.539> biggest<00:05:49.110> problem

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
with it the really the biggest problem

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.529 
with it the really the biggest problem
with<00:05:49.620> this<00:05:49.680> map<00:05:49.889> is<00:05:50.099> the<00:05:50.310> jump<00:05:50.610> and<00:05:50.729> it's<00:05:51.389> a

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
with this map is the jump and it's a

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:52.700 
with this map is the jump and it's a
really<00:05:51.720> big<00:05:51.960> jump<00:05:52.199> I<00:05:52.289> didn't<00:05:52.560> actually

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
really big jump I didn't actually

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.830 
really big jump I didn't actually
necessarily<00:05:53.400> I<00:05:53.580> didn't<00:05:53.940> originally<00:05:54.419> have<00:05:54.539> the

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
necessarily I didn't originally have the

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.779 
necessarily I didn't originally have the
jump<00:05:55.080> in<00:05:55.199> the<00:05:55.289> map<00:05:55.470> I<00:05:55.620> had<00:05:55.740> something<00:05:55.949> else<00:05:56.220> but

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
jump in the map I had something else but

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.029 
jump in the map I had something else but
you<00:05:57.599> know<00:05:57.690> I<00:05:57.720> would<00:05:58.169> the<00:05:58.259> budget<00:05:58.560> concerns<00:05:58.830> and

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
you know I would the budget concerns and

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.020 
you know I would the budget concerns and
everything<00:05:59.250> I<00:05:59.310> was<00:05:59.460> not<00:05:59.580> going<00:05:59.669> to<00:05:59.729> be<00:05:59.849> able<00:05:59.880> to

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
everything I was not going to be able to

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.490 
everything I was not going to be able to
keep<00:06:00.120> what<00:06:00.360> I<00:06:00.389> had<00:06:00.599> before<00:06:00.780> so<00:06:01.139> I<00:06:01.169> made<00:06:01.380> this

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
keep what I had before so I made this

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.409 
keep what I had before so I made this
huge<00:06:01.680> jump<00:06:02.009> and<00:06:02.130> it's<00:06:02.610> actually<00:06:02.969> really<00:06:03.150> fun

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
huge jump and it's actually really fun

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.330 
huge jump and it's actually really fun
and<00:06:03.570> it<00:06:03.659> tends<00:06:03.840> to<00:06:03.900> work<00:06:04.169> most<00:06:05.070> of<00:06:05.190> the<00:06:05.250> time

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
and it tends to work most of the time

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.100 
and it tends to work most of the time
but<00:06:05.610> there<00:06:05.759> are<00:06:05.909> you<00:06:06.300> know<00:06:06.330> a<00:06:06.419> lot<00:06:06.690> of<00:06:06.719> problems

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
but there are you know a lot of problems

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.870 
but there are you know a lot of problems
with<00:06:07.229> the<00:06:07.289> jump<00:06:07.500> still<00:06:07.740> I'm<00:06:08.219> not<00:06:08.400> the<00:06:08.580> best<00:06:08.729> of

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
with the jump still I'm not the best of

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.760 
with the jump still I'm not the best of
making<00:06:09.120> jumps<00:06:09.449> and<00:06:09.599> I<00:06:09.750> really<00:06:10.199> am<00:06:10.289> not<00:06:10.320> at<00:06:10.680> all

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
making jumps and I really am not at all

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.980 
making jumps and I really am not at all
i'm<00:06:11.130> terrible<00:06:11.520> at<00:06:11.580> making<00:06:11.699> jumps<00:06:12.150> but<00:06:12.719> i<00:06:12.750> tried

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
i'm terrible at making jumps but i tried

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.930 
i'm terrible at making jumps but i tried
my<00:06:13.020> best<00:06:13.169> for<00:06:13.530> this<00:06:13.620> map<00:06:13.830> and<00:06:14.130> i<00:06:14.280> think<00:06:14.699> i<00:06:14.759> did

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
my best for this map and i think i did

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.670 
my best for this map and i think i did
decent<00:06:15.389> that's<00:06:15.630> good<00:06:15.900> it<00:06:16.050> could<00:06:16.199> use<00:06:16.380> a<00:06:16.409> lot<00:06:16.650> of

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
decent that's good it could use a lot of

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.469 
decent that's good it could use a lot of
work<00:06:16.919> and<00:06:17.159> hopefully<00:06:17.610> you<00:06:17.969> know<00:06:18.060> i'm<00:06:18.150> planning

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 
work and hopefully you know i'm planning
