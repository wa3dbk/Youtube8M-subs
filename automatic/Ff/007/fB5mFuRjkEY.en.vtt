stuff
and<00:03:56.270> pretty<00:03:56.660> much<00:03:56.830> yeah<00:03:58.420> watching<00:03:59.420> this

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
and pretty much yeah watching this

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.350 
and pretty much yeah watching this
through<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.780> video<00:04:00.020> camera<00:04:00.380> as<00:04:00.500> I<00:04:00.620> pour<00:04:01.360> so

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
through the video camera as I pour so

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.120

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
weeks I tend to do more six weeks and

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.090 
weeks I tend to do more six weeks and
then<00:04:50.000> you<00:04:50.060> can<00:04:50.240> strain<00:04:50.600> it<00:04:50.720> off<00:04:50.840> and<00:04:51.470> use<00:04:51.920> this
