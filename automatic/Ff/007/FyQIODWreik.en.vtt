 [Music] 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.049
 find out on a morning drive 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.910
 roads are nice and empty a little pace 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.910
 I quickly do not like him 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.070
 and that immediately gives us a nice one 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.710
 had the option of the 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.730
 LED headlights of the Ford Mondeo 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.580
 demonstrate 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.650
 high who already think lets lets lets a 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.629
 hours of running just fooling around on LED 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.580
 be that that is the characteristic of one 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.199
 facelift the come more mind you 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.750
 application in the headlight ethel app 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.070
 technology really makes a lot of sense with 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.770
 you just 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.050
 individual leds can be switched on and off and such 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.390
 can create a specific light image 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.920
 what fits the situation you are in 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.920
 if motorists drive me crazy 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.710
 headlights year takes you just nestled 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.030
 low beam high beam to high beam how 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.280
 do n't use your hair very nice 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.720
 oncoming traffic had to put out a lot 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.630
 people forgot that 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.000
 dazzles you man nowadays that 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.130
 in a modern car you no longer have to 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.460
 oncoming high beam comes an oncoming car 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.340
 to hear the light dimmed tidy 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.470
 value not the only adaptive 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.280
 led headlights of the mondeo that 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.010
 recognize 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.200
 7 situation they can imagine you 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.200
 I don't have a city ​​drive either 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.150
 many light far to invite you to 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.160
 the highway is otherwise above 110 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.080
 kilometers per hour the headlight becomes me 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.030
 area you face upwards and 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.509
 it just appears much further on you 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.670
 You also have your own job in step 2 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.009
 do so over come where I find sometimes 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.350
 to a street or a house number 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.869
 or a parking space and then you want something 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.850
 have wider light and also in curves 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.030
 sends the light with you 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.200
 never look so very much until you get the 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.450
 really pay attention 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.180
 and certainly on camera seeing light can do it 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.549
 really to bit follow that bend and that 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.300
 are those little things that you like you 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.950
 a lot of 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:17.810
 say on winding roads in the dark 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:20.720
 However rich hero now learned about 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.250
 modern lighting technology set the buildings 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.190
 builds 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.750
 not that I can do better 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.830
 it better and I also want one 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.230
 new mondeo 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.480
