it but you can see the skin bubbled and
was<00:02:02.479> real<00:02:02.599> hard<00:02:02.840> on<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.049> top

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
was real hard on the top

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.900 
was real hard on the top
I'm<00:02:05.540> gonna<00:02:05.780> remove<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.800> outer<00:02:07.040> skin<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:07.670> fat

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
I'm gonna remove the outer skin and fat

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.120 
I'm gonna remove the outer skin and fat
I<00:02:08.179> try<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.450> remove<00:02:08.720> as<00:02:08.840> much<00:02:09.080> fat<00:02:09.140> as<00:02:09.440> possible

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
I try to remove as much fat as possible

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.610 
I try to remove as much fat as possible
so<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.460> meats<00:02:10.700> as<00:02:10.910> lean<00:02:11.180> as<00:02:11.450> can<00:02:11.630> be<00:02:11.810> it's<00:02:12.470> the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
so the meats as lean as can be it's the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.260 
so the meats as lean as can be it's the
way<00:02:12.710> I<00:02:12.740> personally<00:02:13.370> like<00:02:13.550> it<00:02:13.580> some<00:02:13.970> people

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
way I personally like it some people

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.890 
way I personally like it some people
leave<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:14.690> on<00:02:15.970> but<00:02:16.970> that's<00:02:17.270> kind<00:02:17.570> of<00:02:17.630> gross

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
leave this on but that's kind of gross

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.059 
leave this on but that's kind of gross
in<00:02:18.350> my<00:02:18.530> opinion

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.220 

it<00:02:21.430> peels<00:02:21.760> right<00:02:22.120> off<00:02:22.180> it's<00:02:22.599> really<00:02:22.810> easy<00:02:22.989> to

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
it peels right off it's really easy to

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.069 
it peels right off it's really easy to
take<00:02:23.680> off<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.249> then<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:25.599> stuff<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:25.930> doesn't

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079
