 Y 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.170
 benefits of swimming in babies 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.510
 what we call little baby swimming 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.130
 it has to do with nothingness at least with 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.230
 what most people do 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.180
 they understand to learn to swim since 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.629
 this approach can not be achieved 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.940
 until 4 or 5 years before this age 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.640
 the children are too small to 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.530
 develop autonomy in water and 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.320
 acquire the movements of swimming 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.960
 the newborns are perfectly 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.480
 endowed with a variety of reflexes that 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.150
 they make possible the progressive development 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.420
 of a behavior adapted to the environment in which 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.370
 water develop in this case the 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.530
 most important objective of this 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.019
 activity focuses on strengthening the 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.299
 bond of love and trust between the 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.450
 mother and the baby doing that both 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.729
 share a unique original experience 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.000
 and unrepeatable, strengthening the relationship 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:16.450
 affective and cognitive between baby mom and 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.700
 dad in addition if this were not enough 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.940
 they will create play situations within 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.380
 of a recreational and recreational environment 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.920
 benefits that swimming brings in the 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.260
 babies psychomotor development the baby 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.840
 he still does not walk he finds himself in the water 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.310
 the possibility of moving 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.990
 three-dimensionally being much older 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.500
 the freedom and continuity of movements 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.240
 strengthening of the system 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.120
 cardiorespiratory 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.790
 Swimming strengthens the heart and 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.250
 lungs due to respiratory work 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.560
 that is done in the water increases the 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.200
 efficiency in oxygenation and 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.570
 transfer of blood also helps the 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.790
 immune system increases the 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.920
 IQ and it's 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.080
 proven that babies who have done 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.330
 swimming in the first two years of 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.399
 life they develop a greater perception 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.800
 of the world that surrounds them with what 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.989
 are learning to be more creative and 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.350
 observers the water stimulates the 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.940
 the child's ability to play and this fact 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.420
 will have a very positive effect on 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.030
 future learning improves and strengthens 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.030
 the affective and cognitive relationship between 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.130
 baby mom and dad realizing a 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.580
 aquatic program for a baby them 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.280
 carry 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.050
 together with his parents to share a 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.900
 situation that will help you 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.810
 mutual knowledge feeding love and 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.480
 the pride of mom and dad developed the 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.000
 vital survival skills a 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.850
 example of this is learning to turn around 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.400
 on his back and float before a fall 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.100
 The water also helps the baby to 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.160
 relax and feel much safer 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.620
 The child's age and schedules are 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.810
 advisable to wait until 3 or 4 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.270
 months of life to take the baby to the 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.000
 pool you can start classes when 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.340
 you really feel safe but you must 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.709
 to take into account that from 8 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.470
 or 9 months the baby will lose some 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.230
 very important innate reflexes that without 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.090
 doubt will be very useful the fear of water 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.400
 is acquired as the child goes 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.220
 The longer growing 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.209
 out of the water probably 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.280
 will develop feelings of 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.920
 distrust and even phobia that 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.490
 later they will hinder in many of 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.230
 the cases the learning of swimming 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.660
 recommendations that you should not forget 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.270
 before going to the pool with your baby 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.970
 you will see consult with the pediatrician 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.400
 leave your baby alone near the water 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.710
 staff that will teach the classes will be 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.950
 specifically qualified for 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:51.080
 working with children choose a schedule in 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.480
 that the child does not normally have to 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.910
 sleep or eat you never eat 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.790
 minutes before the swimming session 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:02.240
 takes everything you need to change 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.430
 diaper to the child also avoids swimming pools 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.790
 of doubtful hygienic and sanitary control 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:11.090
 because they cause serious infections and 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.230
 Orchid diseases are good 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.230
 east days 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.780
 beautiful
