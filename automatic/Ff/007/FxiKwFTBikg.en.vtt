 the protect states that the intended protected raised that do so 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:07.910
 We do Jansen that was in the park with stuff from another also cautious 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.789
 then be with your own stuff 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:14.639
 if I myself always very solid then I would be up north from below 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.640
 danielle arends 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.060
 And then you don't know that 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.550
 if your last name says in this time 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.470
 that is apparently it is important for mothers just like being angry and jan 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.050
 call that you come on your way down and not a totally different guest 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.980
 with the same first name 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.990
 and then I can go downstairs and there was the punishment in the room 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.030
 Bart just came from 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.270
 anyway i'm not in the position to do anyway and that feels a kid about it 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.540
 in addition, leaving one room free is punished by another 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.280
 massacre or corporal punishment 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.250
 without eating in bed you can't make an autopsy of course 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.840
 just as if someone from a burning building became safe after all 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.200
 get this face below nitrogen flagship 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.460
 it is a fairly clear step backwards but good 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.020
 and also sent to the rabo and abba then was the waxman on drachten was 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.350
 we think about what you have done 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.680
 and why you have done with it 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.200
 what kind of child conflicts external assignment is because a child thunder better 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.660
 charity does nothing but also think that that is not the right answer 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.189
 now it is one of the first conflicts between 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.280
 identity and how it should then come down and karin there 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.150
 annual interview so the parent and child of well say a bit scared but also 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.610

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.130
 per week in minor 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.500
 then I don't know 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.810
 that says in a video i didn't do it all let them know too 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.450
 h 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.450
 what to piss about shouldn't you do with it 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.030
