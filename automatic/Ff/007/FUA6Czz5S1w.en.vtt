but are caused by inflammation meaning
inflammation<00:01:56.890> is<00:01:57.130> continues<00:01:57.730> to<00:01:57.880> spread<00:01:58.120> and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
inflammation is continues to spread and

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.570 
inflammation is continues to spread and
grow<00:01:58.420> like<00:01:58.930> brain<00:01:59.170> tumors<00:01:59.560> cancer<00:02:00.010> things

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
grow like brain tumors cancer things

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.130 
grow like brain tumors cancer things
like<00:02:00.760> that<00:02:00.940> so<00:02:01.240> acne<00:02:01.630> is<00:02:01.750> also<00:02:02.020> an

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
like that so acne is also an

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.800 
like that so acne is also an
inflammation<00:02:02.350> is<00:02:02.920> just<00:02:03.100> on<00:02:03.220> your<00:02:03.370> skin

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
turmeric is also in also

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.639 
turmeric is also in also
anti-inflammatory<00:02:06.690> so<00:02:07.690> antibacterial

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
anti-inflammatory so antibacterial

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.730 
anti-inflammatory so antibacterial
antifungal<00:02:09.130> are<00:02:09.610> both<00:02:09.759> shrinking<00:02:10.270> acne<00:02:10.750> and

basically shrinking the growth of it and

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.330 
basically shrinking the growth of it and
if<00:02:13.930> it's<00:02:14.080> there<00:02:14.230> it's<00:02:14.320> just<00:02:14.560> shrinking<00:02:15.190> it

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
if it's there it's just shrinking it

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.250 
if it's there it's just shrinking it
basically<00:02:15.700> it's<00:02:15.940> reducing<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:16.810> bacteria

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
basically it's reducing that bacteria

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.750 
basically it's reducing that bacteria
that<00:02:17.380> can<00:02:17.500> feed<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.830> girls<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.280> it's
