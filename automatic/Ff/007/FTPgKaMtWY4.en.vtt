00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.930
 hello that such friends my name is the 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.950
 Gentle and this is an introductory video 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.050
 about a project he had in 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.299
 mind a long time ago and that finally 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.610
 I have decided to make this project what 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:17.410
 I called how to create a little machine 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.410
 recreational cadiz from scratch 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.200
 the little machine that we are going to assemble will be 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.810
 type I separate this what does it mean that 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.880
 It will be of reduced size giving us this way the 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.740
 advantage of being able to transport it to almost 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.720
 any part of the home 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.270
 This is a little machine that I made 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.980
 weather 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.190
 and it's the one we 're going to ride in this 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.190
 tutorial 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.579
 now I will put a video 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.579
 of this machine is in operation 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.430
 although how could they realize it does 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.920
 a moment in the video that is finished 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.620
 of showing was running several 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.940
 videogames of different consoles in the 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.920
 tutorial I'm going to do to build 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.190
 this little machine tries to put around 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.550
 about 2 thousand sets more or less with their 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.950
 respective images and if I have time 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.510
 when he also the videos the project 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.580
 will be directed for everyone without 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.340
 exception and for those who love 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.790
 video games so much better not because 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.849
 have a little machine at home 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.610
 It is great and much more if the factory 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.940
 is yourself 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:21.240
 I will try to cover everything absolutely 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.680
 from cutting the wood the plates of 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.490
 wood to be able to form the drawer itself 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.490
 or the little machine 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.609
 and configure the components of the 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.870
 hardware the levers buttons the 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.469
 wired system configuration 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.909
 operational the front end and finally the 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.819
 simulators with all the respective 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:45.799
 games 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.799
 before starting with this subject itself 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.400
 I remind you that all the information that 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.540
 I have compiled to do this tutorial 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.780
 I have taken it from several pages of 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.280
 internet but especially I'm going to name 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.940
 two of them that are most us 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.690
 has helped these pages are retro vice 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.690
 heretic point 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:12.150
 because they can see it 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.150
 and they are arcade dotcom 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.930
 in those two pages you can find 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.370
 a lot of information to make 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.400
 you yourself a little machine at very high 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.400
 level 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.919
 I have reached the end of this my first 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:28.750
 video I hope all have been left 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.820
 clear any doubt or suggestion 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.259
