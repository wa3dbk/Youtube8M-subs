this and I'm going to close this and I'm

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.490 
this and I'm going to close this and I'm
going<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.260> navigate<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:35.750> localhost<00:02:36.750> which<00:02:37.230> is

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
going to navigate to localhost which is

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.330 
going to navigate to localhost which is
the<00:02:38.390> place<00:02:39.390> on<00:02:39.630> my<00:02:40.020> web<00:02:40.260> server<00:02:40.500> that

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
the place on my web server that

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.050 
the place on my web server that
corresponds<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.420> what<00:02:43.020> was<00:02:43.200> set<00:02:43.380> up<00:02:43.500> with<00:02:43.680> mamp

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
corresponds to what was set up with mamp

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.760 
corresponds to what was set up with mamp
so<00:02:45.060> mamp<00:02:45.630> is<00:02:45.840> now<00:02:46.020> pointing<00:02:46.320> at<00:02:46.620> this

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
so mamp is now pointing at this

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.090 
so mamp is now pointing at this
WordPress<00:02:47.190> directory<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:48.680> this<00:02:49.680> is<00:02:49.830> what<00:02:49.980> we

template<00:04:29.289> like<00:04:29.889> this<00:04:29.919> one<00:04:30.340> bit<00:04:31.210> by<00:04:31.419> bit<00:04:31.659> from

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
template like this one bit by bit from

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.189 
template like this one bit by bit from
scratch<00:04:32.409> now<00:04:33.060> in<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.150> last<00:04:34.360> video<00:04:34.629> I<00:04:34.840> showed

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
scratch now in the last video I showed

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.809 
scratch now in the last video I showed
you<00:04:35.229> some<00:04:35.560> templates<00:04:35.979> that<00:04:36.069> I've<00:04:36.460> done<00:04:36.759> in

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:36.819 
you some templates that I've done in

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:38.790 
you some templates that I've done in
this<00:04:37.090> format<00:04:37.509> and<00:04:37.750> so<00:04:38.349> I'm<00:04:38.439> just<00:04:38.590> going<00:04:38.710> to

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
this format and so I'm just going to

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.219 
this format and so I'm just going to
quickly<00:04:38.979> go<00:04:39.159> back<00:04:39.430> so<00:04:39.729> that<00:04:39.759> you<00:04:39.969> can<00:04:40.120> see<00:04:40.389> them

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:48.240 

this<00:04:44.229> is<00:04:44.469> on<00:04:45.240> again<00:04:46.240> the<00:04:46.419> local<00:04:46.750> machine<00:04:47.250> I'm

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
this is on again the local machine I'm

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.490 
this is on again the local machine I'm
going<00:04:48.370> to<00:04:48.490> go<00:04:48.580> to<00:04:48.639> design<00:04:49.090> these<00:04:50.050> are<00:04:50.319> two

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
going to go to design these are two

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.730 
going to go to design these are two
templates<00:04:50.889> that<00:04:51.039> I<00:04:51.400> managed<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:52.419> put<00:04:52.569> together

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
templates that I managed to put together

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.040 
templates that I managed to put together
relatively<00:04:53.740> quickly<00:04:54.270> using<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.539> method<00:04:55.870> that

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
relatively quickly using the method that

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.990 
relatively quickly using the method that
we're<00:04:56.530> going<00:04:56.620> to<00:04:56.680> be<00:04:56.770> doing<00:04:57.310> here<00:04:57.669> where<00:04:57.849> we've

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
we're going to be doing here where we've

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.240 
we're going to be doing here where we've
got<00:04:58.240> basically<00:04:58.870> a<00:04:58.990> header<00:04:59.289> we've<00:04:59.830> got<00:05:00.039> some

got basically a header we've got some

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.809 
got basically a header we've got some

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909 
bit of CSS to give it the style that we

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:10.649 
bit of CSS to give it the style that we
need<00:05:07.150> and<00:05:07.979> here's<00:05:08.979> another<00:05:09.190> example<00:05:09.659> same

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:10.659 
need and here's another example same

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:12.300 
need and here's another example same
concept<00:05:10.900> we<00:05:11.469> have<00:05:11.590> a<00:05:11.650> sidebar<00:05:11.860> on<00:05:12.069> the<00:05:12.219> right

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
concept we have a sidebar on the right

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.270 
concept we have a sidebar on the right
we<00:05:13.180> have<00:05:13.210> some<00:05:13.479> designs<00:05:13.810> on<00:05:13.990> the<00:05:14.110> left<00:05:14.319> and<00:05:14.560> we

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
we have some designs on the left and we

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.950 
we have some designs on the left and we
have<00:05:15.400> a<00:05:15.430> nice<00:05:15.639> footer<00:05:15.909> with<00:05:16.180> a<00:05:16.419> couple<00:05:16.900> of

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
have a nice footer with a couple of

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:24.809 
have a nice footer with a couple of
flourishes<00:05:17.500> at<00:05:17.650> the<00:05:17.740> bottom<00:05:21.330> so<00:05:23.669> the<00:05:24.669> next

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
flourishes at the bottom so the next

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:27.330 
flourishes at the bottom so the next
step<00:05:25.029> is<00:05:25.330> to<00:05:25.960> actually<00:05:26.259> create<00:05:26.800> a<00:05:26.979> template

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
step is to actually create a template

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.510 
step is to actually create a template
that<00:05:27.400> we<00:05:27.580> can<00:05:27.729> work<00:05:27.879> with<00:05:28.560> so<00:05:29.560> when<00:05:29.919> I<00:05:29.949> log<00:05:30.250> in

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
that we can work with so when I log in

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.749 
that we can work with so when I log in
or<00:05:31.330> when<00:05:31.870> I<00:05:31.900> go<00:05:32.110> back<00:05:32.259> to<00:05:32.590> the<00:05:32.830> local<00:05:33.159> host<00:05:33.370> the

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 
or when I go back to the local host the

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:35.939 
or when I go back to the local host the
back<00:05:33.940> end<00:05:34.210> which<00:05:34.990> is<00:05:35.169> accessible<00:05:35.620> via

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:35.949 
back end which is accessible via

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:41.730 
back end which is accessible via
localhost<00:05:36.729> and<00:05:37.000> then<00:05:38.400> wp-admin<00:05:40.020> I'll<00:05:41.020> get

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:09.699 
and default are actually two names of

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:12.689 
and default are actually two names of
folders<00:06:10.060> that<00:06:10.990> correspond<00:06:11.860> to<00:06:12.069> the<00:06:12.430> themes

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699 
folders that correspond to the themes

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:17.399

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:17.409 
that I'm seeing actually here so the

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:18.930 
that I'm seeing actually here so the
first<00:06:17.620> step<00:06:17.740> is<00:06:18.009> we're<00:06:18.490> going<00:06:18.580> to<00:06:18.639> create<00:06:18.849> a

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
first step is we're going to create a

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.689 
first step is we're going to create a
new<00:06:19.240> folder<00:06:19.659> for<00:06:20.229> our<00:06:20.319> new<00:06:20.500> template<00:06:20.979> i'm

new folder for our new template i'm
going<00:06:21.909> to<00:06:21.969> call<00:06:22.120> this<00:06:22.259> my<00:06:23.259> template<00:06:23.770> and

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:25.379 
going to call this my template and
