00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
little arches and sometimes they like to

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.709 
little arches and sometimes they like to
test<00:00:14.070> its<00:00:14.309> strength<00:00:14.639> by<00:00:14.940> trying<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.420> scratch

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
test its strength by trying to scratch

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.260 
test its strength by trying to scratch
it<00:00:15.750> with<00:00:16.109> rocks<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.980> we<00:00:17.880> went<00:00:18.029> ahead<00:00:18.119> and

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
it with rocks and we went ahead and

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.390 
it with rocks and we went ahead and
patched<00:00:18.600> those<00:00:18.869> up<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.289> little<00:00:19.320> bit<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.830> what

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
patched those up a little bit and what

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.650 
patched those up a little bit and what
we're<00:00:20.520> going<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.699> do<00:00:20.789> now<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.270> get<00:00:21.390> ready<00:00:21.600> to

the<00:00:23.519> whole<00:00:23.640> thing<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.510> I'm<00:00:24.600> mixing<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.019> up

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
the whole thing and so I'm mixing it up

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.439 
the whole thing and so I'm mixing it up
right<00:00:25.350> now<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.830> I'm<00:00:26.670> just<00:00:26.820> putting<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.180> color

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
right now and I'm just putting in color

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.390 
right now and I'm just putting in color
mixing<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.320> up<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.650> then<00:00:28.740> just<00:00:28.890> putting<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.279> on

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
mixing it up and then just putting it on

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.580 
mixing it up and then just putting it on
some<00:00:29.640> test<00:00:29.849> patches<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.420> just<00:00:30.570> seeing<00:00:30.779> until

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
some test patches and just seeing until

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.100 
some test patches and just seeing until
we<00:00:31.710> get<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.949> right<00:00:32.070> color<00:00:32.250> match<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.239> this

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
we get the right color match and so this

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.290 
we get the right color match and so this
here<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.440> just<00:00:34.469> lime<00:00:34.980> putty<00:00:35.280> water<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.030> burnt

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
here is just lime putty water and burnt

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.660 
here is just lime putty water and burnt
umber<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:37.010> hopefully<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:38.309> get<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.430> darker

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
umber and hopefully we can get a darker

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.060 
umber and hopefully we can get a darker

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.270 
in it just a little bit you know
harmless<00:00:57.510> fun<00:00:57.809> we're<00:00:58.469> doing<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.800> little<00:00:58.980> test

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
harmless fun we're doing a little test

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.420 
harmless fun we're doing a little test
patches<00:00:59.879> here<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:01.350> looks<00:01:01.620> really<00:01:02.070> dark

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
patches here and this looks really dark

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.870 
patches here and this looks really dark
but<00:01:03.530> this<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.739> normally<00:01:05.129> about<00:01:05.220> five<00:01:05.580> times

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
but this is normally about five times

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.969 
but this is normally about five times
darker<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:07.140> when<00:01:07.260> we<00:01:07.320> put<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.799> then<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
darker and when we put this on then the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.270 
darker and when we put this on then the
finish<00:01:08.490> color<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:09.060> going<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.049> lime<00:01:10.920> is

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
finish color is going to be so lime is

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.580 
finish color is going to be so lime is
really<00:01:11.939> really<00:01:12.270> white<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.810> bright<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.500> it

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
really really white and bright and it

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.130 
really really white and bright and it
takes<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.890> lot<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.100> pigment<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.900> make<00:01:16.080> a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
takes a lot of pigment to to make a

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.510 
takes a lot of pigment to to make a
color<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.619> want<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.100> that's<00:01:17.310> why<00:01:17.490> it's

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
color you want and so that's why it's

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.700 
color you want and so that's why it's
nice<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.000> use<00:01:18.119> gentle<00:01:18.420> soft<00:01:18.840> colors<00:01:19.259> because

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
nice to use gentle soft colors because

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.590 
nice to use gentle soft colors because
if<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.950> really<00:01:20.189> want<00:01:20.369> deep<00:01:20.790> vibrant<00:01:21.119> colors

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
if you really want deep vibrant colors

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.670 
if you really want deep vibrant colors
you<00:01:21.689> have<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.840> use<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> lot<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.140> pigment<00:01:22.590> and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
you have to use a lot of pigment and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.649 
you have to use a lot of pigment and
that<00:01:23.100> much<00:01:23.280> pigment<00:01:23.520> starts<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.150> sacrifice

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
that much pigment starts to sacrifice

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.719 
that much pigment starts to sacrifice
the<00:01:24.840> integrity<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.350> your<00:01:25.530> plaster<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.280> you

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the integrity of your plaster and you

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.179 
the integrity of your plaster and you
get<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> weaker<00:01:27.330> crumbly<00:01:27.900> plaster<00:01:28.740> all<00:01:28.950> right

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
get a weaker crumbly plaster all right

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.440 
get a weaker crumbly plaster all right
so<00:01:29.430> we're<00:01:29.490> doing<00:01:29.640> now<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.000> getting<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.299> little

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
so we're doing now is getting a little

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.109 
so we're doing now is getting a little
mist<00:01:30.979> ready<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.189> we<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.549> miss<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.939> wall

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
mist ready so that we can miss the wall

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.969 
mist ready so that we can miss the wall
here<00:01:33.600> whenever<00:01:34.079> you're<00:01:34.290> using<00:01:34.439> any<00:01:34.770> type<00:01:34.920> of

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
here whenever you're using any type of

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.880 
here whenever you're using any type of
plaster<00:01:35.579> on<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.909> plaster<00:01:36.450> or<00:01:37.079> even<00:01:37.770> the

plaster on the plaster or even the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.980 
plaster on the plaster or even the
plaster<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.970> first<00:01:39.479> thing<00:01:39.659> stay<00:01:39.840> right

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
plaster on to the first thing stay right

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.840 
plaster on to the first thing stay right
on<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.229> wall<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.560> begin<00:01:40.799> with<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.460> wet<00:01:41.670> this

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
on to the wall to begin with we wet this

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.580 
on to the wall to begin with we wet this
the<00:01:42.060> whole<00:01:42.210> wall<00:01:42.450> down<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.020> put<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> thin<00:01:43.439> layer

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the whole wall down and put a thin layer

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.920 
the whole wall down and put a thin layer
of<00:01:43.649> clay<00:01:44.009> slip<00:01:44.340> down<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:45.180> well<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.659> everything

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
of clay slip down as well so everything

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.420 
of clay slip down as well so everything
was<00:01:45.990> nice<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.229> moist<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.950> reason<00:01:47.250> for

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
was nice and moist and the reason for

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.310 
was nice and moist and the reason for
that<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:48.000> don't<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.689> dry<00:01:48.930> surface

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
that is you don't have a dry surface

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.960 
that is you don't have a dry surface
that<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.740> then<00:01:49.890> put<00:01:50.070> something<00:01:50.369> wet<00:01:50.579> onto

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
that you then put something wet onto

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.210 
that you then put something wet onto
because<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.990> dry<00:01:52.290> surface<00:01:52.710> will<00:01:52.890> start<00:01:53.130> to

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
because this dry surface will start to

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.550 
because this dry surface will start to
suck<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.729> moisture<00:01:53.880> out<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> new<00:01:55.350> thing

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
suck the moisture out of the new thing

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.139 
suck the moisture out of the new thing
that<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.770> put<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.430> if<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:57.119> a

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
that you put on and so if you have a

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.030 
that you put on and so if you have a
completely<00:01:57.540> bone<00:01:57.840> dry<00:01:57.869> surface<00:01:58.619> here<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.890> put

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
completely bone dry surface here and put

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.039 
completely bone dry surface here and put
the<00:01:59.130> lime<00:01:59.310> wash<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.820> it'll<00:02:00.360> take<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.689> moisture

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
the lime wash on it'll take the moisture

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.499 
the lime wash on it'll take the moisture
too<00:02:01.259> fast<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:01.890> makes<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.280> it'll<00:02:02.909> can<00:02:03.329> cause

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
too fast and it makes it it'll can cause

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.780 
too fast and it makes it it'll can cause
it<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.780> crack<00:02:04.020> make<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.829> want<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.040> peel<00:02:05.250> off<00:02:05.340> and

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
it to crack make it want to peel off and

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.700 
it to crack make it want to peel off and
so<00:02:06.360> by<00:02:06.630> wetting<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.200> little<00:02:07.350> bit<00:02:07.530> we're

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
so by wetting this a little bit we're

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.380 
so by wetting this a little bit we're
trying<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.069> equalize<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.550> moisture<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> little

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
trying to equalize the moisture a little

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.170 
trying to equalize the moisture a little
bit<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.810> has<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.099> slower<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.550> has<00:02:11.879> slower

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
bit so it has a slower it has slower

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.600 
bit so it has a slower it has slower
time<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.690> dry<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.230> then

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
time to dry and then

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.340 
time to dry and then
it's<00:02:13.790> great<00:02:13.970> when<00:02:14.120> you're<00:02:14.240> using<00:02:14.360> lime<00:02:14.720> you're

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
it's great when you're using lime you're

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.010 
it's great when you're using lime you're
looking<00:02:15.620> really<00:02:15.800> for<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.190> slow<00:02:16.600> reaction<00:02:17.600> you

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
looking really for a slow reaction you

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.080 
looking really for a slow reaction you
don't<00:02:18.200> really<00:02:18.320> want<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.590> speed<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:18.920> up<00:02:19.100> is<00:02:19.940> it

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
don't really want to speed it up is it

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.180 
don't really want to speed it up is it
going<00:02:20.210> to<00:02:20.270> be<00:02:20.360> faster<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:20.930> do<00:02:21.410> this<00:02:21.770> touch<00:02:22.040> of

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
going to be faster to do this touch of

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.400 
going to be faster to do this touch of
lime<00:02:22.370> wash<00:02:22.640> than<00:02:23.210> it<00:02:23.330> was<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.660> do<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.960> original

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
lime wash than it was to do the original

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.750 
lime wash than it was to do the original
plot<00:02:24.650> plastering<00:02:25.370> oh<00:02:25.670> yeah<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.360> lot<00:02:27.080> faster<00:02:27.290> um

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
plot plastering oh yeah a lot faster um

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.250 
plot plastering oh yeah a lot faster um
main<00:02:28.760> reason<00:02:29.060> being<00:02:29.210> is<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.450> they're

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
main reason being is that they're

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.980 
main reason being is that they're
already<00:02:30.410> has<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.620> layer<00:02:30.830> down<00:02:31.100> and<00:02:31.630> so<00:02:32.630> you're

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
already has a layer down and so you're

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.780 
already has a layer down and so you're
not<00:02:33.080> basically<00:02:33.500> going<00:02:33.770> right<00:02:34.010> over<00:02:34.040> mud<00:02:34.430> or

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
not basically going right over mud or

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.100 
not basically going right over mud or
you're<00:02:34.940> not<00:02:35.060> I<00:02:35.270> mean<00:02:35.390> it'll<00:02:35.540> be<00:02:35.690> really<00:02:35.840> fast

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
you're not I mean it'll be really fast

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.230 
you're not I mean it'll be really fast
the<00:02:36.500> first<00:02:36.740> plaster<00:02:37.310> initial<00:02:37.670> plaster<00:02:38.120> we

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
the first plaster initial plaster we

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.550 
the first plaster initial plaster we
know<00:02:38.360> me<00:02:38.450> put<00:02:38.600> less<00:02:38.750> pigment<00:02:39.170> in<00:02:39.290> actual

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
know me put less pigment in actual

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.890 
know me put less pigment in actual
plaster<00:02:40.100> so<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.670> plaster<00:02:41.060> below<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.570> initial

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
plaster so the plaster below the initial

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.810 
plaster so the plaster below the initial
lime<00:02:42.050> wash<00:02:42.290> was<00:02:42.500> much<00:02:42.650> lighter<00:02:42.890> so<00:02:43.580> then<00:02:43.730> the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
lime wash was much lighter so then the

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.280 
lime wash was much lighter so then the
first<00:02:44.030> line<00:02:44.300> wash<00:02:44.540> takes<00:02:44.810> longer<00:02:45.200> because

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
first line wash takes longer because

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.900 
first line wash takes longer because
you're<00:02:45.500> trying<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:45.770> really<00:02:45.950> saturate<00:02:46.580> that<00:02:46.610> in

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
you're trying to really saturate that in

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.280 
you're trying to really saturate that in
there<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.180> make<00:02:47.270> sure<00:02:47.330> you<00:02:47.540> have<00:02:47.630> even<00:02:47.990> color

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
there to make sure you have even color

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.530 
there to make sure you have even color
and<00:02:48.590> this<00:02:49.459> one<00:02:49.670> we're<00:02:49.970> basically<00:02:50.240> going<00:02:50.480> to

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
and this one we're basically going to

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.140 
and this one we're basically going to
have<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:50.840> within<00:02:51.110> you<00:02:51.260> know<00:02:52.010> one<00:02:52.580> shade<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:53.120> the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
have it within you know one shade of the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.570 
have it within you know one shade of the
exact<00:02:53.480> same<00:02:53.660> color<00:02:53.930> at<00:02:54.739> ritmo<00:02:54.950> port<00:02:55.250> no<00:02:55.370> prob

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
exact same color at ritmo port no prob

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.640 
exact same color at ritmo port no prob
people<00:02:55.850> can<00:02:55.970> be<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.090> little<00:02:56.300> less<00:02:56.650> meticulous

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
people can be a little less meticulous

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.610 
people can be a little less meticulous
and<00:02:57.950> it'll<00:02:58.280> look<00:02:58.370> fine<00:02:58.840> how<00:02:59.840> does<00:03:00.050> it<00:03:00.200> feel<00:03:00.560> to

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
and it'll look fine how does it feel to

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.520 
and it'll look fine how does it feel to
be<00:03:00.890> coming<00:03:01.130> back<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.489> wall<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:01.700> year<00:03:02.030> later

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
be coming back to the wall a year later

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.250 
be coming back to the wall a year later

here created a hairline crack here and
here<00:04:57.349> nothing<00:04:57.890> a<00:04:57.919> major<00:04:58.220> concern<00:04:58.640> but<00:04:58.910> in

order to fix that we made another

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.279 
order to fix that we made another
plaster<00:05:00.890> same<00:05:01.490> stuff<00:05:01.760> as<00:05:01.910> this<00:05:02.120> we<00:05:02.990> didn't<00:05:03.229> we

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
plaster same stuff as this we didn't we

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:04.690 
plaster same stuff as this we didn't we
didn't<00:05:03.530> have<00:05:03.650> to<00:05:03.710> be<00:05:03.830> so<00:05:03.860> picky<00:05:04.190> about<00:05:04.400> getting

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
didn't have to be so picky about getting

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.190 
didn't have to be so picky about getting
the<00:05:04.760> color<00:05:04.970> exactly<00:05:05.210> right<00:05:05.690> because<00:05:05.870> we're

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
the color exactly right because we're

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.200 
the color exactly right because we're
going<00:05:06.320> to<00:05:06.380> go<00:05:06.470> ahead<00:05:06.560> and<00:05:06.680> and<00:05:06.950> lime<00:05:07.640> wash<00:05:07.880> over

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
going to go ahead and and lime wash over

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.150 
going to go ahead and and lime wash over
everything<00:05:08.599> here<00:05:08.900> basically<00:05:09.770> we<00:05:09.919> went<00:05:10.070> ahead

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
everything here basically we went ahead

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.770 
everything here basically we went ahead
and<00:05:10.280> we<00:05:10.400> put<00:05:10.610> that<00:05:10.640> on<00:05:10.910> really<00:05:11.120> thin<00:05:11.419> with<00:05:11.599> just

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
and we put that on really thin with just

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.080 
and we put that on really thin with just
a<00:05:11.870> light<00:05:12.050> sponge<00:05:12.380> application<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:13.400> all<00:05:13.970> those

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
a light sponge application and all those

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.060 
a light sponge application and all those
cracks<00:05:14.450> are<00:05:14.720> filled<00:05:15.020> now<00:05:15.200> and<00:05:15.530> to<00:05:15.890> help

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
cracks are filled now and to help

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.230 
cracks are filled now and to help
alleviate<00:05:16.370> some<00:05:16.789> of<00:05:16.820> that<00:05:16.910> we're<00:05:17.090> going<00:05:17.180> to

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
alleviate some of that we're going to

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.850 
alleviate some of that we're going to
use<00:05:17.390> some<00:05:17.419> more<00:05:17.690> silicone<00:05:18.229> here<00:05:18.560> underneath

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
use some more silicone here underneath

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.250 
use some more silicone here underneath
the<00:05:19.669> shingles<00:05:20.090> here<00:05:20.270> so<00:05:20.419> there's<00:05:20.660> less<00:05:20.840> water

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
the shingles here so there's less water

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.990 
the shingles here so there's less water
that<00:05:21.500> continually<00:05:21.950> is<00:05:22.190> sitting<00:05:22.580> here<00:05:22.880> and

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
that continually is sitting here and

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.150 
that continually is sitting here and
just<00:05:23.690> all<00:05:23.870> that<00:05:24.020> continual<00:05:24.620> water<00:05:24.830> water

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
just all that continual water water

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.740 
just all that continual water water
water<00:05:25.340> or<00:05:25.760> make<00:05:25.940> little<00:05:26.240> cracks<00:05:26.510> oh<00:05:26.660> it's

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
water or make little cracks oh it's

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.390 
water or make little cracks oh it's
nothing<00:05:27.020> to<00:05:27.110> be<00:05:27.200> extremely<00:05:27.620> concerned<00:05:28.130> about

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
nothing to be extremely concerned about

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.950 
nothing to be extremely concerned about
we're<00:05:28.910> just<00:05:29.060> trying<00:05:29.240> to<00:05:29.300> make<00:05:29.450> sure<00:05:29.479> that<00:05:29.840> this

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
we're just trying to make sure that this

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.070 
we're just trying to make sure that this
just<00:05:30.260> is<00:05:30.470> a<00:05:31.240> super<00:05:32.240> durable<00:05:32.450> and<00:05:32.780> with<00:05:32.900> minimal

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
just is a super durable and with minimal

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.440 
just is a super durable and with minimal
maintenance<00:05:33.470> the<00:05:34.460> neat<00:05:34.610> part<00:05:34.640> about<00:05:34.880> line<00:05:35.210> is

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
maintenance the neat part about line is

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.150 
maintenance the neat part about line is
that<00:05:35.570> if<00:05:35.630> you<00:05:35.810> just<00:05:36.169> add<00:05:36.380> a<00:05:36.410> little<00:05:36.620> more<00:05:36.860> water

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
that if you just add a little more water

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.640 
that if you just add a little more water
and<00:05:37.340> lime<00:05:37.700> to<00:05:38.060> it<00:05:38.180> it<00:05:38.300> fills<00:05:38.900> in<00:05:39.080> the<00:05:39.200> hole<00:05:39.380> and

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
and lime to it it fills in the hole and

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.730 
and lime to it it fills in the hole and
it<00:05:39.740> seals<00:05:40.039> itself<00:05:40.280> so<00:05:40.849> they<00:05:41.510> say<00:05:41.539> lime<00:05:42.409> plaster

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
it seals itself so they say lime plaster

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.040 
it seals itself so they say lime plaster
is<00:05:43.099> self-healing<00:05:43.669> cuz<00:05:44.419> even<00:05:44.539> just<00:05:44.810> water

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
is self-healing cuz even just water

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.920 
is self-healing cuz even just water
alone<00:05:45.440> well<00:05:45.770> well<00:05:46.520> the<00:05:47.060> line<00:05:47.360> will<00:05:47.510> dissolve

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
alone well well the line will dissolve

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.719 
alone well well the line will dissolve
enough<00:05:48.260> and<00:05:48.470> fill<00:05:48.650> in<00:05:48.770> its<00:05:48.950> own<00:05:49.099> crack<00:05:49.430> through

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
enough and fill in its own crack through

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:51.070 
enough and fill in its own crack through
the<00:05:49.820> years<00:05:50.030> and<00:05:50.090> that's<00:05:50.360> why<00:05:50.510> they<00:05:50.659> think<00:05:50.720> that

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
the years and that's why they think that

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.550 
the years and that's why they think that
like<00:05:51.760> Scottish<00:05:52.760> mortar<00:05:53.270> work<00:05:53.510> done<00:05:53.780> 400<00:05:54.409> years

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
like Scottish mortar work done 400 years

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.890 
like Scottish mortar work done 400 years
ago<00:05:54.770> was<00:05:54.919> still<00:05:55.159> there<00:05:55.520> I<00:05:55.820> mean<00:05:56.030> if<00:05:56.390> it<00:05:56.570> hasn't

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
ago was still there I mean if it hasn't

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.890 
ago was still there I mean if it hasn't
had<00:05:56.990> to<00:05:57.169> severe<00:05:57.500> beating<00:05:57.890> and<00:05:58.570> so<00:05:59.570> that's<00:05:59.659> one

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
had to severe beating and so that's one

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.779 
had to severe beating and so that's one
real<00:06:00.050> neat<00:06:00.260> prospect<00:06:00.890> about<00:06:01.159> using<00:06:01.550> lime

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:01.789 
real neat prospect about using lime

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:04.450 
real neat prospect about using lime
again<00:06:02.210> even<00:06:02.960> though<00:06:03.050> it<00:06:03.229> was<00:06:03.409> kind<00:06:04.250> of<00:06:04.280> not

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
again even though it was kind of not

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.119 
again even though it was kind of not
used<00:06:04.729> for<00:06:04.880> a<00:06:05.030> long<00:06:05.180> time

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:06.129 
used for a long time

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:08.639 
used for a long time
and<00:06:06.219> Portland<00:06:06.969> cement<00:06:07.270> is<00:06:07.509> what<00:06:07.869> is<00:06:08.139> used<00:06:08.439> now

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:08.649 
and Portland cement is what is used now

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:12.269 
and Portland cement is what is used now
as<00:06:08.889> an<00:06:09.399> outer<00:06:09.550> stucco<00:06:10.119> on<00:06:10.419> buildings<00:06:11.319> like<00:06:12.159> you

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:12.279 
as an outer stucco on buildings like you

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:14.850 
as an outer stucco on buildings like you
see<00:06:12.520> even<00:06:13.209> the<00:06:13.419> coop<00:06:13.749> behind<00:06:14.139> us<00:06:14.349> here<00:06:14.529> that's

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
see even the coop behind us here that's

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.759 
see even the coop behind us here that's
that's<00:06:15.159> cement<00:06:15.550> stucco<00:06:15.759> and<00:06:15.969> if<00:06:16.209> it<00:06:16.330> cracks

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:16.769 
that's cement stucco and if it cracks

00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:19.769 
that's cement stucco and if it cracks
it's<00:06:17.769> very<00:06:17.919> hard<00:06:18.159> to<00:06:18.219> patch<00:06:18.489> because<00:06:18.789> putting

00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:19.779 
it's very hard to patch because putting

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:21.719 
it's very hard to patch because putting
new<00:06:20.019> concrete<00:06:20.589> against<00:06:20.889> the<00:06:21.009> old<00:06:21.099> concrete<00:06:21.550> it

aqueducts in Italy that been rained on

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:28.070 
aqueducts in Italy that been rained on
for<00:06:26.349> thousands<00:06:26.919> of<00:06:26.979> years<00:06:27.039> have<00:06:27.789> withstood

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
for thousands of years have withstood

for thousands of years have withstood
you<00:06:29.080> know<00:06:29.199> cracking<00:06:30.009> and<00:06:30.219> healing<00:06:30.759> themselves

00:06:30.929 --> 00:06:30.939 
you know cracking and healing themselves

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:33.600 
you know cracking and healing themselves
because<00:06:31.599> the<00:06:31.749> line<00:06:31.959> kind<00:06:32.589> of<00:06:32.679> with<00:06:32.739> a<00:06:33.369> little
