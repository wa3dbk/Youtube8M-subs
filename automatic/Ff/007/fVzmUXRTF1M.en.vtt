the game so basically in one class for
level<00:00:27.660> one<00:00:27.900> like<00:00:28.109> level<00:00:28.380> five<00:00:28.619> level<00:00:29.369> 20<00:00:29.760> and

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
level one like level five level 20 and

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.849 
level one like level five level 20 and
then<00:00:30.090> level<00:00:30.510> 35<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.170> help<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.619> prestige

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
then level 35 to help you prestige

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.190 
then level 35 to help you prestige
faster<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.630> game<00:00:33.809> play<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
faster so the game play in the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.959 
faster so the game play in the
background<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.770> was<00:00:34.890> using<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.250> KF<00:00:35.550> five<00:00:35.700> end

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.719 
you notice I have a different gun on
here<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.049> i<00:01:43.110> highly<00:01:43.470> recommend<00:01:44.040> from<00:01:44.610> like

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
here so i highly recommend from like

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.319 
here so i highly recommend from like
level<00:01:45.030> 5<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.600> level<00:01:45.630> 20<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.829> use<00:01:47.130> one<00:01:47.640> gun<00:01:47.909> when

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
level 5 to level 20 you use one gun when

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.359 
level 5 to level 20 you use one gun when
you<00:01:48.360> get<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> over<00:01:48.780> 20<00:01:49.170> level<00:01:49.439> 25<00:01:49.860> use<00:01:50.189> at

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
you get to over 20 level 25 use at

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.190 
you get to over 20 level 25 use at
different<00:01:50.700> guns<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.060> level<00:01:51.360> 5<00:01:51.540> uses<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.930> KF

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
different guns so I level 5 uses the KF

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.440 
different guns so I level 5 uses the KF
five<00:01:52.409> at<00:01:52.680> level<00:01:52.950> 20<00:01:53.280> switch<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.850> sm<00:01:54.210> one

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
five at level 20 switch to the sm one

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.959 
five at level 20 switch to the sm one
and<00:01:54.689> then<00:01:55.560> once<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.159> get<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.369> little<00:01:56.490> 25

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
and then once you get the little 25

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.459 
and then once you get the little 25
utility<00:01:57.450> assault<00:01:57.780> or<00:01:57.930> not<00:01:58.079> because<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.320> could

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
utility assault or not because you could

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.870 
utility assault or not because you could
put<00:01:58.590> two<00:01:58.770> attachments<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.399> your<00:01:59.520> kill<00:01:59.700> streak

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
put two attachments on your kill streak

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.399 
put two attachments on your kill streak
so<00:02:00.060> throw<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.450> assault<00:02:00.719> drone<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.140> then

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
so throw in the assault drone and then

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.249 
so throw in the assault drone and then
you<00:02:01.560> can<00:02:01.710> also<00:02:01.829> swap<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.820> out<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.570> usually

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
you can also swap it out so you usually

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.870 
you can also swap it out so you usually
want<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.649> try<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:04.890> get<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.100> 100<00:02:05.520> kills<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.820> the

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
want to try and get to 100 kills of the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.089 
want to try and get to 100 kills of the
bottom<00:02:06.149> run<00:02:06.240> before<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.320> stop<00:02:07.590> using<00:02:07.890> it

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
bottom run before you stop using it

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.800 
bottom run before you stop using it

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
challenges by doing that so level 25

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.589 
challenges by doing that so level 25
five<00:02:13.739> you<00:02:14.099> can<00:02:14.250> keep<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.549> bottom<00:02:14.790> round<00:02:14.909> keep
