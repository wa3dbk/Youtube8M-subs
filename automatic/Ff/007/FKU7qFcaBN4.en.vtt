bottom third middle third and upper
third<00:02:37.629> I<00:02:37.840> would<00:02:37.989> stick<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:39.280> tied<00:02:39.580> clip<00:02:39.970> or<00:02:40.180> tie

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
bar in that middle third now depending

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.580 
bar in that middle third now depending
on<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.330> jacket<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:43.840> you're<00:02:44.080> wearing<00:02:44.290> and

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
on the jacket that you're wearing and

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.830 
on the jacket that you're wearing and
the<00:02:44.739> stance<00:02:45.099> of<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.459> jacket<00:02:45.940> really<00:02:46.510> may

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
the stance of the jacket really may

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.800 
the stance of the jacket really may
determine<00:02:47.290> if<00:02:47.590> you

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
determine if you

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.630 
determine if you
show<00:02:48.080> this<00:02:48.290> off<00:02:48.530> where<00:02:48.830> it's<00:02:49.010> going<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.459> go

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
show this off where it's going to go

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.110 
show this off where it's going to go
meaning<00:02:50.709> if<00:02:51.709> you<00:02:51.920> have<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:52.250> jacket<00:02:52.520> with<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:52.790> high

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
meaning if you have a jacket with a high

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.710 
meaning if you have a jacket with a high
stance<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:55.580> stance<00:02:55.940> all<00:02:56.239> that<00:02:56.360> refers<00:02:56.690> to

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
stance and the stance all that refers to

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.780 
stance and the stance all that refers to
is<00:02:57.110> basically<00:02:57.440> where<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:57.920> jacket<00:02:58.400> buttons

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
is basically where that jacket buttons

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.449 
is basically where that jacket buttons
how<00:02:59.000> high<00:02:59.239> up<00:02:59.540> so<00:03:00.020> a<00:03:00.050> three-button<00:03:00.860> jacket<00:03:01.310> has

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
how high up so a three-button jacket has

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.360 
how high up so a three-button jacket has
a<00:03:01.489> higher<00:03:01.880> stance<00:03:02.390> a<00:03:02.860> two-button<00:03:03.860> jacket<00:03:04.250> as<00:03:04.340> a

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
a higher stance a two-button jacket as a

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.120 
a higher stance a two-button jacket as a
lower<00:03:04.640> stance<00:03:05.090> all<00:03:05.630> right<00:03:05.870> so<00:03:06.200> with<00:03:06.800> a<00:03:06.830> higher

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
lower stance all right so with a higher

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.520 
lower stance all right so with a higher
stance<00:03:07.580> if<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:07.910> put<00:03:08.150> this<00:03:08.330> tie<00:03:08.630> bar<00:03:08.930> tie<00:03:09.260> clip

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
stance if you put this tie bar tie clip

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.860 
stance if you put this tie bar tie clip
lower<00:03:10.069> you're<00:03:10.640> not<00:03:10.819> necessarily<00:03:11.239> going<00:03:11.690> to<00:03:11.750> be

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
lower you're not necessarily going to be

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.300 
lower you're not necessarily going to be
able<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.110> see<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.349> when<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.560> jackets<00:03:12.980> button

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
able to see it when the jackets button

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.920 
able to see it when the jackets button
so<00:03:13.580> all<00:03:13.880> you<00:03:14.000> do<00:03:14.120> is<00:03:14.269> raise<00:03:14.450> it<00:03:14.630> up<00:03:14.720> a<00:03:14.840> little

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
so all you do is raise it up a little

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.839 
so all you do is raise it up a little
bit<00:03:15.110> so<00:03:15.290> that<00:03:15.319> it<00:03:15.560> can<00:03:15.709> be<00:03:15.860> visible<00:03:16.190> if<00:03:16.550> you're

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849
