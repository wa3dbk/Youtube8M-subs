orthopedic surgeon who uses essential

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.060 
orthopedic surgeon who uses essential
oils<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.480> his<00:00:18.630> practice<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.410> found<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.039> be

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
oils in his practice I found this to be

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.519 
oils in his practice I found this to be
very<00:00:20.189> interesting<00:00:20.970> one<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.960> reasons<00:00:22.289> why

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
very interesting one of the reasons why

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.910 
very interesting one of the reasons why
I<00:00:22.859> became<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:23.580> interested<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.590> essential<00:00:25.590> oils

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
I became so interested in essential oils

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.089 
I became so interested in essential oils
was<00:00:26.820> due<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.570> amount<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.199> research<00:00:28.740> that

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
was due to the amount of research that

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.680 
was due to the amount of research that
has<00:00:29.400> been<00:00:29.670> done<00:00:30.109> on<00:00:31.109> essential<00:00:32.099> oils<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:33.630> I

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
has been done on essential oils and so I

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.060 
has been done on essential oils and so I
think<00:00:33.809> it's<00:00:34.140> interesting<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:34.800> have<00:00:35.040> a

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
think it's interesting that we have a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.100 
think it's interesting that we have a
health<00:00:35.520> care<00:00:35.730> professional<00:00:36.030> who<00:00:36.510> has<00:00:36.719> now

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
health care professional who has now

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.380 
health care professional who has now
looked<00:00:37.800> at<00:00:37.890> some<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.309> same<00:00:38.640> research<00:00:39.090> and

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
looked at some of that same research and

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.650 
looked at some of that same research and
is<00:00:40.079> using<00:00:40.590> essential<00:00:41.160> oils<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.850> his<00:00:42.180> practice

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.200 
is using essential oils and his practice
on<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> regular<00:00:43.230> basis<00:00:43.710> if<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.700> were<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.910> walk

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
on a regular basis if you were to walk

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
into his office one of the first things

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.420 
into his office one of the first things
you<00:00:47.760> may<00:00:47.940> notice<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.750> fragrance<00:00:49.590> or<00:00:50.100> aroma

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
you may notice is the fragrance or aroma

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.170 
you may notice is the fragrance or aroma
of<00:00:50.700> essential<00:00:51.270> oils<00:00:51.770> he<00:00:52.770> not<00:00:52.980> only<00:00:53.180> diffuses

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
of essential oils he not only diffuses

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.139 
of essential oils he not only diffuses
essential<00:00:54.780> oils<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.340> front<00:00:56.670> part<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.030> his

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
essential oils in the front part of his

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.200 
essential oils in the front part of his
office<00:00:57.539> but<00:00:57.989> also<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.770> each<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> five<00:00:59.609> exam

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
office but also in each of the five exam

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.240 
office but also in each of the five exam
rooms<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.809> believe<00:01:01.500> he<00:01:01.590> does<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.980> not<00:01:02.219> just

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
rooms I believe he does that not just

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.570 
rooms I believe he does that not just
because<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.390> aroma<00:01:04.110> or<00:01:04.470> fragrance<00:01:05.010> but

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
because of the aroma or fragrance but

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.390 
because of the aroma or fragrance but
because<00:01:06.330> essential<00:01:07.080> oils<00:01:07.409> have<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.950> ability

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
because essential oils have the ability

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.039 
because essential oils have the ability
to<00:01:08.640> kill<00:01:09.510> airborne<00:01:10.170> pathogens<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.130> well

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
to kill airborne pathogens as well

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.230 
to kill airborne pathogens as well
another<00:01:13.049> protocol<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.400> surgeon<00:01:14.880> uses

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
another protocol that the surgeon uses

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.130 
another protocol that the surgeon uses
with<00:01:15.630> his<00:01:15.780> patients<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.580> he<00:01:17.580> has<00:01:17.820> them<00:01:18.479> rub

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
with his patients is he has them rub

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.580 
with his patients is he has them rub
essential<00:01:19.650> oils<00:01:19.950> into<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.369> affected<00:01:20.880> area<00:01:21.509> a
