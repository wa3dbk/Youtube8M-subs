00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.300
 In this video you can see some horny 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.300
 bridges for your minecraft world 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.779
 Professionals and welcome to 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.880
 fourth pot of last the sanyo 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.460
 minecraft yes today is about bridge 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.490
 and there I have five kinds of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.739
 I like to show you bridges 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.450
 I would like and yes then I would say 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.160
 Let's start with the first one 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.460
 almost everyone knows this bridge 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.610
 the normal stone bridge and the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.320
 take the bridge here and so 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.000
 yes the only special maybe 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.700
 here this mastered stone goat the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.250
 in each case at these stages border and the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.650
 Steps are there that the facade 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.630
 does not seem so empty and yes 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.070
 maybe what about the lamps? 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.240
 I have thought of lamps supervision 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.520
 if you bridge such times in whole 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.170
 big room drops that in here below 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.040
 does not look so bald and right 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.280
 looks really good, and yes 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.090
 lamps are just these trap doors and yes 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.799
 that it would come to the first bridge to 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.140
 second the second bridge already looks 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.479
 something massive and a little more modern 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.249
 also here with the bow of the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.109
 bridge and are on this arch 

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:27.810
 stop those fences 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:29.700
 which serves a bit as a rope and 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.350
 he's a bit down here, too 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.409
 as a part of that everything so 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.219
 bit is held together and 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:41.729
 this great veil receives this great 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:42.749
 these big bows and therefore have to 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.429
 the circumstances also a bit 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:47.310
 That's why it's true that's the case 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.139
 a bit huge and that's also here 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.280
 so half a feiler because the bridge is yes 

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:55.079
 but still further and yes maybe 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.789
 but to go in here 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.219
 here in the middle are everywhere helped 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.649
 steps and here I just have 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.520
 spruce wood laid over that one 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.950
 little bit about that one level above 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.450
 was packed and that on everyone 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.170
 page 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.730
 and yes it would be the second bridge 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.230
 we come to the third the third one 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.050
 a bit Chinese 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.220
 Japanese anyway 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.360
 Everything made of wood in any case and yes 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.790
 So you realize that it's her 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.780
 Japanese or Chinese is recognizable 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.210
 stop this jump of wood the 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.870
 just do this in Chinese flair 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.360
 with the bridge in and yes again 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.190
 was also different types of wood 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.260
 do not use it that much 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.870
 looks and also a bit 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.370
 lowered down so here again by so 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.040
 a stage and it's called for here 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.670
 lowered so that a bit horny 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.430
 looks and here a bit too 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.880
 Decorated with such a few bows here in the 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.250
 over the bridge and here too 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.720
 closed the window with his side on it 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.710
 yes that would be the third bridge 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.750
 Commissioner fourth the fourth bridge 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.700
 Actually looks almost exactly like 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.530
 the second, however, had decisive 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.990
 difference 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.160
 Here are two parts of the pillars 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.550
 I actually come to the castle 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.470
 a little better because she had 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.340
 better to adapt to the water 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.860
 Anyway and here I'm going to stop 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.470
 no ropes down so in the form of witnesses 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.760
 but so are the bridge is here 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.620
 thus built to the stone levels 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.010
 and yes, another bow here 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.770
 built over it and what maybe 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.290
 to say the form is the bridge has 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.760
 here a vault and then goes 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.190
 Again, where the fall is so kind 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.130
 down and here he starts again 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.350
 Effect that it would be the fourth and 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.070
 now we come to the last one 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.750
 bridge the last hump had been there 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.400
 I thought a bit about that 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.450
 should not be so massive but 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:08.060
 look a little better and me 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.470
 think so well done so here 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.300
 Both bows I have about it 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.670
 made it over the bridge with it 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.080
 has received a bit and yes so the 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.989
 Bridge, I can imagine if 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.380
 you kinda if you have such a minecraft 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.880
 Castle has been built and through the park 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.070
 flows so influential you can do this 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.010
 bridge well because they too 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.620
 very well placed here with son 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.669
 the whole 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:36.930
 his and so and again 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:39.060
 used different types of wood and so 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.100
 so that does not look the same and 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.080
 The pillars are also very small 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.710
 So I just have two 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.030
 logs used in each case while the 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.770
 bridge is not difficult either 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.880
 so that the circumstances a bit 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.960
 fit and yes that would be it to the bridges 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.639
 and at the same time with this part 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.020
 and yes, if you liked it 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:05.100
 Of course you like a rating there 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.139
 leave and yes well then I want to say 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.410
 Let's see in the next part of last 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:13.350
 design your minecraft and yes I hope 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.389
 that I put the bridges on ideas 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.130
 or you guys from all over 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.800
 the back has a zusammengebastelt the 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.800
 then looks really cool and yes me 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:26.160
 I hope you with this kram her 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.590

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.630
