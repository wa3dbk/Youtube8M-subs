to<00:01:54.990> be<00:01:55.200> hydreigon<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.610> was<00:01:57.270> expecting<00:01:57.719> a

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
to be hydreigon I I was expecting a

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.179 
to be hydreigon I I was expecting a
physical<00:01:58.229> barrier<00:01:58.320> Lucario<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:58.979> just

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
physical barrier Lucario so I just

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.039 
physical barrier Lucario so I just
wanted<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.460> burn<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.790> switch<00:02:00.420> out<00:02:00.600> as<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> hydro

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
wanted to burn it switch out as a hydro

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.899 
wanted to burn it switch out as a hydro
I'll<00:02:01.380> take<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.649> any<00:02:01.710> day<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.189> hydro<00:02:02.820> pump

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
I'll take that any day and hydro pump

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.780 
I'll take that any day and hydro pump
actually<00:02:03.240> picks<00:02:03.450> up<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.689> one<00:02:03.840> hit<00:02:03.960> KO<00:02:04.170> on

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
actually picks up the one hit KO on

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.850 
actually picks up the one hit KO on
namaskar<00:02:05.300> so<00:02:05.420> that's<00:02:05.570> really<00:02:05.840> big<00:02:05.990> 4-3<00:02:06.710> lead

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
namaskar so that's really big 4-3 lead

combat which I am more than happy to see

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.440 
combat which I am more than happy to see
because<00:02:55.250> my<00:02:55.370> Road<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:55.760> wash<00:02:55.880> of<00:02:56.030> course<00:02:56.239> is

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
because my Road and wash of course is

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.080 
because my Road and wash of course is
more<00:02:56.660> specially<00:02:57.080> defensive<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:58.090> mega

for a sphere and dark pulse and I think

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.890 
for a sphere and dark pulse and I think
that's<00:03:19.850> just<00:03:19.880> a<00:03:20.030> testament<00:03:20.239> to<00:03:20.570> how<00:03:20.840> good

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
the best special attackers and they

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.340 
the best special attackers and they

zapdos<00:05:27.080> here<00:05:27.440> is<00:05:27.650> going<00:05:28.220> to<00:05:28.430> faint<00:05:28.960> you<00:05:29.960> know

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
zapdos here is going to faint you know

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.360 
zapdos here is going to faint you know
the<00:05:30.380> only<00:05:30.470> way<00:05:30.650> you<00:05:30.800> could<00:05:30.889> have<00:05:31.010> really<00:05:31.190> want

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
the only way you could have really want

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.670 
the only way you could have really want
any<00:05:31.520> way<00:05:31.730> is<00:05:32.030> if<00:05:32.330> you<00:05:32.449> t<00:05:32.630> boult<00:05:32.810> on<00:05:32.900> my<00:05:33.020> Lucario

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
any way is if you t boult on my Lucario

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.740 
any way is if you t boult on my Lucario
I<00:05:33.830> was<00:05:33.949> fully<00:05:34.160> paralyzed<00:05:34.699> and<00:05:34.940> then<00:05:35.300> I<00:05:35.570> was

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
I was fully paralyzed and then I was

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.720 
I was fully paralyzed and then I was
fully<00:05:35.930> paralyzed<00:05:36.380> again<00:05:36.740> so<00:05:37.340> the<00:05:37.400> chances

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
fully paralyzed again so the chances

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.950 
fully paralyzed again so the chances
that<00:05:37.790> were<00:05:37.940> relatively<00:05:38.360> low<00:05:38.660> you<00:05:38.720> know<00:05:38.870> I

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
that were relatively low you know I

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.020 
that were relatively low you know I
played<00:05:39.050> my<00:05:39.230> odds<00:05:39.530> I<00:05:39.770> hate<00:05:39.980> Stone<00:05:40.250> Edge<00:05:40.400> I<00:05:40.639> never

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
played my odds I hate Stone Edge I never

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.879 
played my odds I hate Stone Edge I never
want<00:05:41.270> to<00:05:41.330> use<00:05:41.389> it<00:05:41.660> and<00:05:41.690> like<00:05:42.169> I<00:05:42.290> said<00:05:42.350> I<00:05:42.500> missed

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
want to use it and like I said I missed

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.170 
want to use it and like I said I missed
it<00:05:43.010> all<00:05:43.220> the<00:05:43.340> times<00:05:43.550> i<00:05:43.669> use<00:05:43.910> the<00:05:44.030> dead

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
it all the times i use the dead

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.970 
it all the times i use the dead
nationals<00:05:44.600> so<00:05:45.050> it's<00:05:45.199> really<00:05:45.350> an<00:05:45.500> awful<00:05:45.860> move

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
nationals so it's really an awful move

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.650 
nationals so it's really an awful move
to<00:05:46.130> rely<00:05:46.400> on<00:05:46.430> especially<00:05:47.030> on<00:05:47.120> a<00:05:47.150> frail<00:05:47.419> mega

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
to rely on especially on a frail mega

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.900 
to rely on especially on a frail mega
evolution<00:05:48.110> like<00:05:48.230> Lucario<00:05:48.770> so<00:05:49.100> if<00:05:49.669> i<00:05:49.730> had<00:05:49.820> to

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
evolution like Lucario so if i had to

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.640 
evolution like Lucario so if i had to
recommend<00:05:50.300> a<00:05:50.389> mega<00:05:50.570> Lucario<00:05:50.930> bill<00:05:51.080> that<00:05:51.230> first

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
recommend a mega Lucario bill that first

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.780 
recommend a mega Lucario bill that first
of<00:05:51.710> all<00:05:51.770> probably<00:05:52.010> recommend<00:05:52.250> rock<00:05:52.580> slide

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
of all probably recommend rock slide

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.490 
of all probably recommend rock slide
over<00:05:53.000> stone<00:05:53.180> edge<00:05:53.360> but<00:05:53.720> i'll<00:05:54.050> talk<00:05:54.230> more<00:05:54.260> about
