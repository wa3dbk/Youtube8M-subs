actually<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> entangle<00:01:31.590> spells<00:01:31.799> do<00:01:31.950> not<00:01:32.100> work

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
actually the entangle spells do not work

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.100 
actually the entangle spells do not work
on<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.729> implants<00:01:33.090> because<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.869> cannot

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
on the implants because you cannot

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.539 
on the implants because you cannot
attack<00:01:34.409> them<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.829> can<00:01:34.950> only<00:01:35.070> use<00:01:35.159> them<00:01:35.400> in

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
attack them and you can only use them in

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.370 
attack them and you can only use them in
combat<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.180> don't<00:01:36.479> worry<00:01:36.600> about<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.990> entangle

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
combat so don't worry about the entangle

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.870 
combat so don't worry about the entangle
spells<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.579> run<00:01:38.759> around

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
spells you just have to run around

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.609 
spells you just have to run around
through<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> wheat<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.259> pass<00:01:40.439> through

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
through the wheat you can pass through

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.710 
through the wheat you can pass through
this<00:01:40.770> wheat<00:01:40.979> stuff<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.479> find

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
this wheat stuff and you have to find

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.660 
this wheat stuff and you have to find
the<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:42.990> planes<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.409> are<00:01:43.470> worth<00:01:43.770> value<00:01:44.250> and

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
the in planes that are worth value and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.160 
the in planes that are worth value and
you<00:01:44.790> can<00:01:44.939> also<00:01:45.060> world<00:01:45.329> hop<00:01:45.540> because<00:01:45.990> there's

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
you can also world hop because there's

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.600 
you can also world hop because there's
different<00:01:46.500> airplanes<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.979> different<00:01:47.340> worlds

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
different airplanes on different worlds

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.190 
different airplanes on different worlds
so<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.820> can<00:01:47.970> always<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.360> use<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.899> friends

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
so you can always just use a friends

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.389 
so you can always just use a friends
list<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.470> quick<00:01:49.680> hop<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.040> different<00:01:50.310> worlds

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
list to quick hop to different worlds

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.700 
list to quick hop to different worlds
and<00:01:50.670> test<00:01:51.329> out<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> employees<00:01:51.840> there<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.680> I

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
and test out the employees there so I

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.350 
and test out the employees there so I
actually<00:01:52.920> got<00:01:53.189> pretty<00:01:53.399> incredibly<00:01:54.030> lucky

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
actually got pretty incredibly lucky

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.999 
actually got pretty incredibly lucky
just<00:01:54.570> within<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.930> few<00:01:54.960> minutes<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.560> trying<00:01:55.860> this

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
just within a few minutes of trying this

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.280 
just within a few minutes of trying this
I<00:01:56.250> actually<00:01:56.490> found<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:57.090> kingly<00:01:57.509> inkling<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.200> as

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
I actually found a kingly inkling so as

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.690 
I actually found a kingly inkling so as
you<00:01:58.409> can<00:01:58.500> see<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.680> just<00:01:58.890> ran<00:01:59.070> right<00:01:59.100> past<00:01:59.369> it

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
you can see I just ran right past it

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.429 
you can see I just ran right past it
there<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.540> course<00:02:00.570> since<00:02:00.960> there<00:02:01.140> are<00:02:01.229> no

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
there and of course since there are no

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.289 
there and of course since there are no
you<00:02:01.799> couldn't<00:02:02.100> use<00:02:02.280> stuns<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.820> game<00:02:03.000> or<00:02:03.240> in

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
you couldn't use stuns in the game or in

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.270 
you couldn't use stuns in the game or in
tangles<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.049> mean<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.560> did<00:02:04.770> take<00:02:04.950> quite<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.219> while

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
tangles I mean it did take quite a while

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.830 
tangles I mean it did take quite a while
to<00:02:05.490> catch<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.820> because<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.270> ran<00:02:06.420> away<00:02:06.540> and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
to catch it because it ran away and

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.900 
to catch it because it ran away and
since<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.290> higher<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.099> level<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.700> point

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
since the higher the level the in point

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.790 
since the higher the level the in point
is<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.270> harder<00:02:09.539> they<00:02:09.660> are<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.810> catch<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.530> since

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
is the harder they are to catch so since

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.860 
is the harder they are to catch so since
the<00:02:10.979> King<00:02:11.160> Olympia<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.670> 91<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.300> takes<00:02:12.599> quite<00:02:12.780> a

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
the King Olympia is 91 it takes quite a

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.100 
the King Olympia is 91 it takes quite a
while

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
while

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.020 
while
actually<00:02:13.470> catch<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.550> tend<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.820> fail

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
actually catch it and you tend to fail

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.550 
actually catch it and you tend to fail
quite<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.360> bit<00:02:15.540> always<00:02:16.020> make<00:02:16.200> sure<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.380> don't

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
quite a bit always make sure you don't

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.380 
quite a bit always make sure you don't
actually<00:02:16.710> loot<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.400> Plains<00:02:17.610> because<00:02:17.790> odds

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
actually loot the in Plains because odds

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.270 
actually loot the in Plains because odds
are<00:02:18.780> for<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.380> most<00:02:19.530> part<00:02:19.770> you're<00:02:19.950> actually

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
are for the most part you're actually

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.470 
are for the most part you're actually
going<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.520> lose<00:02:20.580> money<00:02:20.880> if<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.210> end<00:02:21.360> up

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
going to lose money if you end up

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.760 
going to lose money if you end up
looting<00:02:21.780> them<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.080> it's<00:02:22.230> much<00:02:22.350> much<00:02:22.560> better

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
looting them so it's much much better

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.440 
looting them so it's much much better
just<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.250> catch<00:02:23.400> them<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.730> catch<00:02:24.420> them

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
just to catch them and catch them

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.660 
just to catch them and catch them

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
in planes and that's really what you

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.430 
in planes and that's really what you
tend<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.090> enjoy<00:02:48.240> in<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.570> game<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:49.170> can<00:02:49.320> do

that<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.770> make<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.130> would<00:02:50.670> say<00:02:50.850> on<00:02:50.970> average

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
that and make I would say on average

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.120 
that and make I would say on average
it's<00:02:51.420> around<00:02:51.690> 2<00:02:51.930> mil<00:02:52.080> per<00:02:52.200> hour<00:02:52.350> it<00:02:53.100> really

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
it's around 2 mil per hour it really

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.070 
it's around 2 mil per hour it really
just<00:02:53.700> depends<00:02:53.970> on<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.180> ecto<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:54.720> don't<00:02:54.930> really

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
just depends on you ecto so don't really

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.840 
just depends on you ecto so don't really
expect<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.680> make<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:55.950> consistent<00:02:56.130> 2<00:02:56.550> mil<00:02:56.700> per

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.820 
expect to make it consistent 2 mil per
hour<00:02:57.000> if<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.300> ever<00:02:57.480> do<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:57.780> try<00:02:58.050> this<00:02:58.110> it

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
hour if you ever do that try this it

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.949 
hour if you ever do that try this it
does<00:02:59.130> vary<00:02:59.400> quite<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.760> bit<00:02:59.820> also<00:03:00.420> there's<00:03:00.780> like
