00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:42.090
 of the partners 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.129
 option 2 is for axel rose to 6 geese 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.550

 [Music] 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:56.480
 also but I did not understand the object 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.790
 very happy his brother nothing was left with 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.859
 all 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:06.540
 the bad of this today in ricardo morÃ¡n 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.540
 we listen to your opinion 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.579
 excellent presentation 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.499
 I'm trying to find the buts 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.760
 the evaluation but it does not provoke me 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:18.910
 It seems that he has done an extraordinary 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.070
 presentation is a difficult song is 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.990
 a song that I do not only like 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.570
 both in the mccartney version that I 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.690
 it seems that he is the original author as the 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.130
 cover that makes guns and roses and that is 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.340
 a complicated song is emotion 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.740
 difficult your voice has gained a lot of weight 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.169
 that I did not have especially before in the 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.500
 sharp and it feels so like axl 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.570
 rose I the only thing I would observe is a 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.009
 A little more precision in English 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.740
 there are some words that escape you 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.940
 here I saw tuning at the end but 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.009
 it would really be pettiness 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.360
 censure you for that with all the rest of 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.210
 good things that makes the stage very 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.979
 well excellent comments what would be 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.900
 the option that we must remember for 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.680
 send our text message and vote 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.009
