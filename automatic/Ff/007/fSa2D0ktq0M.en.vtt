00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
your lightning connector in there but

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.639 
your lightning connector in there but
you<00:00:49.269> don't<00:00:49.420> get<00:00:49.540> much<00:00:49.750> of<00:00:49.899> the<00:00:49.989> feedback<00:00:50.229> or

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
you don't get much of the feedback or

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.979 
you don't get much of the feedback or
that<00:00:50.800> click<00:00:51.100> when<00:00:51.309> you<00:00:51.339> push<00:00:51.579> it<00:00:51.699> in<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:52.780> power

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
that click when you push it in the power

that click when you push it in the power
button<00:00:53.170> is<00:00:53.350> still<00:00:53.589> exposed<00:00:53.920> to<00:00:54.129> there's<00:00:54.280> no

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
button is still exposed to there's no

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.670 
button is still exposed to there's no
problems<00:00:54.879> there<00:00:54.940> but<00:00:55.809> one<00:00:55.960> thing<00:00:56.199> I<00:00:56.409> didn't

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
problems there but one thing I didn't

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.410 
problems there but one thing I didn't
like<00:00:56.739> is<00:00:57.100> that<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:57.370> volume<00:00:57.550> buttons<00:00:58.000> actually

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
like is that the volume buttons actually

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.450 
like is that the volume buttons actually
covered<00:00:58.809> and<00:00:58.989> unmarked<00:00:59.559> so<00:00:59.769> not<00:01:00.100> only<00:01:00.219> does<00:01:00.399> it

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
covered and unmarked so not only does it

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.160 
covered and unmarked so not only does it
require<00:01:00.760> more<00:01:01.059> effort<00:01:01.210> to<00:01:01.540> push<00:01:01.719> the<00:01:01.870> buttons

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
require more effort to push the buttons

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.240 
require more effort to push the buttons
because<00:01:02.559> you<00:01:02.710> need<00:01:02.829> to<00:01:02.890> push<00:01:03.040> through<00:01:03.159> the

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
because you need to push through the

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.279 
because you need to push through the
leather<00:01:03.549> but<00:01:04.089> for<00:01:04.269> a<00:01:04.299> new<00:01:04.540> user<00:01:04.809> just

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:05.289 
leather but for a new user just

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:06.900 
leather but for a new user just
introduced<00:01:05.740> to<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:05.979> iphone<00:01:06.310> it<00:01:06.520> could<00:01:06.729> take<00:01:06.759> a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
introduced to the iphone it could take a

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.060 
introduced to the iphone it could take a
bit<00:01:07.000> longer<00:01:07.179> to<00:01:07.539> find<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:07.840> butter<00:01:08.050> I'm<00:01:08.800> not

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
bit longer to find the butter I'm not

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.680 
bit longer to find the butter I'm not
sure<00:01:09.280> if<00:01:09.460> it<00:01:09.580> was<00:01:09.640> just<00:01:09.850> my<00:01:09.970> case<00:01:10.210> it<00:01:10.390> was<00:01:10.420> sent

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
sure if it was just my case it was sent

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.240 
sure if it was just my case it was sent
out<00:01:10.810> but<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.050> camera<00:01:11.350> cut<00:01:11.500> out<00:01:11.649> was<00:01:11.800> a<00:01:11.830> very

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
out but the camera cut out was a very

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.800 
out but the camera cut out was a very
weird<00:01:12.369> inaccurate<00:01:13.270> shape<00:01:13.450> I<00:01:13.570> don't<00:01:13.750> know

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
weird inaccurate shape I don't know

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.780 
weird inaccurate shape I don't know
maybe<00:01:13.960> it's<00:01:14.110> just<00:01:14.259> me<00:01:14.470> but<00:01:14.500> it<00:01:14.710> works<00:01:14.860> fine

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
maybe it's just me but it works fine

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.060 
maybe it's just me but it works fine
this<00:01:17.420> case<00:01:17.630> also<00:01:17.780> falls<00:01:18.260> into<00:01:18.410> a<00:01:18.560> stand<00:01:18.890> with

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
this case also falls into a stand with

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.860 
this case also falls into a stand with
that<00:01:19.160> second<00:01:19.610> small<00:01:19.940> tab<00:01:20.150> that<00:01:20.540> I<00:01:20.600> showed<00:01:20.840> you

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
that second small tab that I showed you

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.510 
that second small tab that I showed you
earlier<00:01:21.020> on<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.530> video<00:01:21.770> this<00:01:22.040> sounds<00:01:22.370> really

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
earlier on the video this sounds really

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.920 
earlier on the video this sounds really
handy<00:01:22.910> when<00:01:23.030> you<00:01:23.120> want<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.360> watch<00:01:23.480> a<00:01:23.600> video<00:01:23.870> on

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
handy when you want to watch a video on

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.570 
handy when you want to watch a video on
the<00:01:24.110> go<00:01:24.290> one<00:01:24.620> thing<00:01:24.770> I'd<00:01:24.890> like<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:25.100> know<00:01:25.370> is

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
the go one thing I'd like to know is

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.070 
the go one thing I'd like to know is
that<00:01:25.700> you<00:01:25.790> can't<00:01:26.030> adjust<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:26.540> angle<00:01:26.690> of<00:01:26.960> the

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
that you can't adjust the angle of the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.170 
that you can't adjust the angle of the
stand<00:01:27.380> if<00:01:27.680> you<00:01:28.010> try<00:01:28.220> this<00:01:28.250> falls<00:01:28.700> on<00:01:28.820> its<00:01:29.000> face

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
stand if you try this falls on its face

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.170 
stand if you try this falls on its face
unfortunately<00:01:30.490> it<00:01:31.490> was<00:01:31.670> all<00:01:31.820> well<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.120> good

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
unfortunately it was all well and good

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.120 
unfortunately it was all well and good
having<00:01:32.810> a<00:01:32.900> thin<00:01:33.140> case<00:01:33.440> but<00:01:33.950> how<00:01:34.040> about

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
having a thin case but how about

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.070 
having a thin case but how about
protection<00:01:34.790> on<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.360> corners<00:01:35.660> of<00:01:35.690> the<00:01:35.870> case

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
protection on the corners of the case

which is a significant down for my

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.820 
which is a significant down for my
opinion<00:01:44.020> one<00:01:45.020> thing<00:01:45.200> that<00:01:45.229> I'd<00:01:45.410> like<00:01:45.440> to<00:01:45.590> point

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
opinion one thing that I'd like to point

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.590 
opinion one thing that I'd like to point
out<00:01:45.979> is<00:01:46.040> that<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.490> screen<00:01:46.729> cover<00:01:47.000> doesn't

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
out is that the screen cover doesn't

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.060 
out is that the screen cover doesn't
press<00:01:47.840> down<00:01:48.050> properly<00:01:48.410> I'd<00:01:48.680> like<00:01:48.830> to<00:01:48.950> have

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
press down properly I'd like to have

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.499

seen<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:49.550> magnet<00:01:49.910> there<00:01:50.119> or<00:01:50.240> something

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
seen and magnet there or something

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.790 
seen and magnet there or something
similar<00:01:50.869> don't<00:01:51.229> keep<00:01:51.410> the<00:01:51.530> cover<00:01:51.710> down

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
similar don't keep the cover down

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.010 
similar don't keep the cover down

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
because again if you drop the case the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.749 
because again if you drop the case the
cover<00:01:54.200> could<00:01:54.410> fly<00:01:54.770> open<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.220> damage<00:01:55.729> the
