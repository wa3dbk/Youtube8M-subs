00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.500
Hello and thanks for tuning into Episode 7 of Season 1 of the Tutorials.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.020
Today I'll be showing you how to open the cargo doors, open the passenger doors, and use the jetty [air-bridge],

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:36.620
and the ... luggage ramps and cars, so we'll get started.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.500
To open the main exit, it's Shift+E, and then as you can see it's opening.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.440
Then to get the jetty [air-bridge] attached, it's Ctrl+J. Now while that's loading, we'll just go to the other

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.760
side and get the cargo doors open.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.120
To open the cargo doors, it's Shift+E and then immediately after, 2.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.580
And then the luggage ramp automatically starts moving.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.380
Now to open all of the doors, it's Shift+E and immediately after 3.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.500
As you just saw there. Now that's the jetty [air-bridge] now attached.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.780
And there's the luggage ramp.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:39.720
Now that the luggage ramp it attached, the luggage cart will now automatically reverse and come over

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.880
towards the ramp.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.580
And then that's how everything is set up.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:56.060
Then the luggage ramp and cart will automatically go away after about 5 minutes, and then that's

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.660
when you can close the doors.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.400
And then it's Ctrl+J to take away the jetty [air-bridge] and Shift+E to close the main exit.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.760
And you're done.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.340
Thanks for tuning into episode 7, episode 8 will be out next week and it's how to taxi.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:13.700
Thanks for watching.
