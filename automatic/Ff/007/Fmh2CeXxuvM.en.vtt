area in the game first it have to be the

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:04.319 
area in the game first it have to be the
mother<00:04:01.870> ship<00:04:02.139> after<00:04:02.349> this<00:04:03.090> because<00:04:04.090> you<00:04:04.299> have

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
mother ship after this because you have

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.679 
mother ship after this because you have
to<00:04:04.540> use<00:04:04.629> stealth<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.230> I<00:04:05.290> suck<00:04:05.590> at<00:04:05.739> stuff<00:04:06.689> um
