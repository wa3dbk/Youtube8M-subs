00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.310 
thirty-five pounds and ten percent body
fat<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.920> puts<00:00:26.130> me<00:00:26.340> at<00:00:26.539> 150<00:00:27.539> pounds<00:00:28.109> and

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
twenty-eight percent body fat so now my

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.510 
twenty-eight percent body fat so now my
next<00:00:32.730> goal<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:34.020> drop<00:00:34.620> another<00:00:34.920> ten<00:00:35.190> percent

next goal is to drop another ten percent

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.370 
next goal is to drop another ten percent
body<00:00:35.640> fat<00:00:35.790> which<00:00:36.540> would<00:00:36.690> put<00:00:36.780> me<00:00:36.840> at<00:00:37.020> eighteen

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
body fat which would put me at eighteen

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.220 
body fat which would put me at eighteen
percent<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:38.070> then<00:00:38.579> i<00:00:38.850> would<00:00:39.090> start<00:00:39.300> prepping

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
percent and then i would start prepping

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.360 
percent and then i would start prepping
for<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> competition<00:00:40.890> i<00:00:41.450> think<00:00:43.280> over<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
for a competition i think over the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.040 
for a competition i think over the
course<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.820> seven<00:00:45.210> months<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:45.690> actually

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
course of the seven months it's actually

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.090 
course of the seven months it's actually
been<00:00:46.260> fairly<00:00:46.770> easy<00:00:47.539> I<00:00:48.539> mean<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> beginning<00:00:49.980> is

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
been fairly easy I mean the beginning is

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.410 
been fairly easy I mean the beginning is
hard<00:00:50.430> i<00:00:50.579> think<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.820> beginning<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.270> always

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
hard i think the beginning is always

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.900 
hard i think the beginning is always
hard<00:00:51.840> for<00:00:51.930> people<00:00:52.410> just<00:00:52.620> getting<00:00:53.610> into<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
hard for people just getting into the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.270 
hard for people just getting into the
