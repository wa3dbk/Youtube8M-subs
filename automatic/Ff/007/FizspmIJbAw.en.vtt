00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.710
MARIA: Oh, hey, hola.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:07.160
This is my friend, Supreme Court
Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.670
SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.640
MARIA: Un cafecito?

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.750
SONIA SOTOMAYOR: Si, gracias.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.850
BABY BEAR: Finally, justice
will be served!

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.470
MARIA: Hey, Baby Bear.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.830
BABY BEAR: Hi.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.480
Hey, I heard that there was
a Supreme Court Justice on

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.770
Sesame Street.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.035
MARIA: There is, Baby Bear.

00:00:23.035 --> 00:00:24.500
There is.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.040
SONIA SOTOMAYOR:
Hi, Baby Bear.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.070
I am Supreme Court Justice
Sonia Sotomayor.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.130
But you can call me Justice.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.910
BABY BEAR: Oh, well.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.520
You can call me Baby.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.560
SONIA SOTOMAYOR: OK, Baby.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.920
BABY BEAR: OK, Justice.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.550
Now, to be clear, what does
a Justice do again?

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.130
SONIA SOTOMAYOR: A Supreme Court
Justice is a judge who

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.050
solves arguments by giving
his or her opinion.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.100
BABY BEAR: That's just
what I thought.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.230
Well, I need you to listen
and solve a disagreement.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.820
MARIA: Whoa, whoa, wait a
minute now, Baby Bear.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.430
We're trying to have a
little coffee here.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.650
SONIA SOTOMAYOR: No hay
problema, Maria.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.790
I can handle this.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.600
I do all the time.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.715
Just give me a second.

00:01:02.715 --> 00:01:07.730
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.160
BABY BEAR: Wow!

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.470
Impressive.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.090
SONIA SOTOMAYOR: I always
wear these robes

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.390
when I hear a case.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.140
BABY BEAR: Perfect.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.700
Now I can tell you
what happened.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.770
GOLDILOCKS: Wait a minute!

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.200
I have something to say, too.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.900
SONIA SOTOMAYOR: I
know who you are.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.350
You're Goldilocks.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.820
GOLDILOCKS: And I know who you
are, a Supreme Court Justice.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.420
The perfect judge
to hear my case.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.230
BABY BEAR: Whoa, whoa.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.215
Hold on a second.

00:01:32.215 --> 00:01:35.540
The Justice has to hear
my side of the story.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.561
GOLDILOCKS: No, mine!

00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:37.443
BABY BEAR: No, mine!

00:01:37.443 --> 00:01:38.325

00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:39.870
SONIA SOTOMAYOR: Don't worry.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.910
I will listen to both sides
of the case, OK?

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.620
Baby, you go first.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.080
BABY BEAR: Thank you,
Your Honor.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.320
Now, does the Justice think it
was right for Goldilocks to

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.230
come into my house--

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.210
uninvited, mind you-- sit in
my chair, and break it?

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.660
SONIA SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.330
Let me hear Goldilocks'
story next.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.180
GOLDILOCKS: I'm sorry.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.199
I didn't mean to break it.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.061
I didn't know it
was his chair.

00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:11.504
I was tired.

00:02:11.504 --> 00:02:15.320
And it was the only chair
that fit just right.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.970
MARIA: This is ridiculous!

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.180
Plus, our cafe is
getting cold.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.440
SONIA SOTOMAYOR: This will only
take a second, Maria.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.580
Baby, Goldilocks didn't mean
to bring the chair.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.120
It was an accident, and
accidents do happen.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.696
BABY BEAR: Well, I guess
that is kind of true.

00:02:32.696 --> 00:02:36.140
But I mean, my chair
is still broken.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.700
SONIA SOTOMAYOR: Well, I think
that maybe we can fix that.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.620
BABY BEAR: How?

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.640
SONIA SOTOMAYOR: Goldilocks,
do you have glue?

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.790
GOLDILOCKS: I do.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.150
SONIA SOTOMAYOR: Then, to end
this disagreement, I say you

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.970
help Baby fix his chair, and
then the two of you can live

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.970
happily ever after.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.060
BABY BEAR: I can
live with that.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.700
Thank you, Justice!

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.935
GOLDILOCKS: Well, come
on, Baby Bear.

00:02:58.935 --> 00:03:03.210
I'll fix this chair
in no time at all!

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.390
MARIA: Amiga, you are
a very good sport.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.550
SONIA SOTOMAYOR: Are
you kidding?

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.440
I wish all my cases
were this easy.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.490
Ahora, el cafe, por favor.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.962
MARIA: Si.

00:03:14.962 --> 00:03:16.536
THREE LITTLE PIGS: We
heard there was a

00:03:16.536 --> 00:03:18.450
Justice on Sesame Street.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.610
We need her to end
our disagreement!

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.820
BIG BAD WOLF: Well, me too!

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.295
I would like to state my case.

00:03:25.295 --> 00:03:29.290
MARIA: Oh, this is going to
be a very long afternoon.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.870
SONIA SOTOMAYOR: All in
a day's work, Maria.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.470
All in a day's work.
