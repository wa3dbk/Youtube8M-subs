I'm just kidding she does like she this
is<00:02:16.010> this<00:02:16.580> is<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:17.000> good<00:02:17.420> example<00:02:17.660> of<00:02:18.200> why<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.530> AI

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
is this is a good example of why the AI

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.920 
is this is a good example of why the AI
needs<00:02:19.069> to<00:02:19.310> be<00:02:19.370> fixed<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:20.300> now<00:02:20.420> she's<00:02:20.690> gonna<00:02:20.810> be

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930
