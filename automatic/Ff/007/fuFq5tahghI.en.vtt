00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.810
 Hello, I am a game and today I am going to 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.959
 give a demonstration of the capabilities 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.719
 that have cell phones with windows 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:15.230
 and well, specifically, the 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:18.789
 capabilities of the recent recent 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:22.430
 release of cortana as you 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:25.320
 before knowing cortana is 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.449
 is an application that developed 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.900
 microsoft for windows phone and 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.579
 tablets to be able to send commands and 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.760
 can open applications or perform 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.949
 specific issues in this case what 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.260
 What I'm going to do is send commands to 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:44.430
 cortana voice commands to be able 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.640
 activate a led or failing to turn it off 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.890
 and for this I have developed a 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.640
 application for windows phones 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.950
 is scheduled to cut receive 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.810
 commands and can recognize them 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:04.909
 to send a signal via bluetooth to 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.100
 external hardware 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.549
 I'm going to show you by principle 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.819
 accounts the application the application that 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:18.109
 I have here was developed in visual 

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:20.689
 studio in 2013 itself sharp is this one 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:23.479
 call 6 windows phone actually my 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.700
 application is called auto when you 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.990
 see that I invoke the south command I'm going to 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.710
 say the name of the application first 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.409
 the application basically consists of a 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.750
 very simple interface with three buttons to the 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.600
 principle and the first button is to search 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.549
 which basically consists when I 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.259
 activate in search all devices 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.050
 how useful they are more to our 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.050
 around 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.500
 and connect to one specifically the 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.080
 Cancel button that is to be able to 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.490
 cancel a connection when I 'm 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.490
 connecting to a 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.200
 the disconnect button so that in case of 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.660
 that is already connected I can 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.000
 disconnect from bluetooth 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.980
 specifically and finally I have a 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.120
 button that is called yesterday command and a 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.750
 text box to send commands to me 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.600
 external interface and finally the 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.850
 external interface basically consists of 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.290
 an electronic arduino card and 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.800
 well you have to know that a card 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.959
 This type of electronics consists of a 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.670
 microprocessor in forgiveness or in a 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.920
 microcontroller that contains in turn 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.730
 different electronic components for 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.730
 be able to realize then some devices 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.560
 electronic this arduino card is 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:52.250
 the program in programming language 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:56.000
 c and as you can see this card is 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.550
 connected to a bluetooth device that 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.130
 it's called good in this case it's a h 0 5 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.000
 which is actually designed to be able 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:08.080
 connect to the hoop and not directly 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.600
 and finally this is a sensor 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.110
 ultrasound that is for these effects not 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.480
 is going to be used in this card 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.300
 wine was already programmed precisely for 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.690
 can send and receive commands from my 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.940
 auto application now I'm going to do the 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.300
 show as you can see from 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.580
 this side is here a led connected already 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.400
 directly to the arduino card and 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.170
 There is a green LED on that 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.220
 course is telling us that the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.800
 arduino card is being 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.600
 energized then to start the 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.690
 show what I'm going to do is 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.570
 summon cortana to be able to tell him that 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.900
 turn off the light and by means of bluetooth 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:57.120
 cortana will send a 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:04:00.569
 a message and it involves me my card is going to 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.460
 receive that command and it will activate the 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:08.620
 light and turn it off 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.580
 we have to make sure that it is 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.570
 bluetooth device 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:16.030
 hc 05 is already paired in 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.820
 my device and connected and as 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.260
 you can see the hc 05 already 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.260
 find connected 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.920
 now I'm going to activate the cut to 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.920
 be able to send a command 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.050
 auto turn on the light 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:56.330
 and there we can already see the led on 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.330
 now I'm going to turn it off 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:01.489
 auto turn off the light 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.840
 and well there we see already the light off and 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.260
 Well, these are the capabilities that 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.840
 the phone windows are already immersed in 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.500
 in the new devices this is the 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.930
 way in how to communicate directly 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.360
 with external electronic interfaces and 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:39.530
 well, this example is basically 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:42.020
 useful to be able to automate some 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.910
 devices at home like being able to tell 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.760
 shorten shorten off light of my 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:50.000
 bedroom turn off 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.430
 my refrigerator or turn off my air 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.900
 conditioned in order these are the 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.870
 capabilities and cut 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:00.550
 external devices connected to them 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.550
 viable thank you very much
