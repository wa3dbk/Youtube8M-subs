 in this afternoon our competitions of holder the hell 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:11.900
 the only source 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.349
 of information that we have 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.720
 about the shock 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.089
 will happen after quality 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:22.339
 the Bible 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.220
 human research 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.619
 can not transcend in any way 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.220
 beyond love 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.920
 and that if any person wants to know 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.180
 it remains and after stability 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.920
 soto 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.710
 it does not cover reserves 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.309
 left the hell with the rewards you remember quality 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.010
 and educational beyond the grave are issues 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.049
 where the bible is the board 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:54.170
 authority when speaking 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.580
 of it 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.330
 the people that the sea even talked about hell 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.950
 and the greatest preacher of hell 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.180
 the Lord Jesus Christ 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.440
 and he continually 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.590
 under a sky yes this message 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.660
 he repeated it and he repeated it and he repeated it for jesus christ is an agent 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.660
 and he as audio knew perfectly 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.730
 of his death on the cross would miss the people of hell 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:33.640
 if only he knew the seriousness of the sin and the only way to escape the trial 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.170
 the eternal of god 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.100
 winter did not exist 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.330
 so 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.960
 Jesus Christ would not have had 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.000
 go down to the imovie world and your thesis 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.460
 on a cross 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.350
 the death of Jesus Christ 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.310
 it is precisely related to your sins foot with my sins 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.700
 and cited below and died on the cross 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.549

 the hell after this woman 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.459
 consider for example by passages where Christ speaks of hell mateos 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.960
 52 but I tell them 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.589

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:18.639
 I was guilty of trial 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:23.999
 and whoever in fact says his brother that guilt of that council and 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:29.339
 anyone that what is happening will be exposed palin land of fire 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:31.320
 matteo and extended to eight 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.170
 Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but also can not kill 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.739
 the environment from there the leather destroy in the night the body 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:43.709

 mateo chapter 13 of circle 40 to 42 ' 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.799
 so that when you start the party where you have on the body 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.209
 so be the end of this century 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.300
 the villarreal and by man to his angels and the cooperator his kingdom to 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.720
 all those who serve trujillo alto and those of affectivity 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.570
 was going to happen in the game hype 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.809
 here comes the chlorine 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:11.519
 the gnashing of teeth 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.719
 circle 49 to 50 'the same chapter 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:19.350
 This will be the end of the century, the angels were missing 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.139
 and apart we are more concentrated 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.990
 and what the character of game rules 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.990
 Here comes the city actress and the gnashing of teeth 

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:30.819
 Matthew chapter 25 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.889
 of title 41 and the circle 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:35.289
 46 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:40.619
 says the Lord Jesus Christ then did sanctioner of the left ap 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:42.529
 attention and damn

 to the fire the ground prepared for inviables the angels 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.010
 verse 46 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.819
 avoid risks to eternal punishment and the just 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.129
 to eternal life 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.189
 her most predictable friend of this universe 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.289
 the one that Jesus Christ the endeavor 

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:05.589
 there is a place after this life 

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:08.269
 don that weapons 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.549
 of all human beings 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.629
 this jury vecchio 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.829
 who rejected plane 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.790
 will be condemned and commented 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.060
 externally in a game that never goes out 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:24.789
 not in this league 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:30.310
 It is more important to listen to the message of the act of God 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.240
 for the salvation of his soul 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.479
 it is precisely 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:40.490
 Although we can study the 'divine hell' we have to know a little about 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.960
 God's character because there are many people who say he said he is a god 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.069
 of love 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.420
 God is a god that in the end afp 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.490
 everyone is going to forgive us and everyone is going to save us 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.090
 there are people who have told me I can not understand in the compressor how it can be 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.419
 a god creates rock and after getting married in hell others believe 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.389
 deceptively also 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.599
 if at the end of the tÃ¡chira nobody is going to condemn me 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:10.800
 and I also do not even have another life after this life 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:13.460
 all these concepts 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.830
 the revelation comes from ignorance 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.610
 of the word of God 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.990
 life does not reveal what team has all the attributes cep 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:26.159
 On the one hand we have the attributes 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.979
 natural of god 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.319
 and on the other hand we have the attributes 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:32.099
 morals of god 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:38.680
 attribute is a word that means something that belongs to cooke and alicia people 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.089
 possess the attributes 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:46.330
 this diverse to the comic that if the contingency and my presence 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.990
 means that god 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.349
 everything than what a leader generated 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:57.720
 God knows all Indians connect preferentially in Toluca at the same time 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:01.259
 these comparisons natural attributes that god 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:05.559
 but life teaches us that god say moral tribute too 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.250
 or act related 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.289
 all its character 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:13.569
 the bible says the first iphone 4 that god is love 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:20.770
 says that we choose 97 2 estimated that justice act the foundation government 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:21.710
 universal 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.860
 the bible shows us that god efe 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.889
 holy 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:30.139

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:33.150

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.770
 I am perfect in all its attributes 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.719
 and the foundation of all of them is their sanctity 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:43.909
 God's justice of God The mercy of God of Saint 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:48.999
 the love of God is holy the saintliness the dawn-tcp the justice process 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:52.589
 and when we begin to understand what God is 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:57.110
 I still hope to play musketeers with freedom 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.990
 choose us 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.449

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:07.949
 Jerez Morales

 we are beings for the freedom of fact to do 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.809
 The free will

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.860
 you can find that in this part this message is possible a little more seriously 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.149
