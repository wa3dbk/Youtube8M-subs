00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.730
 I am from ours his provider 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.000
 hobby garden and today I wanted once 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.500
 show how we our goals with 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.500
 supply 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.500
 OK 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:35.190
 is our first own made 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:40.260
 because we have on the field or am 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:44.040
 field edge woman collected and have that 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:49.650
 then dried again and again 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.989
 turned and that's just over and over again 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.540
 turned and then we pressed that 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.000
 in his trailer hammer time on it around 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:01.320
 first laced mashed 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.920
 fooled and knotted it together 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.280
 our first own houses we 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.869
 made last year in the summer and 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.660
 this year we want more of our own 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:17.940
 because we usually buy 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:24.530
 even with his farmers still hay this 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.530
 course consumes some reason 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.440
 times the in thing right now out again 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:12.130
 had to connect with several fast ones 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:15.890
 so that we still have loose hay and 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:25.040
 we had that with trailer for that 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:31.000
 car charged and then stop together 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.000
 belongs to the environment and taken away 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:48.100
 what sound funny for a bit 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:51.940
 but you are the hofer and we do 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:56.380
 that's just not so stingy or so we 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:13.690
 just do it that way 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:16.450
 we can only make a big tree 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.690
 then stop the technology that works well 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.690
 quite well 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.000
 and me very funny to each other 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.460
 get whatever location for location 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.990
 get power and then so 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.990
 not squeezed like that 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:54.450
 between like then much more in it 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.680
 then see you next year
