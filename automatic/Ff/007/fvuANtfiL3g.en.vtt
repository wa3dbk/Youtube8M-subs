00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.130
 being very sincere the ultrabooks not 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.870
 well started the concept created by 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.299
 of fairly thin notebooks and 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.740
 fast looked very beautiful on paper but 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.080
 few are the models that followed the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.580
 Scratch all specifications 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.350
 there are few models that can 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.980
 stay out of the socket for five hours 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.800
 example 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.570
 in the midst of all this we have the vaio p 11 da 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.680
 sony that strictly follows all 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.680
 intel's recommendations 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.160
 it is made of carbon and so it is 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.140
 extremely light and thin is possible 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.329
 hold it in just two fingers looks only 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.160
 a curious detail is that the quinas are 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.200
 well that is what leaves the job 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.000
 with a more square look other 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.800
 striking design feature 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.809
 when it's open the back 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.789
 stands up a little, causing the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.160
 keyboard is slightly inclined toward the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.440
 user a simple detail but that brings 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.510
 more convenience for typing and gives 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.910
 most sophisticated air appliance 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.949
 the first highlight the screen 11.6 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.380
 inch full hd resolution with 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.540
 trillo led technology - the same 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.400
 used in the line xperia sony 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.070
 besides being sensitive to the touch allowing 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.840
 up to 10 simultaneous taps and this 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.840
 combined with a powerful battery that 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.220
 take up to seven hours off the power outlet 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.619
 carbon steel structure that makes it 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.659
 it weighs only 870 grams 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.150
 beyond the same thickness of the macbook is 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.250
 making for 11 an ideal companion for 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.409
 who spends a lot of time away from home 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.759
 the settings are not surprising but 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.590
 also did not disappoint 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.869
 under the hood we have a processor 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.360
 intel core i7 dual core of fourth 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.600
 generation 4g b of ram and 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.310
 128-gigabyte ssd storage 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.439
 this means a startup in 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.479
 only four seconds fast opening 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.520
 and good overall performance. 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.290
 although the multitasking is a bit 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.159
 was hampered by the low 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.259
 RAM memory 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.399
 but we did not find a version with 8 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.399
 gb of available memory 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.240
 the keyboard and mouse set is another 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.799
 keyboard highlight could well be 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.909
 greater and make better use of 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.739
 available 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.720
 but this does not prevent typing from being 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.310
 smooth and precise as well as possessing 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.620
 led lighting 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.660
 the touchpad although small is enough 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.970
 accurate and supports all gestures of the 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:25.940
 windows 8 thinking the mouse in several 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:27.739
 situations like everything that is good in life 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.049
 especially in Brazil it is necessary 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.090
 pay a high price to get 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.670
 in the case of vaio for 11 we are talking 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.560
 of five thousand and four hundred reais more 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.910
 expensive even that the super billed 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.250
 apple macbook air 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.470
 worth it for the feature set 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.840
 Yes but not the least equivalent 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.280
 cost and benefit here 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.170
 if you like analysis and short here in 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.489
 so low our youtube channel everyone 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.489
 The days have new video for you.
