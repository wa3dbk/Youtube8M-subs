00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:05.034
 It became quite usable by raising the bottom of the parameter. 

00:00:13.126 --> 00:00:17.126
 Keep an alert as enemies may also come through the ray in the front passage. 

00:00:22.585 --> 00:00:26.585
 In response, 02 beam cannons came up. I was a little disappointed. 

00:00:30.442 --> 00:00:34.442
 The BR will aim at the aisle and the right-wing advance at this point. 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.590
 The right ray is important. The enemy's advance route is completely in sight. 

00:01:12.503 --> 00:01:16.503
 Because the enemy is falling into the snow, change the position. 

00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:27.782
 As I was calling to draw, correspondence was delayed for a moment. 

00:01:43.331 --> 00:01:47.331
 The key to reducing the number of bullets is to change the position once you have decided on the ranks from Marlan. 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.670
 I was measuring the timing, but eventually I hit it and failed (; w 

00:02:08.852 --> 00:02:12.852
 Leave the enemy in the passage to your allies and secure B for the next time. 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:52.179
 I changed the target because I saw gel M. 

00:02:53.817 --> 00:02:57.817
 It is not limited to the BR machine, but it moves from the boundary of the wall to the boundary of the wall to reduce the number of bullets. 

00:03:10.168 --> 00:03:14.168
 It has failed in the thruster landing Marlan. If it succeeds, a bullet will come out the moment the knee falls. 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.840
 The BD system that can take continuous twists over long distances is extremely compatible with the support aircraft. 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.769
 Head Vulcan and chest Vulcan are confusing, but are identified by the weapon circle "C". 

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:07.433
 As allies got in contact with the enemy's land gel, they assisted. 

00:04:34.597 --> 00:04:38.597
 Earn damage with N Saddle. 

00:04:55.123 --> 00:04:59.123
 The EXAM dash is useful for releasing the gap. 

00:05:02.566 --> 00:05:06.566
 Watch behind the wall. I'm back because I didn't follow the enemy. 

00:05:31.138 --> 00:05:35.138
 During a close battle, aim at saber (→ reservation Marlan). It is useful because you can get a continuous failure. 

00:05:54.197 --> 00:05:58.197
 Situationally, it is about Ton Ton. I am wondering which way to go with B or C. 

00:06:24.398 --> 00:06:28.398
 The BR is most likely to aim at the enemy's advance route. Read ahead and move. 

00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:35.551
 As I saw Ger M, I am going to help. 

00:06:37.554 --> 00:06:41.554
 I am on alert reading a rampage. 

00:06:52.455 --> 00:06:56.455
 Because it is a battle in the aisle, we move on the building. The reservation is being returned for the jump. 

00:07:07.018 --> 00:07:11.018
 The target has not come here at all, so I am firing continuously. 

00:07:44.356 --> 00:07:48.356
 I think that I aim at gel M after having knead at this time. 

00:08:00.272 --> 00:08:05.272
 As BD system requires BR → Marlan or Saber, and Saber → Marlan both need to reserve weapons, so it is a difficult point that it is difficult by all means.
