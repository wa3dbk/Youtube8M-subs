00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
to have students work on this for a

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.470

couple<00:00:46.960> reasons<00:00:47.200> it<00:00:47.650> introduces<00:00:48.280> a<00:00:48.480> one

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
couple reasons it introduces a one

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.000 
couple reasons it introduces a one
little<00:00:49.750> new<00:00:49.870> concept<00:00:50.380> to<00:00:50.410> the<00:00:50.559> general

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
little new concept to the general

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.340 
little new concept to the general
alternating<00:00:51.670> bass<00:00:51.820> idea<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:52.840> that<00:00:52.989> is<00:00:53.170> that

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
alternating bass idea and that is that

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.900 
alternating bass idea and that is that
the<00:00:53.440> bass<00:00:53.620> notes<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.070> four<00:00:54.309> bass<00:00:54.489> notes<00:00:54.700> in<00:00:54.850> a

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
the bass notes the four bass notes in a

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.850 
the bass notes the four bass notes in a
measure<00:00:55.050> alternate<00:00:56.050> from<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.290> fifth<00:00:56.559> to<00:00:56.680> the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
measure alternate from the fifth to the

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.890 
measure alternate from the fifth to the
fourth<00:00:57.250> and<00:00:57.550> then<00:00:57.610> the<00:00:57.760> six<00:00:58.059> to<00:00:58.270> the<00:00:58.330> fourth<00:00:58.660> on

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
fourth and then the six to the fourth on

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.320 
fourth and then the six to the fourth on
every<00:00:59.559> chord<00:00:59.920> so<00:01:00.489> that's<00:01:00.670> sometimes<00:01:00.940> leave

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
every chord so that's sometimes leave

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.320 
every chord so that's sometimes leave
the<00:01:01.450> chords<00:01:01.780> not<00:01:01.990> being<00:01:02.640> properly<00:01:03.640> named

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
the chords not being properly named

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.300 
the chords not being properly named
because<00:01:04.690> they're<00:01:04.930> kind<00:01:05.259> of<00:01:05.290> an<00:01:05.410> inversion<00:01:05.710> we

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
because they're kind of an inversion we

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.440 
because they're kind of an inversion we
don't<00:01:06.430> really<00:01:06.520> care<00:01:06.700> too<00:01:06.880> much<00:01:06.910> about<00:01:07.210> that<00:01:07.390> in

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
don't really care too much about that in

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.609 
don't really care too much about that in
the<00:01:07.600> case<00:01:07.750> of<00:01:07.780> this<00:01:08.020> song<00:01:08.200> it's<00:01:08.380> just<00:01:08.410> how<00:01:08.590> he

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
the case of this song it's just how he

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.100 
the case of this song it's just how he
plays<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:09.070> chords<00:01:09.220> but<00:01:09.940> otherwise<00:01:10.630> it's<00:01:11.050> a

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
plays the chords but otherwise it's a

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.050 
plays the chords but otherwise it's a
standard<00:01:11.680> alternating<00:01:12.340> bass<00:01:12.460> finger<00:01:12.850> picking
