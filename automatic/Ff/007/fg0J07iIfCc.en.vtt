00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.519
I think, for me, the bicycle and cycling is everything. 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.460
When I was almost 4 years old 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.700
I got on a bike,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.310
and since that moment I wanted to emulate the big champions of cycling. 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:48.310
The bicycle and cycling is my way of life. 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.240
When you can make a living doing 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.670
what you love,  

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.780
it´s a luxury.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.809
That is what gives me 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.910
the power and the passion for this sport. 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.590
You love it so much,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.100
and you are so deep into it that it becomes a way of life. 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.500
It becomes the most important thing. 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.820
You can develop. 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.040
You can go from the workshop, being able to

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.060
 solve every problem 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.310
a cyclist can have. 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.980
It´s important to know why 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.460
he has that problem. I think that is the passion of this sport. 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.780
At the end of the day, 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.510
it isn´t about going to the event, racing and going home, it´s about 24 hours of work, 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.660
thinking how you can do it better, how you can improve. 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.230
It is not about  

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.440
combining cycling and work.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.400
Being my passion, 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.240
most of the time I don´t see it like a job.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.840
I´m excited to get up, 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.190
have breakfast, and grab the jersey 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:57.190
to go training. 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.750
I think I´m a professional rider because I make my work from my passion.  Above all, I know that my bike is ready to go out and bite the asphalt.
