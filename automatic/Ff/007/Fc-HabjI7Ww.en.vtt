that's<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:02.569> poor<00:02:02.780> fingered<00:02:03.109> version<00:02:03.439> of<00:02:03.500> gene

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:03.849 
that's a poor fingered version of gene

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:06.950 
that's a poor fingered version of gene
desus<00:02:04.849> for

and<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:15.090> rhythm<00:02:15.270> of<00:02:15.510> it's<00:02:15.690> quite<00:02:15.930> subtle<00:02:16.230> so

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710

and the rhythm of it's quite subtle so
what<00:02:16.950> we<00:02:17.070> can<00:02:17.190> do<00:02:17.310> temporarily<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.390> just

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
what we can do temporarily is is just

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:25.010 
what we can do temporarily is is just
put<00:02:18.870> in<00:02:19.760> contemporary<00:02:20.760> rhythm<00:02:23.750> we<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:24.900> apply

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
put in contemporary rhythm we can apply

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.560 
put in contemporary rhythm we can apply
that<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.350> every<00:02:25.560> gold<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.730> we've<00:02:26.850> got<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.120> minor

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.900 

9g<00:02:31.790> takes<00:02:32.790> us<00:02:33.060> for

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910

i savvy so slow
and<00:02:37.930> we<00:02:38.020> go<00:02:38.170> round<00:02:38.380> those<00:02:38.620> chords<00:02:39.070> three<00:02:39.340> times

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590

on<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.680> last<00:02:54.890> round<00:02:55.310> we<00:02:55.670> slightly<00:02:56.060> change<00:02:56.360> it

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
on the last round we slightly change it

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.120 
on the last round we slightly change it
we<00:02:56.660> can<00:02:56.780> pesi<00:02:57.230> at<00:02:57.440> nine
