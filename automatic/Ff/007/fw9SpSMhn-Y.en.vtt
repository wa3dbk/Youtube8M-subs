00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
your downloadable content on a probably

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.940 
your downloadable content on a probably
something<00:05:29.660> a<00:05:29.690> little<00:05:29.780> release<00:05:30.230> or<00:05:30.530> just

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
something a little release or just

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.310 
something a little release or just
something<00:05:31.130> you<00:05:31.280> can<00:05:31.430> format<00:05:31.730> on<00:05:32.090> the<00:05:32.810> side<00:05:33.020> so

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
something you can format on the side so

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.230 
something you can format on the side so
which<00:05:33.440> we<00:05:33.620> all<00:05:33.770> have<00:05:33.950> already<00:05:34.370> at<00:05:34.490> bat<00:05:34.700> yeah<00:05:35.030> so

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
which we all have already at bat yeah so

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.000 
which we all have already at bat yeah so
that<00:05:35.390> i<00:05:35.419> think<00:05:35.510> that's<00:05:35.930> kind<00:05:36.200> of<00:05:36.260> smart<00:05:36.620> yeah

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
that i think that's kind of smart yeah

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.500 
that i think that's kind of smart yeah
that's<00:05:37.310> kind<00:05:37.490> of<00:05:37.520> smart<00:05:37.910> that<00:05:38.060> i<00:05:38.090> do<00:05:38.210> that

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
that's kind of smart that i do that

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.180 
that's kind of smart that i do that
they're<00:05:39.020> like<00:05:39.200> well<00:05:39.380> why<00:05:39.590> make<00:05:39.800> them<00:05:39.950> pay<00:05:40.160> for

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
they're like well why make them pay for

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.040

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
a hard drive in there when we could take

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.300 
a hard drive in there when we could take
it<00:05:42.080> out<00:05:42.260> of<00:05:42.290> the<00:05:42.440> cost<00:05:42.650> of<00:05:42.860> system<00:05:43.190> they

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
it out of the cost of system they

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.250 
it out of the cost of system they
probably<00:05:43.520> have<00:05:43.880> a<00:05:43.910> few<00:05:44.090> wrist<00:05:44.510> yeah<00:05:44.750> why<00:05:44.960> give
