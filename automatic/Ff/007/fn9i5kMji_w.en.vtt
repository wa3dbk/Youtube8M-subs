00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
to do was just have this tower thing run

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.979 
to do was just have this tower thing run
on<00:00:30.980> a<00:00:31.009> complete<00:00:31.610> autopilot<00:00:31.970> and<00:00:32.509> still

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
gonna get a little bit closer on the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.040 
gonna get a little bit closer on the
plants<00:00:36.559> pretty<00:00:36.739> soon<00:00:37.040> but<00:00:37.310> as<00:00:37.370> you<00:00:37.640> can<00:00:37.760> see

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
plants pretty soon but as you can see

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.620 
plants pretty soon but as you can see
from<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:39.170> last<00:00:39.290> update<00:00:39.940> the<00:00:40.940> plants<00:00:41.510> are

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
from the last update the plants are

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.420 
from the last update the plants are
doing<00:00:41.720> really<00:00:42.320> really<00:00:42.650> well

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
doing really really well

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.180

and<00:00:43.720> you<00:00:44.720> know<00:00:44.810> I<00:00:44.840> didn't<00:00:45.230> absolutely<00:00:45.440> nothing

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
and you know I didn't absolutely nothing

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.240 
and you know I didn't absolutely nothing
except<00:00:46.880> for<00:00:46.910> make<00:00:47.360> sure<00:00:47.390> that<00:00:48.110> the<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:49.040> water

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
except for make sure that the the water

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.740 
except for make sure that the the water
was<00:00:49.430> still<00:00:49.520> running<00:00:49.640> while<00:00:50.270> I<00:00:50.300> was<00:00:50.480> gone<00:00:50.600> on

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
was still running while I was gone on

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.120 
was still running while I was gone on
vacation<00:00:50.900> that's<00:00:51.470> it<00:00:51.740> just<00:00:51.980> make<00:00:52.100> sure

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
vacation that's it just make sure

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.270 
vacation that's it just make sure
electricity<00:00:52.970> was<00:00:53.390> coming<00:00:53.660> into<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:53.930> system

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
electricity was coming into the system

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.670 
electricity was coming into the system
aside<00:00:55.280> from<00:00:55.460> that<00:00:55.520> I<00:00:55.850> pH<00:00:56.390> and<00:00:56.750> properly<00:00:57.380> added

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
aside from that I pH and properly added

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.260 
aside from that I pH and properly added
nutrients<00:00:58.190> to<00:00:58.310> the<00:00:58.400> water<00:00:58.579> before<00:00:58.940> I<00:00:58.970> left

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
nutrients to the water before I left

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.990 
nutrients to the water before I left
gave<00:00:59.840> a<00:00:59.870> little<00:01:00.140> bit<00:01:00.230> extra<00:01:00.800> just<00:01:01.100> in<00:01:01.370> case<00:01:01.430> it

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
gave a little bit extra just in case it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.220 
gave a little bit extra just in case it
was<00:01:02.150> going<00:01:02.300> to<00:01:02.360> run<00:01:02.510> out<00:01:02.660> but<00:01:02.840> these<00:01:02.989> plants

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
was going to run out but these plants

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.719 
was going to run out but these plants
are<00:01:03.380> very<00:01:03.410> young<00:01:03.800> so<00:01:04.009> I<00:01:04.040> don't<00:01:04.220> expect<00:01:04.489> that<00:01:04.610> to

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
are very young so I don't expect that to

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.719 
are very young so I don't expect that to
happen<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:05.269> in<00:01:05.390> fact<00:01:05.659> it<00:01:05.840> didn't<00:01:06.140> happen

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
happen and in fact it didn't happen

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.340 
happen and in fact it didn't happen
we're<00:01:07.729> gonna<00:01:07.820> go<00:01:08.000> ahead<00:01:08.119> and<00:01:08.450> take<00:01:08.840> a<00:01:08.870> look<00:01:09.050> at

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
we're gonna go ahead and take a look at

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.500 
we're gonna go ahead and take a look at
the<00:01:09.590> close-ups<00:01:10.220> real<00:01:10.430> quick<00:01:10.700> just<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.300> show

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
the close-ups real quick just to show

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.270 
the close-ups real quick just to show
you<00:01:11.570> exactly<00:01:12.140> how<00:01:12.320> healthy<00:01:12.800> these<00:01:12.920> plants

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
you exactly how healthy these plants

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.570 
you exactly how healthy these plants
have<00:01:13.370> become

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.780 

so<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:19.700> kale<00:01:20.290> was<00:01:21.290> probably<00:01:21.920> as<00:01:22.190> far<00:01:22.220> as<00:01:22.550> the

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
so the kale was probably as far as the

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.330 
so the kale was probably as far as the
leaf<00:01:23.060> diameter<00:01:23.570> goes<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:24.380> biggest<00:01:24.830> leaf<00:01:25.040> when

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
leaf diameter goes the biggest leaf when

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.510 
leaf diameter goes the biggest leaf when
I<00:01:25.370> left<00:01:25.760> was<00:01:26.410> about<00:01:27.410> this<00:01:27.800> size<00:01:28.070> here<00:01:28.310> this

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
I left was about this size here this

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.760 
I left was about this size here this
really<00:01:28.850> small<00:01:29.210> little<00:01:29.870> thing<00:01:30.140> or<00:01:30.320> maybe

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
really small little thing or maybe

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.410 
really small little thing or maybe
somewhere<00:01:31.100> closer<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.610> this<00:01:31.730> this<00:01:32.060> actually

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
somewhere closer to this this actually

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.720 
somewhere closer to this this actually
this<00:01:32.720> cotile<00:01:33.080> down<00:01:33.320> here<00:01:33.530> as<00:01:34.250> you<00:01:34.400> can<00:01:34.520> see

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
this cotile down here as you can see

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.540 
this cotile down here as you can see
it's<00:01:35.200> probably<00:01:36.200> gone<00:01:36.290> up<00:01:36.350> about<00:01:36.560> 10x<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:37.340> size

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
it's probably gone up about 10x and size

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.720 
it's probably gone up about 10x and size
every<00:01:38.060> single<00:01:38.510> kale<00:01:39.130> spinach<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:40.490> chard

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
every single kale spinach and chard

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.230 
every single kale spinach and chard
spinach<00:01:41.420> up<00:01:41.810> top<00:01:42.050> and<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:43.190> chart<00:01:43.580> right<00:01:43.940> here

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
spinach up top and the chart right here

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.150 
spinach up top and the chart right here
are<00:01:44.750> doing<00:01:45.020> really<00:01:45.170> well<00:01:45.350> chard<00:01:45.710> I've<00:01:45.860> noticed

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
are doing really well chard I've noticed

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.710 
are doing really well chard I've noticed
his<00:01:46.310> a<00:01:46.550> little<00:01:46.850> bit<00:01:46.940> slower<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.420> grow<00:01:47.570> in

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
his a little bit slower to grow in

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.160 
his a little bit slower to grow in
general<00:01:48.140> than<00:01:48.800> kale<00:01:49.190> or<00:01:49.660> lettuce<00:01:50.660> as<00:01:50.870> we<00:01:51.020> can

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
general than kale or lettuce as we can

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.280 
general than kale or lettuce as we can
see<00:01:51.410> down<00:01:51.620> here<00:01:52.000> but<00:01:53.000> in<00:01:53.180> general<00:01:53.600> it's<00:01:54.020> doing

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
see down here but in general it's doing

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.620 
see down here but in general it's doing
really<00:01:54.410> well<00:01:54.590> over<00:01:55.040> in<00:01:55.250> tower<00:01:55.700> at<00:01:55.910> number<00:01:56.300> two

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
really well over in tower at number two

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.770

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
now just to talk a little bit about the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.330 
now just to talk a little bit about the
method<00:02:21.470> because<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:21.739> know<00:02:21.800> that's<00:02:22.040> what<00:02:22.220> this

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
method because I know that's what this

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.750 
method because I know that's what this
whole<00:02:22.520> thing<00:02:22.790> is<00:02:22.910> about<00:02:23.860> it's<00:02:24.860> very<00:02:25.100> simple<00:02:25.489> I

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
whole thing is about it's very simple I

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.750 
whole thing is about it's very simple I
gave<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.600> a<00:02:26.890> little<00:02:27.890> bit<00:02:28.040> more<00:02:28.430> than<00:02:28.640> what

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
gave it a little bit more than what

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.430 
gave it a little bit more than what
general<00:02:29.090> hydroponics<00:02:29.330> recommends<00:02:30.110> in<00:02:30.260> the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
general hydroponics recommends in the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.070 
general hydroponics recommends in the
mild<00:02:30.950> vegetative<00:02:31.489> growth<00:02:31.550> phase<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.660> I

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
mild vegetative growth phase so I

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.770 
mild vegetative growth phase so I
believe<00:02:34.070> it's<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.400> teaspoon<00:02:35.000> per<00:02:35.239> gallon<00:02:35.600> I

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
believe it's a teaspoon per gallon I

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.020 
believe it's a teaspoon per gallon I
wanted<00:02:36.200> about<00:02:36.320> 1.5<00:02:37.010> teaspoons<00:02:37.489> just<00:02:37.790> because

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
wanted about 1.5 teaspoons just because

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.699 
wanted about 1.5 teaspoons just because
I<00:02:38.060> know<00:02:38.209> it<00:02:38.510> from<00:02:38.630> my<00:02:38.840> experience<00:02:39.290> that<00:02:39.350> leafy

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
I know it from my experience that leafy

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.560 
I know it from my experience that leafy
greens<00:02:39.950> can<00:02:40.130> handle<00:02:40.459> it<00:02:40.610> but<00:02:41.030> that's<00:02:41.120> about<00:02:41.390> it

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
greens can handle it but that's about it

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.690 
greens can handle it but that's about it
