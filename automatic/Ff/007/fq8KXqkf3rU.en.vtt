00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.240 
if I feel too much space I might only
hit<00:04:30.170> the<00:04:30.290> root<00:04:30.470> note<00:04:30.650> and<00:04:30.830> I<00:04:30.860> might<00:04:31.040> have<00:04:31.070> to

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
hit the root note and I might have to

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.980 
hit the root note and I might have to
come<00:04:31.490> back<00:04:31.670> to<00:04:31.850> it<00:04:31.970> these<00:04:32.420> are<00:04:32.600> things<00:04:32.840> we<00:04:32.960> want

have to be really careful I have a
floating<00:05:17.260> tail<00:05:17.830> piece<00:05:18.010> if<00:05:18.220> I<00:05:18.850> you<00:05:19.090> can<00:05:19.240> see<00:05:19.270> why

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
floating tail piece if I you can see why

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.300 
floating tail piece if I you can see why
I<00:05:19.540> got<00:05:19.630> my<00:05:19.840> hand<00:05:20.080> here<00:05:20.290> that's<00:05:20.770> to<00:05:20.920> control

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
I got my hand here that's to control

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
I got my hand here that's to control
this<00:05:22.830> it's<00:05:23.830> like<00:05:24.010> through<00:05:24.400> the<00:05:24.460> guitar<00:05:24.580> so<00:05:25.240> if

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
this it's like through the guitar so if

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.320 
this it's like through the guitar so if
I<00:05:25.420> been<00:05:25.660> in<00:05:25.810> this<00:05:26.760> you're<00:05:27.760> not<00:05:27.880> gonna<00:05:27.970> hear<00:05:28.180> any

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
I been in this you're not gonna hear any

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330 
I been in this you're not gonna hear any
dipping<00:05:28.510> if<00:05:28.930> I<00:05:29.140> block<00:05:29.410> this<00:05:29.590> little<00:05:29.800> bit<00:05:29.890> now

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
dipping if I block this little bit now

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.560 
dipping if I block this little bit now
and<00:05:30.550> I<00:05:30.670> got<00:05:30.850> that<00:05:31.030> softer<00:05:33.300> put<00:05:34.300> a<00:05:34.330> little<00:05:34.480> bit

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
and I got that softer put a little bit

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.060 
and I got that softer put a little bit
of<00:05:34.690> reverb<00:05:34.810> on<00:05:35.080> your<00:05:35.230> tone<00:05:35.410> it<00:05:35.560> affects<00:05:35.860> it<00:05:36.010> a

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
of reverb on your tone it affects it a

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:47.340 
of reverb on your tone it affects it a
little<00:05:36.250> bit<00:05:36.340> I<00:05:36.430> can<00:05:36.580> break<00:05:45.930> now<00:05:46.930> what's<00:05:47.170> really

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
little bit I can break now what's really

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.080 
little bit I can break now what's really
important<00:05:47.920> is<00:05:48.070> putting<00:05:48.370> some<00:05:48.520> timing<00:05:48.760> into

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
important is putting some timing into

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.790 
important is putting some timing into
your<00:05:49.180> scales<00:05:49.480> that<00:05:49.750> really<00:05:49.990> helps<00:05:50.260> what<00:05:50.770> I

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
your scales that really helps what I

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.960 
your scales that really helps what I
mean<00:05:51.010> by<00:05:51.160> that<00:05:51.190> is<00:05:51.460> is<00:05:51.580> you<00:05:51.640> know<00:05:51.730> everybody

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
mean by that is is you know everybody

00:05:51.970 --> 00:06:00.010 
mean by that is is you know everybody
goes<00:05:53.820> what<00:05:54.820> if<00:05:54.910> you<00:05:55.000> put<00:05:55.210> a<00:05:55.240> little<00:05:55.360> bit

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.390 

little<00:06:01.020> swing<00:06:01.230> and<00:06:01.530> you're<00:06:01.620> spinning<00:06:01.920> in<00:06:02.280> your

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
little swing and you're spinning in your

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.950 
little swing and you're spinning in your
scale<00:06:02.640> there<00:06:02.820> right<00:06:03.000> kind<00:06:03.300> of<00:06:03.360> try<00:06:03.660> to<00:06:03.690> groove

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
scale there right kind of try to groove

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.700 
scale there right kind of try to groove
it<00:06:04.080> out<00:06:04.170> a<00:06:04.230> little<00:06:04.380> bit

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
it out a little bit

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.410 
it out a little bit
and<00:06:04.800> that's<00:06:05.430> a<00:06:05.580> cool<00:06:05.790> way<00:06:05.940> to<00:06:05.970> approach

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:06.420 
and that's a cool way to approach

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.080 
and that's a cool way to approach
putting<00:06:07.200> into<00:06:07.410> your<00:06:07.740> playing<00:06:08.010> some<00:06:08.880> rhythmic

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
putting into your playing some rhythmic

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:29.780 
putting into your playing some rhythmic
ideas<00:06:27.350> and<00:06:28.350> a<00:06:28.470> nice<00:06:28.680> resolving<00:06:29.190> happy<00:06:29.520> chord

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
ideas and a nice resolving happy chord

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.610 
ideas and a nice resolving happy chord
so<00:06:30.120> what<00:06:30.690> I<00:06:30.720> think<00:06:30.990> you're<00:06:31.080> gonna<00:06:31.200> get<00:06:31.380> from

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
so what I think you're gonna get from

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.380 
so what I think you're gonna get from
this<00:06:31.800> lesson<00:06:32.010> and<00:06:32.310> this<00:06:32.400> inspired<00:06:32.640> by<00:06:33.060> style

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.390 
this lesson and this inspired by style

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.330 
this lesson and this inspired by style
is<00:06:33.600> to<00:06:33.720> say<00:06:33.900> that<00:06:34.140> we<00:06:34.560> can<00:06:34.770> take<00:06:35.040> something

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
is to say that we can take something

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.280 
is to say that we can take something
that<00:06:35.490> does<00:06:35.760> not<00:06:35.940> even<00:06:36.270> remotely<00:06:36.480> go<00:06:37.050> this

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:37.290 
that does not even remotely go this

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.090 
that does not even remotely go this
direction<00:06:37.830> and<00:06:37.980> we<00:06:38.430> can<00:06:38.580> say<00:06:38.790> these<00:06:39.030> chords

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
direction and we can say these chords

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.040 
direction and we can say these chords
make<00:06:41.100> me<00:06:41.280> feel<00:06:41.520> like<00:06:41.760> I'm<00:06:42.270> in<00:06:42.480> two<00:06:42.810> things

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
make me feel like I'm in two things

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.020 
make me feel like I'm in two things
different<00:06:43.440> I<00:06:43.590> can<00:06:43.770> use<00:06:43.950> get<00:06:44.520> rid<00:06:44.670> of<00:06:44.760> the<00:06:44.850> pick

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030 
different I can use get rid of the pick

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.940 
different I can use get rid of the pick
and<00:06:45.420> I<00:06:45.690> could<00:06:45.870> play<00:06:46.050> some<00:06:46.290> of<00:06:46.320> these<00:06:48.950> prebend

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:49.950 
and I could play some of these prebend

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:55.300 
and I could play some of these prebend
it<00:06:50.510> third<00:06:51.510> finger<00:06:51.840> over<00:06:52.020> here<00:06:52.140> right<00:06:52.320> now<00:06:53.750> and

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.310 
it third finger over here right now and

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.350 
it third finger over here right now and
then<00:06:56.310> I<00:06:56.340> got<00:06:56.520> an<00:06:56.610> email<00:06:56.670> everybody<00:06:57.210> I<00:06:57.270> don't

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
then I got an email everybody I don't
