the bit that we want to export once

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.710 
the bit that we want to export once
we've<00:01:32.850> done<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:33.409> go<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:35.299> file<00:01:37.159> and<00:01:38.720> save

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
we've done this we go to file and save

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.710 
we've done this we go to file and save
for<00:01:40.049> web

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
for web

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.660 
for web
now<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.930> dialog<00:01:43.380> box<00:01:43.409> basically<00:01:44.280> tells<00:01:44.549> you

now this dialog box basically tells you

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.399 
now this dialog box basically tells you
on<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> left<00:01:45.420> hand<00:01:45.630> side<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
on the left hand side this is the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.410 
on the left hand side this is the
original<00:01:46.799> file<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.700> right<00:01:47.909> hand<00:01:48.180> side

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
original file on the right hand side

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.649 
original file on the right hand side
it's<00:01:48.720> an<00:01:48.810> example<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.399> same<00:01:50.670> file<00:01:51.000> but<00:01:51.509> in

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
it's an example of the same file but in

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.770 
it's an example of the same file but in
an<00:01:51.810> optimized<00:01:52.350> version<00:01:52.549> so<00:01:53.549> right<00:01:53.790> now<00:01:54.060> this

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
an optimized version so right now this

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.940 
an optimized version so right now this
is<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> jpg<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.890> we<00:01:56.640> don't<00:01:57.000> really<00:01:57.479> want<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.229> jpg

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
is a jpg and we don't really want a jpg

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.510 
is a jpg and we don't really want a jpg
for<00:01:59.460> our<00:01:59.759> file<00:02:00.149> because<00:02:00.630> all<00:02:01.380> JPEGs<00:02:02.040> come<00:02:02.340> with

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
for our file because all JPEGs come with

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.700 
for our file because all JPEGs come with
a<00:02:02.549> white<00:02:02.850> background<00:02:03.149> if<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.719> do<00:02:04.049> not<00:02:04.259> have<00:02:04.469> a

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
a white background if you do not have a

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.180 
a white background if you do not have a
background<00:02:05.310> specified<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> jpg<00:02:07.190> we

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
background specified so a jpg we

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.059 
background specified so a jpg we
definitely<00:02:08.789> don't<00:02:08.970> want<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.300> as<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.509> jpg

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
definitely don't want it as a jpg

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.700 
definitely don't want it as a jpg
probably

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
rough around the edges literally if we

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.930 
rough around the edges literally if we
just<00:02:25.090> zoom<00:02:25.180> in<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.080> have<00:02:26.320> a<00:02:26.350> look<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.040> see<00:02:27.400> it

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.150 
just doesn't look it looks like it's
over<00:02:30.810> contrasted<00:02:31.810> right<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.620> if<00:02:32.770> I<00:02:32.860> mess<00:02:33.040> up

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
over contrasted right and if I mess up

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.740 
over contrasted right and if I mess up
any<00:02:33.520> of<00:02:33.610> these<00:02:33.760> sentence<00:02:34.180> it's<00:02:34.360> not<00:02:34.480> really

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
any of these sentence it's not really

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.290 
any of these sentence it's not really
gonna<00:02:34.900> change<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:36.070> so<00:02:36.670> I<00:02:36.700> think<00:02:36.820> what<00:02:37.180> we

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
gonna change that so I think what we

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.810 
gonna change that so I think what we
need<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.510> do<00:02:37.780> is<00:02:38.170> maybe<00:02:38.710> change<00:02:39.160> this<00:02:39.460> into<00:02:39.700> a

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
need to do is maybe change this into a

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.620 
need to do is maybe change this into a
PNG<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.570> see<00:02:40.750> what<00:02:40.960> we<00:02:41.080> get<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:42.330> now<00:02:43.330> we<00:02:43.390> have

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
PNG and see what we get so now we have

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.230 
PNG and see what we get so now we have
our<00:02:43.780> PNG<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.620> if<00:02:44.740> we<00:02:44.890> zoom<00:02:45.190> in<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.700> just<00:02:45.970> looks

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
our PNG and if we zoom in it just looks

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.600 
our PNG and if we zoom in it just looks
perfect<00:02:46.830> absolutely<00:02:47.830> what<00:02:48.010> we<00:02:48.130> want<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:48.490> have

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
perfect absolutely what we want you have

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.150 
perfect absolutely what we want you have
a<00:02:48.700> transparent<00:02:49.330> background<00:02:49.710> it<00:02:50.710> doesn't<00:02:51.040> look

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
a transparent background it doesn't look

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.270 
a transparent background it doesn't look
overly<00:02:51.690> pixelated<00:02:52.690> well<00:02:53.110> right<00:02:53.800> now<00:02:53.980> it<00:02:54.130> does

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
overly pixelated well right now it does

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.910 
overly pixelated well right now it does
because<00:02:54.520> it's<00:02:54.670> at<00:02:55.240> like<00:02:55.360> six<00:02:55.990> hundred<00:02:56.110> percent

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
because it's at like six hundred percent

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.340 
because it's at like six hundred percent
we<00:02:57.520> bring<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:57.910> out<00:02:58.150> zoom<00:02:58.570> it<00:02:58.690> out<00:02:58.810> to<00:02:58.960> a<00:02:59.020> hundred

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
we bring it out zoom it out to a hundred

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.230 
we bring it out zoom it out to a hundred
percent<00:02:59.440> you<00:02:59.710> could<00:02:59.920> see<00:03:00.160> they<00:03:00.550> practically

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
percent you could see they practically

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.430 
percent you could see they practically
look<00:03:01.600> identical

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
look identical

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.190 
look identical
so<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.160> PNG<00:03:03.490> is<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.240> right<00:03:04.420> way<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:04.690> go<00:03:04.990> right

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
so the PNG is the right way to go right

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.160 
so the PNG is the right way to go right
now<00:03:05.230> I'm<00:03:05.560> gonna<00:03:06.010> save<00:03:06.370> this<00:03:06.640> as<00:03:06.970> a<00:03:07.720> Photoshop

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
now I'm gonna save this as a Photoshop

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.430 
now I'm gonna save this as a Photoshop

mobile okay so now be in GIMP I'm not
really<00:03:25.330> a<00:03:25.450> GIMP<00:03:25.870> user<00:03:26.170> so<00:03:26.740> I'm<00:03:27.010> literally

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
head over to the crop tool and the same

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.210 
head over to the crop tool and the same
way<00:03:34.630> like<00:03:34.870> we<00:03:34.900> did<00:03:35.200> in<00:03:35.320> Photoshop<00:03:35.830> we're<00:03:36.070> just

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:02.129 
in fireworks in my opinion is to select

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:04.179 
in fireworks in my opinion is to select
the<00:05:02.249> background<00:05:02.719> right-click<00:05:03.719> and<00:05:04.020> choose

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
background and with the canvas what we

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.820 
background and with the canvas what we
can<00:05:10.979> do<00:05:11.189> is<00:05:11.550> if<00:05:11.969> we<00:05:12.090> scroll<00:05:12.330> down<00:05:12.389> here<00:05:12.620> we<00:05:13.620> can

can do is if we scroll down here we can

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.350 
can do is if we scroll down here we can
select<00:05:14.340> no<00:05:15.090> feel<00:05:15.840> so<00:05:16.650> we've<00:05:16.800> got<00:05:17.009> a<00:05:17.360> empty

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
rectangular slice and what this does is

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.320 
rectangular slice and what this does is
it<00:05:32.460> inserts<00:05:33.150> a<00:05:33.479> slice<00:05:34.289> for<00:05:34.800> us<00:05:35.069> which<00:05:35.669> is<00:05:35.849> super

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
it inserts a slice for us which is super

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.490 
it inserts a slice for us which is super
cool<00:05:36.539> we<00:05:36.659> don't<00:05:36.839> have<00:05:37.020> to<00:05:37.169> worry<00:05:37.349> about

cool we don't have to worry about
drawing<00:05:37.889> stuff<00:05:38.279> in<00:05:38.599> sometimes<00:05:39.599> it<00:05:39.750> can<00:05:39.930> go<00:05:40.080> a

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
drawing stuff in sometimes it can go a

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.860 
drawing stuff in sometimes it can go a
bit<00:05:40.349> over<00:05:40.909> not<00:05:41.909> all<00:05:42.060> the<00:05:42.210> time<00:05:42.419> most<00:05:42.689> of<00:05:42.810> the
