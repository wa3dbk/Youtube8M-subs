00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hello everyone, Sanya, and in this video I 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.610
 show you how to draw a cupcake 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.900
 honestly myself and even plainly here 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.999
 I have a picture I myself do not really 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.340
 imagine how to draw now 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:20.460
 try with you so start 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.450
 perhaps from the top for some reason I myself 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.570
 love starting from the top 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:30.180
 such a thing descent 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:40.890
 another bureau pens how is it not exactly 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:45.409
 then they put it like this such a tuba 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.409
 peas book sloppy 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.270
 something like that 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.309
 1 eyes 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:25.880
 and now we will need black 

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:29.350
 felt-tip pen I fell so now everything will be 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.350
 more beautiful than you think 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:53.439
 Here and now now we paint over 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.090
 eyes 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.090
 we put there such small roundels 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:09.789
 like this, now circling here 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:30.140
 and now here are the stripes now 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.200
 now we need pencils and also 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:39.230
 pen to start i'll take pink 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:41.630
 pencil and pink felt tip pen pink 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.760
 pencil I paint the background somewhere will 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.540
 darker somewhere will be brighter and you're so all 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.540
 provided for 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.930
 such a circle 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.240
 like this 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.890
 as you can see in my place is darker in 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:38.380
 one place with glue like this 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.380
 here more light here more darker 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.740
 it's like done to 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.570
 show how the light falls 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:52.240
 now we take pink it so 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:55.880
 say we do such things 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:01.670
 we are circling youtube again only 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:09.950
 pink but this is already my personal idea 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:14.270
 do not like can not enter somewhere need 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.700
 It's harder to paint over here 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:22.910
 here now leave the opposite that is here 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:26.480
 we will be the darkest corner here 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:29.120
 so you can paint on it i think him 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:36.160
 my text's nose is missing 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:40.480
 spout so now we start coloring 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:44.480
 the middle, that is, the paper is shorter 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:47.020
 for coloring this napkin or 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.530
 some call i will use 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:54.500
 yellow pencil 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:05:01.340
 if you're awake and green now and again 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:02.840
 same yellow maybe arantier like that 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:08.000
 but first I'll paint 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:12.700
 at first everything yellow is not so bright yellow 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.700
 pretty took that nothing terrible 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.160
 if here and so on more pressure 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.780
 then our light will be uniform if 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.970
 weaker there somewhere again will be 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.700
 stronger years are weaker than a piece of paper seems to me 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.700
 can't shine so i have 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:43.410
 will be uniform so now i take 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:47.820
 yellow orange is so green now 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:53.090
 I'll take this green one , that is, I took 4 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.090
 colors and starting to enter 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:00.410
 if right from afar to inspect something 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.410
 principle, it can not be noticed 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:15.150
 but if you bring something closer you will see 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:18.290
 what is there circle well now I take orange 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:28.130
 and in some places I spend 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:28.130
 such stripes are a little green 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.390
 well, you can use dark green 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.900
 Can I have some please? 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:44.870
 I will be like this . 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:48.470
 can by the way be used for the page 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:50.060
 about Easter let's say we drew together 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.680
 liked the video put fingers top 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.680
