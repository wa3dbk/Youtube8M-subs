00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:12.580
 abracadabra 11 speaks hello to all and 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:15.110
 welcome to a minecraft tutorial 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:19.250
 specifically from a mod and the mod 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:23.390
 is this if it is mod for minecraft 1.4 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:28.430
 points 6 1.4 points 7 ok is a mod that 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:31.880
 adds enough seeds and trees a mod 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:35.540
 basically from farms and such is good no 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.510
 more rather of seeds and these things 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.820
 Not that much 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.820
 very automatic farms and things like these 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.920
 I will put these two pages in the 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.130
 description and the world needs the mod 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.100
 itself basically not and you need to 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.300
 minecraft force to work though 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.290
 today is not downloading the mod from here ok 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.420
 downloading 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.240
 this I close it as it is called opens 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.480
 the files and the minecraft that is already 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:09.310
 page that is that they are going in the 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.979
 files any file that 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.530
 release opens up for example now 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.869
 when it seems to jump advertising death of 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.579
 light when you can download notes 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.670
 is that I will also be done this is what 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:25.159
 I have put I'm worth 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.159
 completely oblivious to this 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.869
 ok now we go to downloads and we put 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:36.659
 these two download the desks this 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:39.600
 I do it so it's better ok 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.499
 by now we open the one that is called 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.270
 minecraft force and gold program 7 but 

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:47.939
 with any compressor program 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.479
 file compressor like winrar or in 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.509
 zip and such any of these there are 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:57.630
 enough then we're worth it now let's go 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.959
 At the beginning we wrote app data by 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.680
 percent app data percent ok and we 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:05.480
 will lead to roaming 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.380
 in real folder this we put it like this 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.960
 back in a minecraft here good I 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.660
 I have a few things of elche mod 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.790
 but it's because I installed it before 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.220
 but we can see here inside we should not 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.170
 there's nothing because this is the force in the end 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.320
 this dressings if you do not have installed 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.490
 no previously composed mode will come out 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.850
 equally do not worry, it's worth it 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:32.010
 it's totally the same 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.160
 it's worth checking here that the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.150
 minecraft file and it's an ok file and 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.190
 we will open it with me I have it with 7 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.940
 yes but you give it to open with or 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.230
 winrar or wifi vale 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.920
 the air with 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.740
 I mean 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.020
 and once we get here for a moment 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.459
 to tell you that for this mode 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.330
 it works you have to have obviously 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.239
 well this see it to our no you do not have 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.980
 than to have any other way 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.540
 installed to uninstall any 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.270
 another one that you have to be strong and 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.550
 we entered and keep in mind that also 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.120
 anything can go wrong and you 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.489
 you have to restart or this is what I say 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.290
 keep it in mind you can take the risk of 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.519
 being mini is one thing so that we do not know 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.680
 pass anything with minecraft this 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.450
 I say it because it will not be would not be the 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.870
 first time you receive a comment that 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.860
 because of you minecraft does not work 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.660
 things like states because that what 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.220
 keep in mind that you can make me some 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.730
 things so that nothing happens to us with 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.910
 minecraft copy security I do not know a 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.430
 lot of things and once said this 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.319
 and making sure of this 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.720
 the one that we just opened from minecraft 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.570
 that was unused minecraft will have a 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.040
 folder named meta and pnv and this one does not 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.579
 we select and erase them with the 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.230
 delete button so now with the 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:05.130
 force we enter and copy everything with 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:10.710
 control to copy everything and what 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:14.540
 we arrived here ok he assured that the 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.540
 visions of the file ok yes 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.580
 under the close and now 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.130
 we took advantage of that we had not closed 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.920
 this to go here 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.910
 and well now still contained in the 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:35.310
 mods folder so we go and 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.340
 we enter the minecraft without pressing for 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.030
 city ​​because the mod would be removed 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.830
 obviously we wait for him to load 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.440
 ok and here we will get a folder 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:50.370
 called mods the one that tells us down here 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.110
 three loaded modes we have assets here 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.990
 we have to minecraft fuck parker the 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.490
 force and the module that was another 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.410
 program another mode that was used 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.820
 before it did run some many 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.190
 but now almost always the 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.220
 portal we do not close and this folder 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.870
 this file here we copy it 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.570
 here where we had now we have 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.980
 created here or if you want to go back in 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.590
 as you want, I already have an access 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.680
 direct here we have not created a 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.650
 folder called a lot and here we paste the 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:23.520
 march and so it is that simple 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:26.389
 we close and that's how simple we enter and 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.400
 we can check that the mod is 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:32.000
 properly installed and properly 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.000
 OK 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.030
 there are four modes we have here 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.289
 it swallows if it is ways we can 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:46.039
 check let's go to any good world 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:47.539
 so that this mode leads to it being created 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:49.069
 in trees automatically already 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:52.009
 literarily but for this is more 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:54.340
 believe in a new world that we are not a 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:56.230
 old world then 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:00.419
 We can use the content of the mod 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.419
 but obviously not 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.870
 the bushes that carry new ones that 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.250
 create with new suns worlds that created 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.260
 the world and something that always takes me 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.000
 A lot of creating a voucher is already taken out of 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.440
 load of cut because I always 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.040
 takes quite took me about ten 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.440
 seconds here to load and clear because 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.320
 we pass this because what is cut 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.780
 obviously it's ok and here we can now 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.000
 check I'm in creative let's go here 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.760
 we can check that everything has gone 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.380
 correctly here that I have done well 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:37.830
 everything that brings orange lettuce tomatoes 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.740
 and 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:44.160
 good corn everything as you see buying here and 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:47.400
 we have everything installed all 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.230
 correctly so good the lemon already 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.870
 is installed I hope you have 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:55.110
