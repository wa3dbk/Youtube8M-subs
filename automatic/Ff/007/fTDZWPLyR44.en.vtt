00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.450
 is to his muses for this first 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.849
 tutorial on fifa 14 and I decided to 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.950
 attack me a big piece of fifa 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.910
 how to defend how well how 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.960
 manage defensive situations at best 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.420
 and here I want to point out that it is 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.590
 still a tutorial for players 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.689
 beginners can have some basics 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.550
 experienced players they have me 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.670
 maybe to find this tutorial useless 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.660
 for them finally here we'll see that 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.099
 together so we'll be heading all of 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.600
 continued towards orders 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.370
 first thing essential is when 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.110
 isabelle auto change I had the rsa 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.730
 rather change players if we want 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.040
 to defend well it is obligatory to 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.309
 put manual or air balloons 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.430
 in any case self is definitely 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.160
 ban one is not worth playing in 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.379
 self and so here's having a mastery 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.199
 total of our defense so manual 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.219
 ubals on air air balloons okay 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.809
 change players automatically when 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.220
 the balloon will be in the air ie 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.409
 upon receipt of a head 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.600
 you do not have to change 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.909
 players that will do it automatically so 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.310
 the second very important thing 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.430
 we can see in the orders by 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.299
 default that the player change it 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.700
 is about a pound where for PS3 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.290
 despite everything there is another way of 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.240
 change players and it's more the one 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.390
 there we will use this with the joystick 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.040
 right then right joystick that's 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.040
 totally different from a button 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.909
 obviously and it allows you to choose 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.220
 exactly 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.079
 so when you do not have the balloon 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.180
 choose exactly which players you 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.829
 want to control by indicating the 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.990
 direction in which it is 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.240
 we'll see that anyway in a 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.100
 example much more concrete than all 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.939
 take and well here's a situation 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.270
 basic 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.530
 if I want to change player and I 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.420
 want to choose a particular player 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.009
 imagine that I want to choose the player 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.550
 the most forward with the button that me 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.460
 randomly chosen 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.050
 one of the three players and so imagine 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.910
 in a defense where I'm in 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.800
 the urgency to choose a player 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.750
 it's very complicated whereas with the 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.160
 right joystick 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.480
 if I want to choose the player towards 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.070
 the front I just have to lead my 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.900
 right joystick forward and I 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.120
 chosen and after return to another 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.040
 player arrange his defense as I 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.780
 want it really allows very quickly 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.340
 to know which players we are not going to manage 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.770
 to be in panic by pressing full 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.470
 of times on the button l1 to lb for 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.080
 change player see an example again 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.180
 more concrete weeks and tackle this 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.040
 action we can look at street i you 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.870
 invite to watch the radar especially it's 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.120
 that I directly control the 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.730
 defenders the players really off 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.860
 who are not even on the screen area 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.130
 which will be impossible to do with the 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.310
 button lb it's choosing me a player who 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.890
 is the closest to the balloon so a 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.690
 once we have this base there in the 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.240
 theory we will use players we 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.850
 selects to cover to perform 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.340
 marking and to actually cover the 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.989
 risk areas there in this example one 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.670
 sees the player making a call and I 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.739
 immediately beforehand chosen the 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.750
 closest defender with the 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.430
 right joystick what am I going to do that 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.800
 I'm going to use a teammate to 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.020
 put pressure on the player who has 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.560
 the balloon and I'm busy behind the 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.840
 marking and risk areas during the 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.030
 censor is doing it with a little luck 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.350
 and look well put it fast and I'm going 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.360
 always use my player for 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.880
 cover to always be marking 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.440
 without taking care of the kia player who has the 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.360
 ball 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.870
 before that, I take care of the 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.350
 risk 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.610
 then shouted the button lb the button for 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.430
 change player he is not at 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.530
 to proscribe that is to say that you have 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.020
 still used knowing he's going 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.790
 select the player closest to the 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.710
 balloon so be doing a mix of both 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.960
 centers 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.610
 I organize my defense with the joystick 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.950
 I choose the players I want I 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.020
 watch out for ball calls and the 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.630
 button to change players 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.940
 select the player closest to the 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.530
 balloon still in general to intervene 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.060
 directly on the player who has the 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.470
 ball 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.970
 so once we understand the 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.520
 cover system and that the player 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.800
 which one directs and the pressure system 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.720
 with a computer 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.630
 we will have to pay attention to a 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.540
 thing it's not always used 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.910
 to press the rb button to send 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.950
 a teammate otherwise obviously it's okay 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.810
 to make holes all over the defense 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.760
 and it's going to be complicated there 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.430
 the occurrence there is only one attacker 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.280
 so no need to pay attention to a 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.840
 other area and I send the computer and with 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.580
 the other to another player that I 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.440
 control you see I'm should 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.190
 to intervene I do it voluntarily 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.000
 I am willingly waiting once 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.280
 the computer and the player 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.990
 you can very well no longer do you 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.030
 take care of everything that is doing well 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.100
 do the job well 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.220
 now imagine the situation with 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.480
 a small effect that allows us to see 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.010
 another 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.730
 another player to another attacker 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:09.120
 as I call on the computer he 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:11.220
 leave this area totally free 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.020
 where is the second striker 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.030
 and that would always be the case with players 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.340
 that you are going to call does not see any more 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.800
 all handle the marking or whatever 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.300
 it's his priority it's going to be 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.700
 take care of the player who has the ball 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.830
 so it's up to you really manage this 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.710
 touch there to rb key to not 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.510
 always use it and be careful 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.910
 when you have to master it then 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:36.960
 last little tip before closing this 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.640
 defending is to know well anticipated 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.860
 I almost want to tell you not to 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.120
 not take care of the player who has the 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.540
 ball any case at first 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.310
 in the first part 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.500
 of the land it will have to take care of 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.180
 everything that's going on around so 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.720
 to anticipate the pass of your 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.000
 opponent 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.770
 it's going to be the moment or another if 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.780
 you organize well your defense he goes 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.490
 necessarily a moment when to another 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.380
 an error and leave you the ball 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.750
 so with the right joystick you can 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.360
 easily the eleven players you can 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.220
 choose them individually choose this 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.540
 that it would not be possible therefore with the 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.010
 player changes button and so 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.870
 you can organize your defense 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.550
 take care of everything that's going on 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.950
 around the player who has the ball 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.590
 firstly when the 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:21.170
 situation really gets too much 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.400
 urgent that the player who has the ball gets 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.610
 really find in a position 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.420
 advantageous for him in your area 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.210
 defensive 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.680
 there may be need to use the 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.140
 player changes button for 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.090
 that you nevertheless intervene 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.700
 never was always the case there is 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.070
 always mean with the computers to trap 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.530
 to trap the player who has the ball 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.660
 so here I am aware that this tutorial 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.540
 is not not enough for everyone 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.610
 for average players 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.560
 average beginners I think it can 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.120
 to be very helpful and if you learned 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.520
 something in this tutorial there and that's 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.310
 already a big progression and to this type 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.230
 defense explained in this tutorial efira 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.680
 already largely to defend you 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.820
 obviously there will be several parts 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.130
 we will see much more things 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.930
 much more advanced like that's like 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.729
 usually even master word it's 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.770
 really training is in the 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:14.350
 really practice that you are going to find 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.600
 automatisms and is managed manage 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.729
 really your defense here is so it's 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.100
 all for the moment we will meet again 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:23.500
 very very fast and I really wish 

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.139
 good victories and two bays of 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.560
 take bull as few goals as possible 

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:28.560
 go ciao ciao
