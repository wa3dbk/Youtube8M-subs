00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.220
 apart from this in but do not believe that 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:36.770
 it's like excuses but nothing else I'm 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.580
 explaining in the habit video I'm going to 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.140
 show how you can make some popcorn 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.750
 delicious they have as chocolate 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.560
 white and oreo cookies are super super 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.350
 super rich 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.899
 I recommend that the tests to me the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.240
 they gave away we were a competition and a 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.350
 of the many girls there do not give us 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.329
 he did because it was Valentine's Day 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.640
 I remember it very well on San 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.649
 valentine was a competition and she did 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.130
 lots of little bags like that to give them away 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.960
 among the participants and I asked the 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.390
 recipe and he shared it very kindly 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.599
 the first time I try and I 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.640
 it served very well so believe me 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.410
 believe me it is not so guaranteed 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.090
 the success of you so good is 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.370
 let's see how to make these popcorn 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.040
 to begin we're going to take away the 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.110
 random stuffing and put the cookie 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.299
 in a container these are the 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.769
 ingredients cookies oreos popcorn 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.049
 without butter or with very little 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.470
 butter and white chocolate for 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.470
 melt 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.290
 let's remove all the stuffing and good 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.420
 the filling does not help you anything you can 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.920
 undo it once you have all 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.870
 the cookies in the container you're going to 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.870
 mark very well those you want to make crumbs 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.010
 I want it to be almost like powder already 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.010
 knows 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:02.440
 and good in a being we will have raining 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.180
 I put a glass container because I'm going 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.430
 I'll make chocolate to melt 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.410
 bain-marie if you have a fret 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.360
 special to do that because it's perfect 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.700
 and if you can not do it like I did 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.020
 and we put chocolate here and it's going to 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.020
 melt once the water boils 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.540
 much is going to melt I started what 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.160
 empty everything in a bag as you can see 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.110
 here then the chocolate popcorn in 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.820
 a bag but then I realized that 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.920
 it was easier to mix it if you put it in a 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.630
 recipient to this team all in one 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.180
 container as you can see here and I 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.860
 facilitate life very much that was a 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.810
 thing that I learned so I recommend them 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.270
 that I do not feel in a container and not 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.440
 it's not difficult and the other thing is that 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.330
 once it goes like that it's the popcorn 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.460
 before putting the chocolate you 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.490
 I recommend that you remove the pretty ones from 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.860
 corn because that is a bit annoying to 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.200
 eat you once you get done this 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.370
 for this chocolate the popcorn and then 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.140
 you put all the crumbs of cookies 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.750
 and that is to your taste you can put it 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.239
 how much chocolate or when cookie 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.060
 you want is very very rich and good you go 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:08.870
 to let cool for a few minutes about 10 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:10.940
 20 minutes and is ready to eat this 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.260
 what can it occurred to me this after what 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.120
 You can put in bags as for 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.280
 give for example when for the day 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.959
 of valentine as I tell them she does not 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.000
 I gave him a bag yes but I think 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.729
 to give away the 10 ama lentino day of 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.160
 peace with what this gesture is perfect 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.590
 and well I promise you that it is very very very 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.440
