 [Music] 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.790
 kids and welcome to this new one 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:21.100
 tutorial then today I will show you how 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:25.240
 install playing with all packages 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:28.540
 of the ftv launcher that is what I am 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.320
 using this time for gameplay 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.320
 multiplayer 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.870
 then to do it you will need a folder 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:42.730
 rare you will find the link below 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:46.110
 in the description the lancer and drink spa 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.850
 ie for minecraft then cracked 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.690
 even if you have n't bought it you can 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:56.100
 play and is version 1.2 point 7 the 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.870
 my day at this time 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.160
 once downloaded you will find this 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:08.590
 file and inside you will find this file 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:11.079
 jar that we will need to pull it out on 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.140
 desktop I recommend you put it inside 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:17.200
 a folder because you will have to create 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.909
 many some files are the best 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.830
 keep them in a folder if you don't 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:25.300
 fill the computer with files in China 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.270
 anyway I don't do it now because 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.170
 I've already installed one anyway 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.670
 once you put the file in a folder 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.229
 now for example I put it here 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.020
 inside 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.090
 then here are not a few files because 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.170
 others ended up in here because it is 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:47.470
 success a patatrac however does nothing 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.470
 we are going to open the first lancer 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.909
 time if I'm not mistaken he will ask you where 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:58.450
 creating and anyway will tell and the folder 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:02.020
 where you issued it you say yes and 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.330
 it will start then as you see the launcher is 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.909
 this one here you can choose all 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.349
 so pack you see there really are 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.650
 many 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.750
 here are the options the language la 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.350
 console that this one behind that 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:21.430
 you will always have to keep open because 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:25.060
 need and you can also choose how many 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.430
 jig of ram to dedicate to minecraft here 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.680
 news that I don't know what is here 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.090
 should be my maps if i am 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.860
 mistake 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.010
 I don't know why every now and then you implant yourself 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.430
 however, the mini maps do nothing 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:45.180
 textures you see there are these here 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.180
 anyway to start ours 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.640
 minecraft we should go quaino bach 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.250
 then first of all we will have to create a 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.980
 profile so we have here create profile 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.790
 here we can write what 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:05.130
 we want is also any password 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:08.640
 low but just write something 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:12.790
 now back up here you can too 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:17.470
 change it very comfortable back below 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:21.070
 the profile and to start a way 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:25.060
 packa we should select it then 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:27.480
 now for example I will select this 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.280
 park mode that I don't download yet 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.970
 so to let you see how it works 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.580
 as long as you select it here 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.970
 done double click on the mode 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.490
 calmly click on launch and you see that 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.470
 the download will start 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:50.980
 now the winter a little bit there 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:54.910
 interested now we close because we go 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.450
 for you do not do it anyway who undiano 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:02.080
 and now I'll show you for example the 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:05.190
 park way I downloaded or da 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:09.640
 the students I am using now are difficult 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:14.830
 you see it's already downloaded so let's click 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:17.500
 su lancia here will tell me which way it is 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.690
 a new version of the world is available 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.510
 even if you want to download it download it 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.610
 it is said that a new one is available 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.760
 version of the lancer instead not 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.370
 download there otherwise it will not work anymore 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.300
 for sp but now I say no otherwise 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.910
 having to download all the fashions from scratch 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:40.480
 so let's say no and see that there 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:45.570
 this ftb screen will appear this here 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:48.280
 you don't have to close anything because it's like that 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.910
 then as you can see it was closed on 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.450
 launcher but here and the console states 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.480
 it's still working 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.790
 [Music] 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.630
 now we wait for a moment that it served 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:04.210
 it's not very fast because it has to load 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:10.419
 all the fashions in this package 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:15.090
 they should be on 70 69 I think why 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:18.010
 the one is reached, however, you see that 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:24.460
 it works if i do n't know we want to create a 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:32.280
 new world so much so we create the 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:38.140
 world we wait a moment for new ones 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:40.300
 ok you see that you make it 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:44.530
 see what works then if you see 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.960
 these two maps down here 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.560
 those at the top 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:53.410
 the classic one and the upper one 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.479
 but I add another so much 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.330
 however you see that the game 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.950
 it works if you see that wide slightly 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.910
 it is not the fault of the world 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:06.370
 but some of my pc and anyway it works 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.950
 you'll perfectly know it's inventory 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.500
 now I'm in the creative doesn't show me 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:15.220
 too many things complete however you see 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:18.210
 there are all 69 pages of must not 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:22.180
 net all this stuff 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:26.440
 so I would say that for this video it is 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:29.110
 all but then there are also here 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:32.530
 exit without clicking hicks by clicking 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:35.650
 with visas what to say to close 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.840
 automatically the other window e 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:42.430
 in the next tutorial I will show you 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:45.460
 how to change the face 20 as I have it 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:51.820
 I mean the one with the ok you do in 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:55.270
 mini map of the teleports so I would say 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:59.130
 that for this video all left me 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:04.440
 like it if you keep the video dry 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:04.440
 subscribe to my channel and hello to everyone
