00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.450
 which the ones in charge made a 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.689
 volunteering that they took over 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.809
 make the total accommodation of all these 28 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.160
 thousand sleeves that are here are 28 thousand of 

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:31.279
 which exist 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.220
 from this date is how we're going 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.290
 receiving donations donations demand 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.750
 of the Japanese Japanese community 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.430
 resident some children who buy their 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.650
 sleeves apart that buy them direct 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.570
 from japan these people this 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.400
 and sleeves use sleeves that are no longer going to 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.200
 use that they will no longer read and 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.460
 they prefer to leave them of patrimony for 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.770
 that other people continue reading 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.070
 now we will start with what is the area 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.090
 for little ones 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.480
 while as what is 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.680
 now read lounge doctors as you know 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.680
 commonly in japan 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:16.450
 doraemon very famous to us as 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.450
 so to speak of the best known 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.770
 this is that one of the most 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.450
 old and at the same time one of the most 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.330
 representative in Japanese culture 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.450
 of the principles of the rafÃ¡h mandate and 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.450
 jan 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.210
 the authors even notice the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.920
 old note that the first sleeves 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.600
 that we saw had another structure to give 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.580
 to understand the information here already has 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.860
 other information is why it is 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.310
 changed the formats of exhibition 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.330
 all this is relatively easy for 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.100
 girls 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.620
 note the counterpart of the hallway girls 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.680
 guys this is where the section starts 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.120
 for me this 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.909
 young older youth 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.999
 All this 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.989
 is for a little this this novel are 

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:14.170
 more action other content stronger in 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.690
 how much battles is literally manga 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.040
 for kids, this is a hangar for 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.960
 girls for bigger boys 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.960
 All this 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:29.220
 as we move forward the 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:33.650
 l'aquila corridors with the cv and so 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:39.459
 successively the coves of the islands 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.459
 and so we are moving forward is of chizo 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.620
 we are moving forward and the complexity of 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.780
 language advances as well as complexity 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.520
 of those in the stories is also going 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.460
 going forward 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.190
 inclusive on this side this are for 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.710
 guys let's find a novel that 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.230
 is very famous in these latitudes of 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.580
 simple world 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.220
 masami kurumada 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.720
 one of the most famous and I think that 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.190
 including this series based on 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.890
 Latin America 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.720
 beta x 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.720
 the original tone should be done 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.280
 all these stories are more for 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.830
 Boys 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.690
 you get to pick up opinions though 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.400
 they also have what they do is that 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.870
 verify in Japan what are the most 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:32.180
 sold in japan to bring them to mexico 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.280
 is what is commonly verified although 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.989
 there are also this are based on certain 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.750
 requests made by the public 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.120
 users will be true public and faria 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.790
 you have to be a little proud sometimes 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.210
 of this because because you guys like 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.970
 fans 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.770
 which 60 of the partners that are 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.750
 enrolled here are Japanese to the 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.550
 Mexican-American community in 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.130
 this Mexican and Latin American in 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.900
 the community is very scarce 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.049
 mexican 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.310
 the manga that they request the most and the one that 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:07.010
 brush I think that in general the 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.010
 Latin American continues that they do not want 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.110
 and genre requested by the 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.110
 Mexican community is the genre they are in 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.829
 3rd genre are in is the most requested and 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.870
 the most requested 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.830
 and as for those stories what are 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.570
 the most requested worth 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.790
 without of equal here 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.130
 they are like that most requested by part 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.190
 of the Latin American community not in 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.330
 particular the Mexican one for the community 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.830
 Japanese already changes the roll a lot 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.830
 we go to this hall 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.060
 because the most requested by the 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.810
 Japanese community are the most 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.300
 old like this safari fan 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:57.270
 it's like the most requested by the 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.910
 Japanese community and for this golden 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.130
 the Japanese community has this hobby 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.640
 for that kind of stories too 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:09.210
 Ironically, it's guys, two centric 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:12.129
 they have a great taste for the show 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.469
 by the Japanese community 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:18.749
 by the Mexican community almost 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:18.749
 you do not touch on this kind of digits
