00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.279
 we make mozzarella waffles today 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.430
 That's not cheese waffles 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.430
 incredible 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.420
 what you need for the mozzarella 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.600
 or israels is of course mozzarella 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.980
 bit of spices for the breaded breaded 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.280

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.230
 So we would be talented and talented 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.220
 South Africa and later to dipping if you like 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.350
 then finished 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.649
 salsa sauce and everyone did not 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.390
 to be thought of sweet chilli sauce 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.000
 we are just unbelievable and expensive 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.110
 therefore to stress made everything 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.879
 Of course he also still needs her 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.430
 we have not had any recently 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.350
 Comment on the last waffle 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:09.860
 Experiments on the look but it comes 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.860
 all out 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:17.670
 This time we are very confident 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:20.100
 pa modou 22 on the well that it 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.729
 important for the administration so make 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:30.000
 we have the panade and there we need three 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:30.900
 tablespoon flour 123 so paprika or 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.180
 curry 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.640
 I think we are the squats or 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.090
 are for squatting or 90 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:45.780
 we do it, so they want one 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:48.540
 half teaspoon whole topic we are 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.640
 Hard core still a bit noble sweet 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.210
 bought paprika of behavior 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.830
 Now it is almost full effect 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.020
 then we have the second plate yes 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:03.490
 already being prepared in eggs 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:05.800
 two years a part of cards will be okay 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.209
 you need half a mug 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.100
 still perceive each case or 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.500
 bread crumb surface of the original even 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.720
 bread crumbs from old bread that of course 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:23.130
 also really green you just do 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.130
 finger-thick slices of mozzarella 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:45.970
 Let's go and of course 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:51.650
 do not be afraid of court in quantities 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:54.489
 little holistic that I wonder if 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.489
 that still holds here 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.780
 we look dinger in and I very 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.750
 I'm really a little bit honest 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:12.010
 bammel but put on it 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.450
 I hope that there are no big ones 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:19.350
 But there is still this 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.350
 probably give summer 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.959
 okay okay okay 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.730
 i have to say i was too 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.270
 Finally , there is salt left 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.290
 tip on 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:46.450
 and then they are done ours 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:51.790
 mozzarella okay then let's go 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:58.440
 and try how she's a service pro 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:04:01.090
 visitors for preparation 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.770
 Of course, nobody is the first time 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.840
 and I have not seen before 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.950
 so often picture 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.200
 well, a bit smells a bit 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.730
 jam but it is super easy so 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.870
 Preparations of five possible 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.100
 beer bottles to taste for that 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.960
 I totally underestimated that even in 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.960
 but the trousers are secretly lucky 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.560
 also there five out of five possible 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.450
 deflation because it's super fast 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.280
 go and it's just delicious but 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.280
 it is not that healthy 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.929
 came
