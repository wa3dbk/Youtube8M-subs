about<00:01:45.240> 6<00:01:45.659> times<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.130> believe<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:47.850> said<00:01:48.479> you

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
about 6 times so I believe this said you

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.960 
about 6 times so I believe this said you
was<00:01:48.689> charged<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.560> iPhone<00:01:49.979> 4s<00:01:50.220> about<00:01:50.610> 6<00:01:50.850> times

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
was charged of iPhone 4s about 6 times

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.020 
was charged of iPhone 4s about 6 times
you<00:01:51.180> could<00:01:51.299> charge<00:01:51.509> an<00:01:51.720> iPad<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.790> about<00:01:53.790> two

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
you could charge an iPad to about two

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.789 
you could charge an iPad to about two
and<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.270> half<00:01:54.509> times<00:01:54.780> or<00:01:55.049> two<00:01:55.170> times<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.560> think<00:01:55.619> it

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
and a half times or two times I think it

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.530 
and a half times or two times I think it
was<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.250> that's<00:01:57.060> very<00:01:57.450> very<00:01:57.780> substantial<00:01:58.590> and

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
was so that's very very substantial and

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.850 
was so that's very very substantial and
with<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.689> type<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.869> battery<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.649> know<00:02:01.740> all

with this type of battery you know all

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.039 
with this type of battery you know all
you<00:02:02.159> do<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:02.700> huge<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.479> it's<00:02:03.630> quite

you do it's it's huge and it's quite
weighty<00:02:04.380> I'd<00:02:05.100> say<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.340> probably<00:02:05.670> weighs<00:02:05.759> over

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939

you can charge multiple devices at the
same<00:02:50.349> time<00:02:50.650> obviously<00:02:51.129> that'll<00:02:51.699> take<00:02:52.150> double

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
same time obviously that'll take double

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.929 
same time obviously that'll take double
the<00:02:52.689> juice<00:02:52.959> charging<00:02:53.919> this<00:02:54.040> thing<00:02:54.250> up<00:02:54.489> itself

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
the juice charging this thing up itself

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:56.909 
the juice charging this thing up itself
takes<00:02:55.209> quite<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.599> while<00:02:55.689> it's<00:02:56.530> kind<00:02:56.739> of<00:02:56.799> a

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:56.919 
takes quite a while it's kind of a

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.619 
takes quite a while it's kind of a
circumstance<00:02:57.370> where<00:02:57.849> you're<00:02:57.909> gonna<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.120> lot<00:02:58.419> a

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
circumstance where you're gonna a lot a

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.689 
circumstance where you're gonna a lot a
couple<00:02:59.079> hours<00:02:59.469> to<00:02:59.680> charge<00:02:59.859> your<00:03:00.069> thing<00:03:00.250> you

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:00.699 
couple hours to charge your thing you

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:02.490 
couple hours to charge your thing you
know<00:03:00.819> five<00:03:01.150> or<00:03:01.299> six<00:03:01.480> hours<00:03:01.750> so<00:03:02.019> what<00:03:02.199> I<00:03:02.260> usually

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
know five or six hours so what I usually

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.909 
know five or six hours so what I usually
do<00:03:02.799> is<00:03:02.980> I<00:03:03.900> fully<00:03:04.900> deplete<00:03:05.260> its<00:03:05.379> battery<00:03:05.709> and

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:05.919 
do is I fully deplete its battery and

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.349 
do is I fully deplete its battery and
then<00:03:06.010> I<00:03:06.069> charge<00:03:06.280> it<00:03:06.430> overnight<00:03:06.609> because<00:03:07.180> the

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
then I charge it overnight because the

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.170 
then I charge it overnight because the
sink<00:03:07.569> takes<00:03:07.719> quite<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:07.989> while<00:03:08.079> to<00:03:08.199> charge<00:03:08.500> up

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
sink takes quite a while to charge up

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.159 
sink takes quite a while to charge up
it's<00:03:10.180> kind<00:03:10.359> of<00:03:10.419> simple<00:03:10.689> as<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:11.079> know

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:11.169 
it's kind of simple as that you know

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:13.379 
it's kind of simple as that you know
they<00:03:11.290> redid<00:03:11.500> design<00:03:11.859> it's<00:03:12.069> got<00:03:12.189> the<00:03:12.609> the<00:03:12.639> red

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
they redid design it's got the the red

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:14.580 
they redid design it's got the the red
here<00:03:13.569> on<00:03:13.659> the<00:03:13.719> sides<00:03:13.930> it's<00:03:14.109> actually<00:03:14.349> rubber

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
here on the sides it's actually rubber

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.099 
here on the sides it's actually rubber
so<00:03:14.859> it's<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.040> good<00:03:15.189> grip<00:03:15.489> and<00:03:16.239> they<00:03:16.659> kind<00:03:17.079> of

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
so it's a good grip and they kind of

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.020 
so it's a good grip and they kind of
made<00:03:17.259> it<00:03:17.290> sleeker<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:17.799> copied<00:03:18.400> a<00:03:18.489> Decepticon

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
made it sleeker and copied a Decepticon

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.879 
made it sleeker and copied a Decepticon
logo<00:03:19.150> on<00:03:19.389> the<00:03:19.449> top<00:03:19.629> I<00:03:20.409> don't<00:03:20.530> know<00:03:20.620> how<00:03:20.739> they

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
logo on the top I don't know how they

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.390 
logo on the top I don't know how they
did<00:03:21.040> that<00:03:22.259> but<00:03:23.259> you<00:03:23.650> know<00:03:23.739> just<00:03:24.099> like<00:03:24.250> the

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
did that but you know just like the

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.899 
did that but you know just like the
previous<00:03:24.549> review<00:03:24.909> I<00:03:25.060> did<00:03:25.209> it<00:03:25.449> works<00:03:25.720> great<00:03:26.909> and

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
previous review I did it works great and

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:29.610 
previous review I did it works great and
I'm<00:03:28.750> having<00:03:28.959> a<00:03:29.019> great<00:03:29.169> time<00:03:29.290> with<00:03:29.439> it<00:03:29.500> I

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
I'm having a great time with it I

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.530 
I'm having a great time with it I
enjoyed<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.400> upgrade<00:03:30.639> it<00:03:30.849> I<00:03:31.060> don't<00:03:31.209> think<00:03:31.359> it

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
enjoyed the upgrade it I don't think it

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.210 
enjoyed the upgrade it I don't think it
wasn't<00:03:31.689> 100%<00:03:32.079> necessary<00:03:32.620> but<00:03:32.769> it's<00:03:32.859> obviously

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
wasn't 100% necessary but it's obviously

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.080 
wasn't 100% necessary but it's obviously
what<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.519> time<00:03:33.699> is<00:03:33.729> to<00:03:33.909> come

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
what the time is to come

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.089 
what the time is to come
they<00:03:34.689> added<00:03:34.870> a<00:03:35.079> little<00:03:35.199> bit<00:03:35.349> more<00:03:35.500> power<00:03:35.799> to<00:03:35.919> it

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
they added a little bit more power to it

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.830 
they added a little bit more power to it
to<00:03:36.489> compensate<00:03:37.120> for<00:03:37.269> all<00:03:37.389> the<00:03:37.419> new<00:03:37.599> devices

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840

coming out with a larger battery so I'm
anxious<00:03:40.509> to<00:03:40.540> see<00:03:40.840> how<00:03:41.019> much<00:03:41.259> this<00:03:41.530> will<00:03:41.769> charge

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
anxious to see how much this will charge
