00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
he's also starting on this Depot only

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.270 
he's also starting on this Depot only
one<00:02:28.599> of<00:02:28.630> us<00:02:28.780> really<00:02:29.080> does<00:02:29.380> need<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.709> scout<00:02:30.099> I'll

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
one of us really does need to scout I'll

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.660 
one of us really does need to scout I'll
take<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.580> scouting<00:02:30.970> duties<00:02:31.239> on<00:02:31.420> that<00:02:31.450> 1i<00:02:32.670> we

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
take the scouting duties on that 1i we

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.070 
take the scouting duties on that 1i we
can<00:02:33.819> see<00:02:33.970> if<00:02:34.060> they're<00:02:34.180> doing<00:02:34.330> early<00:02:34.599> gas<00:02:34.780> or

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
can see if they're doing early gas or

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.440 
can see if they're doing early gas or
not<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:35.440> we<00:02:35.500> need<00:02:35.769> to<00:02:36.010> hope<00:02:36.700> we<00:02:36.819> can<00:02:36.940> expand<00:02:37.269> or

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
not so we need to hope we can expand or

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.220 
not so we need to hope we can expand or
not<00:02:39.000> usually<00:02:40.000> if<00:02:40.060> they<00:02:40.120> do<00:02:40.180> early<00:02:40.510> gasps<00:02:40.720> you

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
not usually if they do early gasps you

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.250 
not usually if they do early gasps you
do<00:02:41.500> have<00:02:42.209> quite<00:02:43.209> an<00:02:43.360> advantage<00:02:43.750> mineralize

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
do have quite an advantage mineralize

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.640 
do have quite an advantage mineralize
because<00:02:44.530> they<00:02:44.620> do<00:02:44.709> have<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:44.950> put<00:02:46.049> units<00:02:47.049> into

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
because they do have to put units into

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.100 
because they do have to put units into
the<00:02:47.769> gas<00:02:47.950> depot<00:02:48.790> plus<00:02:49.120> build<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.810> depot

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
the gas depot plus build the depot

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.670 
the gas depot plus build the depot

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:09.679 
they're going to your army

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:11.929 
they're going to your army
it<00:05:10.679> looks<00:05:10.949> like<00:05:11.009> my<00:05:11.219> allies<00:05:11.520> building<00:05:11.849> out

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:11.939 
it looks like my allies building out

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:14.419 
it looks like my allies building out
into<00:05:12.449> the<00:05:12.679> bottom<00:05:13.679> part<00:05:13.830> there<00:05:14.039> which<00:05:14.159> is<00:05:14.189> good

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:14.429 
into the bottom part there which is good

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:16.459 
into the bottom part there which is good
so<00:05:14.610> when<00:05:14.729> you<00:05:14.819> expand<00:05:15.270> that<00:05:15.509> you<00:05:16.020> got<00:05:16.169> some

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:16.469 
so when you expand that you got some

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:18.409 
so when you expand that you got some
buildings<00:05:16.830> in<00:05:16.919> the<00:05:16.979> front<00:05:17.249> does<00:05:17.460> say<00:05:18.209> meat

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
buildings in the front does say meat

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.089 
buildings in the front does say meat
shields<00:05:18.929> or<00:05:19.080> decoys<00:05:19.469> or<00:05:19.679> something<00:05:19.949> so<00:05:20.069> they

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
shields or decoys or something so they

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:22.189 
shields or decoys or something so they
don't<00:05:20.309> just<00:05:20.459> run<00:05:21.179> straight<00:05:21.300> to<00:05:21.449> your<00:05:21.629> Expo<00:05:21.929> and

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
don't just run straight to your Expo and

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.779 
don't just run straight to your Expo and
hurt<00:05:22.679> you<00:05:22.830> there<00:05:25.399> looks<00:05:26.399> like<00:05:26.550> we're<00:05:26.669> just

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789
