00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
that's done we're ready to locate our

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.970 
that's done we're ready to locate our
drilling<00:02:09.429> points<00:02:11.100> for<00:02:12.100> our<00:02:12.190> fasteners<00:02:13.769> we<00:02:14.769> can

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
drilling points for our fasteners we can

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.710 
drilling points for our fasteners we can
do<00:02:15.100> it<00:02:15.250> one<00:02:15.430> of<00:02:15.459> two<00:02:15.610> ways<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:16.239> can<00:02:16.420> actually

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
do it one of two ways you can actually

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.360 
do it one of two ways you can actually
use<00:02:17.230> this<00:02:17.470> as<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:18.670> template<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.510> drill<00:02:20.340> okay<00:02:21.340> I

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
use this as the template to drill okay I

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.259 
use this as the template to drill okay I
don't<00:02:21.700> recommend<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.360> because<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:25.120> will

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
don't recommend that because you will

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.080 
don't recommend that because you will
scuff<00:02:26.019> the<00:02:26.170> powder<00:02:26.410> paint<00:02:26.799> with<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.940> drill

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
scuff the powder paint with the drill

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.970 
scuff the powder paint with the drill
instead<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.120> recommend<00:02:31.420> using<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.440> transfer

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
instead I recommend using a transfer

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.539 
instead I recommend using a transfer
punch<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.940> we<00:02:34.090> would<00:02:34.239> drop<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.750> into<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.230> hole

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
punch and we would drop it into the hole

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.170 
punch and we would drop it into the hole
and<00:02:37.019> then<00:02:38.019> set<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.320> with<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.620> hammer<00:02:39.340> which

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
and then set it with a hammer which

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.910 
and then set it with a hammer which
would<00:02:40.359> give<00:02:40.540> us<00:02:40.660> our<00:02:40.810> Center<00:02:41.260> point<00:02:41.530> for<00:02:41.799> our

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
would give us our Center point for our

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:51.160 
would give us our Center point for our
drill

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.540 

first<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.440> would<00:02:52.500> remove<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:56.040> strut<00:02:56.310> tower

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
first I would remove the strut tower

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:13.450 
first I would remove the strut tower
brace<00:02:56.700> once<00:02:57.210> again

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.540 

I<00:03:13.990> would<00:03:14.990> start<00:03:15.320> on<00:03:15.530> your<00:03:18.010> center<00:03:19.010> point<00:03:19.220> with

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
I would start on your center point with

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:31.220 
I would start on your center point with
a<00:03:19.580> small<00:03:20.030> pilot<00:03:20.600> drill<00:03:21.050> first

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.990 

now<00:03:32.230> this<00:03:32.379> is<00:03:32.560> a<00:03:32.590> double<00:03:33.040> wall<00:03:33.220> struck<00:03:33.730> tower

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
now this is a double wall struck tower

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.520 
now this is a double wall struck tower
so<00:03:34.720> you're<00:03:34.900> going<00:03:35.019> to<00:03:35.080> have<00:03:35.200> to<00:03:35.349> go<00:03:35.500> through

so you're going to have to go through

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:45.119 
so you're going to have to go through
both<00:03:36.010> of<00:03:36.040> them<00:03:36.370> into<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.120> spring<00:03:37.420> cavity<00:03:44.129> once

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
both of them into the spring cavity once

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.240 
both of them into the spring cavity once
that's<00:03:45.430> completed<00:03:46.709> step<00:03:47.709> up<00:03:47.920> to<00:03:48.130> your
