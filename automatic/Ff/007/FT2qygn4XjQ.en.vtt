00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.180 

okay<00:00:01.020> so<00:00:01.079> let's<00:00:01.469> have<00:00:01.500> a<00:00:01.620> look<00:00:01.709> at<00:00:01.860> some<00:00:02.040> of<00:00:02.129> the

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
okay so let's have a look at some of the

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.740 
okay so let's have a look at some of the
different<00:00:02.490> types<00:00:02.730> of<00:00:02.909> scans<00:00:03.330> well<00:00:03.659> the

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
different types of scans well the

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.259 
different types of scans well the
simplest<00:00:04.170> scan<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:04.770> just<00:00:06.319> peaks<00:00:07.319> of<00:00:08.269> voltage

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
simplest scan is just peaks of voltage

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.839 
simplest scan is just peaks of voltage
but<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.469> arrive<00:00:10.860> at<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.099> transducer<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:11.759> we

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
but that arrive at the transducer and we

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.999 
but that arrive at the transducer and we
just<00:00:12.030> plot<00:00:12.870> those<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.380> voltage<00:00:13.769> against

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
just plot those on a voltage against

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.390 
just plot those on a voltage against
time<00:00:14.370> graph<00:00:14.870> and<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.560> called<00:00:16.770> an<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.980> scan

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
time graph and this is called an a scan

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.179 
time graph and this is called an a scan
the<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.119> stamp<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> stands<00:00:19.590> for<00:00:19.710> amplitude

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
the a stamp the a stands for amplitude

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.370 
the a stamp the a stands for amplitude
because<00:00:20.730> all<00:00:20.880> we're<00:00:21.060> getting<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.539> amplitude

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
because all we're getting is amplitude

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.609 
because all we're getting is amplitude
information<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:23.160> nothing<00:00:23.789> else<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.630> at<00:00:25.260> time

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
information and nothing else so at time

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.500 
information and nothing else so at time
T<00:00:25.890> equals<00:00:26.130> zero<00:00:26.189> that's<00:00:26.820> when<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.119> ultrasound

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
T equals zero that's when the ultrasound

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.779 
T equals zero that's when the ultrasound
pulse<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.900> sent<00:00:28.109> out<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.460> we're<00:00:29.640> going<00:00:29.730> to

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
pulse is sent out and so we're going to

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.269 
pulse is sent out and so we're going to
get<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.970> large<00:00:30.470> reading<00:00:31.470> on<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.619> voltmeter<00:00:31.890> of

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
get a large reading on the voltmeter of

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.520 
get a large reading on the voltmeter of
the<00:00:32.520> piezoelectric<00:00:33.059> transducers<00:00:33.930> vibrated

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the piezoelectric transducers vibrated

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.520 
the piezoelectric transducers vibrated
that<00:00:35.100> volt<00:00:35.340> meter<00:00:35.610> reading<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.600> vibrations

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
that volt meter reading the vibrations

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.729 
that volt meter reading the vibrations
and<00:00:37.739> measuring<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.030> induced<00:00:39.360> EMF<00:00:39.739> will

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
and measuring the the induced EMF will

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.410 
and measuring the the induced EMF will
record<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.160> large<00:00:41.399> pulse<00:00:41.640> at<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:41.969> point<00:00:42.239> so

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
record a large pulse at that point so

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.090 
record a large pulse at that point so
this<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.809> initial<00:00:43.020> Pole<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.680> pulse<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
this is the initial Pole the pulse the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.250 
this is the initial Pole the pulse the
pulse<00:00:44.129> that's<00:00:44.520> sent<00:00:44.789> out<00:00:45.020> so<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.079> kind<00:00:46.230> of

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
pulse that's sent out so we kind of

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.400 
pulse that's sent out so we kind of
ignore<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.649> one<00:00:47.329> and<00:00:48.329> then<00:00:48.780> after<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> certain

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
ignore that one and then after a certain

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.709 
ignore that one and then after a certain
amount<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.649> time<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.190> going<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.550> be<00:00:50.670> a

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
amount of time is going to be a

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.290 
amount of time is going to be a
reflection<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.469> waves<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.430> if<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:53.910> draw<00:00:54.120> up

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
reflection so the waves so if we draw up

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.110 
reflection so the waves so if we draw up
here<00:00:54.660> here's<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.500> transducer<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.850> sending

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
here here's the transducer it's sending

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.240 
here here's the transducer it's sending
a<00:00:57.270> pulse<00:00:57.480> down<00:00:57.780> into<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.620> body<00:00:58.770> or<00:00:59.070> whatever

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
a pulse down into the body or whatever

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.490 
a pulse down into the body or whatever
it<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.760> it's<00:01:00.629> going<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.989> hit<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.170> surface

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
it is and it's going to hit a surface

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.470 
it is and it's going to hit a surface
now<00:01:01.949> some<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.520> pulse<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.969> going<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.300> come

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
now some of that pulse is going to come

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.270 
now some of that pulse is going to come
back<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.930> transducer<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:05.070> when<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
back to the transducer and when the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.179 
back to the transducer and when the
first<00:01:05.549> pulse<00:01:05.760> comes<00:01:06.030> back<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.450> transducer

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
first pulse comes back to the transducer

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.149 
first pulse comes back to the transducer
we<00:01:08.189> get<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.570> spike<00:01:09.570> like<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.049> but<00:01:10.680> some<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.040> it

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
we get a spike like that but some of it

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.130 
we get a spike like that but some of it
is<00:01:11.610> going<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.060> be<00:01:12.180> sent<00:01:12.420> down<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.840> next

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
is going to be sent down to the next

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.990 
is going to be sent down to the next
layer<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.100> next<00:01:14.280> layer<00:01:14.400> might<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.820> there

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
layer and the next layer might be there

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.749 
layer and the next layer might be there
for<00:01:15.180> example<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.780> then<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.710> bit<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.580> going

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
for example and then that bit is going

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.920 
for example and then that bit is going
to<00:01:17.939> travel<00:01:18.210> all<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> way<00:01:18.479> back<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
to travel all the way back to the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.109 
to travel all the way back to the
transducer<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.740> then<00:01:20.310> when<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.790> arrives

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
transducer and then when that arrives

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.490 
transducer and then when that arrives
back<00:01:21.270> at<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.509> transducer<00:01:22.080> we're<00:01:22.200> going<00:01:22.380> to

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
back at the transducer we're going to

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.670 
back at the transducer we're going to
get<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> second<00:01:23.189> pulse<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:24.299> when<00:01:24.570> these<00:01:24.720> pulses

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
get a second pulse so when these pulses

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.859 
get a second pulse so when these pulses
come<00:01:26.009> back<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.520> get<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.909> first<00:01:27.119> one<00:01:27.240> here<00:01:27.689> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
come back we get the first one here and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.690 
come back we get the first one here and
the<00:01:28.110> second<00:01:28.409> one<00:01:28.530> here<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.130> they're<00:01:29.549> just

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
the second one here and they're just

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.810 
the second one here and they're just
plotted<00:01:30.090> as<00:01:30.299> spikes<00:01:31.100> voltage<00:01:32.100> spikes<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.640> on

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
plotted as spikes voltage spikes on on

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.780 
plotted as spikes voltage spikes on on
this<00:01:33.060> graph<00:01:33.600> effectively<00:01:34.579> but<00:01:35.579> we<00:01:35.670> can

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
this graph effectively but we can

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.359 
this graph effectively but we can
calculate<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.420> distance<00:01:36.570> between<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:38.009> this

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
calculate the distance between the this

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.700 
calculate the distance between the this
boundary<00:01:38.790> here<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.450> boundary<00:01:39.750> here<00:01:40.170> by

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
boundary here and this boundary here by

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.100 
boundary here and this boundary here by
using<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.220> time<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.729> takes<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.299> delta<00:01:42.899> T

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
using the time it takes this delta T

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.469 
using the time it takes this delta T
here<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.280> second<00:01:44.700> between<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> first

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
here for the second between the first

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
pulse being received back and the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.020 
pulse being received back and the
distance<00:01:49.680> between<00:01:49.829> those<00:01:50.130> two<00:01:50.189> boundaries<00:01:50.759> is

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
distance between those two boundaries is

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.030 
distance between those two boundaries is
equal<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> speed<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.409> ultrasound<00:01:52.860> in

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
equal to the speed of the ultrasound in

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.399 
equal to the speed of the ultrasound in
this<00:01:53.159> particular<00:01:53.460> layer<00:01:53.820> here<00:01:54.259> multiplied<00:01:55.259> by

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
this particular layer here multiplied by

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.590 
this particular layer here multiplied by
the<00:01:55.470> time<00:01:55.829> difference<00:01:56.280> divided<00:01:56.790> by<00:01:56.909> two<00:01:56.969> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
the time difference divided by two the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.149 
the time difference divided by two the
time<00:01:57.810> difference<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.200> delta<00:01:58.590> T<00:01:58.770> here<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
time difference is delta T here the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.830 
time difference is delta T here the
difference<00:01:59.430> between<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.759> first<00:02:00.030> pulse<00:02:00.719> has

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
difference between this first pulse has

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.450 
difference between this first pulse has
arrived<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.380> second<00:02:01.740> pulse<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.040> arrival

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
arrived on the second pulse is arrival

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.179 
arrived on the second pulse is arrival
why<00:02:03.390> do<00:02:03.450> we<00:02:03.630> divide<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.020> by<00:02:04.049> two<00:02:04.200> well<00:02:05.040> it's

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
why do we divide it by two well it's

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.389 
why do we divide it by two well it's
because<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.790> pulse<00:02:06.450> has<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.840> travel<00:02:07.220> to<00:02:08.220> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
because the pulse has to travel to the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.219 
because the pulse has to travel to the
second<00:02:08.759> boundary<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.270> then<00:02:09.539> back<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.080> it's

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
second boundary and then back so it's

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.290 
second boundary and then back so it's
arrival<00:02:10.739> will<00:02:10.890> be<00:02:11.009> delayed<00:02:11.370> by<00:02:12.270> that

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
arrival will be delayed by that

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.410 
arrival will be delayed by that
time<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:14.290> time<00:02:14.650> so<00:02:15.220> we<00:02:15.520> need<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.790> divide

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
time and that time so we need to divide

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.270 
time and that time so we need to divide
that<00:02:16.450> by<00:02:16.660> two<00:02:16.720> because<00:02:17.080> we<00:02:17.680> don't<00:02:17.860> want<00:02:18.040> there

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
that by two because we don't want there

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.950 
that by two because we don't want there
and<00:02:18.460> back<00:02:18.610> we<00:02:18.850> just<00:02:18.880> want<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.450> know<00:02:19.480> how<00:02:19.840> long

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
and back we just want to know how long

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.080 
and back we just want to know how long
it<00:02:20.080> took<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.290> get<00:02:20.530> there<00:02:20.800> okay<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:21.850> that's

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
it took to get there okay so that's

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.350 
it took to get there okay so that's
where<00:02:22.300> that<00:02:22.480> half<00:02:22.750> comes<00:02:23.020> from<00:02:23.080> there<00:02:24.300> okay<00:02:25.300> so

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
where that half comes from there okay so

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.490 
where that half comes from there okay so
that's<00:02:25.630> how<00:02:25.720> we<00:02:25.840> calculate<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.350> distance

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
that's how we calculate the distance

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.800 
that's how we calculate the distance
between<00:02:26.770> two<00:02:27.280> boundaries<00:02:27.610> now<00:02:28.300> amplitude

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
between two boundaries now amplitude

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.050 
between two boundaries now amplitude
scans<00:02:29.110> are<00:02:29.320> useful<00:02:29.950> because<00:02:30.580> they<00:02:30.850> give<00:02:31.030> us

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
scans are useful because they give us

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.940 
scans are useful because they give us
information<00:02:31.450> about<00:02:31.990> that<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.440> distances

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
information about that the distances

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.890 
information about that the distances
between<00:02:33.010> different<00:02:33.640> boundaries<00:02:33.970> inside<00:02:34.780> the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
between different boundaries inside the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.660 
between different boundaries inside the
body<00:02:35.110> but<00:02:35.650> they<00:02:35.770> don't<00:02:35.980> actually<00:02:36.160> give<00:02:36.430> us<00:02:36.550> a

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
body but they don't actually give us a

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.350 
body but they don't actually give us a
picture<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.570> we<00:02:37.720> can<00:02:38.190> interpret<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:40.060> in

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
picture that we can interpret so in

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.970 
picture that we can interpret so in
order<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.690> do<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:40.930> what<00:02:41.230> we<00:02:41.260> need<00:02:41.380> is<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.710> be

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
order to do that what we need is a be

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.920 
order to do that what we need is a be
scan<00:02:43.110> now<00:02:44.110> B<00:02:44.410> scan<00:02:44.740> instead<00:02:45.250> of<00:02:45.340> giving<00:02:45.610> you

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
scan now B scan instead of giving you

scan now B scan instead of giving you
amplitude<00:02:46.930> spikes<00:02:47.320> like<00:02:47.560> this<00:02:47.770> gives<00:02:48.070> you

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
amplitude spikes like this gives you

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.850 
amplitude spikes like this gives you
dots<00:02:48.640> of<00:02:48.970> brightness<00:02:49.450> on<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:49.660> 2d<00:02:50.260> plane<00:02:50.590> our

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
dots of brightness on a 2d plane our

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.600 
dots of brightness on a 2d plane our
image<00:02:51.190> so<00:02:52.150> what<00:02:52.780> we<00:02:52.870> do<00:02:53.020> is<00:02:53.200> we<00:02:53.560> send<00:02:53.860> an<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.280> scan

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
image so what we do is we send an a scan

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.380 
image so what we do is we send an a scan
out<00:02:54.760> in<00:02:54.910> this<00:02:55.030> direction<00:02:56.790> okay<00:02:57.790> this<00:02:58.180> the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
out in this direction okay this the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.690 
out in this direction okay this the
scanner<00:02:58.690> would<00:02:59.050> be<00:02:59.200> here<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.770> it<00:03:00.430> will<00:03:00.520> send

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
scanner would be here and it will send

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.070 
scanner would be here and it will send
an<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:00.880> scan<00:03:01.150> out<00:03:01.270> in<00:03:01.390> this<00:03:01.510> direction<00:03:01.660> and

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
an a scan out in this direction and

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.870 
an a scan out in this direction and
there<00:03:02.800> will<00:03:02.890> be<00:03:02.920> a<00:03:03.040> reflection<00:03:03.220> from<00:03:03.610> this

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
there will be a reflection from this

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.180 
there will be a reflection from this
boundary<00:03:04.570> here<00:03:04.630> which<00:03:05.050> will<00:03:05.200> come<00:03:05.350> back<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:05.800> a

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
boundary here which will come back and a

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.920 
boundary here which will come back and a
reflection<00:03:06.670> from<00:03:06.820> this<00:03:07.090> boundary<00:03:07.480> here<00:03:07.750> which

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
reflection from this boundary here which

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.380 
reflection from this boundary here which
will<00:03:08.080> come<00:03:08.260> back<00:03:08.410> and<00:03:08.620> instead<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.430> plotting

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
will come back and instead of plotting

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.660 
will come back and instead of plotting
the<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:12.670> pulses<00:03:13.150> as<00:03:13.740> voltage<00:03:14.740> spikes<00:03:15.130> we<00:03:15.370> plot

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
the the pulses as voltage spikes we plot

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.390 
the the pulses as voltage spikes we plot
them<00:03:15.850> as<00:03:16.060> bright<00:03:16.540> as<00:03:16.750> dots<00:03:17.080> of<00:03:17.320> brightness<00:03:17.739> so

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
them as bright as dots of brightness so

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.520 
them as bright as dots of brightness so
that<00:03:18.610> one<00:03:18.790> there<00:03:18.820> might<00:03:19.180> be<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.600> dot<00:03:19.930> there<00:03:20.200> and

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
that one there might be a dot there and

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.190 
that one there might be a dot there and
a<00:03:21.190> dot<00:03:21.430> there<00:03:21.670> rather<00:03:22.300> let's<00:03:22.570> say<00:03:22.750> dot<00:03:22.989> there

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
a dot there rather let's say dot there

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.630 
a dot there rather let's say dot there
and<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.410> dot<00:03:23.560> there<00:03:23.770> because<00:03:24.160> there's<00:03:24.370> a<00:03:24.430> two

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
and a dot there because there's a two

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.520 
and a dot there because there's a two
bright<00:03:24.910> bright<00:03:25.390> spots<00:03:25.870> on<00:03:26.050> on<00:03:26.290> that

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
bright bright spots on on that

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.130 
bright bright spots on on that
particular<00:03:26.830> line<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:27.430> then<00:03:28.180> we<00:03:28.540> send<00:03:28.870> an

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
particular line and then we send an

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.840 
particular line and then we send an
ultrasound<00:03:29.770> pulse<00:03:30.070> out<00:03:30.280> at<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.489> slightly

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
ultrasound pulse out at a slightly

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.790 
ultrasound pulse out at a slightly
different<00:03:30.970> angle<00:03:31.360> into<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.840> body<00:03:32.050> so<00:03:32.620> we're

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
different angle into the body so we're

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.750 
different angle into the body so we're
going<00:03:32.890> to<00:03:32.980> get<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:34.470> dot<00:03:35.470> there<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:35.920> a<00:03:36.370> dot<00:03:36.580> there

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
going to get a dot there and a dot there

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.610 
going to get a dot there and a dot there
as<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.480> pulse<00:03:37.660> comes<00:03:37.870> back<00:03:38.080> here<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.530> then

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
as the pulse comes back here and then

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.440 
as the pulse comes back here and then
the<00:03:38.709> pulse<00:03:38.920> comes<00:03:39.130> back<00:03:39.340> from<00:03:39.459> here<00:03:39.790> so<00:03:40.270> that

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
the pulse comes back from here so that

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.680 
the pulse comes back from here so that
would<00:03:40.630> be<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:41.050> dot<00:03:41.709> there<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.700> dot<00:03:42.880> there<00:03:43.060> and

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
would be a dot there and a dot there and

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.729 
would be a dot there and a dot there and
we<00:03:43.750> do<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:43.959> in<00:03:44.050> many<00:03:44.230> at<00:03:44.470> many<00:03:44.650> different

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
we do it in many at many different

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.620 
we do it in many at many different
angles<00:03:45.100> so<00:03:45.400> that<00:03:45.730> on<00:03:45.880> this<00:03:46.000> little<00:03:46.209> diagram

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
angles so that on this little diagram

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.920 
angles so that on this little diagram
here<00:03:46.720> that's<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.320> third<00:03:47.560> direction<00:03:48.130> so<00:03:48.930> we'll

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
here that's the third direction so we'll

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.440 
here that's the third direction so we'll
get<00:03:50.020> a<00:03:50.080> dot<00:03:50.290> there<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:50.650> dot<00:03:50.860> there<00:03:51.130> or<00:03:52.120> on<00:03:52.330> this

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
get a dot there and dot there or on this

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.820 
get a dot there and dot there or on this
one<00:03:52.660> it<00:03:52.780> would<00:03:52.900> be<00:03:53.020> a<00:03:53.050> dot<00:03:53.290> there<00:03:53.470> and<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.680> dot

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
one it would be a dot there and a dot

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.770 
one it would be a dot there and a dot
there<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.610> we<00:03:55.000> keep<00:03:55.209> going<00:03:55.600> and<00:03:57.000> we<00:03:58.000> get<00:03:58.239> lots

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
there and we keep going and we get lots

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.410 
there and we keep going and we get lots
and<00:03:58.989> lots<00:03:59.110> and<00:03:59.260> lots<00:03:59.410> of<00:03:59.530> dots<00:04:00.060> now<00:04:01.060> if<00:04:01.180> you<00:04:01.300> do

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
and lots and lots of dots now if you do

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.840 
and lots and lots of dots now if you do
enough<00:04:01.630> a<00:04:01.750> scans<00:04:02.110> obviously<00:04:02.500> those<00:04:02.680> dots<00:04:03.010> join

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
enough a scans obviously those dots join

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.979 
enough a scans obviously those dots join
up<00:04:04.739> to<00:04:05.739> form<00:04:06.010> lines<00:04:06.280> and<00:04:06.640> from<00:04:07.420> that<00:04:07.630> we<00:04:07.810> can

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
up to form lines and from that we can

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.590 
up to form lines and from that we can
make<00:04:08.170> out<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.800> shape<00:04:09.269> of<00:04:10.269> the<00:04:10.900> boundary<00:04:12.600> so

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
make out the shape of the boundary so

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.570 
make out the shape of the boundary so
that's<00:04:13.840> that's<00:04:14.140> the<00:04:14.320> B<00:04:14.470> scan<00:04:14.800> it's<00:04:15.010> lots<00:04:15.340> of<00:04:15.459> a

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
that's that's the B scan it's lots of a

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.000 
that's that's the B scan it's lots of a

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100

voltage spikes on a voltage against time

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.020 
voltage spikes on a voltage against time
graph<00:04:32.670> okay<00:04:33.670> that's<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.960> base<00:04:35.110> camp<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:36.030> then

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
graph okay that's the base camp and then

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.380 
graph okay that's the base camp and then
there's<00:04:37.240> an<00:04:37.450> M<00:04:37.960> scam<00:04:38.320> where<00:04:39.250> M<00:04:39.670> stands<00:04:40.270> for

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
there's an M scam where M stands for

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.710 
there's an M scam where M stands for
moving<00:04:40.660> so<00:04:41.320> effectively<00:04:42.220> what<00:04:42.430> we<00:04:42.550> do<00:04:42.760> is<00:04:43.030> we

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
moving so effectively what we do is we

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.290 
moving so effectively what we do is we
take<00:04:44.080> a<00:04:44.140> B<00:04:44.410> scan<00:04:44.740> every<00:04:45.370> tenth<00:04:45.700> of<00:04:45.790> a<00:04:45.880> second<00:04:46.210> or

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
take a B scan every tenth of a second or

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.080 
take a B scan every tenth of a second or
whatever<00:04:46.390> and<00:04:46.750> we<00:04:47.470> refresh<00:04:47.890> it<00:04:48.100> like<00:04:48.760> a<00:04:48.790> TV

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
whatever and we refresh it like a TV

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.660 
whatever and we refresh it like a TV
picture<00:04:49.690> which<00:04:50.290> effectively<00:04:51.100> gives<00:04:51.310> us<00:04:51.430> a

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
picture which effectively gives us a

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.550 
picture which effectively gives us a
moving<00:04:52.330> image<00:04:52.390> just<00:04:52.840> like<00:04:52.930> a<00:04:53.050> fill

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
moving image just like a fill

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.520 
moving image just like a fill
okay<00:04:54.160> so<00:04:54.220> many<00:04:54.910> a<00:04:55.000> scans<00:04:55.390> making<00:04:55.810> up<00:04:55.930> a<00:04:56.020> B<00:04:56.200> scam

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
okay so many a scans making up a B scam

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.130 
okay so many a scans making up a B scam
and<00:04:56.950> a<00:04:57.130> few<00:04:57.340> B<00:04:57.490> scans<00:04:57.760> a<00:04:57.880> second<00:04:58.270> making<00:04:58.900> up

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
and a few B scans a second making up

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.740 
and a few B scans a second making up
what<00:04:59.470> we<00:04:59.590> call<00:04:59.830> an<00:05:00.070> M<00:05:00.280> scam<00:05:00.700> and<00:05:01.390> we've<00:05:01.570> got<00:05:01.720> a

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
what we call an M scam and we've got a

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.860 
what we call an M scam and we've got a
couple<00:05:02.020> of<00:05:02.140> little<00:05:03.300> little<00:05:04.300> videos<00:05:04.570> here

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
couple of little little videos here

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.480 
couple of little little videos here
let's<00:05:05.050> show<00:05:05.260> you<00:05:05.350> one<00:05:05.500> of<00:05:05.530> them<00:05:05.740> here<00:05:06.070> I<00:05:06.190> can

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
let's show you one of them here I can

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.270 
let's show you one of them here I can
get<00:05:07.180> this<00:05:07.270> to<00:05:07.330> load<00:05:07.630> up<00:05:10.470> so<00:05:11.470> there<00:05:11.680> we<00:05:11.800> go<00:05:11.830> so

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
get this to load up so there we go so

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.240 
get this to load up so there we go so
you<00:05:12.310> can<00:05:12.670> see<00:05:12.940> there<00:05:13.830> each<00:05:14.830> of<00:05:15.130> these

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
you can see there each of these

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.380 
you can see there each of these
individual<00:05:15.850> lines

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
individual lines

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.510 
individual lines
let's<00:05:16.600> just<00:05:16.870> play<00:05:17.200> that<00:05:17.440> again<00:05:17.680> each<00:05:18.190> of<00:05:18.400> these

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
let's just play that again each of these

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.010 
let's just play that again each of these
individual<00:05:19.090> lines<00:05:19.920> is<00:05:20.920> an<00:05:21.520> a<00:05:21.640> scan<00:05:21.970> all<00:05:22.660> right

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
individual lines is an a scan all right

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.690 
individual lines is an a scan all right
and<00:05:23.110> many<00:05:23.770> a<00:05:23.860> scans<00:05:24.220> at<00:05:24.340> different<00:05:24.610> angles

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
and many a scans at different angles

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.030 
and many a scans at different angles
make<00:05:25.030> up<00:05:25.180> a<00:05:25.270> B<00:05:25.420> scan<00:05:25.690> and<00:05:26.260> that<00:05:26.380> B<00:05:26.530> scan<00:05:26.770> is<00:05:26.860> then

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
make up a B scan and that B scan is then

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.590 
make up a B scan and that B scan is then
refreshed<00:05:27.460> many<00:05:27.820> times<00:05:28.000> a<00:05:28.090> second

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
refreshed many times a second

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.350 
refreshed many times a second
to<00:05:29.020> give<00:05:29.170> you<00:05:29.290> a<00:05:29.320> moving<00:05:29.950> image<00:05:30.150> looks<00:05:31.150> like<00:05:31.240> a

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
to give you a moving image looks like a

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.780 
to give you a moving image looks like a
fetus's<00:05:32.110> on<00:05:32.290> there<00:05:32.530> perhaps<00:05:33.780> okay
