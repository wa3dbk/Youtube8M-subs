aircraft<00:00:13.880> what<00:00:14.880> we<00:00:15.000> have<00:00:15.120> on<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.269> screen<00:00:15.480> here

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
aircraft what we have on the screen here

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.230 
aircraft what we have on the screen here
is<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> simple<00:00:16.800> landing<00:00:17.310> gear<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.760> I'm

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
is a simple landing gear and I'm

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.189 
is a simple landing gear and I'm
basically<00:00:18.510> going<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.720> show<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:18.960> how<00:00:19.140> to

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
basically going to show you how to

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.580 
basically going to show you how to
animate<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.859> so<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.029> rotates

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
animate it so that it rotates

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.400 
animate it so that it rotates
approximately<00:00:22.590> 90<00:00:22.859> degrees<00:00:23.130> up<00:00:23.340> like<00:00:23.519> that

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
approximately 90 degrees up like that

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.920 
approximately 90 degrees up like that
well<00:00:25.410> one<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.859> first<00:00:26.099> concepts<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:27.539> I've

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
well one of the first concepts that I've

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.359 
well one of the first concepts that I've
got<00:00:28.080> on<00:00:28.170> my<00:00:28.199> screen<00:00:28.500> here<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.949> should<00:00:29.160> show

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
got on my screen here that I should show

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.970 
got on my screen here that I should show
you<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.939> thing<00:00:30.240> called<00:00:30.449> linking<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.050> if

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
you is the thing called linking and if

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.620 
you is the thing called linking and if
you'll<00:00:32.160> notice<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.850> landing<00:00:33.480> gear

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
you'll notice that this landing gear

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.840 
you'll notice that this landing gear
shaft<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:34.020> actually<00:00:34.290> only<00:00:34.440> one<00:00:34.680> object<00:00:35.160> but<00:00:35.760> if

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
shaft is actually only one object but if

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.150 
shaft is actually only one object but if
I<00:00:35.969> rotate<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.510> all<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.260> objects<00:00:37.620> rotate<00:00:37.950> with

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
I rotate it all the objects rotate with

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.240 
I rotate it all the objects rotate with
us<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:39.270> that's<00:00:39.480> basically<00:00:39.750> linking<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.980> what

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
us and that's basically linking is what

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.459 
us and that's basically linking is what
does<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.719> you'll<00:00:42.719> notice<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.200> screen

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
does that you'll notice on the screen

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.650 
does that you'll notice on the screen
here<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:44.190> I've<00:00:44.280> got<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> shaft<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:45.210> couple<00:00:45.600> of

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
here that I've got a shaft a couple of

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.520 
here that I've got a shaft a couple of
cross<00:00:45.870> pieces<00:00:47.690> basically<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> wheel<00:00:49.260> shaft

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
cross pieces basically a wheel shaft

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.799 
cross pieces basically a wheel shaft
right<00:00:49.890> there<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.399> two<00:00:51.059> tires<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.660> they're

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
right there and two tires and they're

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.020 
right there and two tires and they're
all<00:00:51.899> linked<00:00:52.199> together<00:00:52.550> now<00:00:53.550> if<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.789> want<00:00:53.969> to

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
of our list of our objects if I go

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.479 
of our list of our objects if I go
display<00:01:00.660> sub<00:01:00.960> tree<00:01:01.230> it'll<00:01:01.920> show<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.190> actual

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
display sub tree it'll show the actual

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.429 
display sub tree it'll show the actual
hierarchy<00:01:03.300> you'll<00:01:03.840> notice<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> nose<00:01:04.409> gear

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
hierarchy you'll notice the nose gear

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.160 
hierarchy you'll notice the nose gear
which<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> shaft<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.150> highest<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
which is the shaft is the highest in the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.060 
which is the shaft is the highest in the
tree<00:01:07.590> with<00:01:08.340> two<00:01:08.670> objects<00:01:09.060> below<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.510> line<00:01:10.409> 03

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
tree with two objects below it line 03

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.250 
tree with two objects below it line 03
has<00:01:11.310> one<00:01:11.850> object<00:01:12.270> directly<00:01:12.510> below<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.960> and

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
has one object directly below it and

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.859 
has one object directly below it and
cylinder<00:01:13.860> 03<00:01:14.310> has<00:01:14.460> two<00:01:14.700> objects<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.270> that's

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
cylinder 03 has two objects and that's

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:16.999 
cylinder 03 has two objects and that's
basically<00:01:16.110> how<00:01:16.380> they're<00:01:16.680> linked<00:01:16.860> together

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
basically how they're linked together

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.440 
basically how they're linked together
now<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.549> show<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.880> on<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.030> screen<00:01:18.090> how

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
now to show you on the screen how

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.960 
now to show you on the screen how
they're<00:01:18.600> linked<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.070> that<00:01:20.070> tire<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.640> linked

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
they're linked it's that tire is linked

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.320 
they're linked it's that tire is linked
to<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.180> shaft<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.650> tire<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.909> linked<00:01:24.299> to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
to the shaft that that tire is linked to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.609 
to the shaft that that tire is linked to
the<00:01:24.479> same<00:01:24.659> shaft<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:27.090> shaft<00:01:27.509> cross<00:01:28.080> piece<00:01:28.380> is

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
the same shaft the shaft cross piece is

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.249 
the same shaft the shaft cross piece is
linked<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.460> object<00:01:29.729> which<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.810> turn<00:01:31.049> is

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
linked to this object which in turn is

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.010 
linked to this object which in turn is
linked<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.070> object<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.689> one<00:01:33.869> is

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
linked to that object and this one is

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.319 
linked to that object and this one is
also<00:01:34.170> linked<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.710> object<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.670> that's

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
also linked to that object and that's

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.480 
also linked to that object and that's
why<00:01:36.450> they<00:01:36.570> all<00:01:36.689> rotate<00:01:37.049> rotate<00:01:37.619> together<00:01:38.040> like

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
why they all rotate rotate together like

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.420 
why they all rotate rotate together like
that<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:39.750> basically<00:01:40.380> how<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.100> do<00:01:41.310> an

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
that so basically how you do an

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.230 
that so basically how you do an
animation<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.329> basically<00:01:43.110> take<00:01:43.829> your<00:01:44.240> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
animation is basically take your the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.389 
animation is basically take your the
object<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.960> highest<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.829> highest<00:01:46.860> up<00:01:47.280> in

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
object in the highest the highest up in

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.880 
object in the highest the highest up in
the<00:01:47.490> tree<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.060> hierarchy<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.780> rotate<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.860> and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
the tree the hierarchy and rotate it and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.179 
the tree the hierarchy and rotate it and
of<00:01:50.250> course<00:01:50.460> everything<00:01:50.850> will<00:01:51.030> rotate<00:01:51.630> with<00:01:51.840> it

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
of course everything will rotate with it

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.380 
of course everything will rotate with it
so<00:01:53.189> one<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> other<00:01:53.610> concepts<00:01:54.119> we<00:01:54.240> have<00:01:54.329> to

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
so one of the other concepts we have to

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.080 
so one of the other concepts we have to
look<00:01:54.540> at<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.990> number<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.290> frames<00:01:56.090> down

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
look at is the number of frames down

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.300 
look at is the number of frames down
here<00:01:57.329> at<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.479> bottom<00:01:57.540> we<00:01:57.990> have<00:01:58.020> frame<00:01:58.710> 0<00:01:59.009> all

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
here at the bottom we have frame 0 all

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.490 
here at the bottom we have frame 0 all
the<00:01:59.399> way<00:01:59.490> over<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.759> frame<00:01:59.939> 1<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.259> case

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
the way over the frame 1 in this case

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.730 
the way over the frame 1 in this case
here<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.799> dr<00:02:02.250> sorry<00:02:02.520> frame<00:02:02.880> 100<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:04.320> default

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
here the dr sorry frame 100 the default

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.980 
here the dr sorry frame 100 the default
for<00:02:05.219> 3d<00:02:05.460> studio<00:02:05.610> max<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.119> 100<00:02:06.540> frames<00:02:06.780> of

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
for 3d studio max is 100 frames of

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.700 
for 3d studio max is 100 frames of
animation

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
animation

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.210 
animation
this<00:02:08.459> can<00:02:08.670> be<00:02:08.789> changed<00:02:08.819> by<00:02:09.479> simply

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
this can be changed by simply

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.600 
this can be changed by simply
right-clicking<00:02:12.260> here<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.530> changing<00:02:14.490> the

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
right-clicking here and changing the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.309 
right-clicking here and changing the
length<00:02:14.730> right<00:02:15.060> here<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.330> can<00:02:15.450> change<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.840> I'm

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
length right here you can change it I'm

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.340 
length right here you can change it I'm
not<00:02:16.440> sure<00:02:16.620> what<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.860> upper<00:02:17.100> limit<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.180> but<00:02:18.569> 100

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
not sure what the upper limit is but 100

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.490 
not sure what the upper limit is but 100
will<00:02:19.470> do<00:02:19.590> for<00:02:19.800> now<00:02:19.830> anyway<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:21.870> basically<00:02:22.260> what

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
will do for now anyway so basically what

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.240 
will do for now anyway so basically what
we<00:02:22.590> do<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.770> we<00:02:22.980> take<00:02:23.130> our<00:02:23.340> uppermost<00:02:24.300> part

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
we do is we take our uppermost part

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.699 
we do is we take our uppermost part
we're<00:02:26.250> going<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.430> animate<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.780> what<00:02:28.590> we're

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
we're going to animate it so what we're

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.370 
we're going to animate it so what we're
going<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.890> do<00:02:29.069> is<00:02:29.310> we're<00:02:29.550> going<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:30.110> down<00:02:31.110> here

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
going to do is we're going to down here

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.309 
going to do is we're going to down here
to<00:02:31.470> set<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.709> key<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.160> turn<00:02:32.690> your<00:02:33.690> animation

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
to set the key to turn your animation

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.860 
to set the key to turn your animation
mode<00:02:34.500> on<00:02:35.360> set<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.510> keyframe<00:02:36.810> at<00:02:37.319> frame<00:02:37.350> 0<00:02:38.870> which

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
mode on set a keyframe at frame 0 which

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.500 
mode on set a keyframe at frame 0 which
will<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.170> course<00:02:40.200> put<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.530> keyframe<00:02:40.920> there<00:02:41.510> move

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
will of course put a keyframe there move

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.410 
will of course put a keyframe there move
it<00:02:42.660> over<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.870> frame<00:02:43.170> 100<00:02:44.180> we're<00:02:45.180> going<00:02:45.330> to

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
it over to frame 100 we're going to

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.479 
it over to frame 100 we're going to
rotate<00:02:45.570> our<00:02:45.900> shaft<00:02:46.160> approximately<00:02:47.160> 90

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
rotate our shaft approximately 90

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.040 
rotate our shaft approximately 90
degrees<00:02:47.820> right<00:02:48.810> there<00:02:49.110> set<00:02:49.890> another<00:02:50.130> keyframe

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
degrees right there set another keyframe

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
degrees right there set another keyframe
turn<00:02:52.050> key<00:02:52.230> mode<00:02:52.410> off<00:02:53.840> replay<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.200> now<00:02:55.830> if

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
turn key mode off replay it and now if

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.009 
turn key mode off replay it and now if
you<00:02:56.190> move<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.910> frame<00:02:57.180> counter<00:02:57.570> you'll<00:02:57.750> notice

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
you move the frame counter you'll notice

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.150 
you move the frame counter you'll notice
that<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.290> rotates<00:02:59.000> now<00:03:00.410> there<00:03:01.410> is<00:03:01.500> one<00:03:01.530> concept

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
that it rotates now there is one concept

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.830 
that it rotates now there is one concept
to<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.670> should<00:03:02.850> know<00:03:03.030> about<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.420> that's

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
to that you should know about and that's

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.390 
to that you should know about and that's
key<00:03:04.080> filtering<00:03:04.650> if<00:03:04.769> you<00:03:04.890> go<00:03:05.010> on<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.220> key

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
key filtering if you go on the key

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.610 
key filtering if you go on the key
filters<00:03:05.880> you'll<00:03:06.510> notice<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.170> can<00:03:07.350> you

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
filters you'll notice that you can you

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.860 
filters you'll notice that you can you
can<00:03:07.769> change<00:03:08.040> position<00:03:08.519> rotation<00:03:08.910> scale<00:03:09.600> and

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
can change position rotation scale and

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.930 
can change position rotation scale and
different<00:03:10.140> parameters<00:03:10.650> because<00:03:11.640> we're<00:03:11.790> only

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
different parameters because we're only

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.500 
different parameters because we're only
doing<00:03:12.299> rotation<00:03:13.079> all<00:03:13.440> we<00:03:13.769> want<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.070> ever

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
doing rotation all we want to ever

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.870 
doing rotation all we want to ever
activate<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.630> rotation<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:16.350> we<00:03:16.500> would<00:03:16.650> then

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
activate is rotation so we would then

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.190 
activate is rotation so we would then
make<00:03:17.880> sure<00:03:17.940> rotation<00:03:18.660> is<00:03:18.780> checked<00:03:19.079> and

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
make sure rotation is checked and

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.780 
make sure rotation is checked and
everything<00:03:19.560> else<00:03:19.739> is<00:03:19.920> off<00:03:20.100> which<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.519> is<00:03:20.640> in

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
everything else is off which it is in

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.660 
everything else is off which it is in
this<00:03:20.880> case<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:22.620> we've<00:03:22.950> got<00:03:23.130> our<00:03:23.160> basic

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
this case so we've got our basic

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.460 
this case so we've got our basic
animation<00:03:24.030> right<00:03:24.390> there<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.870> if<00:03:25.200> we<00:03:25.230> were<00:03:25.410> to

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
animation right there and if we were to

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.229 
animation right there and if we were to
click<00:03:25.650> on<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:25.950> play<00:03:26.160> button<00:03:26.190> play<00:03:26.850> animation

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
click on the play button play animation

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.360 
click on the play button play animation
will<00:03:27.930> notice<00:03:28.200> that<00:03:28.350> it<00:03:28.440> plays<00:03:28.620> all<00:03:28.860> by<00:03:29.040> itself

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
will notice that it plays all by itself

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.120 
will notice that it plays all by itself
and<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:30.420> course<00:03:30.480> it'll<00:03:30.780> rotate<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.530> go<00:03:31.950> back

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
and of course it'll rotate and go back

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.400 
and of course it'll rotate and go back
around<00:03:32.280> now<00:03:33.269> let's<00:03:33.450> look<00:03:33.570> at<00:03:33.690> another<00:03:33.780> concept

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
around now let's look at another concept

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.650 
around now let's look at another concept
and<00:03:34.650> that's<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.950> key<00:03:35.130> frames<00:03:35.660> basically

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
and that's the key frames basically

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.390 
and that's the key frames basically
keyframes<00:03:37.230> are<00:03:37.380> simply<00:03:37.769> points<00:03:38.190> in<00:03:38.310> the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
keyframes are simply points in the

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.880 
keyframes are simply points in the
animation<00:03:38.790> where<00:03:39.090> changes<00:03:39.600> take<00:03:39.870> place<00:03:39.900> in

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
animation where changes take place in

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.009 
animation where changes take place in
our<00:03:41.040> animation<00:03:41.640> of<00:03:41.760> course<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.630> the

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
our animation of course the the

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.930 
our animation of course the the
animation<00:03:43.560> takes<00:03:43.739> place<00:03:44.100> over<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.549> hundred

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
animation takes place over a hundred

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.300 
animation takes place over a hundred
frames<00:03:45.269> between<00:03:45.600> frames<00:03:46.019> 0<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.560> frame<00:03:46.769> 100

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
frames between frames 0 and frame 100

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.220 
frames between frames 0 and frame 100
which<00:03:47.850> is<00:03:48.000> actually<00:03:48.180> technically<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.810> hundred

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
which is actually technically a hundred

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.050 
which is actually technically a hundred
1<00:03:49.440> frames<00:03:49.769> but<00:03:50.810> let's<00:03:51.810> just<00:03:52.019> say<00:03:52.170> for<00:03:52.200> example

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
1 frames but let's just say for example

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.920 
1 frames but let's just say for example
we<00:03:54.060> wanted<00:03:54.450> to<00:03:54.480> have<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.859> have<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.760> right<00:03:57.750> now

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
we wanted to have the have the right now

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.069 
we wanted to have the have the right now
if<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.290> look<00:03:58.500> at<00:03:58.680> us<00:03:58.829> at<00:03:58.980> frame<00:03:59.670> 50<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.870> thing

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
if you look at us at frame 50 the thing

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.890 
if you look at us at frame 50 the thing
is<00:04:01.109> rotated<00:04:01.769> approximately<00:04:02.700> halfway<00:04:02.910> well

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
is rotated approximately halfway well

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.750 
is rotated approximately halfway well
what<00:04:04.079> would<00:04:04.230> happen<00:04:04.560> if<00:04:04.680> this<00:04:05.459> particular

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
what would happen if this particular

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.150 
what would happen if this particular
landing<00:04:06.269> gear<00:04:06.450> if<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:07.079> only<00:04:07.200> rotated<00:04:08.100> a

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
landing gear if it only rotated a

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.800 
landing gear if it only rotated a
quarter<00:04:08.579> of<00:04:08.609> the<00:04:08.790> way<00:04:08.910> in<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.180> first<00:04:09.390> 50

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
quarter of the way in the first 50

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.539 
quarter of the way in the first 50
frames<00:04:10.019> well<00:04:10.829> that's<00:04:10.980> actually<00:04:11.310> quite<00:04:11.430> easy

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
frames well that's actually quite easy

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.660 
frames well that's actually quite easy
to<00:04:11.940> do<00:04:12.120> you<00:04:12.329> would<00:04:12.930> go<00:04:13.500> back<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.829> here<00:04:14.010> turn<00:04:14.489> on

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
to do you would go back to here turn on

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.830 
to do you would go back to here turn on
set<00:04:14.970> key<00:04:15.350> go<00:04:16.350> to<00:04:16.410> your<00:04:16.590> frame<00:04:16.889> frame<00:04:17.639> 50<00:04:18.150> let's

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
set key go to your frame frame 50 let's

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.429 
set key go to your frame frame 50 let's
rotate<00:04:19.079> it<00:04:19.350> back<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.590> bit<00:04:19.769> now

00:04:20.429 --> 00:04:20.439 
rotate it back a bit now

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:22.600 
rotate it back a bit now
so<00:04:21.439> does<00:04:21.620> it's<00:04:21.769> right<00:04:21.949> there<00:04:22.129> just<00:04:22.400> barely

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
so does it's right there just barely

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.529 
so does it's right there just barely
moved<00:04:22.939> basically<00:04:23.780> right<00:04:24.650> there<00:04:24.889> and<00:04:25.509> set<00:04:26.509> a

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
moved basically right there and set a

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:32.200 
moved basically right there and set a
key<00:04:26.629> turn<00:04:27.620> off<00:04:27.770> set<00:04:28.039> key<00:04:29.139> and<00:04:30.580> now<00:04:31.580> if<00:04:31.819> we<00:04:31.999> wrote

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
key turn off set key and now if we wrote

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.779 
key turn off set key and now if we wrote
you<00:04:32.479> rotate<00:04:33.080> it<00:04:33.110> you'll<00:04:33.319> notice<00:04:33.650> that<00:04:33.789> it

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
you rotate it you'll notice that it

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:36.249 
you rotate it you'll notice that it
actually<00:04:34.939> rotates<00:04:35.240> and<00:04:35.539> then<00:04:35.629> it<00:04:35.719> gets<00:04:35.840> really

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
actually rotates and then it gets really

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.700 
actually rotates and then it gets really
fast<00:04:36.590> at<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:36.860> last<00:04:37.129> because<00:04:37.580> and<00:04:38.499> where<00:04:39.499> this

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
fast at the last because and where this

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.589 
fast at the last because and where this
comes<00:04:40.009> into<00:04:40.279> play<00:04:40.490> this<00:04:40.729> is<00:04:40.939> kind<00:04:41.150> of<00:04:41.210> hard<00:04:41.389> to

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 
comes into play this is kind of hard to

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.510 
comes into play this is kind of hard to
visualize<00:04:41.779> maybe<00:04:42.499> at<00:04:42.680> this<00:04:42.830> point<00:04:42.949> in<00:04:43.279> time

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
visualize maybe at this point in time

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.269 
visualize maybe at this point in time
but<00:04:44.419> basically<00:04:45.080> what<00:04:45.349> you've<00:04:45.529> got<00:04:45.740> to<00:04:45.860> do<00:04:46.039> is

00:04:46.269 --> 00:04:46.279 
but basically what you've got to do is

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:48.600 
but basically what you've got to do is
what<00:04:46.909> would<00:04:47.029> happen<00:04:47.090> if<00:04:47.509> you<00:04:47.629> had<00:04:47.779> to<00:04:47.930> rotate

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
what would happen if you had to rotate

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.659 
what would happen if you had to rotate
the<00:04:49.610> shaft<00:04:50.349> so<00:04:51.349> let's<00:04:51.770> say<00:04:51.979> for<00:04:52.219> example<00:04:52.340> you

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
the shaft so let's say for example you

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.040 
the shaft so let's say for example you
had<00:04:52.789> to<00:04:52.879> rotate<00:04:53.060> it<00:04:53.330> in<00:04:53.629> a<00:04:53.719> different

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
had to rotate it in a different

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.300 
had to rotate it in a different
direction<00:04:54.939> so<00:04:55.939> we<00:04:55.969> would<00:04:56.210> turn<00:04:56.389> on<00:04:56.419> set<00:04:56.779> key

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
direction so we would turn on set key

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.869 
direction so we would turn on set key
let's<00:04:58.310> go<00:04:58.490> up<00:04:58.610> to<00:04:58.639> frame<00:04:59.090> 50<00:04:59.629> again<00:05:00.699> but<00:05:01.699> this

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:01.879 
let's go up to frame 50 again but this

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:05.170 
let's go up to frame 50 again but this
time<00:05:02.860> we're<00:05:03.860> going<00:05:04.009> to<00:05:04.129> rotate<00:05:04.310> the<00:05:04.699> shaft<00:05:04.879> in

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
time we're going to rotate the shaft in

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.749 
time we're going to rotate the shaft in
this<00:05:05.330> direction<00:05:06.039> just<00:05:07.039> slightly<00:05:07.759> there<00:05:08.210> and

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
this direction just slightly there and

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.879 
this direction just slightly there and
set<00:05:10.759> a<00:05:10.789> key<00:05:10.879> right<00:05:11.210> there<00:05:11.529> see<00:05:12.529> now<00:05:12.710> it

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
set a key right there see now it

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.450 
set a key right there see now it
actually<00:05:13.250> rotates<00:05:13.639> back<00:05:14.860> and<00:05:15.860> it'll<00:05:16.159> actually

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
actually rotates back and it'll actually

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.179 
actually rotates back and it'll actually
rotate<00:05:17.060> up<00:05:17.439> into<00:05:18.439> that<00:05:18.589> position<00:05:19.150> and<00:05:21.189> into

00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:22.189 
rotate up into that position and into

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.269 
rotate up into that position and into
this<00:05:23.029> position<00:05:23.300> and<00:05:23.960> you'll<00:05:24.740> notice<00:05:24.979> that

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:25.279 
this position and you'll notice that

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:26.769 
this position and you'll notice that
that's<00:05:25.400> basically<00:05:25.939> how<00:05:26.060> you<00:05:26.210> change

00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:26.779 
that's basically how you change

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:29.920 
that's basically how you change
animation<00:05:27.439> is<00:05:27.589> by<00:05:28.069> keyframes<00:05:28.699> by<00:05:29.360> changing

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
animation is by keyframes by changing

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.350 
animation is by keyframes by changing
key<00:05:30.139> points<00:05:30.589> in<00:05:30.710> your<00:05:30.800> animation<00:05:31.400> say<00:05:32.150> right

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
key points in your animation say right

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.050 
key points in your animation say right
there<00:05:32.599> you<00:05:33.379> wanted<00:05:33.680> it<00:05:33.800> to<00:05:33.979> rotate<00:05:34.460> this<00:05:34.879> way

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
there you wanted it to rotate this way

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.339 
there you wanted it to rotate this way
and<00:05:35.710> set<00:05:36.710> a<00:05:36.740> keyframe<00:05:37.719> so<00:05:38.719> now<00:05:38.899> it'll<00:05:39.110> it'll

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
and set a keyframe so now it'll it'll

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:41.499 
and set a keyframe so now it'll it'll
start<00:05:39.680> off<00:05:39.800> in<00:05:39.949> that<00:05:40.099> position<00:05:40.339> and<00:05:40.729> it'll

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:41.509 
start off in that position and it'll

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:46.629 
start off in that position and it'll
rotate<00:05:41.779> up<00:05:42.199> to<00:05:42.649> they're<00:05:43.000> up<00:05:44.000> there<00:05:44.599> and<00:05:45.639> into

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
rotate up to they're up there and into

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.790 
rotate up to they're up there and into
its<00:05:46.849> final<00:05:47.000> resting<00:05:47.330> position<00:05:47.719> and<00:05:48.139> that's

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
its final resting position and that's

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.619 
its final resting position and that's
how<00:05:48.889> you<00:05:49.009> make<00:05:49.219> changes<00:05:49.520> in<00:05:49.909> your<00:05:50.029> animation

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:50.629 
how you make changes in your animation

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:52.749 
how you make changes in your animation
and<00:05:50.839> that's<00:05:51.500> four<00:05:51.740> things<00:05:51.919> we're<00:05:52.219> landing

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 
and that's four things we're landing

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.309 
and that's four things we're landing
gear<00:05:52.939> don't<00:05:53.149> come<00:05:53.389> straight<00:05:53.750> up<00:05:53.779> maybe<00:05:54.139> they

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 
gear don't come straight up maybe they

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.950 
gear don't come straight up maybe they
rotate<00:05:54.710> 90<00:05:55.099> degrees<00:05:55.129> on<00:05:55.789> the<00:05:56.300> way<00:05:56.419> up<00:05:56.599> so<00:05:56.810> that

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
rotate 90 degrees on the way up so that

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.149 
rotate 90 degrees on the way up so that
the<00:05:57.080> landing<00:05:57.319> gear<00:05:57.439> will<00:05:57.620> fit<00:05:57.830> into<00:05:57.979> the

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:58.159 
the landing gear will fit into the

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:00.790 
the landing gear will fit into the
landing<00:05:58.460> gear<00:05:58.550> well<00:05:59.289> basically<00:06:00.289> that's<00:06:00.560> it

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
landing gear well basically that's it

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.769 
landing gear well basically that's it
for<00:06:01.189> animation<00:06:01.759> when<00:06:01.879> it<00:06:02.000> comes<00:06:02.180> to<00:06:02.449> aircraft

00:06:02.769 --> 00:06:02.779 
for animation when it comes to aircraft

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:06.749 
for animation when it comes to aircraft
as<00:06:03.469> far<00:06:04.159> as<00:06:04.399> this<00:06:05.210> type<00:06:05.509> of<00:06:05.539> animation<00:06:06.110> I

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 
as far as this type of animation I

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:09.279 
as far as this type of animation I
probably<00:06:07.759> should<00:06:08.120> actually<00:06:08.629> touch<00:06:09.080> on

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
probably should actually touch on

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:10.600 
probably should actually touch on
another<00:06:09.620> type<00:06:09.860> so<00:06:10.009> what<00:06:10.129> I'll<00:06:10.219> do<00:06:10.399> is<00:06:10.430> I'll

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
another type so what I'll do is I'll

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.269 
another type so what I'll do is I'll
bring<00:06:10.849> in<00:06:11.029> my<00:06:11.180> my<00:06:12.080> a<00:06:12.110> seven-course<00:06:12.830> here<00:06:13.159> and

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:13.279 
bring in my my a seven-course here and

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:15.369 
bring in my my a seven-course here and
I'll<00:06:13.370> give<00:06:13.520> you<00:06:13.610> an<00:06:13.699> idea<00:06:13.789> of<00:06:14.240> another<00:06:14.990> type<00:06:15.349> of

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:15.379 
I'll give you an idea of another type of

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:18.070 
I'll give you an idea of another type of
animation<00:06:15.919> of<00:06:16.520> in<00:06:17.000> fact<00:06:17.240> a<00:06:17.360> large<00:06:17.689> number<00:06:18.050> of

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
animation of in fact a large number of

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.170 
animation of in fact a large number of
flight<00:06:18.409> sims<00:06:18.710> actually<00:06:19.219> do<00:06:19.430> and<00:06:19.699> that's

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
flight sims actually do and that's

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.790 
flight sims actually do and that's
called<00:06:20.449> automated<00:06:21.080> animation

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
called automated animation

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.080 
called automated animation
on<00:06:22.610> this<00:06:23.330> model<00:06:23.659> we<00:06:24.470> have<00:06:24.500> a<00:06:25.069> flap<00:06:25.520> and<00:06:25.789> an

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
on this model we have a flap and an

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.180 
on this model we have a flap and an
aileron<00:06:26.330> right<00:06:26.750> there<00:06:26.990> okay<00:06:27.710> we<00:06:27.889> have<00:06:28.009> our

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
aileron right there okay we have our

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.570 
aileron right there okay we have our
left<00:06:28.759> aileron<00:06:28.940> and<00:06:29.539> our<00:06:29.690> left<00:06:29.900> flap<00:06:30.370> the<00:06:31.370> type

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
left aileron and our left flap the type

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.969 
left aileron and our left flap the type
of<00:06:31.610> animation<00:06:32.060> at<00:06:32.509> things<00:06:32.840> like<00:06:33.020> flight<00:06:33.740> sim

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 
of animation at things like flight sim

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.820 
of animation at things like flight sim
2002<00:06:34.879> and<00:06:35.180> even<00:06:35.810> strike<00:06:36.110> fighters<00:06:36.530> do<00:06:36.710> is

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
2002 and even strike fighters do is

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.969 
2002 and even strike fighters do is
what's<00:06:37.039> called<00:06:37.099> automated<00:06:37.849> animation<00:06:38.979> that

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 
what's called automated animation that

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:42.059 
what's called automated animation that
animation<00:06:40.400> is<00:06:40.669> based<00:06:40.940> on<00:06:41.180> the<00:06:41.389> name<00:06:41.690> of<00:06:41.960> the

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:42.069 
animation is based on the name of the

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:45.490 
animation is based on the name of the
parse<00:06:43.069> so<00:06:43.849> in<00:06:44.000> the<00:06:44.090> case<00:06:44.240> of<00:06:44.300> left<00:06:44.690> aileron<00:06:44.930> the

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
parse so in the case of left aileron the

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.350 
parse so in the case of left aileron the
the<00:06:46.009> engine<00:06:46.490> that<00:06:46.669> you're<00:06:46.789> running<00:06:46.970> it<00:06:47.240> in

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
the engine that you're running it in

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.779 
the engine that you're running it in
knows<00:06:47.599> what<00:06:48.319> left<00:06:48.560> aileron<00:06:48.770> is<00:06:49.190> supposed<00:06:49.580> to

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:49.789 
knows what left aileron is supposed to

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:52.089 
knows what left aileron is supposed to
do<00:06:49.970> now<00:06:50.810> if<00:06:50.990> I<00:06:51.110> go<00:06:51.289> in<00:06:51.470> here<00:06:51.740> you'll<00:06:51.949> notice

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:52.099 
do now if I go in here you'll notice

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:55.080 
do now if I go in here you'll notice
that<00:06:52.340> if<00:06:53.030> I<00:06:53.270> take<00:06:53.509> this<00:06:53.659> and<00:06:53.870> I<00:06:53.900> rotate<00:06:54.349> it<00:06:54.530> like

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.090 
that if I take this and I rotate it like

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.309 
that if I take this and I rotate it like
this<00:06:56.090> you'll<00:06:56.360> notice<00:06:56.690> that<00:06:56.719> it<00:06:56.960> that<00:06:57.289> it

00:06:57.309 --> 00:06:57.319 
this you'll notice that it that it

00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:59.619 
this you'll notice that it that it
rotates<00:06:57.879> actually<00:06:58.879> I<00:06:58.940> got<00:06:59.060> to<00:06:59.150> change<00:06:59.330> one

00:06:59.619 --> 00:06:59.629 
rotates actually I got to change one

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:01.689 
rotates actually I got to change one
thing<00:06:59.900> going<00:07:00.620> to<00:07:00.680> change<00:07:00.860> it<00:07:00.979> to<00:07:01.069> local<00:07:01.280> there

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:01.699 
thing going to change it to local there

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:03.820 
thing going to change it to local there
we<00:07:01.879> go<00:07:02.000> now<00:07:02.690> it'll<00:07:02.900> you'll<00:07:03.139> notice<00:07:03.409> that<00:07:03.440> it<00:07:03.680> it

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:03.830 
we go now it'll you'll notice that it it

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.909 
we go now it'll you'll notice that it it
rotates<00:07:04.400> the<00:07:04.520> proper<00:07:04.940> way<00:07:05.090> the<00:07:05.840> engine<00:07:06.409> the

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:06.919 
rotates the proper way the engine the

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:08.920 
rotates the proper way the engine the
game<00:07:07.310> engine<00:07:07.729> does<00:07:07.909> that<00:07:08.180> automatically

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:08.930 
game engine does that automatically

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.980 
game engine does that automatically
because<00:07:09.650> it's<00:07:09.860> named<00:07:10.159> left<00:07:10.490> aileron<00:07:10.780> now<00:07:11.780> what

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:11.990 
because it's named left aileron now what

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.360 
because it's named left aileron now what
you'll<00:07:12.139> have<00:07:12.229> to<00:07:12.289> look<00:07:12.530> up<00:07:12.650> of<00:07:12.860> course<00:07:13.069> is<00:07:13.250> the

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.370 
you'll have to look up of course is the

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.189 
you'll have to look up of course is the
documentation<00:07:14.150> for<00:07:14.300> the<00:07:14.360> particular<00:07:14.690> game

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 
documentation for the particular game

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:17.740 
documentation for the particular game
that<00:07:15.469> you're<00:07:15.590> using<00:07:16.030> in<00:07:17.030> the<00:07:17.180> case<00:07:17.360> of<00:07:17.389> strike

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:17.750 
that you're using in the case of strike

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.820 
that you're using in the case of strike
fighters<00:07:18.199> there's<00:07:18.440> some<00:07:18.620> fairly<00:07:19.580> decent

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:20.830 
fighters there's some fairly decent

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.559 
fighters there's some fairly decent
tutorials<00:07:21.830> or<00:07:22.090> explanations<00:07:23.090> out<00:07:23.270> there<00:07:23.479> on

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:23.569 
tutorials or explanations out there on

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:25.779 
tutorials or explanations out there on
how<00:07:23.719> it<00:07:23.900> does<00:07:24.080> that<00:07:24.139> and<00:07:24.379> how<00:07:24.680> it's<00:07:25.159> named<00:07:25.430> and

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:25.789 
how it does that and how it's named and

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:28.899 
how it does that and how it's named and
that<00:07:26.180> actually<00:07:26.539> does<00:07:26.690> come<00:07:26.990> with<00:07:27.199> the<00:07:27.909> the

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:28.909 
that actually does come with the the

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:31.360 
that actually does come with the the
documentation<00:07:29.569> that<00:07:29.599> comes<00:07:29.900> with<00:07:30.169> the<00:07:30.370> the

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:31.370 
documentation that comes with the the

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.149 
documentation that comes with the the
exporter<00:07:31.940> so<00:07:32.930> that's<00:07:33.110> basically<00:07:33.259> another

00:07:34.149 --> 00:07:34.159 
exporter so that's basically another

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:35.649 
exporter so that's basically another
example<00:07:34.580> the<00:07:34.880> same<00:07:35.029> thing<00:07:35.240> of<00:07:35.330> course<00:07:35.509> with

00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:35.659 
example the same thing of course with

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:38.620 
example the same thing of course with
their<00:07:35.960> with<00:07:36.590> our<00:07:36.770> rudder<00:07:37.009> and<00:07:37.479> with<00:07:38.479> our

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:38.630 
their with our rudder and with our

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.330 
their with our rudder and with our
elevators<00:07:39.110> as<00:07:39.289> well<00:07:39.500> as<00:07:39.740> you<00:07:39.860> can<00:07:39.979> see<00:07:40.039> they

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:40.340 
elevators as well as you can see they

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.309 
elevators as well as you can see they
rotate<00:07:40.669> them<00:07:41.060> so<00:07:41.630> that's<00:07:41.810> the<00:07:41.930> other<00:07:42.080> type<00:07:42.289> of

00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:42.319 
rotate them so that's the other type of

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:44.529 
rotate them so that's the other type of
animation<00:07:42.909> unfortunate<00:07:43.909> is<00:07:44.000> not<00:07:44.120> a<00:07:44.150> lot<00:07:44.300> i<00:07:44.330> can

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:44.539 
animation unfortunate is not a lot i can

00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:46.180 
animation unfortunate is not a lot i can
tell<00:07:44.690> you<00:07:44.810> because<00:07:44.930> i'm<00:07:45.529> trying<00:07:45.770> to<00:07:45.860> keep<00:07:46.009> this

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:46.190 
tell you because i'm trying to keep this

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.939 
tell you because i'm trying to keep this
game<00:07:46.520> on<00:07:46.759> specific<00:07:47.469> maybe<00:07:48.469> i'll<00:07:48.650> create

00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:48.949 
game on specific maybe i'll create

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:50.890 
game on specific maybe i'll create
another<00:07:49.279> tutorial<00:07:49.729> in<00:07:50.000> the<00:07:50.090> future<00:07:50.449> for<00:07:50.690> maybe

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:50.900 
another tutorial in the future for maybe

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.459
