one<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.030> originally<00:00:15.330> had<00:00:15.830> had<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.859> little<00:00:17.100> bit<00:00:17.310> of

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
one I originally had had a little bit of

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.599 
one I originally had had a little bit of
up<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.789> down<00:00:18.289> slip<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.650> what<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:19.920> mean<00:00:20.010> by<00:00:20.160> slip

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
up and down slip and what I mean by slip

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.470 
up and down slip and what I mean by slip
is<00:00:20.960> when<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.080> would<00:00:22.260> put<00:00:22.730> negative<00:00:23.730> force<00:00:24.150> on

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
is when you would put negative force on

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.230 
is when you would put negative force on
the<00:00:24.810> blade<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.619> way<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.550> lock<00:00:26.760> bar<00:00:27.029> would

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
the blade this way the lock bar would

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.859 
the blade this way the lock bar would
slightly<00:00:27.599> move<00:00:28.320> out<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.650> place<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.220> wasn't

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
slightly move out of place it wasn't

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.610 
slightly move out of place it wasn't
extreme<00:00:30.980> but<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.070> was<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.910> was<00:00:33.120> there<00:00:33.590> so<00:00:34.590> i

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
know I just thought maybe they'd have

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.560 
know I just thought maybe they'd have
some<00:00:48.930> tips<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.500> bending<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> lock<00:00:50.760> bar<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.239> or

scheme from back in the 90s which you

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.969 
scheme from back in the 90s which you
know<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> 90s<00:02:06.540> kid<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.259> think<00:02:07.500> that's<00:02:07.740> cool

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
know on a 90s kid so I think that's cool

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.120 
know on a 90s kid so I think that's cool
but<00:02:08.640> yeah<00:02:09.569> got<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.890> new<00:02:11.129> knife<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.910> the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
but yeah got the new knife in and the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.180 
but yeah got the new knife in and the
is<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.760> completely<00:02:13.420> different<00:02:13.930> knife<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.440> know

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
is a completely different knife I know

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.610 
is a completely different knife I know
that<00:02:15.730> because<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.840> one<00:02:16.990> I<00:02:17.020> had<00:02:17.290> originally

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
that because the one I had originally

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.750 
that because the one I had originally
had<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:19.450> know<00:02:19.540> some<00:02:19.780> specific<00:02:20.670> kind<00:02:21.670> of

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
had you know some specific kind of

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.120 
had you know some specific kind of
patterning<00:02:22.540> on<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.800> front<00:02:24.430> scale<00:02:25.710> that<00:02:26.710> I<00:02:26.770> see

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
patterning on the front scale that I see

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.430 
patterning on the front scale that I see
is<00:02:27.430> not<00:02:27.700> there<00:02:27.970> anymore<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:28.570> yeah<00:02:29.110> they<00:02:29.260> sent

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
is not there anymore so yeah they sent

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.180 
is not there anymore so yeah they sent
me<00:02:29.560> a<00:02:29.620> whole<00:02:29.890> new<00:02:29.920> knife<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:32.190> rock

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
me a whole new knife and it is rock

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.060 
me a whole new knife and it is rock
solid<00:02:33.430> bank<00:02:33.910> vault<00:02:34.180> rock<00:02:34.930> solid<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:35.650> every

solid bank vault rock solid in every

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.150 
solid bank vault rock solid in every
which<00:02:36.280> way<00:02:36.420> every<00:02:37.420> direction<00:02:37.770> you<00:02:38.770> know<00:02:38.920> just

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
which way every direction you know just

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.360 
which way every direction you know just
like<00:02:39.340> all<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.580> other<00:02:39.820> is<00:02:40.000> perfectly<00:02:40.450> centered

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
like all the other is perfectly centered

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.940 
like all the other is perfectly centered
smooth<00:02:42.370> on<00:02:42.610> that<00:02:42.790> barring<00:02:43.560> some<00:02:44.560> other<00:02:44.710> people

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
smooth on that barring some other people

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.820 
smooth on that barring some other people
have<00:02:44.980> noted<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.670> some<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.120> their<00:02:46.240> older<00:02:46.830> saw

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
have noted that some of their older saw

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.650 
have noted that some of their older saw
tues<00:02:48.070> because<00:02:48.430> they<00:02:48.640> run<00:02:48.940> on<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:49.210> bushing

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
tues because they run on a bushing

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.720 
tues because they run on a bushing
system<00:02:50.080> kind<00:02:50.320> of<00:02:50.410> like<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.560> sebenza<00:02:50.950> which

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
system kind of like a sebenza which

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.360 
system kind of like a sebenza which
makes<00:02:52.000> it<00:02:52.120> for<00:02:52.360> a<00:02:52.390> very<00:02:53.260> smooth<00:02:53.890> operating

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
makes it for a very smooth operating

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.120 
makes it for a very smooth operating
knife<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:55.660> know<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:55.840> can<00:02:56.110> flick<00:02:56.470> these<00:02:56.710> open

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
knife you know you can flick these open

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.550 
knife you know you can flick these open
this<00:02:57.550> one<00:02:57.700> isn't<00:02:58.000> broken<00:02:58.180> in<00:02:58.390> yet<00:02:58.570> I<00:02:58.780> just<00:02:59.260> got

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
this one isn't broken in yet I just got

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.880 
this one isn't broken in yet I just got
it<00:02:59.770> but<00:03:00.690> one<00:03:01.690> of<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:01.840> problems<00:03:02.230> was<00:03:02.410> the

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
it but one of the problems was the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.220 
it but one of the problems was the
either<00:03:03.310> on<00:03:03.790> however<00:03:04.390> you<00:03:04.480> want<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:04.690> look<00:03:04.750> at<00:03:05.080> it

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
either on however you want to look at it

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.410 
either on however you want to look at it
that<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.680> bushing<00:03:06.160> was<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.340> little<00:03:06.670> too<00:03:06.880> slim

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
that the bushing was a little too slim

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.860 
that the bushing was a little too slim
or<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.940> washers<00:03:09.940> were<00:03:10.210> not<00:03:10.360> quite<00:03:10.570> thick

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
or the washers were not quite thick

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.660 
or the washers were not quite thick
enough<00:03:11.110> but<00:03:11.350> you'd<00:03:11.470> get<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.740> little<00:03:12.490> bit<00:03:12.640> of

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
enough but you'd get a little bit of

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
enough but you'd get a little bit of
side<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.210> side<00:03:13.450> play<00:03:14.440> on<00:03:14.740> some<00:03:14.980> of<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.190> older

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
side to side play on some of the older

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.990 
side to side play on some of the older
saw<00:03:16.690> twos<00:03:16.960> and<00:03:17.260> it<00:03:17.440> was<00:03:17.830> very<00:03:18.070> very<00:03:18.280> minor<00:03:18.700> and

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
saw twos and it was very very minor and

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.790 
saw twos and it was very very minor and
there's<00:03:19.120> just<00:03:19.210> do<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.690> those<00:03:20.110> pieces<00:03:20.440> not

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
there's just do to those pieces not

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.040 
there's just do to those pieces not
perfectly<00:03:21.700> because<00:03:22.450> if<00:03:22.570> you're<00:03:22.690> going<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:22.870> do

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
perfectly because if you're going to do

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.640 
perfectly because if you're going to do
a<00:03:23.490> bushing<00:03:24.490> and<00:03:25.120> not<00:03:25.690> have<00:03:25.930> any<00:03:26.140> play<00:03:26.410> at<00:03:26.530> all

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
a bushing and not have any play at all

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.510 
a bushing and not have any play at all
it<00:03:26.950> has<00:03:27.250> got<00:03:27.550> to<00:03:27.790> be<00:03:27.820> microscopically<00:03:29.520> perfect

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
it has got to be microscopically perfect

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.730 
it has got to be microscopically perfect
in<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.940> widths<00:03:31.360> of<00:03:31.360> all<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.690> components<00:03:31.960> or

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
in the widths of all the components or

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.040 
in the widths of all the components or
else<00:03:33.100> you'll<00:03:33.520> get<00:03:33.700> a<00:03:33.730> little<00:03:33.910> bit<00:03:34.090> of<00:03:34.120> play<00:03:34.360> so

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
else you'll get a little bit of play so

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.250 
else you'll get a little bit of play so
some<00:03:35.230> people<00:03:35.530> would<00:03:35.620> take<00:03:35.800> the<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.840> the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
some people would take the the the

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.520 
some people would take the the the
bushing<00:03:38.710> and<00:03:39.390> run<00:03:40.390> it<00:03:40.510> on<00:03:40.600> some<00:03:40.780> sandpaper<00:03:41.200> for

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
bushing and run it on some sandpaper for

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.810 
bushing and run it on some sandpaper for
a<00:03:41.560> second<00:03:41.950> to<00:03:42.040> kind<00:03:42.160> of<00:03:42.310> shrink<00:03:42.459> it<00:03:42.640> down<00:03:42.670> a

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
a second to kind of shrink it down a

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.730 
a second to kind of shrink it down a
little<00:03:43.060> bit<00:03:43.240> to<00:03:43.390> get<00:03:43.480> rid<00:03:43.720> of<00:03:43.750> it<00:03:43.870> never<00:03:44.500> really

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
little bit to get rid of it never really

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.890 
little bit to get rid of it never really
bothered<00:03:44.860> me<00:03:45.070> but<00:03:46.000> anyways<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.480> point<00:03:46.510> of

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
bothered me but anyways the point of

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.840 
bothered me but anyways the point of
that<00:03:47.080> long<00:03:47.350> drawn<00:03:47.740> out<00:03:47.890> story<00:03:48.100> is<00:03:48.550> that<00:03:48.580> they

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
that long drawn out story is that they

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.690 
that long drawn out story is that they
appear<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:50.050> have<00:03:50.380> changed<00:03:50.980> something<00:03:51.160> because

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
appear to have changed something because

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.570 
appear to have changed something because
there<00:03:52.390> is<00:03:52.540> not<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:53.560> slightest<00:03:53.950> bit<00:03:54.070> of<00:03:54.310> wiggle

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
there is not the slightest bit of wiggle

there is not the slightest bit of wiggle
