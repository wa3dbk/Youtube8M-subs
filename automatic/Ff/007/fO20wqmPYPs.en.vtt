00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
where you know you're going to need to

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.880

fight<00:01:08.820> you're<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.510> need<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.890> get

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
fight you're going to need to get

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.200

through<00:01:11.070> some<00:01:11.280> adversity<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.970> think

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
through some adversity and I think

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.120 
through some adversity and I think
according<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.200> what<00:01:13.350> Coach<00:01:13.530> Saban<00:01:13.710> said<00:01:14.040> he

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
according to what Coach Saban said he

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.249 
according to what Coach Saban said he
expected<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.939> period<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.810> camp<00:01:16.049> what

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
expected that this period in camp what

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.870 
expected that this period in camp what
he<00:01:16.350> called<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> dog<00:01:16.830> days<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.340> camp<00:01:17.610> would

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
he called the dog days of camp would

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.060 
he called the dog days of camp would
certainly<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.869> beneficial<00:01:19.439> at<00:01:19.590> some<00:01:19.770> point

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
certainly be beneficial at some point

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.620 
certainly be beneficial at some point
during<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.400> season<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.850> again<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.479> where

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
they'll continue to rep everybody but

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.550 
they'll continue to rep everybody but
also<00:01:41.700> after<00:01:42.150> nine<00:01:42.299> days<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.290> scrimmage

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
also after nine days and a scrimmage

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.499 
also after nine days and a scrimmage
they're<00:01:44.250> probably<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.119> start<00:01:45.360> to

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
they're probably going to start to

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.450 
they're probably going to start to
narrow<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.899> down<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.170> little<00:01:46.380> bit<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.950> start<00:01:47.280> to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
narrow it down a little bit and start to

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.370 
narrow it down a little bit and start to
kind<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.119> get<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.360> little<00:01:48.630> bit<00:01:48.840> more<00:01:49.020> into<00:01:49.200> game

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
kind of get a little bit more into game

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.749 
kind of get a little bit more into game
mode<00:01:49.409> starting<00:01:49.979> next<00:01:50.100> week<00:01:50.310> yeah<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.610> think

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
mode starting next week yeah I think

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.280 
mode starting next week yeah I think
that's<00:01:51.060> why<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.450> really<00:01:51.840> important<00:01:52.259> for

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
that's why this is really important for

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.899 
that's why this is really important for
a<00:01:52.409> lot<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.710> younger<00:01:52.950> guys<00:01:53.040> because<00:01:53.700> now

media members but we will look at the
stats<00:02:24.769> one<00:02:25.519> thing<00:02:25.730> I'm<00:02:25.849> interested<00:02:25.879> in<00:02:26.390> is

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
stats one thing I'm interested in is

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.780 
stats one thing I'm interested in is
that<00:02:26.870> back<00:02:27.170> up<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.920> battle<00:02:28.220> for<00:02:28.310> it<00:02:28.370> back<00:02:28.580> up

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
that back up the battle for it back up

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.809 
that back up the battle for it back up
running<00:02:29.000> back<00:02:29.360> job<00:02:29.810> behind<00:02:30.050> TJ<00:02:30.739> oh<00:02:30.769> yeah<00:02:31.610> and<00:02:31.730> I

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
running back job behind TJ oh yeah and I

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.009 
running back job behind TJ oh yeah and I
think<00:02:31.880> right<00:02:32.209> now<00:02:32.420> when<00:02:32.599> you<00:02:32.690> look<00:02:32.810> at<00:02:32.989> it

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
think right now when you look at it

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.080 
think right now when you look at it
probably<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.739> number<00:02:33.980> two<00:02:34.160> guy<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.880> again

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
probably the number two guy and again

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.520 
probably the number two guy and again
this<00:02:35.239> is<00:02:35.390> just<00:02:35.540> me<00:02:35.810> i<00:02:35.840> would<00:02:36.230> think<00:02:36.410> that

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
this is just me i would think that

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.470 
this is just me i would think that
Kenyan<00:02:37.370> drakes<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.790> guy<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:37.970> keep<00:02:38.180> an<00:02:38.330> eye<00:02:38.450> on

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
Kenyan drakes the guy to keep an eye on

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.150 
Kenyan drakes the guy to keep an eye on
certainly<00:02:39.140> there's<00:02:39.349> other<00:02:39.560> guys<00:02:39.739> involved

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
certainly there's other guys involved

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.080 
certainly there's other guys involved
DeHart<00:02:40.870> Derrick<00:02:41.870> Henry<00:02:42.049> the<00:02:42.349> freshman<00:02:43.090> josten

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.490 
DeHart Derrick Henry the freshman josten
Fowler<00:02:44.299> will<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:44.780> know<00:02:44.870> he'll<00:02:45.019> certainly<00:02:45.230> get

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
Fowler will you know he'll certainly get

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.589 
Fowler will you know he'll certainly get
his<00:02:45.650> role<00:02:46.130> in<00:02:46.400> terms<00:02:46.670> of<00:02:46.880> you<00:02:47.269> know<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.390> few

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
his role in terms of you know a few

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.449 
his role in terms of you know a few
carries<00:02:47.959> here<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:48.319> there<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.709> also<00:02:48.860> line<00:02:49.310> up

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
carries here and there and also line up

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.759 
carries here and there and also line up
the<00:02:49.640> full-back<00:02:50.030> spot<00:02:50.060> at<00:02:50.569> h-back<00:02:50.720> so<00:02:51.290> his

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
the full-back spot at h-back so his

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.890 
the full-back spot at h-back so his
versatility<00:02:52.310> will<00:02:52.670> be<00:02:52.760> key<00:02:53.000> this<00:02:53.209> year<00:02:53.420> but<00:02:53.630> I

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
versatility will be key this year but I

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.089 
versatility will be key this year but I
think<00:02:53.959> that'll<00:02:54.349> be<00:02:54.440> something<00:02:54.680> that's<00:02:55.010> very

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
think that'll be something that's very

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.620 
think that'll be something that's very
interesting<00:02:55.400> watch<00:02:55.910> as<00:02:56.090> well<00:02:56.209> as<00:02:56.360> a<00:02:56.390> backup

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
interesting watch as well as a backup

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.470 
interesting watch as well as a backup
