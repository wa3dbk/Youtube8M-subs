00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
course it's obvious I'm talking about

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.590 
course it's obvious I'm talking about
stuff<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.489> have<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.730> earn<00:00:41.879> outside<00:00:42.480> of

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.770 
stuff that you have to earn outside of
your<00:00:42.719> normal<00:00:42.840> class<00:00:43.230> now<00:00:44.059> with<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.210> raid<00:00:45.420> gear

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
your normal class now with the raid gear

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.690 
your normal class now with the raid gear
most<00:00:46.170> likely<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.739> going<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.010> be<00:00:47.100> sold<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
most likely it's going to be sold in the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.959 
most likely it's going to be sold in the
same<00:00:47.940> place<00:00:48.180> at<00:00:48.570> our<00:00:48.780> I'm<00:00:49.789> apparently<00:00:50.789> it's

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
same place at our I'm apparently it's

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.790 
same place at our I'm apparently it's
purple<00:00:51.420> now<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.899> i<00:00:51.930> guess<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.350> going<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.649> be

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
purple now so i guess is going to be

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.979 
purple now so i guess is going to be
similarities<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.879> legendary<00:00:54.449> gear<00:00:54.870> in
