00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.540 

so<00:00:01.979> first<00:00:02.580> you<00:00:02.939> fry

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:05.550 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:15.310 

chicken<00:00:07.010> until<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.550> oil<00:00:10.370> become<00:00:11.370> clear<00:00:11.790> when

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.400 

when<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.500> fry<00:00:17.310> meat<00:00:18.150> like<00:00:18.480> pork<00:00:18.540> or<00:00:19.230> chicken

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
when you fry meat like pork or chicken

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.880 
when you fry meat like pork or chicken
and<00:00:20.480> if<00:00:21.480> oil<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:22.169> not<00:00:22.410> clear<00:00:22.829> that<00:00:22.860> means<00:00:24.890> that

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
and if oil is not clear that means that

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.380 
and if oil is not clear that means that
that<00:00:26.099> smell<00:00:26.759> is<00:00:27.560> inside<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.980> oil<00:00:29.160> its<00:00:29.700> Liggett

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
that smell is inside the oil its Liggett

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.670 
that smell is inside the oil its Liggett
so<00:00:30.689> it's<00:00:30.840> not<00:00:30.960> clear<00:00:31.230> but<00:00:31.710> when<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.220> liket<00:00:33.680> all

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
so it's not clear but when the liket all

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.279 
so it's not clear but when the liket all
the<00:00:34.860> liquid<00:00:37.010> is<00:00:38.010> operate<00:00:38.519> then<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.989> oil

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
the liquid is operate then the oil

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:43.939 
the liquid is operate then the oil
doesn't<00:00:40.769> contain<00:00:41.190> liquid<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.780> oil<00:00:43.019> look

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
doesn't contain liquid so the oil look

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:45.200 
doesn't contain liquid so the oil look
clear

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
clear

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.099 
clear
so<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.780> fry<00:00:46.379> up<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> chicken<00:00:46.739> until<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.579> oil

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109 
so you fry up the chicken until the oil

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:54.990 
so you fry up the chicken until the oil
look<00:00:49.109> clear<00:00:49.859> and<00:00:50.160> then<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.239> put

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.360 

boil<00:00:55.629> our<00:00:56.530> data<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:58.329> then<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:01.809> put<00:01:02.370> Japanese

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
boil our data and then you put Japanese

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.040 
boil our data and then you put Japanese
sake

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:29.300 

about<00:01:08.050> this<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:27.090> when<00:01:28.090> you<00:01:28.120> use<00:01:28.420> frying<00:01:28.810> pan

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
about this and when you use frying pan

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:37.520 
about this and when you use frying pan
and<00:01:30.310> you<00:01:30.730> try<00:01:31.830> eat<00:01:33.540> duck<00:01:34.540> chicken<00:01:34.960> or<00:01:35.800> then

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
and you try eat duck chicken or then

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:46.020 
and you try eat duck chicken or then
then<00:01:38.530> this<00:01:40.380> next<00:01:41.380> thing<00:01:42.360> sneaked<00:01:43.360> into<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:45.030> to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
then this next thing sneaked into the to

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.130 
then this next thing sneaked into the to
the<00:01:46.590> pan<00:01:48.030> contains<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.180> lot<00:01:49.330> of<00:01:49.360> amino<00:01:49.810> acid

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
the pan contains a lot of amino acid

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.700 
the pan contains a lot of amino acid
which<00:01:50.590> is<00:01:51.300> source<00:01:52.300> of<00:01:52.800> umami

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
which is source of umami

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:06.840 
which is source of umami
so<00:02:00.869> diabete<00:02:01.869> which<00:02:02.200> does<00:02:02.910> definitely<00:02:05.850> tell

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
so diabete which does definitely tell

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.900 
so diabete which does definitely tell
that<00:02:06.940> a<00:02:07.470> final<00:02:08.470> food<00:02:09.300> contains<00:02:10.300> all<00:02:11.880> good

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
that a final food contains all good

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.229 
that a final food contains all good
Amina

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:34.470 

so<00:02:19.239> then<00:02:20.019> you<00:02:20.769> put<00:02:21.810> boiling<00:02:22.810> water<00:02:33.209> so<00:02:34.209> the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
so then you put boiling water so the

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.309 
so then you put boiling water so the
taro<00:02:35.190> potato<00:02:38.280> 80%<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.430> television<00:02:40.319> are

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
taro potato 80% of television are

00:02:41.319 --> 00:03:12.900 
taro potato 80% of television are
covered<00:02:41.890> by<00:02:42.299> water<00:03:07.379> and<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:10.140> do<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.290> for<00:03:11.910> 20

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
covered by water and you do it for 20

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.960 
covered by water and you do it for 20
minutes<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:15.870> that's<00:03:16.870> how<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.859> tip<00:03:18.069> how<00:03:18.940> to

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
minutes and that's how to tip how to

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:28.069 
minutes and that's how to tip how to
move<00:03:19.889> this<00:03:20.889> fish<00:03:22.319> I<00:03:25.319> personally<00:03:26.319> think<00:03:26.579> it's

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
move this fish I personally think it's

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:36.449 
move this fish I personally think it's
more<00:03:29.130> delicious<00:03:31.349> if<00:03:32.349> you<00:03:32.410> eat<00:03:34.829> cooled<00:03:35.829> one<00:03:36.130> you

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
more delicious if you eat cooled one you

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.360 
more delicious if you eat cooled one you
just<00:03:36.790> cooked<00:03:37.030> it<00:03:37.239> and<00:03:37.389> you<00:03:37.959> leave<00:03:38.200> it<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:38.560> you

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
just cooked it and you leave it and you

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.360 
just cooked it and you leave it and you
put<00:03:39.609> it<00:03:39.730> in<00:03:39.880> regenerator<00:03:40.690> or<00:03:41.500> two<00:03:42.190> or<00:03:42.340> three

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
put it in regenerator or two or three

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:50.009 
put it in regenerator or two or three
hours<00:03:42.849> and<00:03:43.090> then<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:44.650> tyro<00:03:45.660> potato<00:03:48.180> gets<00:03:49.180> the

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
hours and then the tyro potato gets the

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.819 
hours and then the tyro potato gets the
taste<00:03:50.319> and<00:03:50.739> to<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.849> to<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.299> inside<00:03:52.829> there

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
taste and to the to the inside there

00:03:53.829 --> 00:04:00.839 
taste and to the to the inside there
inside<00:03:53.980> so<00:03:57.000> it's<00:03:58.000> it's<00:03:58.389> delicious<00:03:59.489> when<00:04:00.489> hot

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
inside so it's it's delicious when hot

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:07.500 
inside so it's it's delicious when hot
as<00:04:01.359> well<00:04:01.690> but<00:04:01.989> I<00:04:02.200> think<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:05.530> cold<00:04:06.299> when<00:04:07.299> it's

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
as well but I think the cold when it's

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.990 
as well but I think the cold when it's
cool<00:04:08.169> this<00:04:08.700> refrigerator<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:10.690> tastes<00:04:11.319> even

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
cool this refrigerator it tastes even

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.900 
cool this refrigerator it tastes even
better<00:04:13.000> so
