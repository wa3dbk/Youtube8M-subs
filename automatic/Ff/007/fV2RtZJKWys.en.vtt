00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:09.080
 hello good afternoon let's proceed to 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.860
 assembly of a muscle pneumatic magazine 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.860
 in the components 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.100
 ok and down above we will explain all 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.870
 the components down on the tube of 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.119
 latex in the center and the fiber tube and 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.470
 video on the right and in the part 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.960
 left you see a muscle already with the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.060
 screw termination 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.369
 if we go up, we see the cone 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.980
 threaded the inner bell of the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.860
 the outer bell washer 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.219
 threaded stud metric hollow 6 la 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.199
 nozzle with its fast racÃ³ an asparagus 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.050
 metric thread 6 and the different 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:46.670
 accessories for the connection with the robot 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.890
 Now we can distinguish all 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.460
 components and we will proceed to 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.840
 mounting 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.510
 first we put the threaded cone that goes 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.750
 in with the widest part towards 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.750
 in 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.260
 we use the screw to push 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.729
 we take out the screw and put the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.729
 inner bell 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.240
 we push costs quite because latex 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.229
 slow down a lot 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.229
 now with the screw 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.970
 we look for it in the threaded cone and 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.970
 we stretch a bit to take it to the site 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.510
 now we push the fiberglass and 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.930
 we will prepare the assembly of the bell 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.930
 Exterior 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.189
 it costs a little bit of many threads 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.759
 push a little bit at a time and if any one 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.759
 complicated 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.399
 you use a tool like you can 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.399
 be a screwdriver 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:06.020
 to finish pushing 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.020
 the last ones and those that are left out 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.450
 I would already be 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.960
 now we see 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.510
 what 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.659
 put the washer 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.819
 we introduce the metric screw 6 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:30.110
 to make the extractor and be able to extract 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.110
 the inner cones 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.900
 by tightening the nut what we do is 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.900
 extract the cones 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.360
 now we take out the screw 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.610
 and they are already known traced and 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.910
 strong we put the washer 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.400
 and we put the hollow threaded stud 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.680
 genetic 6 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.689
 and they have half a nut and a couple of 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.689
 Toroidal joints is for every me 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.760
 that we squeeze a little 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.650
 now we put the mouthpiece 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.750
 which is nothing more than an action hexagon 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.220
 oxidizable that has a drill 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.770
 metric 6 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.260
 and on one of the faces lead to a record 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.260
 fast for air intake 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.140
 we squeeze a little 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.239
 and we're going to finish with a screw 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.430
 metric is with a nut instead of a 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:04.579
 fork or a ball joint of this screw 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.579
 we will do the strength tests 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.510
 we are a little nut 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.810
 and we would have in the air muscle 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.209
 finish 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.680
 to perform the tests that are already 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:20.989
 made in another video 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.989
 good greetings and even another
