00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
accurate this is like laser accuracy I

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.150 
accurate this is like laser accuracy I
mean<00:02:40.760> I<00:02:40.880> can<00:02:41.060> move<00:02:41.240> it<00:02:41.770> millimeters<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:43.010> it's

mean I can move it millimeters and it's
it's<00:02:43.810> immediate<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.020> it's<00:02:45.140> super<00:02:45.710> super

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
it's immediate and it's super super

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.680 
it's immediate and it's super super
accurate<00:02:49.630> let's<00:02:50.630> see<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:50.900> slowed<00:02:51.290> up<00:02:51.440> Batman

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
accurate let's see it slowed up Batman

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.820 
accurate let's see it slowed up Batman
so<00:02:53.690> what<00:02:53.840> you<00:02:53.930> do<00:02:54.080> is<00:02:54.110> that<00:02:54.290> you<00:02:54.350> push<00:02:54.620> this

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
so what you do is that you push this

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.949 
so what you do is that you push this
button<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.340> land<00:02:55.610> roid<00:02:55.790> button<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:56.570> kind<00:02:56.870> of

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
button the land roid button to kind of

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.590 
button the land roid button to kind of
turn<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.070> on<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.370> off<00:02:58.490> I<00:02:58.910> think<00:02:59.209> it<00:02:59.480> has<00:02:59.540> a

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
turn it on and off I think it has a
