like Maxine consistency of their
lipsticks<00:02:33.880> it's<00:02:34.120> it's<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:35.200> little<00:02:35.470> bit<00:02:35.590> like

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
lipsticks it's it's a little bit like

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.110 
lipsticks it's it's a little bit like
sheer<00:02:37.299> like<00:02:37.840> if<00:02:38.019> it<00:02:38.170> was<00:02:38.319> a<00:02:38.370> stain<00:02:39.370> kind<00:02:39.819> of<00:02:39.970> and

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
sheer like if it was a stain kind of and

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.370 
sheer like if it was a stain kind of and
then<00:02:40.690> eventually<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.440> petroleum<00:02:42.340> jelly

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
then eventually the petroleum jelly

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.780 
then eventually the petroleum jelly
absorbs<00:02:44.380> into<00:02:44.560> your<00:02:44.769> lips<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.190> then<00:02:45.640> you're

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
absorbs into your lips and then you're

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.580 
absorbs into your lips and then you're
left<00:02:46.000> with<00:02:46.209> this<00:02:46.299> really<00:02:46.540> pretty<00:02:46.660> deposit<00:02:47.500> of

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
left with this really pretty deposit of

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.460 
left with this really pretty deposit of
color<00:02:48.060> income<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.480> see<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:49.870> in<00:02:49.989> comparison

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
color income you see that in comparison

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.870 
color income you see that in comparison
to<00:02:50.680> that<00:02:50.799> it's<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:53.340> little<00:02:54.340> trick<00:02:54.579> with<00:02:54.760> the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
to that it's the little trick with the

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.710 
to that it's the little trick with the
petroleum<00:02:55.329> jelly

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
petroleum jelly

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.930 
petroleum jelly
it's<00:02:55.870> very<00:02:56.319> toned<00:02:56.650> down<00:02:56.709> and<00:02:57.489> it<00:02:57.670> makes<00:02:57.819> it

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
it's very toned down and it makes it

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.690 
it's very toned down and it makes it
easier<00:02:58.299> for<00:02:58.329> a<00:02:58.540> lot<00:02:58.720> of<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:59.019> wear<00:02:59.459> septic

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.450 

so<00:03:03.700> I'm<00:03:03.790> taking<00:03:03.940> this<00:03:04.239> off

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.920 

and<00:03:10.460> this<00:03:10.820> little<00:03:11.120> trick<00:03:11.330> kind<00:03:11.540> of<00:03:11.600> helps<00:03:11.870> you
