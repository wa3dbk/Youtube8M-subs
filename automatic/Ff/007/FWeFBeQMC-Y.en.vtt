00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.269
 Hello everyone today I want to share with 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.610
 you one interesting dish which for 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.219
 I became a discovery never knew what 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.609
 pig skin can either be used 1 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.170
 just recently saw the store 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.210
 which people dreamed very well 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.789
 withdraws from these rolls with pork 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.859
 skins skin like anything and click here 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.170
 let's try cooking start with what 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.750
 that is, the skin must be cut so that 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.649
 roll fit into my widest 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.120
 pan until this whole thing I will wash 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.290
 cook until broth should boil 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.180
 you need to lower the steering wheel only in hot 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.969
 the broth will then not be foam and everything will be 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.460
 better ready for that I will do there 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.789
 add salt and so seriously pretty 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.890
 two very large teaspoons of salt 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.300
 many will not be there threw a trap and 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.260
 pepper pepper now cast 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.170
 and put you did on fire on broth 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.750
 and set to boil the skin itself washed 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.240
 a little towel dry now 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.110
 it only remains to start cooking 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.189
 make salt but not easy salt 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.439
 very very very salt that is 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.009
 the first time i did i planted 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.470
 strong 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:28.110
 and so salty it was removed 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.450
 do our own strongly then again not 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.079
 sorry for the salt 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.079
 just wo n't go away 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.720
 next step we will have pepper all 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.140
 love pepper salad 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.140
 let's pepper 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.509
 rather it is a mixture of peppers 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.259
 I like precisely the mixture except black and 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:14.959
 fragrant white 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:18.620
 the most different is that everyone loves it 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.239
 garlic also do not regret him abel nenko 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.800
 let's all get this thing inside 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:31.040
 grease garlic and be able to be 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:35.930
 twist and tie distribute garlic 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.950
 and this thing is shortly folded later 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.630
 we will be all threads to tie 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.230
 You can simply toothpicks chain but 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:49.519
 seems to me if you tie a stronger 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.620
 the effect will be higher now not spouse 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.120
 will help this thing tie wait when 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.690
 water boils to this thing there 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.230
 put while boiling water I managed 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.870
 prepare still small steer with scraps 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.040
 Now I will do including 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:11.720
 boil now this thing is immersed and 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:14.000
 forget for two hours it's done already 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.410
 1:45 left 15 minutes before 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.769
 how to understand now i will add liquid 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.739
 smoke someone adds onion peel 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:27.260
 to give the appearance of smoked meat but for me 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.420
 so better liquid smoke and will taste 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.200
 smoked 2 tablespoons I think 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.200
 should be enough 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.750
 Rolls especially carefully need to shift 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.209
 why bake neat because 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:50.319
 they are now completely collapsed 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:50.319
 very soft especially soft 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:16.170
 try so hard 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.330
 have let cool to room 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:39.319
 temperature at night will send this to 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.669
 Tomorrow's refrigerator will be tasting 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:49.409
 the roll of the fridge is completely cold 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:52.919
 let's see what happened like this 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:55.039
 this whole thing looks like now try on 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.039
 taste 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.039
 scattered 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.960
 pleasant snack spice felt 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:25.860
 slightly insufficient salting them had yet 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:28.590
 a little more to put what looks like 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.139
 a bit like buying here 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:35.050
 some notes from aspic barely there 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.560
 well, so basically it's an owl delicious 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.409
 spicy 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.680
 very nice, much more ate 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:44.800
 I can definitely say positively 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.389
 really like grass snack 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.270
 add a wide variety of someone 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:51.190
 get out the role it adds vegetables should 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.979
 get even more interesting so 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.979
 try experimenting before communication
