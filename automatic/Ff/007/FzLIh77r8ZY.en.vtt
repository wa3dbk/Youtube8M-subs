here kids sizes they're about the same
price<00:02:23.049> i<00:02:23.319> thought<00:02:23.469> they<00:02:23.560> would<00:02:23.680> be<00:02:23.769> a<00:02:23.799> little

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
price i thought they would be a little

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.050 
price i thought they would be a little
cheaper<00:02:24.219> i<00:02:24.400> think<00:02:24.670> they're<00:02:24.790> just<00:02:24.819> like<00:02:25.030> a

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
cheaper i think they're just like a

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.539 
cheaper i think they're just like a
dollar<00:02:25.299> less<00:02:25.540> or<00:02:25.780> something<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:27.310> if<00:02:27.430> you're

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
dollar less or something so if you're
