oh<00:00:00.819> this<00:00:01.819> is<00:00:02.030> a<00:00:02.060> campfire<00:00:02.659> PBR<00:00:03.379> and<00:00:03.679> I<00:00:03.860> just

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:04.220 
oh this is a campfire PBR and I just

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.250 
oh this is a campfire PBR and I just
want<00:00:04.370> to<00:00:04.430> make<00:00:04.610> a<00:00:04.640> quick<00:00:05.000> video<00:00:05.150> about<00:00:05.390> the

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:06.260 
want to make a quick video about the

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.289 
want to make a quick video about the
dual<00:00:06.440> watch<00:00:06.680> function<00:00:07.280> on<00:00:07.400> this<00:00:07.520> radio<00:00:07.940> as

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:08.299 
dual watch function on this radio as

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:10.949 
dual watch function on this radio as
well<00:00:08.959> as<00:00:09.200> the<00:00:09.469> monitor<00:00:09.799> switch<00:00:10.339> on<00:00:10.549> the<00:00:10.639> side

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:10.959 
well as the monitor switch on the side

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:13.619 
well as the monitor switch on the side
so<00:00:11.959> I'll<00:00:12.079> start<00:00:12.320> with<00:00:12.410> the<00:00:12.619> dual<00:00:12.980> watch<00:00:13.159> and

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:13.629 
so I'll start with the dual watch and

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:15.699 
so I'll start with the dual watch and
basically<00:00:14.629> what<00:00:15.049> you're<00:00:15.259> going<00:00:15.349> to<00:00:15.440> do<00:00:15.559> to

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:15.709 
basically what you're going to do to

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:21.190 
basically what you're going to do to
turn<00:00:15.949> on<00:00:16.070> dual<00:00:16.340> watch<00:00:16.610> is<00:00:17.590> hit<00:00:18.590> menu<00:00:19.180> seven<00:00:20.200> and

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
turn on dual watch is hit menu seven and

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.140 
turn on dual watch is hit menu seven and
menu<00:00:21.590> again<00:00:21.860> they're<00:00:22.130> gonna<00:00:22.250> you're<00:00:23.090> gonna

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
menu again they're gonna you're gonna

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.110 
menu again they're gonna you're gonna
choose<00:00:23.660> on<00:00:23.930> or<00:00:24.110> off<00:00:24.230> hit<00:00:24.980> menu<00:00:25.280> again<00:00:25.640> and<00:00:25.700> exit

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.120 
choose on or off hit menu again and exit

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.120 
choose on or off hit menu again and exit
basically<00:00:29.120> what<00:00:29.420> dual<00:00:29.750> do<00:00:30.140> watch<00:00:30.350> is<00:00:30.560> not<00:00:30.740> the

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
basically what dual do watch is not the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.030 
basically what dual do watch is not the
same<00:00:31.370> as<00:00:31.550> dual<00:00:31.760> receive<00:00:32.320> but<00:00:33.320> what<00:00:33.530> it<00:00:33.650> will<00:00:33.770> do

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
same as dual receive but what it will do

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.580 
same as dual receive but what it will do
is<00:00:34.340> it<00:00:34.520> will<00:00:34.640> switch<00:00:35.030> between<00:00:35.329> your<00:00:35.690> a<00:00:35.930> and<00:00:36.410> B

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
is it will switch between your a and B

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.030 
is it will switch between your a and B
frequency<00:00:37.360> so<00:00:38.560> let's<00:00:39.560> say<00:00:39.680> you<00:00:39.739> have<00:00:39.860> two

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
frequency so let's say you have two

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.440 
frequency so let's say you have two
different<00:00:40.190> channels<00:00:40.760> on<00:00:40.910> and<00:00:41.120> you<00:00:41.210> want<00:00:41.329> to

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
different channels on and you want to

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.220 
different channels on and you want to
listen<00:00:41.600> to<00:00:41.840> both<00:00:42.790> when<00:00:43.790> one<00:00:44.180> channel<00:00:44.989> gets

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
listen to both when one channel gets

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.160 
listen to both when one channel gets
gets<00:00:45.920> a<00:00:46.040> signal<00:00:46.460> coming<00:00:47.000> in<00:00:47.239> it'll<00:00:47.630> switch<00:00:47.899> to

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
gets a signal coming in it'll switch to

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.050 
gets a signal coming in it'll switch to
that<00:00:48.290> channel<00:00:48.770> you'll<00:00:49.340> be<00:00:49.460> listening<00:00:49.640> to<00:00:49.940> that

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
that channel you'll be listening to that

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.569 
that channel you'll be listening to that
and<00:00:50.510> then<00:00:51.140> when<00:00:51.500> a<00:00:51.680> signal<00:00:52.040> comes<00:00:52.190> in<00:00:52.370> to<00:00:52.489> the

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
and then when a signal comes in to the

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.940 
and then when a signal comes in to the
other<00:00:52.700> one<00:00:52.940> it'll<00:00:53.270> switch<00:00:53.510> to<00:00:53.750> that<00:00:53.960> and<00:00:54.290> you

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
other one it'll switch to that and you

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.330 
other one it'll switch to that and you
can<00:00:54.980> listen<00:00:55.399> to<00:00:55.489> that<00:00:55.520> one<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:57.130> basically<00:00:58.130> to

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
can listen to that one so basically to

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.729 
can listen to that one so basically to
find<00:00:58.550> out<00:00:58.670> what<00:00:59.170> frequency<00:01:00.170> you're<00:01:00.350> on<00:01:00.469> the<00:01:00.710> a

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
find out what frequency you're on the a

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.680 
find out what frequency you're on the a
or<00:01:01.040> B<00:01:01.280> you're<00:01:01.969> going<00:01:02.090> to<00:01:02.149> look<00:01:02.239> off<00:01:02.420> to<00:01:02.450> the

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
or B you're going to look off to the

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.610 
or B you're going to look off to the
side<00:01:02.899> and<00:01:03.050> there's<00:01:03.200> going<00:01:03.290> to<00:01:03.350> be<00:01:03.410> a<00:01:03.500> little

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
side and there's going to be a little

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.210 
side and there's going to be a little
triangle<00:01:04.220> over<00:01:04.430> here<00:01:05.260> so<00:01:06.260> you<00:01:06.350> can<00:01:06.620> it<00:01:07.040> will<00:01:07.159> be

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
triangle over here so you can it will be

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.450 
triangle over here so you can it will be
pulsing<00:01:07.820> so<00:01:08.740> when<00:01:09.740> you<00:01:09.830> look<00:01:09.979> at<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.190> triangle

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
pulsing so when you look at the triangle

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.430 
pulsing so when you look at the triangle
the<00:01:10.820> triangle<00:01:11.120> that's<00:01:11.420> pulsing<00:01:11.990> is<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.290> one

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
the triangle that's pulsing is the one

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.219 
the triangle that's pulsing is the one
that<00:01:12.799> you're<00:01:13.010> on<00:01:13.190> so<00:01:14.030> keep<00:01:14.360> that<00:01:14.479> in<00:01:14.540> mind<00:01:14.630> like

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
that you're on so keep that in mind like

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.770 
that you're on so keep that in mind like
if<00:01:15.260> you<00:01:15.470> do<00:01:15.590> decide<00:01:15.830> to<00:01:15.890> transmit<00:01:16.640> that<00:01:17.570> you

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
if you do decide to transmit that you

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.149 
if you do decide to transmit that you
make<00:01:17.960> sure<00:01:18.140> you're<00:01:18.350> going<00:01:18.440> to<00:01:18.500> transmit<00:01:18.920> on

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
make sure you're going to transmit on

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.219 
make sure you're going to transmit on
the<00:01:19.280> right<00:01:19.430> frequency<00:01:20.119> and<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.110> frequency

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
the right frequency and the frequency

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:22.840 
the right frequency and the frequency
you're<00:01:21.770> going<00:01:21.890> to<00:01:21.950> transmit<00:01:22.310> on<00:01:22.430> is<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.729> one

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
you're going to transmit on is the one

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.760 
you're going to transmit on is the one
that's<00:01:23.030> flashing<00:01:23.450> or<00:01:24.020> that<00:01:24.320> had<00:01:24.500> been

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
that's flashing or that had been

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.840 
that's flashing or that had been
flashing<00:01:25.330> so<00:01:26.330> just<00:01:26.680> watch<00:01:27.680> out<00:01:27.890> for<00:01:27.920> that<00:01:28.070> can

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
flashing so just watch out for that can

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.539 
flashing so just watch out for that can
get<00:01:28.939> a<00:01:28.970> little<00:01:29.030> tricky<00:01:29.680> but<00:01:30.680> I'll<00:01:31.189> try<00:01:31.430> and

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
get a little tricky but I'll try and

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.390 
get a little tricky but I'll try and
demonstrate<00:01:31.729> it<00:01:32.210> with<00:01:32.360> a<00:01:32.390> f2<00:01:33.400> police

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
demonstrate it with a f2 police

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.359 
demonstrate it with a f2 police
frequency<00:01:35.240> set<00:01:35.510> on<00:01:35.659> here<00:01:35.930> so<00:01:36.920> I<00:01:36.979> can<00:01:37.100> just<00:01:37.280> show

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
frequency set on here so I can just show

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.450 
frequency set on here so I can just show
other<00:01:37.700> other<00:01:38.060> receiving<00:01:38.630> works<00:01:39.280> let's<00:01:40.280> see

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
other other receiving works let's see

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.980 
other other receiving works let's see
here<00:01:42.790> so<00:01:43.790> you<00:01:43.880> can<00:01:44.030> see<00:01:44.210> it's<00:01:44.540> on<00:01:44.689> the<00:01:44.780> top

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
here so you can see it's on the top

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.810 
here so you can see it's on the top
right<00:01:45.200> now<00:01:45.229> you<00:01:45.650> can<00:01:45.799> see<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.100> triangle<00:01:46.369> right

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
right now you can see the triangle right

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.250 
right now you can see the triangle right
here<00:01:48.610> so<00:01:49.610> it's<00:01:49.759> set<00:01:49.939> to<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.119> top

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.690 

wait<00:01:55.010> for<00:01:55.220> an<00:01:55.340> incoming<00:01:55.700> signal<00:01:57.460> okay<00:01:58.460> just

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
wait for an incoming signal okay just

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.530 
wait for an incoming signal okay just
switch<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.060> bottom

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
switch to the bottom

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.710 
switch to the bottom
oh<00:02:01.570> just<00:02:02.570> went<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:02.990> top<00:02:03.170> no<00:02:04.360> all<00:02:05.360> right<00:02:05.510> so

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
oh just went to the top no all right so

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:17.500 
oh just went to the top no all right so
it's<00:02:05.840> still<00:02:06.050> in<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.200> bottom<00:02:16.330> still<00:02:17.330> on<00:02:17.420> the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
it's still in the bottom still on the

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:34.540 
it's still in the bottom still on the
bottom<00:02:17.810> just<00:02:20.230> switch<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.440> top<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:34.280> now<00:02:34.310> it's

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
bottom just switch the top so now it's

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.190 
bottom just switch the top so now it's
on<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.700> top<00:02:34.970> frequency<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:37.900> it'll<00:02:38.900> just<00:02:39.080> be

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
on the top frequency and it'll just be

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.260 
on the top frequency and it'll just be
switching<00:02:39.590> between<00:02:39.710> both<00:02:40.100> of<00:02:40.130> them<00:02:40.370> on<00:02:41.120> the

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
switching between both of them on the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.210 
switching between both of them on the
police<00:02:41.510> frequencies<00:02:42.080> it's<00:02:42.560> kind<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:42.950> hard<00:02:43.130> to

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
police frequencies it's kind of hard to

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.210 
police frequencies it's kind of hard to
differentiate<00:02:44.210> between<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.930> two<00:02:45.140> they<00:02:46.010> sound

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
differentiate between the two they sound

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.490 
differentiate between the two they sound
very<00:02:46.310> similar<00:02:46.490> but<00:02:47.090> uh<00:02:47.230> if<00:02:48.230> you're<00:02:48.380> on<00:02:48.470> a

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
very similar but uh if you're on a

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.580 
very similar but uh if you're on a
amateur<00:02:49.250> radio<00:02:49.400> frequency<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:51.290> know<00:02:51.380> you're

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
amateur radio frequency you know you're

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.310 
amateur radio frequency you know you're
going<00:02:51.740> to<00:02:51.830> be<00:02:51.980> able<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.250> tell<00:02:52.540> what<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:54.290> know

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
going to be able to tell what you know

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.110 
going to be able to tell what you know
there's<00:02:54.650> different<00:02:55.280> frequencies<00:02:55.820> you<00:02:56.030> know

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
there's different frequencies you know

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.280 
there's different frequencies you know
they<00:02:56.270> might<00:02:56.420> be<00:02:56.540> talking<00:02:56.750> about<00:02:56.900> different

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
they might be talking about different

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.020 
they might be talking about different
topics<00:02:57.440> or<00:02:57.950> something<00:02:58.160> like<00:02:58.250> that<00:02:58.310> so<00:02:58.940> it'll

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
topics or something like that so it'll

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.600 
topics or something like that so it'll
be<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.209> lot<00:02:59.360> easier<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.780> to<00:03:00.709> hear<00:03:01.370> what<00:03:01.489> they're

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
be a lot easier to to hear what they're

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.290 
be a lot easier to to hear what they're
talking<00:03:01.940> about<00:03:02.350> okay<00:03:03.350> so<00:03:03.680> um<00:03:04.300> that's

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
talking about okay so um that's

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.900 
talking about okay so um that's
basically<00:03:05.840> all<00:03:05.959> I<00:03:06.320> had<00:03:06.770> to<00:03:06.920> say<00:03:06.950> about<00:03:07.130> dual

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
basically all I had to say about dual

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.780 
basically all I had to say about dual
watch<00:03:08.180> it's<00:03:08.989> pretty<00:03:09.410> simple<00:03:09.739> it's<00:03:10.489> a<00:03:10.640> nice

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
watch it's pretty simple it's a nice

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.000 
watch it's pretty simple it's a nice
feature<00:03:11.030> not<00:03:11.570> as<00:03:11.810> nice<00:03:12.230> as<00:03:12.260> door<00:03:12.650> receive

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
feature not as nice as door receive

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:20.410 
feature not as nice as door receive
obviously<00:03:13.760> but<00:03:15.610> it<00:03:16.610> works<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:19.030> this<00:03:20.030> radio<00:03:20.360> is

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
obviously but it works and this radio is

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.030 
obviously but it works and this radio is
a<00:03:20.450> lot<00:03:20.630> cheaper<00:03:20.660> than<00:03:21.019> indoor<00:03:21.410> receive<00:03:21.709> radio

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
a lot cheaper than indoor receive radio

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.110 
a lot cheaper than indoor receive radio
so<00:03:22.810> it's<00:03:23.810> definitely<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.380> good<00:03:25.190> option<00:03:25.610> for<00:03:25.910> a

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
so it's definitely a good option for a

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.430 
so it's definitely a good option for a
radio<00:03:26.330> this<00:03:26.660> cheap<00:03:27.430> and<00:03:29.080> so<00:03:30.080> now<00:03:30.230> I'll

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
radio this cheap and so now I'll

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.560 
radio this cheap and so now I'll
demonstrate<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:31.340> monitor<00:03:32.030> switch<00:03:32.269> real

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
demonstrate the monitor switch real

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.949 
demonstrate the monitor switch real
quick<00:03:33.489> it<00:03:34.489> has<00:03:34.910> a<00:03:34.940> pretty<00:03:35.180> cool<00:03:35.269> function<00:03:35.780> so

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
quick it has a pretty cool function so

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.620 
quick it has a pretty cool function so
I'll<00:03:36.110> switch<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.880> something<00:03:37.880> that's<00:03:38.120> clear

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
I'll switch to something that's clear

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.050 
I'll switch to something that's clear
okay<00:03:39.440> so<00:03:39.500> now<00:03:39.739> I'm<00:03:39.920> on<00:03:40.040> a<00:03:40.070> repeater<00:03:40.489> frequency

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
okay so now I'm on a repeater frequency

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.350 
okay so now I'm on a repeater frequency
and<00:03:42.340> basically<00:03:43.340> what<00:03:43.580> the<00:03:43.700> monitor<00:03:44.030> switch

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
and basically what the monitor switch

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.479 
and basically what the monitor switch
does<00:03:44.660> is<00:03:44.900> like<00:03:45.200> if<00:03:45.560> you<00:03:45.769> hit<00:03:45.920> this<00:03:46.070> button<00:03:46.340> on

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
does is like if you hit this button on

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.250 
does is like if you hit this button on
the<00:03:46.640> side<00:03:46.820> here's<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.090> monitor<00:03:47.510> switch<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:48.050> just

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
the side here's a monitor switch it just

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.690 
the side here's a monitor switch it just
says<00:03:48.410> MLA<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:49.400> i/o<00:03:50.709> is<00:03:51.709> people<00:03:52.010> talking

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.850 

No<00:03:55.730> okay<00:03:56.480> so<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:56.780> see<00:03:56.989> now<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:57.290> dole<00:03:57.680> watch

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
No okay so you see now and dole watch

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.470 
No okay so you see now and dole watch
again<00:03:58.190> and<00:03:58.430> it's<00:03:58.760> switch<00:03:58.970> down<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.209> that

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
again and it's switch down to that

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.220 
again and it's switch down to that
bottom<00:03:59.660> frequency<00:04:00.319> so<00:04:01.010> what<00:04:01.880> I<00:04:01.910> need<00:04:02.150> to<00:04:02.270> do<00:04:02.480> if

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
bottom frequency so what I need to do if

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.420 
bottom frequency so what I need to do if
I<00:04:03.380> just<00:04:03.560> want<00:04:03.709> to<00:04:03.800> listen<00:04:03.890> to<00:04:04.099> this<00:04:04.190> top

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
I just want to listen to this top

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.920 
I just want to listen to this top
frequency<00:04:04.970> is<00:04:05.030> I<00:04:05.180> need<00:04:05.330> to<00:04:05.360> turn<00:04:05.569> off<00:04:05.599> dual

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
frequency is I need to turn off dual

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.140 
frequency is I need to turn off dual
watch<00:04:06.200> by<00:04:06.920> going<00:04:07.390> menu<00:04:08.390> seven<00:04:09.489> menu<00:04:10.489> again<00:04:10.790> and

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
watch by going menu seven menu again and

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.270 
watch by going menu seven menu again and
then<00:04:11.300> hit<00:04:11.510> down<00:04:11.750> and<00:04:12.110> then<00:04:12.769> menu<00:04:13.099> again<00:04:13.630> exit

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
then hit down and then menu again exit

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.890 
then hit down and then menu again exit
then<00:04:16.280> I<00:04:16.310> can<00:04:16.430> switch<00:04:16.669> up<00:04:16.700> to<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.090> top<00:04:17.329> and

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
then I can switch up to the top and

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.629 
then I can switch up to the top and
there<00:04:18.019> we<00:04:18.139> are<00:04:18.169> we're<00:04:18.590> off<00:04:18.709> to<00:04:18.889> a<00:04:18.919> watch<00:04:19.130> so<00:04:19.430> no

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
there we are we're off to a watch so no

there we are we're off to a watch so no
I<00:04:19.669> not<00:04:19.880> too<00:04:20.030> worried<00:04:20.209> about<00:04:20.709> this<00:04:21.709> frequency

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
I not too worried about this frequency

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.159 
I not too worried about this frequency
down<00:04:22.730> here<00:04:23.000> which<00:04:23.300> is<00:04:23.480> a<00:04:23.510> police<00:04:23.960> frequency

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
down here which is a police frequency

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.580 
down here which is a police frequency
cutting<00:04:24.950> in<00:04:25.100> alright<00:04:25.970> so<00:04:26.720> back<00:04:26.990> to<00:04:27.050> the

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
cutting in alright so back to the

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.830 
cutting in alright so back to the
monitor<00:04:28.040> switch<00:04:28.340> just<00:04:28.700> as<00:04:28.880> MLA<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:29.419> I<00:04:29.540> down

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
monitor switch just as MLA and I down

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
monitor switch just as MLA and I down
here<00:04:30.190> if<00:04:31.190> you<00:04:31.280> press<00:04:31.550> it<00:04:31.729> once<00:04:32.860> flashlight
