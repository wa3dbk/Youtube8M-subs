00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
that the main reasons why I recommend

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.419 
that the main reasons why I recommend
this<00:02:08.750> product<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.380> almost<00:02:09.649> any<00:02:09.920> product

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
this product and almost any product

this product and almost any product
moulton<00:02:10.850> nutrition<00:02:11.360> of<00:02:11.420> a<00:02:11.510> big<00:02:11.720> fan<00:02:12.020> of<00:02:12.050> them

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
moulton nutrition of a big fan of them

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.920 
moulton nutrition of a big fan of them
so<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:14.000> second<00:02:14.270> thing<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.420> want<00:02:14.600> to<00:02:14.630> look<00:02:14.690> at

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
so the second thing you want to look at

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.990 
so the second thing you want to look at
obviously<00:02:15.470> is<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.770> protein<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.550> protein

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
obviously is the protein and the protein

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.410 
obviously is the protein and the protein
per<00:02:17.660> serving<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:18.380> on<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:19.070> food<00:02:19.880> label<00:02:19.910> here

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
per serving so on the food label here

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.350 
per serving so on the food label here
there's<00:02:21.050> 24<00:02:21.500> grams<00:02:21.740> of<00:02:21.920> protein<00:02:22.160> in<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:23.060> 30

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
there's 24 grams of protein in a 30

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.060 
there's 24 grams of protein in a 30
grand<00:02:23.660> scoop<00:02:24.080> now<00:02:24.350> you<00:02:24.410> see<00:02:24.709> my<00:02:24.830> other<00:02:24.950> videos

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
grand scoop now you see my other videos

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.300 
grand scoop now you see my other videos
such<00:02:25.730> as<00:02:25.760> like<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.060> syntha-6<00:02:26.590> or<00:02:27.590> I<00:02:27.620> just<00:02:27.980> did

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
such as like a syntha-6 or I just did

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.560 
such as like a syntha-6 or I just did
one<00:02:28.489> on<00:02:28.520> Ely<00:02:28.940> texty<00:02:29.510> from<00:02:30.470> dymatize<00:02:31.390> they<00:02:32.390> had

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
one on Ely texty from dymatize they had

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.990 
one on Ely texty from dymatize they had
a<00:02:32.600> little<00:02:32.959> bit<00:02:33.170> less<00:02:33.560> protein<00:02:33.920> per<00:02:34.370> scoop<00:02:34.700> like

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
a little bit less protein per scoop like

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.830 
a little bit less protein per scoop like
dymatize<00:02:35.630> emily<00:02:36.110> was<00:02:36.670> 22<00:02:37.670> grams<00:02:37.970> for<00:02:38.209> a<00:02:38.270> 36

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
dymatize emily was 22 grams for a 36

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.380 
dymatize emily was 22 grams for a 36
scoop<00:02:39.280> so<00:02:40.280> obviously<00:02:40.730> this<00:02:41.030> is<00:02:41.150> gonna<00:02:41.270> be<00:02:41.360> a

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
scoop so obviously this is gonna be a

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.760 
scoop so obviously this is gonna be a
little<00:02:41.630> better<00:02:41.810> value<00:02:42.290> when<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.530> talked

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
little better value when you talked

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.210 
little better value when you talked
about<00:02:42.800> 24<00:02:43.250> out<00:02:44.090> of<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.390> 30<00:02:44.660> grand<00:02:44.930> scoop<00:02:45.260> 24

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
about 24 out of the 30 grand scoop 24

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.430 
about 24 out of the 30 grand scoop 24
bits<00:02:46.459> getting<00:02:46.730> protein<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.480> they<00:02:47.900> also<00:02:48.110> have

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
bits getting protein and they also have

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.990 
bits getting protein and they also have
a<00:02:48.470> little<00:02:48.800> bit<00:02:48.920> of<00:02:48.950> fillers<00:02:49.370> not<00:02:49.640> as<00:02:49.760> much<00:02:49.940> as

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
a little bit of fillers not as much as

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.020 
a little bit of fillers not as much as
others<00:02:50.540> with<00:02:51.500> three<00:02:51.800> grams<00:02:52.070> of<00:02:52.280> carbohydrate

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
others with three grams of carbohydrate

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.199 
others with three grams of carbohydrate
and<00:02:53.270> one<00:02:54.110> gram<00:02:54.350> of<00:02:54.530> fat<00:02:54.890> so<00:02:55.060> what<00:02:56.060> you're

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
and one gram of fat so what you're

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.090 
and one gram of fat so what you're
probably<00:02:56.390> going<00:02:56.600> to<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.840> trade-off<00:02:57.290> is<00:02:57.560> most

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
probably going to the trade-off is most

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.440 
probably going to the trade-off is most
people<00:02:58.580> are<00:02:58.640> probably<00:02:58.820> going<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.180> say<00:02:59.299> this

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
people are probably going to say this

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.810 
people are probably going to say this
tastes<00:02:59.780> a<00:02:59.930> little<00:03:00.110> inferior<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:01.549> the<00:03:01.670> other

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
tastes a little inferior to the other

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.479 
tastes a little inferior to the other
products<00:03:02.450> again<00:03:02.690> taste<00:03:03.140> is<00:03:03.440> totally<00:03:04.220> up<00:03:04.340> in

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
products again taste is totally up in

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:05.979 
products again taste is totally up in
the<00:03:04.549> air<00:03:04.640> from<00:03:04.970> person<00:03:05.299> to<00:03:05.360> person<00:03:05.390> so<00:03:05.900> you

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
the air from person to person so you

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.850 
the air from person to person so you
can't<00:03:06.260> really<00:03:06.320> say<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:06.910> but<00:03:08.860> typically

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
can't really say that but typically

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.340 
can't really say that but typically
protein<00:03:10.760> powders<00:03:11.090> without<00:03:11.420> a<00:03:11.750> little<00:03:12.140> bit

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
to be a little just on average inferior

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.660 
to be a little just on average inferior
as<00:03:19.940> far<00:03:20.180> as<00:03:20.269> taste<00:03:20.570> goes<00:03:20.950> we're<00:03:21.950> taste<00:03:22.310> holes

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
blend of their sources of protein is

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.340 
blend of their sources of protein is
just<00:03:41.630> a<00:03:41.780> whey<00:03:41.989> protein<00:03:42.560> as<00:03:42.709> you<00:03:42.860> can<00:03:43.010> see

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
just a whey protein as you can see

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.040 
just a whey protein as you can see
here<00:03:43.590> just<00:03:43.800> pure<00:03:44.670> way<00:03:44.910> so<00:03:45.480> you<00:03:45.540> just<00:03:45.660> have<00:03:45.810> two

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
here just pure way so you just have two

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.170 
here just pure way so you just have two
forms<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.650> have<00:03:46.770> the<00:03:46.920> isolate<00:03:47.520> and<00:03:47.730> the

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
forms you have the isolate and the

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.930 
forms you have the isolate and the
concentrate<00:03:49.010> not<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.040> big<00:03:50.310> difference<00:03:50.730> there

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
concentrate not a big difference there

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.880 
concentrate not a big difference there
unless<00:03:51.570> maybe<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:52.020> have<00:03:52.170> some<00:03:52.380> problems<00:03:52.830> with
