test teaching to a test and and so a
couple<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:25.019> changes<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.439> want<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.680> make<00:00:25.830> number

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
couple of changes I want to make number

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.490 
couple of changes I want to make number
one<00:00:26.310> if<00:00:26.609> we're<00:00:27.570> going<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.779> have<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> test<00:00:28.289> have

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
one if we're going to have a test have

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.689 
one if we're going to have a test have
it<00:00:28.619> at<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.800> beginning<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> year<00:00:29.429> don't

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
it at the beginning of the year don't

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.060 
it at the beginning of the year don't
make<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.090> punishment<00:00:30.449> but<00:00:31.170> use<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.679> as<00:00:32.040> a

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
make it a punishment but use it as a

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.670 
make it a punishment but use it as a
tool<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.489> know<00:00:32.910> where<00:00:33.270> children<00:00:33.660> are<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.230> how

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
tool to know where children are and how

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.740 
tool to know where children are and how
they<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:34.890> improve<00:00:39.829> number<00:00:40.829> two<00:00:41.719> number<00:00:42.719> two

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
they can improve number two number two

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.049 
they can improve number two number two
if<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.350> child<00:00:43.710> comes<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.670> they're<00:00:44.850> two

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
if a child comes in and they're two

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.970 
grades behind and at the end of the year
there<00:00:48.239> are<00:00:48.270> only<00:00:48.629> one<00:00:48.960> year<00:00:49.110> behind<00:00:49.320> that

there are only one year behind that
schools<00:00:50.340> done<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.550> good<00:00:50.730> job<00:00:50.989> but<00:00:52.100> right<00:00:53.100> now

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
schools done a good job but right now

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.619 
schools done a good job but right now
the<00:00:53.309> way<00:00:53.550> No<00:00:53.730> Child<00:00:53.910> Left<00:00:54.059> Behind<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.570> a

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the way No Child Left Behind is a

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.830 
the way No Child Left Behind is a
structure<00:00:55.370> that<00:00:56.370> school<00:00:57.270> would<00:00:57.420> be<00:00:57.449> deemed<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
structure that school would be deemed a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.569 
structure that school would be deemed a
failure<00:00:57.870> now<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.890> doesn't<00:00:59.070> make<00:00:59.219> sense<00:00:59.280> so

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
failure now that doesn't make sense so

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.279 
failure now that doesn't make sense so
you<00:00:59.670> got<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.879> track<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.270> growth<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.750> progress

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
you got to track the growth the progress

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.049 
you got to track the growth the progress
that<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.590> child<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.949> making<00:01:02.370> during<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
that that child is making during the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.800 
that that child is making during the
course<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.570> year<00:01:05.030> number<00:01:06.030> three<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
course of the year number three the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.810 
course of the year number three the
reason<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.320> don't<00:01:07.380> want<00:01:07.770> people<00:01:08.310> teaching<00:01:08.549> to

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
reason I don't want people teaching to

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.170 
reason I don't want people teaching to
the<00:01:08.850> test<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.450> because<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:11.180> uninspiring

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
the test is because it is uninspiring

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.600 
the test is because it is uninspiring
for<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> teacher<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.280> uninspiring<00:01:14.280> for<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
for the teacher and uninspiring for the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.609 
for the teacher and uninspiring for the
student<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.180> since<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.990> only<00:01:16.229> thing<00:01:16.439> that's

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
student and since the only thing that's

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.039 
student and since the only thing that's
being<00:01:16.799> tested<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.430> math<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.970> reading<00:01:18.420> it

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
being tested is math and reading it

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.420 
being tested is math and reading it
means<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.470> we're<00:01:20.220> not<00:01:20.340> teaching<00:01:20.869> children<00:01:21.869> a

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
means that we're not teaching children a

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.100 
means that we're not teaching children a
broad<00:01:23.430> range<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.180> thing<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.509> want<00:01:24.720> kids<00:01:24.930> to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
broad range of thing I want kids to

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.770 
broad range of thing I want kids to
learn<00:01:25.350> art<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.920> music<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.850> history<00:01:27.270> and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
learn art and music and history and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.800

civics
and<00:01:29.930> a<00:01:30.140> whole<00:01:30.380> host<00:01:30.649> of<00:01:31.450> other<00:01:32.450> things<00:01:35.619> because

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
and a whole host of other things because

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.609 
and a whole host of other things because
we<00:01:36.890> know<00:01:37.130> we<00:01:37.759> know<00:01:37.939> that<00:01:38.240> children<00:01:38.450> who<00:01:39.079> do

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
we know we know that children who do

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.859 
we know we know that children who do
well<00:01:39.829> in<00:01:39.979> music<00:01:40.369> that<00:01:41.180> actually<00:01:41.570> improves

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
well in music that actually improves

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.139 
well in music that actually improves
their<00:01:42.020> math<00:01:42.200> scores<00:01:42.729> we<00:01:43.729> know<00:01:43.880> that<00:01:44.119> children

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
their math scores we know that children

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.109 
their math scores we know that children
who<00:01:44.689> get<00:01:44.869> physical<00:01:45.409> education<00:01:45.970> actually<00:01:46.970> are

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
who get physical education actually are

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.679 
who get physical education actually are
better<00:01:47.360> focused<00:01:47.990> in<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.590> classroom<00:01:49.240> so<00:01:50.240> so

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
better focused in the classroom so so

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.330 
better focused in the classroom so so
that's<00:01:50.869> what<00:01:51.049> so<00:01:51.289> that's<00:01:51.409> changing<00:01:52.009> No<00:01:52.159> Child

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
that's what so that's changing No Child

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.639 
that's what so that's changing No Child
Left<00:01:52.520> Behind<00:01:52.670> I<00:01:53.060> want<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.630> pay<00:01:54.110> our<00:01:54.409> teachers

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
Left Behind I want to pay our teachers

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:02.830 
Left Behind I want to pay our teachers
more

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840
