you actually do your initial glue up and
fitment<00:00:20.050> we've<00:00:21.050> painted<00:00:21.380> the<00:00:21.560> inside<00:00:22.210> of<00:00:23.210> one

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
fitment we've painted the inside of one

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.040 
fitment we've painted the inside of one
of<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:24.290> tank<00:00:25.190> shrouds<00:00:25.640> yellow<00:00:26.510> so<00:00:26.750> you<00:00:26.780> can

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
of the tank shrouds yellow so you can

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.740 
of the tank shrouds yellow so you can
see<00:00:27.410> where<00:00:28.220> to<00:00:28.250> actually<00:00:28.700> put<00:00:29.120> the<00:00:29.210> glue<00:00:29.420> but

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
see where to actually put the glue but

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.200 
see where to actually put the glue but
if<00:00:30.320> you<00:00:30.500> look<00:00:30.680> closely<00:00:30.980> on<00:00:31.220> each<00:00:31.580> mold<00:00:31.940> that

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
if you look closely on each mold that

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.200 
if you look closely on each mold that
you<00:00:32.270> get<00:00:32.599> and<00:00:32.890> each<00:00:33.890> side<00:00:34.250> it<00:00:34.490> will<00:00:34.580> say<00:00:34.820> do<00:00:35.060> not

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
you get and each side it will say do not

this<00:00:36.980> will<00:00:37.190> allow<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:39.260> channel<00:00:39.800> in<00:00:40.010> this

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
this will allow the channel in this

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.660 
this will allow the channel in this
piece<00:00:40.579> to<00:00:41.030> vent<00:00:41.240> properly<00:00:41.510> if<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:42.560> tank<00:00:43.460> is

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
piece to vent properly if the tank is

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.410
