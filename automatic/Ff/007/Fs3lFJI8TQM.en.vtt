to put an angle piece in your skirt if

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.870 
to put an angle piece in your skirt if
you<00:00:07.140> want<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.410> have<00:00:07.589> any<00:00:07.859> kind<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.250> twirl<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.790> it

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
you want to have any kind of twirl to it

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.280 
you want to have any kind of twirl to it
and<00:00:09.000> what<00:00:09.120> I<00:00:09.150> do<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.630> take<00:00:09.840> one<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:10.170> the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
and what I do is I take one of the

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.320 
and what I do is I take one of the
strips<00:00:10.500> that<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:10.800> made<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.429> about<00:00:12.300> a

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
strips that I made this is a about a

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.930 
strips that I made this is a about a
half<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.840> yard<00:00:13.049> or<00:00:13.740> excuse<00:00:14.160> me<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.580> yard

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
half a yard or excuse me this is a yard

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.620 
half a yard or excuse me this is a yard
cut<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.630> half<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.820> length<00:00:17.820> wise<00:00:18.119> because<00:00:18.420> you

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
cut in half the length wise because you

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.840 
cut in half the length wise because you
always<00:00:18.779> want<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.020> keep<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.230> stretchy<00:00:19.920> part<00:00:20.340> to

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
always want to keep the stretchy part to

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.779 
always want to keep the stretchy part to
the<00:00:21.000> smaller<00:00:21.300> pieces<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:23.160> stretchy<00:00:23.460> part

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
the smaller pieces so the stretchy part

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.170 
the smaller pieces so the stretchy part
should<00:00:24.480> be<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.930> shorter<00:00:25.500> part<00:00:26.060> because<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
should be the shorter part because the

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.670 
should be the shorter part because the
more<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.599> have<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.779> stretch<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.349> there<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
more you have to stretch on there the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.720 
more you have to stretch on there the
more<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.859> have<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.010> sew<00:00:29.250> on<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.429> stretchy

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
more you have to sew on the stretchy

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.880 
more you have to sew on the stretchy
part<00:00:30.170> more<00:00:31.170> likely<00:00:31.560> you're<00:00:31.679> going<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.830> have

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
part more likely you're going to have

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.310 
part more likely you're going to have
errors<00:00:33.140> to<00:00:34.140> do<00:00:34.230> as<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.469> lay<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.710> out<00:00:34.800> flat<00:00:36.320> and

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
errors to do as you lay it out flat and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.810 
errors to do as you lay it out flat and
this<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.590> just<00:00:37.770> something<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.219> found<00:00:38.430> through

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
this is just something I found through

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.680 
this is just something I found through
trial<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.300> error<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.719> works<00:00:39.960> great

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
trial and error that works great

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.029 
trial and error that works great
get<00:00:42.690> your<00:00:44.420> sew<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:46.020> side<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.590> want<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.860> leave

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
get your sew this side you want to leave

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.540 
get your sew this side you want to leave
it<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:47.670> overhanging<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.480> both<00:00:48.690> sides

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
it so it's overhanging on both sides

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.600 
it so it's overhanging on both sides
right<00:00:50.550> here<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.739> that<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.219> have<00:00:53.399> a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
right here and that is so you have a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.400 
right here and that is so you have a
little<00:00:53.879> bit<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.149> material<00:00:54.420> at<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> top<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.260> put

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
little bit of material at the top to put

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.020 
little bit of material at the top to put
it<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.340> don't<00:00:56.489> want<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.699> fold<00:00:56.910> it

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
it in so you don't want to fold it

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.060 
it in so you don't want to fold it
exactly<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.719> half<00:00:59.629> and<00:01:00.739> then<00:01:01.739> you're<00:01:01.859> just

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
exactly in half and then you're just

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.470 
exactly in half and then you're just
going<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.219> go<00:01:02.370> ahead<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.640> cut<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.850> all<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.149> way

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
going to go ahead and cut it all the way

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.429 
going to go ahead and cut it all the way
down<00:01:03.860> now<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.430> one<00:01:05.640> time<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.600> cannot<00:01:07.170> rip

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
down now this is one time you cannot rip

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.140 
down now this is one time you cannot rip
it<00:01:07.590> because<00:01:07.979> we're<00:01:08.189> not<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:08.369> we're<00:01:08.970> going

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
it because we're not going we're going

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.010 
it because we're not going we're going
at<00:01:09.360> an<00:01:09.479> angle<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> material<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.869> is

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
at an angle on the material so this is

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.480 
at an angle on the material so this is
one<00:01:13.170> time<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.350> forced<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.890> use<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.130> scissors

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
one time I forced to use the scissors

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.880 
one time I forced to use the scissors
but<00:01:17.390> since<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.509> love<00:01:18.689> making<00:01:18.930> skirts<00:01:19.320> enough<00:01:19.590> I

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
but since I love making skirts enough I

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.090 
but since I love making skirts enough I
don't<00:01:20.610> mind<00:01:23.900> just<00:01:24.900> keep<00:01:25.380> your<00:01:25.530> hand<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:25.890> there

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
don't mind just keep your hand on there

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.840 
don't mind just keep your hand on there
to<00:01:26.189> hold<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.729> doesn't<00:01:26.850> pull<00:01:27.210> out<00:01:27.360> honey

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
to hold it so it doesn't pull out honey

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.460 
to hold it so it doesn't pull out honey
you<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:29.970> any<00:01:30.119> little<00:01:30.360> minor<00:01:30.659> errors<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.350> can

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
you have any little minor errors you can

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.649 
you have any little minor errors you can
always<00:01:31.680> adjust<00:01:32.250> when<00:01:32.880> you're<00:01:33.030> going<00:01:33.360> down<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
always adjust when you're going down the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.350 
always adjust when you're going down the
sides<00:01:34.369> and<00:01:35.369> when<00:01:35.490> you're<00:01:35.610> done<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:35.970> only

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
sides and when you're done this only

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.390 
sides and when you're done this only
works<00:01:36.600> also<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:37.110> material<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
works also with material that is the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.429 
works also with material that is the
same<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.850> both<00:01:38.880> sides<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.810> do<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.140> with<00:01:40.409> a

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
same on both sides if you do this with a

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.469 
same on both sides if you do this with a
pattern<00:01:40.860> material<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.909> will<00:01:42.030> need<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.270> do<00:01:42.360> it

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
pattern material you will need to do it

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.649 
pattern material you will need to do it
twice<00:01:42.630> because<00:01:43.320> otherwise<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.920> will<00:01:44.070> have

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
twice because otherwise you will have

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.620 
twice because otherwise you will have
two<00:01:45.659> pieces<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.140> face<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:46.920> way<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.630> what

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
two pieces that face this way and what

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.120 
two pieces that face this way and what
you<00:01:48.780> need<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> piece<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.439> will<00:01:49.710> face<00:01:49.890> each

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
you need is a piece that will face each

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.139 
you need is a piece that will face each
wing<00:01:50.369> both<00:01:51.149> ways<00:01:52.009> like<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.970> when<00:01:54.060> you're

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
wing both ways like that so when you're

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.240 
wing both ways like that so when you're
done<00:01:54.360> should<00:01:54.960> look<00:01:55.170> something<00:01:55.439> like<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:56.009> one

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
done should look something like this one
