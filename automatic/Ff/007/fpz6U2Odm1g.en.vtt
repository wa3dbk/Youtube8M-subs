00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.299
 hello hello how are you I hope that very well 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.900
 and wanting to work today as 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.390
 handcraft I bring this adornment that in 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.610
 this case is for Christmas but it can be 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.730
 for birthdays or just to 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:32.590
 decorating the house is made with cardboard 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:35.769
 red and some green beads is very very 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.550
 easy until I have another this is done 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:43.390
 in gold wrapping paper with red 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.610
 also pulling Christmas colors but 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.559
 you can choose the color that 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.350
 you want the stamp with which 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.809
 you have at home if you want good 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.969
 fabrics is with magazines already in the 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.340
 tutorial if you are interested to see them 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.079
 I show different examples even of 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.870
 journals 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.719
 good if you feel like doing them 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.920
 I leave the tutorial step by step I hope 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.369
 they can do it 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.280
 see you in a next video first thing 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.590
 what we are going to do is cut out circles 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.750
 of the paper that you choose in this 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.380
 case I am using a paper of 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.899
 gift in golden tone also with 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.720
 Christmas designs or finite stars 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.399
 steadily but they can be with the 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.380
 paper that you want can even 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.690
 be with cardboard that was the example that 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.600
 I showed them to the beginning of cardboard 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.090
 red holding the trimmers the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.659
 six circles what we are going to do is 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.960
 honor them in the middle 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.840
 and again to the goal this is going to be 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.600
 to mark only once 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.700
 we fold is for half and again to 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.630
 Half of us will be left with a fourth metal 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.880
 good of which we are going to mark for 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.140
 do the petals then they will do 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.580
 the next 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:07.950
 fold and they will face like these two 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:11.850
 leaving a petal and they're going to throw it 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.430
 same with the next one there are going to be two 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.910
 firecrackers and what they are going to do is paste 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.850
 these edges we are going to put glue 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.760
 white if you want you can do it with with 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.500
 the hot glue that would dry 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.989
 Too much faster 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:33.530
 So let's put this aside as 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.530
 this side and we're going to paste 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.850
 this like this one or the viral one is going to take 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.080
 a little bit what I suggest is that what 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.930
 let them dry 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.660
 with something that sustains me in this case 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.570
 I'm going to use an invisible hair and what 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.590
 they're going to let it dry very well you do not have to 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.560
 stay this figure 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.060
 once we have the six 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.690
 chapters that would fit us like this 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.870
 They are dry we will use the following from 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.910
 the tip where it is in the petals we go 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.130
 to round up let's remove that little bit 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.900
 what do you have then we're going to 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.470
 place an account let's give up 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.470
 so 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.820
 let's go to live in this case I 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.760
 I'm going to use that hot glue 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:33.200
 to make it faster we're going to go 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.200
 sticking full petals 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:59.270
 all attached we are going to stick and we are going to 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.270
 close the flowers 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.280
 so we would stay now what remains is 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:12.740
 give it a little bit of shape that is both 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.740
 least be a little lose your best half 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:26.250
 Now what are we going to do in this 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:26.250
 case I'm going to put a red little story 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:35.450
 there would be the flower finished 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.210
 Now if you want this, you can 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.820
 stay like this you can put a thread and 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:44.360
 It can be perfectly to decorate 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:48.080
 in this way but if you stay in this 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.540
 which is like that in the form of a sphere 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.240
 we're going to need at least three like 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.810
 this one can be too much but in this 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.330
 case 3 is used with 3 we are going to do 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.560
 this 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:05.979
 then what are we going to prepare three 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.210
 Same flowers and with the glue 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:12.719
 let's go tracing to find the way 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.719
 to go hitting 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:23.860
 do not 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.860
 two 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:34.700
 before they have to place the yarn go 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.700
 forgetting we are going to place the temple 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:47.210
 Y 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:50.259
 very well that would be the expert there 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.259
 I would let it dry 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.230
 is the end result you can be with 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.670
 more you wait but in this case I think 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:02.860
 that is beautiful to transform three 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:05.710
 they are very nice they are very easy to 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.530
 make materials sincerely I'm going to 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.630
 show what even magazines are 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.150
 can soften these others that 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.910
 you can also be these little things 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:19.090
 good magazines already saw that the only thing 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:23.320
 they need is a piece of paper from 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:26.740
 any kind a little bit of glue 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.630
 scissors and desire to work and I think that 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:32.200
 with that we can have the same 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:34.420
 ornaments for the house I hope you like it and 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.910
 you can do it, I thank you 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.310
 have come here without more than 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:42.540
 tell them I leave a huge kiss and we 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.540
 we see in a next video
