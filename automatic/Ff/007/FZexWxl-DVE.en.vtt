00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
hi guys it's iron in this video I'm

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.250 
hi guys it's iron in this video I'm
gonna<00:00:08.340> show<00:00:08.580> you<00:00:08.610> how<00:00:08.849> to<00:00:08.910> make<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.179> weapon<00:00:09.480> if

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
gonna show you how to make a weapon if

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.140 
gonna show you how to make a weapon if
you<00:00:10.469> have<00:00:10.590> done<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.920> quest<00:00:11.190> zen<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.059> art

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
you have done the quest zen and the art

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.270 
you have done the quest zen and the art
of<00:00:12.389> weapon<00:00:12.870> maintenance<00:00:13.049> you'll<00:00:14.009> remember

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
of weapon maintenance you'll remember

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.490 
of weapon maintenance you'll remember
there<00:00:14.820> are<00:00:14.849> patterns<00:00:15.509> for<00:00:15.780> different<00:00:16.230> kinds

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
there are patterns for different kinds

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.300 
there are patterns for different kinds
of<00:00:16.560> weapons<00:00:17.090> so<00:00:18.090> how<00:00:18.480> do<00:00:18.539> we<00:00:18.900> get<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.590> mats<00:00:19.890> to

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
of weapons so how do we get the mats to

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.210 
of weapons so how do we get the mats to
make<00:00:20.520> one<00:00:20.930> you<00:00:21.930> can<00:00:22.109> break<00:00:22.350> down<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.859> weapon

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
make one you can break down the weapon

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.810 
make one you can break down the weapon
drops<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.789> get<00:00:24.090> while<00:00:24.480> questing<00:00:25.820> it

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
drops that you get while questing it

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.910 
drops that you get while questing it
doesn't<00:00:27.210> really<00:00:27.330> matter<00:00:27.570> what<00:00:27.840> ql<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.529> it

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
doesn't really matter what ql it is it

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.040 
doesn't really matter what ql it is it
all<00:00:29.189> breaks<00:00:29.429> down<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.939> either<00:00:30.150> base<00:00:30.420> metal<00:00:30.840> or

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
all breaks down to either base metal or

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.770 
all breaks down to either base metal or
imperfect<00:00:31.859> metal<00:00:32.340> maybe<00:00:32.969> just<00:00:33.329> metal<00:00:33.600> later

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
imperfect metal maybe just metal later

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.010 
imperfect metal maybe just metal later
on<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.710> would<00:00:34.980> assume<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.750> this<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.870> what

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
on to you I would assume so this is what

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.369 
on to you I would assume so this is what
you<00:00:37.110> do<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:38.219> open<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.670> assembly<00:00:39.149> window<00:00:39.510> then

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
you do you open the assembly window then

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.139 
you do you open the assembly window then
drag<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.829> weapon<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.489> want<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.700> break<00:00:41.910> down

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
drag the weapon you want to break down

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.229 
drag the weapon you want to break down
into<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.200> little<00:00:43.260> box<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.180> see

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
into this little box and you can see

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.260 
into this little box and you can see
what<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.750> will<00:00:45.870> give<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.969> sometimes<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.149> gives

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
what it will give you sometimes it gives

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.029 
what it will give you sometimes it gives
you<00:00:48.390> an<00:00:48.510> imperfect<00:00:48.930> metal<00:00:49.170> sometimes<00:00:49.530> base

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
you an imperfect metal sometimes base

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.709 
you an imperfect metal sometimes base
metal<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:51.320> got<00:00:52.320> some<00:00:52.559> base<00:00:52.770> metal<00:00:53.190> here<00:00:53.399> too

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
metal I got some base metal here too

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.869 
metal I got some base metal here too
five<00:00:54.719> base<00:00:55.140> metal<00:00:55.559> makes<00:00:55.800> one<00:00:56.280> imperfect

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
five base metal makes one imperfect

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.290 
five base metal makes one imperfect
metal<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.390> five<00:00:58.109> imperfect<00:00:58.800> metal<00:00:59.100> gives<00:00:59.760> one

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
metal and five imperfect metal gives one

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:19.180 
metal and five imperfect metal gives one
metal

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.400 

okay<00:01:20.190> I<00:01:20.370> don't<00:01:20.760> need<00:01:20.940> seven<00:01:21.750> metal<00:01:22.050> to<00:01:22.230> make<00:01:22.350> a

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
okay I don't need seven metal to make a

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.860 
okay I don't need seven metal to make a
weapon<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.610> I'm<00:01:23.880> gonna<00:01:24.000> go<00:01:24.210> ahead<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.510> make

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
weapon so I'm gonna go ahead and make

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.750 
weapon so I'm gonna go ahead and make
seven<00:01:25.380> now<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:27.740> think<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:29.070> still<00:01:29.310> make<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> weapon

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
seven now I think I still make a weapon

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.010 
seven now I think I still make a weapon
with<00:01:30.380> imperfect<00:01:31.380> metal<00:01:32.300> but<00:01:33.300> it<00:01:33.570> might<00:01:33.720> not<00:01:33.870> be

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
with imperfect metal but it might not be

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:43.530 
with imperfect metal but it might not be
so<00:01:34.200> good

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:02:13.220 

you

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.040 

ackee<00:02:14.099> then<00:02:14.459> arranged<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.269> pattern<00:02:15.659> on<00:02:15.870> the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
ackee then arranged a pattern on the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.430 
ackee then arranged a pattern on the
grid<00:02:17.299> I'm<00:02:18.299> making<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.840> kiosk<00:02:19.200> focus

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.940 

if<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.070> can't<00:02:23.280> remember<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.790> patterns

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
if you can't remember the patterns

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.430 
if you can't remember the patterns
have<00:02:26.160> put<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:27.060> link<00:02:27.510> in<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.810> description<00:02:28.290> below

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
have put a link in the description below

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:47.069 
have put a link in the description below
for<00:02:28.830> us<00:02:29.129> check

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:52.059 

put<00:02:48.079> it<00:02:48.200> up<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:48.500> took<00:02:48.709> it<00:02:48.980> here<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:50.920> that's<00:02:51.920> a

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
put it up and took it here and that's a

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.380 
put it up and took it here and that's a
preview<00:02:52.310> of<00:02:52.549> what<00:02:52.700> you<00:02:52.819> will<00:02:52.939> get<00:02:53.090> if<00:02:53.269> you

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
preview of what you will get if you

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:01.520 
preview of what you will get if you
assemble<00:02:53.689> it

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.589

and there we go me weapon

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.250 
and there we go me weapon
