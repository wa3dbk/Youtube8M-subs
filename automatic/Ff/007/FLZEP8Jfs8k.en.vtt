00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.899
 small video tutorial about the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.760
 road construction in simcity I try I 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.070
 to bring something closer like you 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.450
 Main roads give your perfect harmony 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.719
 bring the so-called side streets 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.220
 can if you now times on a 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.619
 Side street will be clicking a year 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.900
 All these tools are displayed 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.080
 helplines are there to help 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.279
 To show where the houses are best 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.220
 can evolve and how much 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.750
 Platz need it so if you now times 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.450
 then see this square here at the puck 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.890
 That's the place for just one 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.450
 from the greatest density so at the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.430
 however, main roads only become one 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.579
 Such lines here are displayed 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.379
 much further away and if you are one too 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.079
 next to it is always there 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.120
 too much space that means it can 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.469
 a house with great density there but 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.090
 it still fits a little bit down 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.960
 but the small place is unfortunately not 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.199
 big enough for a second house so what 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.879
 you do it there are two little tricks of the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.949
 trick is you can go with the normal 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.049
 road to go all the way if you now 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.700
 on the left side, remove this density 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.530
 Then you wanted to see her 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.330
 street you put the approximately 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.880
 the same width has for itself 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.159
 completes like the main street last 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.920
 click on it and on the other side and behold 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.700
 you have the same distance as here 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.700
 we test is short 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.710
 the second possibility that you have it 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.020
 Take a park for example here 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.759
 a little bit to check out and in the discus 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:48.240
 this park has the same width or 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:50.009
 length like these big houses takes the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.130
 cross road puts you in about 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.890
 little bit before that 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:00.509
 and lo and behold, it suits everyone again 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.630
 Home of the greatest tight so I hope 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.530
 helped a lot and he was having a lot of fun 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.530
 try is for
