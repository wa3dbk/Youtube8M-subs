00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
okay so this video is how to change your

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.120 
okay so this video is how to change your
final<00:00:19.860> drive<00:00:20.070> oil<00:00:20.460> on<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:21.150> Yamaha<00:00:21.620> 650<00:00:22.620> classic

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
final drive oil on a Yamaha 650 classic

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.940 
final drive oil on a Yamaha 650 classic
custom<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:24.300> think<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.780> is<00:00:25.080> also<00:00:25.560> valid<00:00:25.830> for

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
custom I think this is also valid for

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.530 
custom I think this is also valid for
other<00:00:26.250> models<00:00:26.640> but<00:00:26.790> I'm<00:00:26.910> not<00:00:27.060> entirely<00:00:27.360> sure

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.540 
other models but I'm not entirely sure

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.080 
other models but I'm not entirely sure
but<00:00:27.900> if<00:00:28.890> your<00:00:29.070> final<00:00:29.430> drive<00:00:29.640> looks<00:00:29.880> something

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
but if your final drive looks something

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.820 
but if your final drive looks something
like<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.810> that's<00:00:30.870> assume<00:00:31.500> it's<00:00:31.740> about

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
like this and that's assume it's about

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.030 
like this and that's assume it's about
the<00:00:32.070> same<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.239> made<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> video<00:00:34.170> before<00:00:34.559> and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
the same so I made a video before and

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.470 
the same so I made a video before and
the<00:00:35.100> quality<00:00:35.460> was<00:00:35.610> horrible<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.059> I'm<00:00:36.300> just

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
the quality was horrible so I'm just

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.930 
the quality was horrible so I'm just
going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.690> pseudo<00:00:37.170> go<00:00:37.380> through<00:00:37.710> what<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.550> did<00:00:38.640> to

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
going to pseudo go through what I did to

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.549 
going to pseudo go through what I did to
change<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.390> oil<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:39.989> kind<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.320> get<00:00:40.470> an

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
change the oil so you kind of get an

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.830 
change the oil so you kind of get an
idea<00:00:40.650> of<00:00:40.950> how<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.340> done<00:00:41.520> it's<00:00:42.150> pretty<00:00:42.390> simple

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
idea of how it's done it's pretty simple

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.040 
idea of how it's done it's pretty simple
the<00:00:43.170> worst<00:00:43.620> part<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.010> getting<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:45.050> drain

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
the worst part is getting the the drain

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.710 
the worst part is getting the the drain
plugs<00:00:46.350> out<00:00:46.590> which<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.790> be<00:00:47.970> a<00:00:48.150> pain<00:00:48.540> if

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
plugs out which can be a pain if

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.689 
plugs out which can be a pain if
somebody<00:00:49.019> put<00:00:49.140> them<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.350> too<00:00:49.500> tight<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.949> the

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
somebody put them on too tight and the

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.310 
somebody put them on too tight and the
kind<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:50.970> oil<00:00:51.150> that<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.540> should<00:00:51.720> use<00:00:51.900> to<00:00:51.930> do

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
kind of oil that you should use to do

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.460 
kind of oil that you should use to do
your<00:00:52.670> change<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:54.150> first<00:00:54.930> thing<00:00:55.080> you<00:00:55.110> need<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.440> a

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
your change so first thing you need is a

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.210 
your change so first thing you need is a
17<00:00:56.339> millimeter<00:00:56.519> box<00:00:57.210> end<00:00:57.480> wrench<00:00:57.650> and<00:00:58.650> you're

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
17 millimeter box end wrench and you're

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.799 
17 millimeter box end wrench and you're
going<00:00:59.339> to<00:00:59.400> take<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> drain<00:00:59.970> plug<00:01:00.089> off<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.690> I'm

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
going to take the drain plug off so I'm

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:01.850 
going to take the drain plug off so I'm
not<00:01:00.960> going<00:01:01.080> to<00:01:01.140> do<00:01:01.290> it<00:01:01.320> because<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.739> already

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the oil will start coming out of the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.960 
the oil will start coming out of the
bottom<00:01:10.080> one<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.310> have<00:01:11.310> something<00:01:11.580> ready<00:01:11.820> to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
bottom one so have something ready to

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.040 
bottom one so have something ready to
catch<00:01:12.120> it<00:01:12.300> I<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.690> little<00:01:12.900> doohickey

that I catch the oil with and comes out

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.399 
that I catch the oil with and comes out
once<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.580> stops<00:01:17.880> draining<00:01:18.300> out<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:19.170> pretty

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
once this stops draining out it's pretty

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.679 
once this stops draining out it's pretty
simple<00:01:19.710> you're<00:01:19.860> going<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.040> fill<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.310> with<00:01:20.460> oil

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
simple you're going to fill it with oil

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.270 
simple you're going to fill it with oil
the<00:01:21.689> oil<00:01:21.719> that<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.079> use<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.860> saw<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the oil that I use that I saw a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.950 
the oil that I use that I saw a
recommendation<00:01:23.640> for<00:01:24.119> was<00:01:24.390> Mobil<00:01:24.810> 1<00:01:26.960> synthetic

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
recommendation for was Mobil 1 synthetic

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.569 
recommendation for was Mobil 1 synthetic
gear<00:01:28.170> oil<00:01:28.409> 75<00:01:29.399> W<00:01:29.820> 90<00:01:30.149> LS<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:31.590> LS<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.219> the<00:01:32.250> thing

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
gear oil 75 W 90 LS the LS is the thing

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.670 
gear oil 75 W 90 LS the LS is the thing
that's<00:01:32.700> important<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.329> think<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.840> that

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
that's important I think on this that

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.050 
that's important I think on this that
hundred<00:01:34.950> percent<00:01:34.979> sure<00:01:35.250> but<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.670> know<00:01:35.820> that

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
hundred percent sure but I know that

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.870 
hundred percent sure but I know that
this<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.479> stuff<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.810> use<00:01:36.960> I've<00:01:37.880> saw

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
this is the stuff to use I've saw

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.940 
this is the stuff to use I've saw
somewhere<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.630> don't<00:01:40.049> know<00:01:40.110> YouTube<00:01:40.560> somewhere

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
somewhere I don't know YouTube somewhere

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.800 
somewhere I don't know YouTube somewhere
and<00:01:41.130> read<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.789> that<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.299> stuff<00:01:42.659> you

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
and read that that is the stuff you

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.569 
and read that that is the stuff you
should<00:01:42.960> use<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.409> basically<00:01:44.189> you're<00:01:44.430> going<00:01:44.520> to

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
should use so basically you're going to

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.179 
should use so basically you're going to
put<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.180> fill<00:01:45.930> expire<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.500> drain<00:01:46.770> plug<00:01:46.920> back

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
put the fill expire the drain plug back

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.940 
put the fill expire the drain plug back
on<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:48.299> you're<00:01:48.659> going<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.960> basically<00:01:49.649> just

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:56.870 
it comes to the bottom of thread you'll
see<00:01:55.469> in<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.799> little<00:01:56.130> hole<00:01:56.340> there's<00:01:56.609> threads

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
see in this little hole there's threads

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.700 
see in this little hole there's threads
in<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.090> bottom<00:01:57.359> fill<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.049> up<00:01:58.140> till<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.409> reaches
