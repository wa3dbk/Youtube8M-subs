 no no 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.400
 the watermelon is an annual herbaceous plant 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.470
 creeping pertaining to the family of 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.110
 the cucurbits whose scientific name 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.110
 it's citrus la nature 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.029
 own intensive crops thanks 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.400
 to forced cultivation and its protection in 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.710
 greenhouse has been extended the time of 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.930
 permanence in the market having 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.300
 ceased to be a fruit exclusively 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.940
 really 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.399
 Planting watermelon in a greenhouse 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.070
 It is carried out with seeds previously 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:46.010
 finished in seedbed since December 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.420
 until April earning precocity 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.420
 with respect to direct sowing 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:59.399
 germination begins with the appearance 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.550
 of the containers when the seedling 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.559
 It is about 8 centimeters tall 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.479
 the terminal bud begins to appear that 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.390
 it goes lengthening appreciating itself 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.460
 subsidence of new leaves at 10 o 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.950
 12 days of germination 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.930
 containers begin to wither and 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.930
 the terminal bud begins its rotation 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.549
 the crops under plastic are 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.320
 subjected to temperature conditions and 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.470
 moisture that favor proliferation 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.570
 of diseases to fight them 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.970
 uses the landron graft technique 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.670
 pumpkin resistant for its affinity 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.369
 morphological and physiological with the majority 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.110
 of the ingested varieties of watermelon and 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.450
 also resistance to fusariosis 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.450
 vascular and other soil fungi 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:53.510
 the time elapsed since sowing 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.880
 to transplants ranges between 30 and 40 days 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.980
 from sowing in seedbed the 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.160
 transplant the family seedling to 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.980
 floor should be done with a brush since 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.400
 it does not support the transplant to root 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.920
 nude 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.009
 they open their eyes with family or 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.110
 planter once the brush is placed 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.940
 covers the ground and there is a risk that 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.090
 did the plants and facilitate their 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.890
 rooted to the month that the nascence begins 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.460
 the watermelon develop their lips 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.830
 crawlers starting the notations 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.780
 the second irrigation is done ten or twelve 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.180
 days after this event 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.370
 when the plants have several leaves 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.830
 real work will be done 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.870
 superficial to extirpate the bad 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.290
 herbs and perform the techniques of 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.290
 contribute 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.620
 in the cultivation of watermelon there are two systems 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.870
 of pruning applicable in greenhouses 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.660
 first is to act on the 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.150
 plant since the beginning of growth 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.459
 so that when it has four or 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.130
 six true leaves is highlighted by 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.680
 on the third sheet by clicking on the 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.950
 axillary bud is repeating itself 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.470
 process with the secondary branches of 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.470
 this form the adult plant has two 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.069
 branches born from the main and four 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.069
 secondary shoots 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.620
 in the second system they are left from the 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.740
 principle only two main branches 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.930
 when they have five or six leaves 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.600
 they stand out above the third 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.280
 leaf so that four develop 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.500
 secondary branches 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.020
 Y 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.090
 in some regions it is normal 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.360
 Soil cover with so many vegetables 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.100
 plastic sheet sand and so on 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.200
 looking to favor and maintain a 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.540
 soil temperature most suitable for 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.880
 crops retain moisture 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.190
 I usually keep control of bad 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.640
 herbs and the reduction of work in 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.640
 soil 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.860
 in bloom the flower buds and pears 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.670
 will result in male flowers or 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.760
 female solitary linked and axillary 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.980
 is the first flowers to appear are 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.299
 the masculine ones and then the 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.430
 female 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.519
 the latter appear in all 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.010
 branches curdling normally the flowers 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.940
 female branches of the main branches and 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.940
 of the second room 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.680
 d 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.780
 in the greenhouses given the absence of 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.670
 natural pollination apply 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.780
 hormonal substances that cause the 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.780
 development of the fruit 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.290
 through pollination and 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.260
 fertilization the ovary develops 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.420
 transforming into fruit is a phenomenon 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.490
 of strict hormonal control influenced 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.310
 by greenhouse conditions and the 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.710
 luminous intensity if it is at 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.630
 hormonal one is the right one is acting with 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.930
 I regulate regulators that correct those 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.930
 shortcomings 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.930
 a month and a half after the start 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.240
 to develop the fruits in the 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.910
 earlier varieties and both 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.030
 months have stalks of a meter 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.370
 length from this moment the plant 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.470
 you need a prolonged warm period 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.620
 for the beginning of the maturity of the 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:37.130
 fruits that culminates between 80 and 100 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:40.010
 days a science the date of collection 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.980
 of watermelon is subordinated to the 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:46.730
 Cultivated variety vintage cultivation area 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:49.130
 of sowing and cultivation system from the 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:52.310
 sow plantation until it starts 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.910
 the collection takes place from 2 to 3 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.480
 months 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.940
 lengthening 6 7 or 10 days in the plants 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.160
 inserted 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.740
 convenient times of day for the 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.500
 pickup are sunset or by 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.600
 early morning the watermelon fruit will 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.140
 collect leaving two or three 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.970
 centimeters of product length 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.900
 making clean cuts without leaving 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.900
 stallion wound 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.600
 the watermelon fruit is a big berry 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.720
 with fleshy placenta and epicardium 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:53.500
 brittle usually smooth color 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:56.380
 variable shape and size the pulp is 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:59.220
 sweet and its color for light pink to 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.220
 intense red
