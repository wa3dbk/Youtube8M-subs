00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 these are the tastiest competitions so 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.359
 intervals I think every recipe is good 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.760
 hefty me nice to fall in as 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.830
 your minutes market and yes play a good one 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.590
 sides from a score therefore the zero 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.240
 and then yes then nse does not believe 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.340
 more the make still good trainer 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.230
 if you are keen to show you 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.789
 yes of course for yes when in view 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.210
 she the trainer said that I would him 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.359
 to make 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.650
 and yes this is good 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.330
 yes congratulations with the three 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.740
 points but that is tricky or not 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.390
 not doing her 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.200
 the mission in advance that want one 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.340
 most troublesome opponent would get 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.910
 a fact there said de la fere 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.239
 excrete 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.489
 yes based on mentality not that 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.200
 could have brought after today you could 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.239
 see that we nec though on 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.969
 mentality 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.469
 yes wanted to win the competition or not 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.070
 get many results 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.010
 Well it was like glassware from but where 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.000
 I won that is more important than 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.980
 It doesn't matter anymore that it is one 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.410
 awkward race was an ever faster one 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.750
 two points then important if you then the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.500
 that's where you are going to analyze, we think 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.970
 start normally and then went reasonably 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.890
 depressed and officer went a lot 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.340
 things here check a photo in course 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.320
 those players had to make and then so 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.950
 even more so have the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.600
 ball 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.000
 I thought that was a plus and you 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.680
 of it first approaching and if you then it 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.580
 end 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.840
 yes but leaves with three points and ano 2 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.759
 can only say the result 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.520
 is good is a match after his 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.320
 European adventure always tricky 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.590
 well then you are in the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.050
 fatigue and such 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.140
 to them we did put in the week but 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.130
 yes it will hurt in the legs 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.250
 physiologically it is never allowed 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.290
 Paul remember that they are and things 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.540
 often in the head 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.860
 yes you can see that very clearly this 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.750
 team anyway and not all but still 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.450
 be a number now that you have anyway 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.370
 must go through and must go through 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.590
 and a certain degree of hardness 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.690
 did you know beforehand the 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.620
 other results the result of ajax and 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.500
 FC Twente 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.930
 well i know i don't know that ajax 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.380
 lost patients to one ear but the 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:17.830
 dungeon first just money with mine 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.840
 am ajax director in london and i know 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.950
 not for the end starter 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.700
 yes there I am in a rest when 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.380
 do you use that 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.330
 what namely yes that helps 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.980
 always had the game during competition 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.870
 the head looks that the ajax had 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.880
 lost and at the same time the if 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.050
 what does not do that with a player and 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.420
 motivated the 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.370
 to how the additional feather as we 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.290
 this match has further look nec 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.570
 player has two boys who rent psv 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.790
 look there even after the hall union 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.930
 and who do not initiate today but as 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.220
 I the morning 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.190
 there is a boy we see doing below 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.200
 then I will look at you specifically 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.640
 on your two boys' region 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.930
 today is just three points in the bag 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.060
 and exit 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.590
 have shown three points in the bag 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.460
 able to score and the and also show 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.240
 that it's the end of the game 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.600
 Get on 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.600
 that is positive
