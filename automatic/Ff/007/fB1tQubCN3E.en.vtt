00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.509
 us here again on 24.11 and still have 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.620
 here with my audi engine vw sharan 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.240
 which is no longer jump now 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.360
 I have taken care of me once new spark plugs 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.500
 and she has to give it without gas 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.790
 of course a little bit thought out because 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.550
 the old ones were full of little wet 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.490
 Gasoline so drowned and total 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.740
 has eaten flawlessly the first 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.230
 started now he sees I had 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.060
 before, of course , already flashed 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.640
 There was no problem with it now 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.289
 the points that you can not do here 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.239
 see 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.399
 a bit you can see interesting 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.540
 So on the phone you do not see it now 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.489
 because it just is not strong enough 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.340
 resolved that I want to test a thing 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.700
 and I read that we 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.530
 that hannover deducts that month 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:52.100
 still continues to look like this or 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.100
 kind of 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.840
 yes, that's what I wanted to see if 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.570
 because then many memory and shows 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.100
 have someone original vag come to me 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.070
 done but somehow I still have 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.299
 never seen a memory error 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.390
 no mistake well found that's it 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:17.689
 I do not understand a shit like that 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.600
 what can be taken the whole reader 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:23.700
 read the control unit 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:28.530
 I mean, he has to know why 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.290
 assumes that he gives none of the speed 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.479
 no signals but that is here 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:39.900
 everything empty what you look great if 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.240
 This speed encoder is then or 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.090
 or of course perfect then 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.369
 as one can assume no 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.720
 speed I want that now 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.210
 not here so it will be easy 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.250
 tristan 0 displayed in contrast to this 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.950
 if the petrol pump is broken or out 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.350
 the speed displayed the 2 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.799
 just not mixed but then there is 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.350
 the speed 200 which is displayed 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.149
 I do not know, there is still such a thing 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.110
 what give like camshafts 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:13.200
 which is I think rather than hire here what 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.569
 happens over the subtracts or when the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.610
 not at all honest is like that 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.230
 here is the thing is natural in 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:26.879
 I now have the distributor in it too 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:30.239
 not so keen and still makes him 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:37.280
 let's get started now 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:37.280
 jump on like butter 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:49.099
 Unfortunately, unfortunately, no mistakes shortly 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:56.420
 the story of the story I once again 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:03:03.450
 on and electronics is the control unit 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:06.290
 or not yet there it is then go 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.290
 I'm on error memory 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:13.010
 no short mistakes so that's sad 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:17.510
 but well of course 800 it indicates if 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:21.140
 then everything is okay and over 200 the 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.940
 just indicated when the angeber and the 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:31.030
 Engine control unit okay so if I am 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:32.870
 which the engine rage that he 30 then 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.380
 and of course whenever the 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:40.190
 168 then pull off gasoline bomb 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.960
 it so then it suffers then then 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.220
 is the holder okay but that 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.110
 engine control unit of course dead 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.660
 and then you can see that he is beautiful too 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.070
 of course, the tachometer remains empty and 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.880
 that's why it's time 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:55.310
 ole light flashes otherwise we had 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.550
 then at the tank still guessed that me 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.840
 me the central gaze and 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.880
 if necessary, clean it if so 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.450
 something happens and if the spark is not 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.450
 is okay
