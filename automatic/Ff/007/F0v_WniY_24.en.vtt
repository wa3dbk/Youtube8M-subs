00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:11.910
 hello everyone I am launching the blog www.bo 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.309
 china superfine dot com is today vi 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.830
 I bring you to Rome and I also tell you about it in Rome 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.320
 and amatrice because I tell you the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.390
 Amatriciana pasta recipe 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.090
 let's start with a promise in pasta 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.400
 amatriciana does not like onion 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.349
 this is one of the most common mistakes that 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.090
 is committed is like in the trap a 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.070
 put the onion in the cream 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.149
 matriciana does not go there put it in 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.010
 head 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.899
 so let's do the simple things 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.780
 ingredients for matriciana are few 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.160
 good but the onion is not there and so is it 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.200
 there is no white wine in theory 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.320
 someone puts someone there does not 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.640
 puts in the original recipe is Roman 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.739
 that of an amateur 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.539
 there is the white wine does not exist 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.230
 so if you put it at your own risk 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.129
 and danger 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.289
 I tell you mine and I support it is the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.129
 closer to the original if possible 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.140
 do n't believe me 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:07.110
 look for the sources I go to 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.990
 tell to prepare the matriciana 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.960
 so we take two people as a base 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.020
 we need 150 g of pillow 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.090
 that should be cut into strips and not a 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.710
 tadini because you cut it into cubes 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.229
 the moment he went to cook it 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.119
 it dries too much instead cut to 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.560
 you do more or less thin strips 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.920
 levels a little from the big slice that 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.420
 you have remains the texture you feel 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.979
 in the mouth when you eat and then 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.560
 throw in strips 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.070
 we need 300 g of tomato 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.200
 fresh and peeled gold or fresh golden smoke 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.860
 your model go to crush them you do 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.960
 so in order to make it beautiful I think though 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.720
 you want something even denser than a 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.189
 even more dense tomato not used 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.590
 the past but use the postman for 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:59.119
 in order to pass veiled, then we have 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:03.360
 need 100 grams of pecorino romano 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:06.509
 already grated we will become after gods 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.729
 100 g of bucatini bucatini you can use 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.260
 also amatrice spaghetti as an amateur 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.090
 if the bucatini but above all the 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.000
 spaghetti we use bucatini because 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.700
 buffaloes is its bucatini matrix death 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.239
 and school death then we need 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.099
 a big enough pan us 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.540
 we put a spoon and half a thorium 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:31.330
 and in theory it should be half a pepper 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.190
 fresh or some flakes of for 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.440
 tasks dried chili I chose 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.209
 dry chili for capri simple 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.180
 but if you have fresh chilli 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.250
 cut in half and put it in the oil 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.540
 the original recipe and if there is 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.819
 have you I strongly recommend you 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.519
 use it involves the use of 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.700
 lard instead of oil but sure that 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.410
 the final taste is totally different 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.390
 so if you have used lard 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.569
 lard and do not care about the diet of 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:03.879
 used fats then construct 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:07.540
 let's go to the preparation we put 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:10.780
 the oil and the chilli to heat maybe 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.599
 average when the oil and peeling in 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.540
 of the gonzÃ¡lez and pour it all inside 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.190
 and make it brown, realize it is 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.310
 rolled when it starts to become 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.109
 pale yellow as you see and pillow and front 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.299
 took on a yellowish color 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.959
 white and pulled out all the fat 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.359
 of cooking 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.340
 at this point you have two options if 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.919
 you used fresh chilli where 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.540
 that remove it because otherwise it becomes 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:38.200
 inedible if you have used it instead 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.150
 the dried chili in flakes it 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.060
 let in so much the taste is very 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.859
 less strong than normal that 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.840
 moment in which pillow is ready 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:50.700
 renewed that we do is simply 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.700
 pour the color 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.970
 this is the juice of the amatriciana 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.270
 as you can see I don't really like his 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.490
 liquid 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.860
 I prefer that there is little tomato and 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.450
 a lot of france then used in 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.250
 proportion much more than pillow 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.750
 there are those who love it more liquid 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.580
 in short, this is a matter of taste 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.710
 and in all cases my advice is to 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.260
 do not add salt because the pillow 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.760
 by itself it is very very tasty so 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.160
 in the end you would have something that is 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.110
 inedible then calculate when 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.460
 let's go and put the pecorino cheese 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:27.650
 cheese and the sauce tasty 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.780
 that is, his with the matriciana must be done 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.770
 cook for 10 minutes over medium heat 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.690
 low 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.910
 sometimes you turn it over, don't add 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.370
 water, leave it on low heat 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.470
 medium low for about ten minutes in the 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.450
 Meanwhile minuted we look for 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.400
 few 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.530
 then the water boils we put at 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.290
 boil water with salt then in 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.870
 moment in which he really wanted bucatini me 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.210
 I cook them al dente, I recommend 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.370
 don't cook them too much because otherwise 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.230
 you send me a blade that never appeared before 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.970
 let them cook al dente followed 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.430
 instructions eliminated a couple of minutes 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:06.020
 from cooking and alpha instructions 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:08.540
 remember the spaghetti bucatini are 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.880
 ready and down the derby so different 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.150
 directly into the pan I 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:24.230
 prepared the sauce and mix adding 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:27.260
 the pecorino and with disk things that resulted 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:32.150
 then there is the proof that even in this one 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:38.870
 beautiful of the house of the amatriciana yes 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:40.520
 feels a smell that I did not imagine me 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.040
 I recommend this operation sheets a 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.170
 cooker otherwise so screen with the 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:50.270
 pasta cooks and stuff comes out 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:51.560
 eatable ready then very ready 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.280
 intact 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.280
 then comes the beautiful 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:09.260
 see the portions are enough 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:12.620
 abounds in commanders but not even later 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.750
 casinos enchant anyone I know 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.020
 we can do it done place there 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.020
 they all do 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:27.900
 and in all this once implanted 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.919
 with pecking the dough remains the most part 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.470
 beautiful and good 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:35.789
 that is, what commonly comes 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:39.199
 called the lame or the whole 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:39.199
 bacon than the pasta in the pan 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:51.090
 look what you see we have crises is 

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:55.259
 time 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:57.389
 we will remain so much happiness but we lack the 

00:06:55.259 --> 00:07:00.720
 final touch the final touch is given 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:03.000
 from the grace of pecorino ships there 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.940
 cold weather so they are treated in 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.180
 reality the battleships treated in reality 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:11.280
 legrottaglie not issue as much as you want 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:14.940
 perhaps without abounding because they are May 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:17.190
 at the cabin door and at this point 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.740
 this is the matriciana and bucatini 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:21.990
 all'amatriciana with the original recipe 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:24.629
 it takes very simple without onion 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:28.280
 about 15 minutes 18 while exaggerating e 

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:28.280
 so I had a taste of course 

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:33.319
 taste tasting 

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:49.210
 yes, we were there, however, before I did 

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.520
 in short, I'm going to eat all out 

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.860
