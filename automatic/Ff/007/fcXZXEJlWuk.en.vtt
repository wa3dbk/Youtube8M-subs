00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
kind of pathway did I take i took a

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.630 
kind of pathway did I take i took a
diagonal<00:02:44.900> I<00:02:45.050> didn't<00:02:45.320> take<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.620> right<00:02:45.980> 1i<00:02:46.430> a

diagonal I didn't take the right 1i a
little<00:02:47.600> zigzaggy<00:02:48.080> so<00:02:48.800> after<00:02:49.100> you<00:02:49.190> do<00:02:49.340> that

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
little zigzaggy so after you do that

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.400 
little zigzaggy so after you do that
they<00:02:49.760> can<00:02:49.940> rebuild<00:02:50.150> it<00:02:50.510> any<00:02:50.750> way<00:02:50.930> they<00:02:50.960> want

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
they can rebuild it any way they want

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.200 
they can rebuild it any way they want
and<00:02:51.680> we<00:02:52.100> do<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.400> again<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:52.820> we<00:02:52.880> just<00:02:53.090> keep

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
and we do it again and we just keep

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.920 
and we do it again and we just keep
going<00:02:53.620> start<00:02:54.620> our<00:02:54.830> max<00:02:55.640> that's<00:02:56.360> on<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.690> sweet

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
going start our max that's on the sweet

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.770 
going start our max that's on the sweet
statue<00:02:57.740> of<00:02:57.950> liberty<00:02:58.370> now<00:02:58.850> Carol<00:02:59.270> is<00:02:59.360> building

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
that's it I think I'll try that Dettori

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.580 
that's it I think I'll try that Dettori
this<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.760> I<00:03:05.000> let<00:03:05.180> them<00:03:05.330> practice<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:06.050> I<00:03:06.350> tell

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
this and I let them practice and I tell

this and I let them practice and I tell
them<00:03:06.620> all<00:03:06.920> right<00:03:07.010> start<00:03:07.370> at<00:03:07.550> this<00:03:07.700> distance<00:03:08.020> do

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
them all right start at this distance do

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.740 
them all right start at this distance do
it<00:03:09.140> one<00:03:09.320> time<00:03:09.350> step<00:03:09.770> back<00:03:10.130> do<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:10.850> again<00:03:10.940> step

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
it one time step back do it again step

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.990 
it one time step back do it again step
back<00:03:11.990> go<00:03:12.530> back<00:03:12.770> and<00:03:13.070> see<00:03:13.640> what<00:03:13.670> you're<00:03:13.910> doing

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
what do you need to do to make this work

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.100 
what do you need to do to make this work
and<00:03:16.850> I<00:03:16.970> say<00:03:17.210> the<00:03:17.540> kids<00:03:17.750> will<00:03:17.900> say<00:03:18.080> peace<00:03:19.870> has<00:03:20.870> to

and I say the kids will say peace has to

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.230 
and I say the kids will say peace has to
be<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.290> sneak<00:03:21.680> attack<00:03:21.710> so<00:03:22.460> there's<00:03:22.640> no<00:03:22.760> bounces

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
be a sneak attack so there's no bounces

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.390 
be a sneak attack so there's no bounces

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
that's a partner activity you have to do

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.490 
that's a partner activity you have to do
the<00:04:23.240> progression<00:04:23.870> on<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.080> element

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
the progression on the element

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.770 
the progression on the element
level<00:04:24.920> the<00:04:25.310> next<00:04:25.760> step<00:04:25.970> would<00:04:26.150> be<00:04:26.210> a<00:04:26.360> group<00:04:26.630> of

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
level the next step would be a group of

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.230 
level the next step would be a group of
four<00:04:27.140> doing<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:28.010> same<00:04:28.220> thing<00:04:28.580> building

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
four doing the same thing building

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.640 
four doing the same thing building
structures<00:04:29.780> and<00:04:29.960> see<00:04:30.080> if<00:04:30.290> they<00:04:30.440> can<00:04:30.620> knock

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
structures and see if they can knock

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.950 
structures and see if they can knock
them<00:04:30.920> down<00:04:31.100> then<00:04:31.820> at<00:04:32.000> the<00:04:32.150> end<00:04:32.180> if<00:04:32.510> you<00:04:32.600> do<00:04:32.780> have

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
them down then at the end if you do have

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.570 
them down then at the end if you do have
time<00:04:32.990> it<00:04:33.380> would<00:04:33.470> be<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.680> whole<00:04:33.860> class<00:04:34.190> and

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
time it would be the whole class and

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.550 
time it would be the whole class and
what<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.150> do<00:04:35.300> for<00:04:35.660> that<00:04:35.840> is<00:04:35.870> I<00:04:36.170> would<00:04:36.290> say<00:04:36.440> all
