00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.470
 Hello everyone and welcome 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.750
 today this new unboxing that 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.480
 sees the air force headphones as protagonists 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.820
 shadow of the turtle beach that how 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.219
 you may well be branded 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.839
 crono of ghosts because this is 7 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.699
 let's say this pair of headphones is born between 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.410
 the activision collaboration with 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.910
 third beach that I take the opportunity of 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.189
 thank just for having me 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.289
 sent this pair of headphones so that 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.510
 sails can show during this 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.340
 video but I have to be honest I don't have 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.869
 never tried a pair of ata headphones 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.420
 turbi that is so much beach to be a lot 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.600
 famous for making peripheral worship 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.370
 audio someone fiat set for console not 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.379
 I never had the opportunity to compal e 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.610
 I must say that they really presented themselves 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.110
 very good especially for the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.160
 pack you tell me it was not 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.899
 it has nothing to do with it, but I know it was 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.390
 beautiful for the package and find me 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.730
 every single component in its own 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.469
 under pack like these manuals 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.480
 closed inside this small package 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.370
 that diabolical one didn't want to open to 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.739
 really owned but so let's see 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.899
 first of all, what is inside of 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.359
 this box as usual the usual ones 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.400
 paperwork precaution but above all 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.320
 this giant turtle sticker 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.869
 beach that I didn't know where to stick 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.970
 we have the very important visual after 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.560
 that we really have a lot of cables 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.799
 because these headphones are compatible 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.520
 for both Mac and Windows PCs for consoles 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.259
 xbox 60 playstation 3 and also for iphone 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.780
 in short, for any mobile terminal 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.820
 but as soon as these dear cables 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.189
 rca therefore that we can connect via 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.670
 component to have a way of connecting the 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.250
 our headphones or aux cable the famous 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.990
 aux case and to conclude we also have 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.049
 the cable that will allow us to connect 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.220
 our part of the 360 ​​but reading in 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.720
 network I found that these headphones 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.520
 it should also be compatible for 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.619
 xbox one eye playstation 4 indeed if 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.899
 maybe go to the store I show you 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.130
 however if you look for other formations 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.930
 online these headphones should also 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.700
 compatible then for repeat 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.950
 playstation 4 and xbox one do not give you 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.240
 still confirms however on facebook in 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.210
 description I leave you all information 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.759
 necessary to fink so that you then 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.560
 may you be certain, but I tell you already 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.969
 here they should be compatible 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.459
 also therefore for what they are 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.470
 the next gen then as you see we have 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.700
 this cable is really very long e 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.150
 surely this is a virtue because 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.579
 often many of you maybe 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.379
 paparazzi on the couch 18 meters from the 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:19.180
 console then with such a long cable 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.909
 surely we wo n't have any problems 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.730
 then how do you see both usb and 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.989
 3.5 gold lacquered jack and this is the 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.670
 online remote control o 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.250
 amp but we'll see it in the course 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.650
 of the video first let's see the set is 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.569
 that in short, let's say a lot 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.430
 pretty compact and this is me 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.780
 like it because it is also quite light 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.120
 compared to upstream and set I had 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.950
 way to try in the long run after a two 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.810
 three hours in the head in short, not 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.299
 you will particularly feel you will not go to 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.400
 weigh the very fine microphone 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.230
 because you can move in each 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.909
 direction without any problem and this 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.920
 let's say a general overview of the 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:56.079
 headphones that I go to show you just a little 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.489
 so without even saying too many 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.079
 information because I finish it below 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.819
 the aesthetic aspect you need to see you if 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.319
 you like them less though they are anyway 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.599
 comfortable the pavilions are 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.099
 quite adjustable they are also 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.560
 rather furniture in materials 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.689
 used and as you see it anyway 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.790
 on the super york bow and in the 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.620
 pavilions and the call logo 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.260
 of duty ghost just because they are 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.760
 branded by call of duty taste and if 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.440
 no is that there is if you take your own 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.239
 all the costs put us at gotto 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.669
 and inside we have the turtle beach logo 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.230
 that will see our ears 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.090
 that is, it is not that we will see them much but how 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.959
 the crackers 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.699
 let's get back to us with an overview 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.799
 of all this I must say the 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:34.690
 product to be really excellent and 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.060
 stereo headphones at a price of approx 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.560
 80 euros the only fault I have to say e 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.459
 you will be online remote control that 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.949
 being a bit archaic we can say yes 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.720
 functional but in terms of design 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:48.579
 and of ergonomics in my opinion one could 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.599
 definitely do better below 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.549
 that aspect 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.079
 in spite of this it is worthwhile the fact that 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.690
 however they are compatible for all 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.310
 therefore definitely not this console 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.959
 it will never be an investment that anyone 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.150
 so you will be able to use 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.519
 maybe on any platform you play 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.739
 on xbox then maybe you want to hear from you 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.940
 something a piece of music from the pc you can 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.440
 always use these headphones then 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.780
 in short, we can define them as a headset 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.190
 elastic here so that 's all for 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.260
 this video to these are the irfis 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.120
 shodou that i really liked it 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.070
 under the aspect of lightness and the 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.229
 comfort in the head also microphone 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.029
 rather versatile but certainly the 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.680
 major flaw in my opinion control 

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.970
 remote in line or amplifier that 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.140
 in short, somewhat questionable in my opinion 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.450
 could work better both below 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.760
 the aspect of design that of ergonomics in 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.070
 hand because on balance it is 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.480
 functional but maybe for a headset like this 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.010
 and especially for the between tour beach 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.900
 being rather famous of designs is 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.630
 searched for in my opinion it could be done 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.010
 surely better then this is 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.270
 all for this video, leave me here 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.910
 under your impressions what 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.500
 think of this at or better this 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.310
 pair of headphones I remind you to be 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.410
 stereo headphones for the cost of around 80 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.210
 euro up for down ok this is really 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.190
 I am all reading thanks for yours 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.190
 tension and the next videos bye
