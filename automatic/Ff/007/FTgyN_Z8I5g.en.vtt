00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
 in Bogota thousands of citizens are victims of excessive collections by 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.080
 of taxi drivers because the truth is that one as a user 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.299
 when you get into a taxi 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.699
 i realize that the idea some 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:15.119
 of regularity 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:16.539
 well 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.490
 percent to one have refused to make the claim 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.669
 why 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.550
 can be a mother and from other countries 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.529
 well, the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.409
 the government is not up to date to have a 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:31.689
 a dining room controlled before that so that there 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.880
 those arbitrariness no no no that's why the challenge for any other but what 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:37.309
 they make those turn 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.699
 or maybe to europe especially through brand rapto one hundred be and that many 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:42.540
 times 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.350
 The main cause of this situation is due to the alteration of the taximeters 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.540
 that generated the loss of more than 300 million pesos a day to the 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.070
 inhabitants of the Colombian capital 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.019
 this issue has aroused the interest of the main authorities of Bogota 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.170
 among them the councilman javier lastra have an investigation carried out in 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.810
 January 2009 showed that 50% of the taxis that roll in Bogota possess 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.910
 the taximeter altered cm 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.450
 yes 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.450
 taracena 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.370
 the team 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.510
 of everything 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.690
 the receivers 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.690
 at 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.159
 by means of electronic devices such as the infamous doll 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.619
 installed by some mechanics the taximeters can generate patterns of 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.000
 count faster than those stipulated in decree 208 2008 of the 

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:51.600
 mayoralty of bogota 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.500
 in which it is indicated that the count should be 59 pesos per unit traveled 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.410
 every 100 meters or every 30 seconds 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.410
 how are those mechanisms and how do they work 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.850
 many times has driven that 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.200
 many countrymen with him somewhere in the world because in Navarre change 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.260
 in the lights and what happens with the one they met when 1% 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:18.959
 l generates an incorrect alpha taximeter information that what it does 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:22.799
 the device the secretary andrés garcía tebar 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:26.969
 the priest occasions that the loss of the apparatus I marked 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.259
 2 3 units where the marker 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:31.359
 that's what is going very well 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.190
 with fines corresponding to half a minimum wage 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.980
 and operational controls by the Metropolitan Transit Police and the 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.790
 mobility secretariat seeks to reduce the alarming figures given to 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.159
 meet for the councilor lastra 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.419
 the procedures that are currently carried out 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:49.039
 are a little 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.279
 by all is to say it that's why the mobility secretariat 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:55.779
 percent at this time is in the process of acquiring the 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:57.769
 portable equipment 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.329
 with which it is going to be this 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.459
 this procedure much more technified hit and we hope that we 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.599
 throw very good results 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.360
 only expected to be measures that are intended to be adopted by the government 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:11.079
 state 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.180
 be positive, provide security and confidence to the thousands of users who 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.549
 daily take a taxi the ciaboga 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.289
 by default at a point t
