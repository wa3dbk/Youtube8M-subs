this<00:00:01.170> is<00:00:01.350> what<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:01.709> PSP<00:00:02.310> analog<00:00:02.700> stick<00:00:02.970> unit

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
this is what the PSP analog stick unit

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.269 
this is what the PSP analog stick unit
looks<00:00:03.540> like<00:00:03.810> once<00:00:04.049> it's<00:00:04.259> removed<00:00:04.650> from<00:00:04.980> the

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
looks like once it's removed from the

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:05.930 
looks like once it's removed from the
faceplate

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
faceplate

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.120 
faceplate
there<00:00:06.660> are<00:00:06.779> two<00:00:06.960> screws<00:00:07.290> that<00:00:07.319> hold<00:00:07.680> on<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:08.040> the

there are two screws that hold on to the
faceplate<00:00:08.340> one<00:00:08.880> here<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.480> one<00:00:09.870> here<00:00:09.900> and

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:10.759 
faceplate one here and one here and

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.310 
faceplate one here and one here and
basically<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.269> whole<00:00:12.300> unit<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.049> held

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
basically the whole unit is held

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.440 
basically the whole unit is held
together<00:00:13.500> by<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.950> metal<00:00:14.429> clip<00:00:14.790> on<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.240> back

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
together by a metal clip on the back

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.010 
together by a metal clip on the back
with<00:00:15.839> four<00:00:16.289> prongs<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:18.539> remove<00:00:18.810> the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
with four prongs on it to remove the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.470 
with four prongs on it to remove the
clip<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.800> just<00:00:19.859> took<00:00:20.279> an<00:00:20.430> exacto<00:00:20.939> knife<00:00:21.150> and

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
clip I just took an exacto knife and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.450 
clip I just took an exacto knife and
stuck<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.439> underneath<00:00:22.710> one<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.039> those<00:00:23.220> little

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
stuck it underneath one of those little

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.410 
stuck it underneath one of those little
prongs<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.619> the<00:00:25.619> whole<00:00:25.910> unit<00:00:26.910> just<00:00:27.090> kind<00:00:27.359> of

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
prongs and the whole unit just kind of

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.930 
prongs and the whole unit just kind of
falls<00:00:27.630> apart<00:00:27.810> afterwards

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.530 

once<00:00:33.720> the<00:00:33.870> metal<00:00:34.020> clip<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.560> off<00:00:35.150> you<00:00:36.150> can<00:00:36.329> take

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
once the metal clip is off you can take

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.150 
once the metal clip is off you can take
off<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.200> circuit<00:00:37.470> board<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:39.710> can<00:00:40.710> take<00:00:40.920> out

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
off the circuit board you can take out

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.299 
off the circuit board you can take out
the<00:00:41.580> white<00:00:41.970> guide<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.910> gray<00:00:45.150> guide<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:46.309> the

and<00:00:55.399> then<00:00:55.520> you'll<00:00:55.700> see<00:00:56.000> that<00:00:56.360> it's<00:00:56.629> made<00:00:57.110> out

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
and then you'll see that it's made out

is the analog stick unit with the spring
around<00:01:07.010> it<00:01:07.300> now<00:01:08.300> that<00:01:08.479> spring<00:01:08.869> is<00:01:08.900> pretty<00:01:09.290> hard

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
around it now that spring is pretty hard

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.910 
around it now that spring is pretty hard
to<00:01:09.860> get<00:01:10.010> back<00:01:10.280> in<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:11.119> air<00:01:11.360> to<00:01:12.110> get<00:01:12.290> it<00:01:12.440> back<00:01:12.619> on

to get back in the air to get it back on

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.219 
to get back in the air to get it back on
the<00:01:13.220> easiest<00:01:13.610> way<00:01:13.850> that<00:01:14.030> I<00:01:14.060> found<00:01:14.420> is<00:01:14.840> you<00:01:14.869> take

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
the easiest way that I found is you take

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.690 
the easiest way that I found is you take
your<00:01:15.590> analog<00:01:16.009> stick<00:01:16.340> unit<00:01:16.729> put<00:01:17.659> it<00:01:17.780> back<00:01:17.930> on

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
your analog stick unit put it back on

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.649 
your analog stick unit put it back on
and<00:01:19.700> you<00:01:20.570> put<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:20.899> spring<00:01:21.170> right<00:01:21.320> on<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.619> top

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
and you put the spring right on the top

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.609 
and you put the spring right on the top
you<00:01:23.659> put<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.140> top<00:01:24.440> part<00:01:24.920> back<00:01:25.369> on<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:26.619> then

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
you put the top part back on and then

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.880 
you put the top part back on and then
starting<00:01:28.100> with<00:01:28.130> one<00:01:28.460> corner<00:01:28.850> I<00:01:29.090> just<00:01:29.360> kind<00:01:29.570> of

starting with one corner I just kind of

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.370 
starting with one corner I just kind of
work<00:01:30.890> it<00:01:31.039> down<00:01:31.250> in<00:01:31.520> there<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.840> while<00:01:33.110> working

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
and to remember where the circuit board

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.789 
and to remember where the circuit board
goes<00:03:00.099> back<00:03:00.310> on<00:03:00.549> just<00:03:01.540> remember<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.140> four<00:03:02.409> gold

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
goes back on just remember the four gold

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.630 
goes back on just remember the four gold
tabs<00:03:03.310> go<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.810> left<00:03:05.049> hand<00:03:05.260> side<00:03:05.650> if<00:03:06.010> you're

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
tabs go to the left hand side if you're

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.729 
tabs go to the left hand side if you're
looking<00:03:07.000> at<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:07.269> as<00:03:07.450> if<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.840> were<00:03:07.959> installed<00:03:08.500> on

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
looking at it as if it were installed on

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.710 
looking at it as if it were installed on
the<00:03:08.860> back<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.250> faceplate<00:03:11.610> then<00:03:12.610> you<00:03:13.480> put

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
the back of the faceplate then you put

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.960 
the back of the faceplate then you put
your<00:03:13.870> little<00:03:14.140> clip<00:03:14.379> back<00:03:14.650> on<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:18.310> may<00:03:18.519> need<00:03:18.730> to

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
your little clip back on you may need to

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.470 
your little clip back on you may need to
bend<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.450> prongs<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:20.409> little<00:03:20.739> bit<00:03:21.150> inward<00:03:22.150> so

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
bend the prongs a little bit inward so

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.089 
bend the prongs a little bit inward so
that<00:03:22.659> they'll<00:03:22.900> clamp<00:03:23.470> on<00:03:25.470> but<00:03:26.470> otherwise<00:03:26.769> they

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
that they'll clamp on but otherwise they

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.309 
that they'll clamp on but otherwise they
should<00:03:27.310> just<00:03:27.459> snap<00:03:27.730> back<00:03:28.000> together<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:28.599> then

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
should just snap back together and then

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.020 
should just snap back together and then
you<00:03:29.349> just<00:03:29.650> reinstall<00:03:30.129> it<00:03:30.190> onto<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:30.730> back<00:03:30.849> your

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
you just reinstall it onto the back your

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.579 
you just reinstall it onto the back your
faceplate<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:32.099> it<00:03:33.099> should<00:03:33.370> work
