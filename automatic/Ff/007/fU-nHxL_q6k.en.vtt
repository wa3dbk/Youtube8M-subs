head and then it makes you go oh I can
make<00:05:09.960> a<00:05:09.990> game<00:05:10.320> out<00:05:10.500> of<00:05:10.530> this<00:05:11.450> but<00:05:12.450> um<00:05:12.600> that's

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
make a game out of this but um that's

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.650 
make a game out of this but um that's
usually<00:05:13.470> how<00:05:13.620> I<00:05:13.650> generate<00:05:14.520> my<00:05:14.910> ideas<00:05:15.300> for<00:05:15.540> the

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
usually how I generate my ideas for the

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.810 
usually how I generate my ideas for the
games<00:05:15.840> I<00:05:16.050> just<00:05:16.560> think<00:05:16.830> about<00:05:16.980> all<00:05:17.100> this<00:05:17.400> random

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
games I just think about all this random

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.760 
games I just think about all this random
stuff<00:05:18.180> and<00:05:18.360> then<00:05:18.990> and<00:05:19.290> then<00:05:19.440> when<00:05:19.590> I'm<00:05:19.740> done

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
stuff and then and then when I'm done

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.650 
stuff and then and then when I'm done
thinking<00:05:20.370> I<00:05:20.460> say<00:05:20.670> whom<00:05:21.000> how<00:05:21.330> can<00:05:21.540> I

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
thinking I say whom how can I

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.870 
thinking I say whom how can I
incorporate<00:05:22.200> I'm<00:05:22.740> a<00:05:22.800> bunch<00:05:23.400> of<00:05:23.520> different

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
incorporate I'm a bunch of different

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.810 
incorporate I'm a bunch of different
levels<00:05:24.240> a<00:05:24.330> bunch<00:05:24.540> of<00:05:24.630> different<00:05:25.040> items<00:05:26.040> into

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
levels a bunch of different items into

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.600 
levels a bunch of different items into
this<00:05:26.940> game<00:05:27.210> and<00:05:27.480> then<00:05:27.900> what<00:05:28.170> I<00:05:28.200> do<00:05:28.350> is<00:05:28.800> I<00:05:29.490> just

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
this game and then what I do is I just

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.220 
this game and then what I do is I just
um<00:05:30.510> I<00:05:31.310> build<00:05:32.310> upon<00:05:32.670> that<00:05:32.910> central<00:05:33.330> idea<00:05:33.630> to

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
um I build upon that central idea to

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:40.150 
um I build upon that central idea to
make<00:05:34.410> a<00:05:34.440> grand<00:05:34.980> more<00:05:35.460> big<00:05:35.850> idea<00:05:37.160> but<00:05:38.160> um<00:05:39.140> so

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
make a grand more big idea but um so

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.700 
make a grand more big idea but um so
this<00:05:41.160> was<00:05:41.550> only<00:05:41.970> part<00:05:42.300> 1<00:05:42.540> guys<00:05:42.780> don't<00:05:43.380> worry
