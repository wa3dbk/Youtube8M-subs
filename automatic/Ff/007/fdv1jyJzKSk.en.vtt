00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.100 

this<00:00:31.730> is<00:00:31.850> my<00:00:32.210> everyday<00:00:32.540> what<00:00:33.050> watch<00:00:34.960> wear<00:00:35.960> it<00:00:36.050> a

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
this is my everyday what watch wear it a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:48.540 
this is my everyday what watch wear it a
lot

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.590 

I<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.890> gotten<00:00:51.280> in<00:00:51.399> the<00:00:51.550> water<00:00:51.820> it's<00:00:52.239> fine

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:12.520 

rotating<00:00:55.600> bezel

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.440 

that's<00:01:13.530> pretty<00:01:13.800> accurate<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.030> what's

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
that's pretty accurate this is what's

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.110 
that's pretty accurate this is what's
under<00:01:15.720> $100<00:01:16.410> so<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:17.490> accurate<00:01:17.730> for

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
under $100 so it's really accurate for

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.960 
under $100 so it's really accurate for
the<00:01:18.180> price<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.780> totally<00:01:19.710> notice<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.670> being

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the price I totally notice it being

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.790 
the price I totally notice it being
inaccurate<00:01:21.330> maybe<00:01:21.690> after<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.230> a<00:01:22.260> week<00:01:22.590> and

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
inaccurate maybe after like a week and

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.290 
inaccurate maybe after like a week and
maybe<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.130> couple<00:01:23.430> minutes<00:01:23.670> fast<00:01:24.120> or<00:01:24.450> slow<00:01:24.750> so

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
maybe a couple minutes fast or slow so

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.580 
maybe a couple minutes fast or slow so
you<00:01:27.300> can't<00:01:27.570> ask<00:01:27.720> for<00:01:27.870> much<00:01:28.080> more<00:01:28.140> at<00:01:28.470> this

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
you can't ask for much more at this

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.650 
you can't ask for much more at this
price<00:01:28.890> point<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:32.520> all<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.790> element<00:01:33.119> end<00:01:33.270> links

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
price point so all the element end links

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:43.459 
price point so all the element end links
you<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:33.869> see<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.320> they're<00:01:35.210> solid

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.550 

the<00:01:43.950> rotor<00:01:44.719> wins<00:01:45.719> the<00:01:45.960> watch<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.380> either

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
the rotor wins the watch in either

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.550 
the rotor wins the watch in either
direction<00:01:47.749> so<00:01:48.749> it's<00:01:48.869> more<00:01:49.020> efficient<00:01:49.439> that

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
direction so it's more efficient that

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.980 
direction so it's more efficient that
way<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:53.659> highly<00:01:54.659> recommend<00:01:55.109> this<00:01:55.200> watch<00:01:56.990> here's
