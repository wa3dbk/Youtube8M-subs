the<00:00:37.290> shield<00:00:37.770> here's<00:00:38.700> his<00:00:38.940> exact<00:00:39.420> words<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.170> I

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the shield here's his exact words and I

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.069 
the shield here's his exact words and I
quote<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.190> could<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.149> really<00:00:42.570> seen<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
quote I could have really seen the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.979 
quote I could have really seen the
shield<00:00:43.410> closing<00:00:44.250> down<00:00:44.460> every<00:00:45.239> show<00:00:45.539> for<00:00:45.899> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
shield closing down every show for the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.380 
shield closing down every show for the
next<00:00:46.350> three<00:00:46.620> years<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.250> think<00:00:47.969> we<00:00:48.149> had<00:00:48.360> that

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
next three years I think we had that

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.040 
next three years I think we had that
ability<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:50.579> were<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.969> hot<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.539> think

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
ability and we were that hot I think

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.049 
ability and we were that hot I think
that<00:00:52.289> it's<00:00:52.469> an<00:00:52.620> understatement<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
that it's an understatement that the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.299 
that it's an understatement that the
vast<00:00:54.270> majority<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:55.050> fans<00:00:55.350> loved<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.039> shield

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
vast majority of fans loved the shield

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.189 
vast majority of fans loved the shield
but<00:00:56.610> we<00:00:56.760> didn't<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.270> too<00:00:57.539> many<00:00:57.719> opponents

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
but we didn't have too many opponents

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.369 
but we didn't have too many opponents
left<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.039> face<00:00:59.480> possibly<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> Wyatts<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.260> you

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
left to face possibly the Wyatts but you

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.770 
left to face possibly the Wyatts but you
can't<00:01:01.920> really<00:01:02.250> go<00:01:02.640> above<00:01:02.820> evolution

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
can't really go above evolution

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.870 
can't really go above evolution
