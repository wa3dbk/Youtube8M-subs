00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.639 
five I know I always ask guys and it
sounds<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> repetitive<00:00:48.989> question<00:00:49.500> but<00:00:49.620> I

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
sounds like a repetitive question but I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.020 
sounds like a repetitive question but I
always<00:00:49.739> ask<00:00:49.980> what<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.280> guys<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.670> don't<00:00:50.879> need

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
always ask what you guys do I don't need

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.760 
always ask what you guys do I don't need
to<00:00:51.090> get<00:00:51.210> technical<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:51.840> was<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.110> stuff<00:00:52.590> with

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
to get technical but was it stuff with

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.680 
to get technical but was it stuff with
the<00:00:52.860> motor<00:00:53.100> with<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> suspension<00:00:54.030> or<00:00:54.329> what

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
the motor with the suspension or what

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.360 
the motor with the suspension or what
would<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.050> change<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.770> did<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> little<00:00:56.129> bit<00:00:56.250> of

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
would you change we did a little bit of

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.180 
would you change we did a little bit of
both<00:00:56.550> but<00:00:56.989> engine<00:00:57.989> stuff<00:00:58.469> was<00:00:58.649> really<00:00:58.829> minor

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
both but engine stuff was really minor

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.540 
both but engine stuff was really minor
and<00:00:59.930> the<00:01:00.930> most<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.620> stuff<00:01:01.829> was<00:01:01.980> suspension

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and the most of the stuff was suspension

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.189 
and the most of the stuff was suspension
stuff<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.000> we<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.480> know<00:01:03.510> found<00:01:03.960> were<00:01:04.170> a

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
stuff that we you know found were a

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.500 
stuff that we you know found were a
little<00:01:04.409> bit<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.890> little<00:01:05.640> bit<00:01:05.850> off<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.270> just

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
little bit a little bit off and I just

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.240 
little bit a little bit off and I just
we<00:01:06.930> were<00:01:07.049> good<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.290> places<00:01:07.890> but<00:01:08.010> then<00:01:08.159> my

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
we were good in places but then my

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.130 
we were good in places but then my
corner<00:01:08.549> speed<00:01:08.760> wasn't<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.330> wasn't<00:01:09.659> good<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:09.840> we

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
corner speed wasn't it wasn't good so we

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.570 
corner speed wasn't it wasn't good so we
really<00:01:10.409> worked<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.770> setting<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.189> bike<00:01:11.340> up<00:01:11.549> for

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
really worked on setting the bike up for

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.880 
really worked on setting the bike up for
my<00:01:11.820> corners<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> little<00:01:12.390> easier<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.170> hopefully

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
my corners a little easier and hopefully

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.760 
my corners a little easier and hopefully
that'll<00:01:14.580> relate<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.150> better<00:01:15.570> results<00:01:15.770> first

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
that'll relate to better results first

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.230 
that'll relate to better results first
time<00:01:16.950> here<00:01:17.159> at<00:01:17.250> Dodger<00:01:17.430> Stadium<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:18.060> had<00:01:18.210> a
