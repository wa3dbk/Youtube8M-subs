00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.390
 the skeleton of the title is true but it is 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.910
 possible that arcana really was 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.030
 considered a legendary pokÃ©mon and that 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.940
 in the end the idea was abandoned 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.809
 because this is not known yet but 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.559
 let's do some little analysis 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.480
 his statistics 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.159
 in the first generation they really were 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.260
 really very high 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.720
 let's say they were stand alone in the sense 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.640
 which is fine they were not really 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.980
 considered equal to others and therefore 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.620
 these statistics usually have them 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.540
 it is not the legendary blocks 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.300
 also a very important good is 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.400
 present in the anime in the anime we could 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.850
 find this photo in the first few episodes 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.340
 this photo practically represents one 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.850
 species of mosaic with inside 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.520
 four pokÃ©mon over article 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.980
 zac boss and arcana itself is not roma le 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.480
 axes saw her immediately after being 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.030
 arrived in the center shortly after seeing 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.450
 or I couldn't be wrong I don't remember 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.270
 so much good so the anime why never 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.120
 arcana has been put into this mosaic 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.130
 this along with the three legendary birds 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.750
 it would be a great question and could 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.760
 be a fairly tangible proof 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.650
 however here is another proof for two 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.830
 arcana could be considered a bit 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.600
 as legendary the design of arkan is 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.460
 based on the Chinese state it brings up 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.830
 a legend of itself 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.100
 summer has come down i don't know how 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.680
 say purely the dogs descended were of 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.930
 dogs that protected homes and people 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.360
 from evil spirits then with di 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.830
 supernatural powers and therefore are 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.620
 coming could be considered 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.330
 legendary precisely because of these powers 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.819
 these are only my theories you here 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.560
 let me know what you think 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.010
 you would have seen it well anyway arcana in 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.840
 three legendary I technically not 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.400
 too much 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.650
 so guys let me know yours 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.879
 we see the next theory a 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.879
 soldier and bye bye
