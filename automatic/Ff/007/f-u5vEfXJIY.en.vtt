00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.039
 hello everyone welcome for a 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.440
 new video today I tried 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.410
 to teach you this nation army of 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.870
 white stripes song not very difficult 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.039
 it is then composed of having 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.039
 couple and he goes while they change 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.410
 then a chorus introduction 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.730
 and finally the chorus yes during 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:16.240
 the test during which he will sing in 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:20.110
 done so first I can show myself the 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:25.720
 challenge then it's with the index one presses 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:27.520
 on the 7th party of the way there and we 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.440
 then press with the little finger on 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:36.430
 the tenth near the sequel we play the 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:40.030
 dozens do the best we go down las la 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:43.240
 eighth cargo of mit and then with 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.010
 madex the 7th cargo of the nest and that's what 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:55.540
 laughs 6 and sakhir may be continuous 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:59.830
 while they sing but Quebec 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.520
 street gangs so when you play 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.300
 this note 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.490
 in theory you should do it with the 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.310
 major otherwise you can do it with 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:18.070
 the index what am I doing by reflection 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:21.310
 so slipped the index both are here 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:24.510
 so a moment you get to the chorus 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.510
 and when he says 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.609
 and where after they pass loop 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.549
 chorus introduction it's very simple 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:37.859
 he makes this agreement or with the index and 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.980
 support on the third party then 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:43.379
 with lorie than the annular forgiveness he 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.420
 press the a5 rim fred from there is in 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.260
 below with the little finger along 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.489
 winter he presses on the 5th hard and 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.489
 here and play only these three strings 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:03:00.989
 what goes up 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:03.239
 this freight agreement and that's it and 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:08.040
 then they go to the chorus so 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:09.510
 keep this position well because it 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.340
 canned during all their hunger 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:21.719
 he just shows he is decent 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:24.359
 look what is it that their 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:25.859
 child is it's just the same 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.099
 position but he shows it up to the 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:31.889
 12th party 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:36.590
 then they go up to the 15th and 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:36.590
 relation to the 12th 10th 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.260
 8th and 7th 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:47.109
 this is the second time he's doing it 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:50.930
 that paris just watch my the 8th 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:52.549
 he returns to the 10th to sell December 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:04:03.799
 go back to the freight season 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:04:05.959
 and now it is twice f1 and 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:12.439
 then he takes again the two agreements 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:14.150
 that we saw at the introduction finally and 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.720
 and then you pick them up is what I 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.720
 showed you at the beginning 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.750
 So that's all for this song 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.970
 with a little bit of practice it's not 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.620
 very difficult so I wish you good 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.220
 courage to take it and if you have 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.800
 comments 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.800
