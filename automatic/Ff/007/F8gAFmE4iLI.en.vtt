one of the reasons I love my photo John
is<00:01:02.019> because<00:01:02.350> of<00:01:02.470> the<00:01:02.559> vertical<00:01:02.799> lighting<00:01:03.430> it

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
is because of the vertical lighting it

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:05.910 
is because of the vertical lighting it
delivers<00:01:04.449> hundreds<00:01:05.049> of<00:01:05.260> budding<00:01:05.619> and

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
delivers hundreds of budding and

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.219 
delivers hundreds of budding and
flowering<00:01:06.369> sites<00:01:06.700> all<00:01:06.909> up<00:01:07.360> and<00:01:07.659> down<00:01:07.900> and

flowering sites all up and down and
throughout<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.740> plant<00:01:09.040> instead<00:01:09.759> of<00:01:09.880> just<00:01:10.030> on

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
throughout the plant instead of just on

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.690 
throughout the plant instead of just on
top<00:01:10.479> like<00:01:10.780> typical<00:01:11.470> hydroponic<00:01:11.950> grows<00:01:12.130> it

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.630 
top like typical hydroponic grows it
sounds<00:01:13.450> crazy<00:01:13.780> but<00:01:14.409> it's<00:01:14.590> true<00:01:14.680> it's<00:01:15.310> all

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
about the vertical lighting it also fits

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.640 
about the vertical lighting it also fits
anywhere<00:01:19.390> you<00:01:19.869> don't<00:01:20.049> need<00:01:20.229> to<00:01:20.320> give<00:01:20.439> up<00:01:20.560> a
