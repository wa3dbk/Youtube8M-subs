alright folks today what we're doing is

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.730 
alright folks today what we're doing is
we're<00:00:02.850> changing<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:03.419> dynamic<00:00:04.170> of<00:00:04.319> how<00:00:04.560> we're

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
we're changing the dynamic of how we're

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.730 
we're changing the dynamic of how we're
testing<00:00:05.160> our<00:00:05.250> Tesla<00:00:05.580> turbine<00:00:05.910> for<00:00:06.150> aircraft

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
testing our Tesla turbine for aircraft

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.049 
testing our Tesla turbine for aircraft
engine<00:00:07.740> use<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.189> right<00:00:08.519> now<00:00:08.639> even<00:00:08.790> though<00:00:08.970> it

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
engine use and right now even though it

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.580 
engine use and right now even though it
kind<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.300> has<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.570> helicopter<00:00:10.110> look<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.469> it

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
kind of has the helicopter look to it

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.140 
kind of has the helicopter look to it
what<00:00:10.740> I'm<00:00:10.830> more<00:00:11.040> interested<00:00:11.309> in<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:11.700> can<00:00:11.969> the

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
what I'm more interested in is can the

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.600 
what I'm more interested in is can the
Tesla<00:00:12.480> turbine<00:00:12.809> function<00:00:13.769> as<00:00:13.950> an<00:00:14.070> airplane

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
Tesla turbine function as an airplane

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.820 
Tesla turbine function as an airplane
motor<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.809> something<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.230> can<00:00:16.350> power<00:00:16.529> your

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
motor and something that can power your

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.400 
motor and something that can power your
aircraft<00:00:17.340> prop<00:00:17.670> around<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.570> we've<00:00:18.810> got<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.050> nice

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
aircraft prop around so we've got a nice

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.349 
aircraft prop around so we've got a nice
bend<00:00:19.859> now<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.160> our<00:00:20.400> prop<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.060> we're<00:00:21.180> going<00:00:21.300> to

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
bend now to our prop so we're going to

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.150 
bend now to our prop so we're going to
be<00:00:21.449> turning<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.930> lot<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.380> air<00:00:22.529> with<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:22.890> prop

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
be turning a lot of air with this prop

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.099 
be turning a lot of air with this prop
specially<00:00:23.519> at<00:00:23.580> these<00:00:23.699> rpms<00:00:24.269> hopefully<00:00:25.019> in

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
specially at these rpms hopefully in

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.390 
specially at these rpms hopefully in
these<00:00:25.230> tests<00:00:25.439> today<00:00:25.560> what<00:00:25.800> we're<00:00:25.920> able<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.130> see

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
these tests today what we're able to see

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.859 
these tests today what we're able to see
is<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.580> we're<00:00:26.849> able<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.180> turn<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.570> prop

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
is that we're able to turn this prop

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.740 
is that we're able to turn this prop
under<00:00:28.289> load<00:00:28.560> up<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.340> thirty<00:00:29.609> six<00:00:29.910> hundred<00:00:29.970> rpms

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
under load up to thirty six hundred rpms

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.590 
under load up to thirty six hundred rpms
with<00:00:31.380> 100<00:00:31.920> psi<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.340> less<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.969> less<00:00:33.239> than<00:00:33.390> two

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
with 100 psi and less in less than two

00:00:33.600 --> 00:01:00.069 
with 100 psi and less in less than two
seconds

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:02:04.460 

here<00:01:00.620> we<00:01:00.710> go

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.740 

so<00:02:05.010> that<00:02:05.190> reversal<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.910> just<00:02:06.150> saw<00:02:06.330> was<00:02:06.570> us

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
so that reversal you just saw was us

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.469 
so that reversal you just saw was us
coming<00:02:07.140> back<00:02:07.170> down<00:02:07.650> from<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.980> 3600<00:02:08.760> rpm

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
coming back down from a 3600 rpm

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.980 
coming back down from a 3600 rpm
revolutions<00:02:10.970> span<00:02:11.970> there<00:02:12.270> says<00:02:12.570> that's<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
revolutions span there says that's the

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.780 
revolutions span there says that's the
frame<00:02:13.230> rate<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.500> my<00:02:13.560> camera<00:02:13.920> being<00:02:14.100> 60<00:02:14.520> frames

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
frame rate of my camera being 60 frames

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.970 
frame rate of my camera being 60 frames
per<00:02:14.910> second<00:02:15.420> we<00:02:15.930> know<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.320> when<00:02:16.500> we<00:02:16.590> see<00:02:16.800> that

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
per second we know that when we see that

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.750 
per second we know that when we see that
in<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.190> frame<00:02:17.460> rate<00:02:17.700> there<00:02:17.910> in<00:02:18.090> their<00:02:18.240> visuals
