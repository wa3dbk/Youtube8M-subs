00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
that it's still DVD base which makes it

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.680 
that it's still DVD base which makes it
kind<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.410> pokey<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.100> you've<00:00:47.879> got<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.149> MMI

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
kind of pokey and you've got the MMI

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.000 
kind of pokey and you've got the MMI
controller<00:00:49.230> here<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.620> everything<00:00:49.800> that's

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
controller here so everything that's

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.920 
controller here so everything that's
done<00:00:50.129> via<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.610> kind<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.879> nonsensical<00:00:51.539> four

corner<00:00:52.350> logic<00:00:52.530> which<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.129> never<00:00:53.460> really

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
corner logic which just never really

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.000 
corner logic which just never really
worked<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.180> me<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.600> works<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.320> lot<00:00:55.530> less<00:00:55.770> now

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
worked for me and works a lot less now

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.529 
worked for me and works a lot less now
