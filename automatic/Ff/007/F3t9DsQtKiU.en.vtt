got a 1 to 1 or I mean I just changed
the<00:01:45.780> back<00:01:45.990> boy<00:01:46.229> from<00:01:46.500> like<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.740> 10<00:01:46.979> inch<00:01:47.159> pulley

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
the back boy from like a 10 inch pulley

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.370 
the back boy from like a 10 inch pulley
down<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.759> looking<00:01:47.909> for<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.899> goes<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.110> little<00:01:49.229> bit

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
down to looking for it goes a little bit

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.740 
down to looking for it goes a little bit
faster<00:01:49.590> but<00:01:50.100> that's<00:01:50.250> one<00:01:50.490> thing<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.700> done

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
faster but that's one thing it done

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.080 
faster but that's one thing it done
Moli<00:01:54.480> check<00:01:55.480> out<00:01:55.660> the<00:01:55.840> clearance<00:01:56.380> is<00:01:57.090> that

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
Moli check out the clearance is that

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.170 
Moli check out the clearance is that
something<00:01:58.420> melts<00:01:58.720> look<00:01:59.020> at<00:01:59.110> that<00:02:03.090> plenty<00:02:04.090> of

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
something melts look at that plenty of

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.990 
something melts look at that plenty of
clearance<00:02:04.890> at<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:05.950> bicycle<00:02:06.130> throttle<00:02:06.820> and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
clearance at the bicycle throttle and

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.889 
clearance at the bicycle throttle and
then<00:02:07.479> you<00:02:07.570> got<00:02:07.690> these<00:02:07.840> uh<00:02:08.160> diamond<00:02:09.160> plates<00:02:09.899> got

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
then you got these uh diamond plates got

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.960 
then you got these uh diamond plates got
a<00:02:10.929> nice<00:02:11.140> roll<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.920> them<00:02:12.130> I<00:02:12.220> like<00:02:12.430> that<00:02:12.610> it's

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
a nice roll to them I like that it's

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.560 
a nice roll to them I like that it's
pretty<00:02:13.120> cool<00:02:13.390> kind<00:02:14.020> of<00:02:14.170> spin<00:02:14.709> expands<00:02:15.580> the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
pretty cool kind of spin expands the

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.030 
pretty cool kind of spin expands the
frame<00:02:16.900> there<00:02:17.170> yeah

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
frame there yeah

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.730 
frame there yeah
keeps<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.700> mud<00:02:18.880> off<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:19.740> that's

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
keeps the mud off of you that's

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.590 
keeps the mud off of you that's
something<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.670> haven't<00:02:21.880> seen<00:02:22.240> yet

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
something that I haven't seen yet

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.170 
something that I haven't seen yet
that's<00:02:23.530> all<00:02:23.770> reinforced<00:02:24.610> also<00:02:24.940> so<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.090> can

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
that's all reinforced also so you can

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.250 
that's all reinforced also so you can
actually<00:02:25.540> step<00:02:25.750> on<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:26.050> when<00:02:26.200> you're

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
actually step on that when you're

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.830 
actually step on that when you're
getting<00:02:26.470> on<00:02:26.590> there<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.850> you<00:02:27.910> know<00:02:28.360> just<00:02:28.540> you

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
getting on there so you know just you
