 important to be there as fast as 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.160
 possible then is that you could 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:46.840

 that smeared me in whales head to 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:35.130
 hump and indeed not abandonment that's it 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.790

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.350
 little too york 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.540

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.900
