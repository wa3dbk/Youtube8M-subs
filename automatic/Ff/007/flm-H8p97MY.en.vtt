00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
cm trench was 85 I saw a lot of people

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.780 
cm trench was 85 I saw a lot of people
against<00:02:27.780> someone<00:02:28.140> crazed<00:02:28.349> are<00:02:28.500> 90<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.250> he's

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
against someone crazed are 90 so he's

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.550 
against someone crazed are 90 so he's
got<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.569> potential<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.989> be<00:02:31.140> one<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.379> best

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
got the potential to be one of the best

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.309 
got the potential to be one of the best
players<00:02:31.859> in<00:02:32.099> FIFA<00:02:32.700> 14<00:02:32.970> Kramer<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:33.840> for<00:02:33.989> me<00:02:34.109> I

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
players in FIFA 14 Kramer so for me I

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.649 
players in FIFA 14 Kramer so for me I
think<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:34.950> see<00:02:35.099> if<00:02:35.159> 15<00:02:35.519> potential<00:02:35.970> should<00:02:36.120> be<00:02:36.209> 87

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
think I see if 15 potential should be 87

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.629 
think I see if 15 potential should be 87
and<00:02:37.049> maybe<00:02:37.680> even<00:02:37.829> 80<00:02:38.040> acres<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.519> had<00:02:38.609> a

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:38.639 
and maybe even 80 acres you had a

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.640 
and maybe even 80 acres you had a
fantastic<00:02:38.819> year<00:02:39.299> and<00:02:39.480> especially<00:02:40.139> the<00:02:40.469> world

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
fantastic year and especially the world

fantastic year and especially the world
cup<00:02:40.829> is<00:02:40.980> all<00:02:41.189> if<00:02:41.459> you<00:02:41.639> remember<00:02:42.000> Paris<00:02:42.780> said

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109

the<00:02:43.260> only<00:02:43.470> player<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:43.739> really<00:02:43.859> troubled<00:02:44.340> him

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
the only player that really troubled him

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.339 
the only player that really troubled him
during<00:02:44.549> the<00:02:44.700> game<00:02:44.879> was<00:02:45.480> indeed<00:02:45.720> rhinestone

during the game was indeed rhinestone

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.740 
during the game was indeed rhinestone
not<00:02:46.590> really<00:02:46.859> not<00:02:46.980> stud<00:02:47.310> or<00:02:47.579> not<00:02:48.060> even<00:02:48.450> Jared

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
potential if a legend like Pirlo says he

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.920 
potential if a legend like Pirlo says he
doesn't<00:02:53.669> potential<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.209> be<00:02:54.269> something<00:02:54.299> big<00:02:54.720> in
