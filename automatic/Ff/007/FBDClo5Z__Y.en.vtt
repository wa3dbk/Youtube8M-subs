00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.280
 hi girls and hi guys video of 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.990
 new after sun because after that 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.150
 to the carrot I really made you 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.350
 so long ago I left a 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.330
 a little dry-mouthed 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.310
 the video I thought to make one 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.740
 really simple recipe really the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.019
 easy easy based mainly of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.560
 general true to make an after-sun 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.529
 11 ice creams over a little that also illuminates 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.660
 embodied of the tan and let's see 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.030
 how to do it is really a recipe 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.149
 so very simple that I thought of for 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.670
 all all of you and all you can do 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.129
 it's a super super cute thing to even from 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.510
 give because it really had light 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.760
 also the preparation 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.059
 the first thing to be used e 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.280
 free cells and I'm worshiping at 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.949
 this madness of the vernile pharmacy 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.079
 he also told me on facebook why not 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.020
 I've never tried a real women gel like that 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.049
 very beautiful and very very consistent 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.200
 dense but it absorbs well on the skin 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.600
 therefore without leaving filaments 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.299
 really absurd and good and then and bio gel 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.890
 so really true to bio oil and the 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.080
 best son-in-law we have 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.909
 tried for I said it and it's already finished 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.750
 I took 200 grams are finished 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.460
 because I loved it and the ice cream will be 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.310
 excellent as after sun, also used 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.409
 as it is because it is soothing and among many 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.990
 therefore it is the main ingredient 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.689
 I put it in the bowl then apart alive 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.850
 to dissolve the friend a golden friend I have 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.220
 got this water 24 carats that own 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.740
 golden gilded seed, a boxwood pin 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.740
 rita neo which serves to give a 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.659
 a little more colorful consistency than ours 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.399
 You do n't have a final gel, though 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.070
 don't put it or put some 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.960
 zinc oxide inside the oil li 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.119
 I'm going to melt you can not even 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.860
 put them but it is very nice because at 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.380
 fine angeleri comes just golden that 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.540
 therefore it really illuminates the skin 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.570
 fantastic as what i put the finger of 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.490
 soothing perico excellent as after this 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.049
 here the use on burns also 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.259
 those that maybe I can do near the 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.010
 kitchen as it is on the last skin is 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.280
 the carrot one you see his orange 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.280
 the rich in good vitamin betacarotene 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.379
 for the soothing skin also the facts in 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.650
 home is fine one of these here I am 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:27.260
 very good ortobene the whole friend 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.970
 dispersed well and then simply it 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.030
 I'm going to pour mine a little at a time 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.549
 gl the true and I mix and see that yes 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.900
 it absorbs everything well so it comes to you 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:41.900
 a bright creamy gel back down that 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.599
 on the skin it makes a fantastic effect from 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.560
 colorful and brightens the tan 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:51.079
 so really nice and also 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.510
 putting it in transparent containers does 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.250
 his figure because it shows that he is 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.989
 colored and golden 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.260
 now it would be ready because it really 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.790
 excellent we don't miss anything 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.739
 let's enrich even more if 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.260
 you want with one or all of these 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.260
 vitamin e tocopherol ingredients 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.349
 soothing among the many anti-aging panthenol 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.329
 provitamin b5 lenitive among many 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.190
 bisabolol also soothing against i 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.440
 redness is a little bit of essential oil 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.410
 carrot that the first time I use it 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.879
 I found it really vegan shop and it's a 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.919
 all essential that also excellent as 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.069
 also after- sun joe 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:30.500
 but I have to say that if you feel a little bit 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.239
 the carrot smell and I added too 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.669
 all mint and lavender essential 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.120
 refreshing soothing to cover a 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:40.940
 I put the monoi fragrance a little 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.680
 we recommend you the fragrances of 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.780
 citrus fruits which are also excellent for 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.030
 the summer I put 15 drops of the 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.790
 preservative of the soapstone that I took 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.370
 from the natural beauty store I am the 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.139
 phd a little bit little acid then a 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.629
 this point I'll show you that too 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.220
 with baking soda you can raise the ph 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.299
 many of you always ask me about it 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.129
 comments 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.199
 but we need the soda solution 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.889
 maybe some bubbles may come though 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:05.870
 does nothing 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:07.790
 see that they have added a little wine 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.579
 in the spoon opposed pole everything 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.209
 inside and if the dish is raised and I have it 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:16.220
 brought to 55 which is great and you see 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.459
 that is too much is ours too 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.590
 fantastic after-sun gel on the skin 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.050
 tanned lights up the complexion 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.510
 makes the tan more golden and then 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.889
 really soothing against redness 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.490
 because it contains all the ingredients 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:35.220
 which serve as soothing anti hydrates 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.160
 jella dai vera, which is already excellent for 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.780
 like after sun together with vitamins 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.150
 so really everything is there too 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.490
 essential oils especially that of 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.919
 mentano you know that it is so refreshing 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.660
 as an after- sun gel I put a veil on 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.190
 interesting thing if you do n't want to make it 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.570
 more refreshing 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.240
 you can also add a bit of wind 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.669
 I then showed it in the video of the star 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.070
 after a thousand sun you just put it on 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.530
 menthol inside the oils also yes 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.990
 dissolves or 12 grams of alcohol per 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.389
 Do it again sooner still 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.460
 more refreshing so that's it 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.740
 I hope this recipe is fast and 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.290
 easy to give you satisfaction as it is 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.479
 going to me and sending you a big kiss 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:19.910

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.910

 I found a solution for you to 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.180
 how many of you tell me they want a 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:59.279
 eco organic foundation and are not found with 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.449
 mineral foundation because maybe they have 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:03.529
 imperfections 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.529
