00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.450 

and<00:00:36.899> then<00:00:37.079> knowing<00:00:38.039> what<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.309> do<00:00:38.460> after<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.420> I

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
know this things sound awful just for

00:00:44.250 --> 00:01:04.899 
know this things sound awful just for
the<00:00:44.309> second<00:00:44.640> Avenue<00:00:44.940> having<00:00:45.600> an<00:00:45.690> example

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.830 

and<00:01:05.360> they're<00:01:05.540> like<00:01:05.689> oh<00:01:05.899> well<00:01:06.200> I<00:01:07.509> want<00:01:08.509> to<00:01:08.630> have

and they're like oh well I want to have

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.270 
and they're like oh well I want to have
another<00:01:09.110> instrument<00:01:09.500> learn<00:01:09.920> how<00:01:10.039> do<00:01:10.100> I<00:01:10.219> do

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
another instrument learn how do I do

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.999 
another instrument learn how do I do
that<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:11.000> then<00:01:11.500> they<00:01:12.500> don't<00:01:12.799> know<00:01:13.549> how<00:01:13.729> so

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
that and then they don't know how so

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.649 
that and then they don't know how so
this<00:01:16.009> is<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:16.280> method<00:01:16.460> that<00:01:16.670> I<00:01:16.820> found<00:01:17.210> that

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
this is the method that I found that

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.510 
this is the method that I found that
seems<00:01:17.960> to<00:01:18.110> be<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.649> easiest<00:01:19.360> all<00:01:20.360> right<00:01:21.520> what

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520

seems to be the easiest all right what
you<00:01:22.549> do<00:01:22.789> is<00:01:22.909> you<00:01:23.600> find<00:01:23.920> MIDI<00:01:24.920> out

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
you do is you find MIDI out

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.490 
you do is you find MIDI out
all<00:01:28.170> right<00:01:28.909> set<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> port<00:01:30.270> number<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:31.380> one

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
all right set the port number to one

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.400 
all right set the port number to one
all<00:01:34.010> right<00:01:34.130> what<00:01:34.790> you<00:01:34.910> want<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:35.180> do<00:01:35.600> doesn't

all right what you want to do doesn't
your<00:01:36.470> mixer<00:01:38.620> select<00:01:40.060> all<00:01:41.060> right<00:01:41.210> you<00:01:41.810> what

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
your mixer select all right you what

your mixer select all right you what
you'll<00:01:42.230> have<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:42.470> do<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.710> first<00:01:42.950> time<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:43.870> go

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
you'll have to do the first time you go

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:52.540 
you'll have to do the first time you go
into<00:01:45.260> this<00:01:46.990> pass<00:01:47.990> in<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:48.940> find<00:01:50.650> your<00:01:51.650> VST<00:01:52.250> like

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
into this pass in and find your VST like

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.340 
into this pass in and find your VST like
you<00:01:52.730> did<00:01:52.910> over<00:01:53.810> here<00:01:54.460> so

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
you did over here so

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.880 
you did over here so
load<00:01:57.770> up<00:01:57.980> the<00:01:58.840> world<00:01:59.840> or<00:02:00.080> east-west<00:02:01.390> all<00:02:02.390> right

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.219 

now<00:02:05.370> what<00:02:05.550> you<00:02:05.640> want<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.850> do

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
now what you want to do

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.960 
now what you want to do
let's<00:02:07.590> load<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.009> up<00:02:08.130> like<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.490> would<00:02:08.640> sound

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
let's load it up like you would sound

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:16.730 
let's load it up like you would sound
good<00:02:09.179> as<00:02:09.330> there's<00:02:09.810> something<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:11.130> you<00:02:11.489> know

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.540 

all<00:02:17.250> right<00:02:17.600> right<00:02:18.600> here<00:02:19.160> you're<00:02:20.160> gonna<00:02:20.310> wanna

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
all right right here you're gonna wanna

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.720 
all right right here you're gonna wanna
set<00:02:21.210> your<00:02:21.360> report<00:02:21.870> number<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.290> one<00:02:22.550> so<00:02:23.550> that

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
set your report number to one so that

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.280 
set your report number to one so that
means<00:02:24.590> this<00:02:25.590> will<00:02:26.310> work<00:02:26.490> with<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.390> as<00:02:27.990> long

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
means this will work with this as long

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.570 
means this will work with this as long
as<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.680> ports<00:02:29.220> are<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.460> same<00:02:31.460> probably<00:02:32.460> make

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
as a ports are the same probably make

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.470 
as a ports are the same probably make
sense<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.180> all<00:02:34.110> right

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
sense to you all right

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:46.080 
sense to you all right
select<00:02:36.480> instrument

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.160 

all<00:02:47.090> right<00:02:47.710> that<00:02:48.710> works<00:02:49.150> but<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:51.680> more

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
all right that works but and more

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.100 
all right that works but and more
channels<00:02:54.170> or<00:02:54.980> more<00:02:55.160> instruments<00:02:55.960> what<00:02:56.960> we'll

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
channels or more instruments what we'll

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.630 
channels or more instruments what we'll
need<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.290> do<00:02:57.530> is

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.620 

clone<00:03:02.270> you<00:03:03.020> know<00:03:03.140> clone<00:03:03.650> your<00:03:03.740> channel<00:03:04.070> and

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
clone you know clone your channel and

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.580 
clone you know clone your channel and
then<00:03:05.630> set<00:03:06.290> this<00:03:06.440> channel<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.040> two<00:03:08.560> and<00:03:09.560> that

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
then set this channel to two and that

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.650 
then set this channel to two and that
means<00:03:09.920> it<00:03:10.070> works<00:03:10.190> with<00:03:10.520> this<00:03:10.730> channel<00:03:11.510> right

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
means it works with this channel right

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.580 
means it works with this channel right
here<00:03:11.930> in<00:03:12.050> the<00:03:12.250> instance<00:03:13.250> of<00:03:13.460> piecewise<00:03:14.590> so

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
here in the instance of piecewise so

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.240 
here in the instance of piecewise so
let's<00:03:15.980> say<00:03:16.160> you<00:03:16.220> want<00:03:17.080> yeah<00:03:18.080> it's<00:03:18.440> kind<00:03:19.220> of

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
let's say you want yeah it's kind of

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.860 
let's say you want yeah it's kind of
messed<00:03:19.430> up<00:03:19.640> I<00:03:19.940> don't<00:03:20.420> know<00:03:20.510> if<00:03:20.570> it<00:03:20.660> does<00:03:20.690> that

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
messed up I don't know if it does that

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.870 
messed up I don't know if it does that
sometimes

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.449 

all<00:03:25.240> right

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.839 

now<00:03:31.090> you<00:03:31.780> know<00:03:31.930> like<00:03:32.349> like<00:03:32.950> I<00:03:32.980> said<00:03:33.280> this<00:03:33.700> is

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
now you know like like I said this is

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.599 
now you know like like I said this is
just<00:03:34.060> for<00:03:34.180> example<00:03:34.680> all<00:03:35.680> right

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
just for example all right

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.470 
just for example all right
and<00:03:37.090> that's<00:03:37.540> how<00:03:38.319> you<00:03:38.379> do<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:39.519> and<00:03:39.730> this

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
and that's how you do that and this

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.089 
and that's how you do that and this
doesn't<00:03:40.750> have<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.079> be<00:03:41.260> sent<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.650> port<00:03:41.890> number

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
doesn't have to be sent to port number

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.240 
doesn't have to be sent to port number
one<00:03:42.280> it<00:03:42.730> can<00:03:42.939> be<00:03:43.120> set<00:03:43.329> to<00:03:43.359> a<00:03:43.480> port<00:03:43.900> you<00:03:44.019> want<00:03:44.290> but

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
one it can be set to a port you want but
