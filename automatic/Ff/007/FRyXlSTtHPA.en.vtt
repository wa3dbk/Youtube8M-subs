00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
so that it's in the middle and we don't

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.550 
so that it's in the middle and we don't
have<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.980> do<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:18.019> now<00:02:19.019> we're<00:02:19.200> ready<00:02:19.380> to

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
have to do that so now we're ready to

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.890 
have to do that so now we're ready to
cut

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.170 

so<00:02:25.900> we<00:02:26.680> will<00:02:26.860> remove<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.430> pieces<00:02:27.880> that

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
so we will remove the pieces that

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.900 
so we will remove the pieces that
represent<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:29.380> painted<00:02:29.800> areas<00:02:30.130> on<00:02:30.340> the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
represent the painted areas on the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.270 
represent the painted areas on the
t-shirt<00:02:31.240> so<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:33.550> works<00:02:33.820> as<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.030> stencil<00:02:35.280> the

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
t-shirt so it works as a stencil the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.120 
t-shirt so it works as a stencil the
rest<00:02:36.610> has<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:37.060> be<00:02:37.180> ironed<00:02:37.510> on<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:38.980> it

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
rest has to be ironed on so that it

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:48.540 
rest has to be ironed on so that it
doesn't<00:02:40.060> move<00:02:42.600> okay<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:46.140> this<00:02:47.140> part<00:02:47.200> is<00:02:47.830> going

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
doesn't move okay so this part is going

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.780 
doesn't move okay so this part is going

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
to the directions on our paint we have

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.540 
to the directions on our paint we have
already<00:02:57.460> iron<00:02:58.270> the<00:02:58.570> shirt<00:02:58.930> flat<00:02:59.320> and<00:02:59.620> put<00:03:00.340> a

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
already iron the shirt flat and put a

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.200 
already iron the shirt flat and put a
piece<00:03:00.910> of<00:03:00.940> freezer<00:03:01.330> paper<00:03:02.760> inside<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:04.000> shirt

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
piece of freezer paper inside the shirt

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.280 
piece of freezer paper inside the shirt
so<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.510> paint<00:03:04.720> doesn't<00:03:04.930> soak<00:03:05.200> through<00:03:06.210> take

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
so the paint doesn't soak through take

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:15.240 
so the paint doesn't soak through take
the<00:03:09.120> stencil<00:03:10.120> off<00:03:10.740> so<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.500> can<00:03:14.530> place<00:03:15.040> it

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
the stencil off so so you can place it

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.280 
the stencil off so so you can place it
it's<00:03:15.820> really<00:03:16.030> easy<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.510> work<00:03:16.660> with<00:03:16.840> the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
it's really easy to work with the

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.440 
it's really easy to work with the
freezer<00:03:17.740> paper<00:03:18.990> because<00:03:19.990> um<00:03:20.820> it's<00:03:21.820> isn't

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
freezer paper because um it's isn't

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
freezer paper because um it's isn't
sticky<00:03:22.780> until<00:03:23.350> you<00:03:24.040> iron<00:03:24.700> it<00:03:25.080> so<00:03:26.080> you<00:03:26.170> can

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
sticky until you iron it so you can

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:34.710 
sticky until you iron it so you can
position<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:27.130> wherever<00:03:27.910> you<00:03:28.240> want<00:03:33.540> if<00:03:34.540> the

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
position it wherever you want if the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.830 
position it wherever you want if the
iron<00:03:34.870> turn<00:03:35.200> on<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:36.220> halfway<00:03:36.550> setting<00:03:37.180> with<00:03:37.540> no

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
iron turn on the halfway setting with no

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.810 
iron turn on the halfway setting with no
steam<00:03:38.140> because<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:38.890> want<00:03:39.070> to<00:03:39.130> make<00:03:39.310> sure<00:03:39.340> that

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
steam because I want to make sure that

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.670 
steam because I want to make sure that
the<00:03:40.030> edges<00:03:40.300> are<00:03:40.780> stuck<00:03:41.140> down<00:03:41.340> well<00:03:42.340> so<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:44.500> only

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
the edges are stuck down well so it only

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.699 
the edges are stuck down well so it only
takes<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:45.040> couple<00:03:45.100> of<00:03:45.400> seconds<00:03:46.330> and<00:03:46.570> if<00:03:47.380> you

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
takes a couple of seconds and if you

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.949 
takes a couple of seconds and if you
miss<00:03:47.890> a<00:03:47.920> spot<00:03:48.130> you<00:03:48.370> can<00:03:48.400> go<00:03:48.640> back<00:03:48.790> over<00:03:48.820> it<00:03:49.209> you

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
miss a spot you can go back over it you

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.570 
miss a spot you can go back over it you
really<00:03:50.260> want<00:03:50.290> to<00:03:50.470> make<00:03:50.620> sure<00:03:50.650> that<00:03:51.070> it<00:03:51.340> doesn't

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
really want to make sure that it doesn't

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.790 
really want to make sure that it doesn't
come<00:03:52.000> up<00:03:52.480> underneath<00:03:52.930> it<00:03:55.290> one<00:03:56.290> reason<00:03:56.470> that

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
come up underneath it one reason that

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.580 
come up underneath it one reason that
freezer<00:03:57.070> paper<00:03:57.340> is<00:03:57.760> better<00:03:58.120> than<00:03:58.510> paper<00:03:59.230> or

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
freezer paper is better than paper or

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.300 
freezer paper is better than paper or
plastic<00:03:59.890> stencils<00:04:00.670> is<00:04:00.820> you<00:04:01.209> can<00:04:01.390> replace<00:04:01.810> the

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
plastic stencils is you can replace the

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.030 
plastic stencils is you can replace the
inside<00:04:03.310> pieces<00:04:03.959> or<00:04:04.959> our<00:04:05.200> strawberry<00:04:05.680> seeds

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
inside pieces or our strawberry seeds

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.130 
inside pieces or our strawberry seeds
and<00:04:06.280> they<00:04:06.610> don't<00:04:06.820> have<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.150> be<00:04:07.270> connected<00:04:07.750> to

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
and they don't have to be connected to

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.410 
and they don't have to be connected to
the<00:04:08.260> rest<00:04:08.470> of<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.890> design<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:12.340> pieces<00:04:13.239> that

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
the rest of the design the pieces that

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.349 
the rest of the design the pieces that
we<00:04:13.540> removed<00:04:13.900> earlier<00:04:14.290> are<00:04:15.090> handy<00:04:16.090> for

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
we removed earlier are handy for

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.290 
we removed earlier are handy for
positioning<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:18.510> inside<00:04:19.510> pieces

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.820

to make sure that you go down straight

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:49.990 
to make sure that you go down straight
on<00:05:47.659> to<00:05:48.080> the<00:05:48.110> inside<00:05:48.590> parts<00:05:48.919> so<00:05:49.520> you<00:05:49.610> don't

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
on to the inside parts so you don't

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:59.379 
on to the inside parts so you don't
knock<00:05:50.180> them<00:05:50.419> out<00:05:50.509> of<00:05:50.569> position

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.660

you

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:10.390 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.060 

maybe<00:06:11.390> we<00:06:11.630> should<00:06:11.900> have<00:06:12.050> put<00:06:12.290> something<00:06:12.920> over

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
maybe we should have put something over

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.870 
maybe we should have put something over
it<00:06:13.340> so<00:06:13.640> we<00:06:14.030> didn't<00:06:14.480> get<00:06:14.870> any<00:06:15.590> so<00:06:16.100> we<00:06:16.280> won't<00:06:16.550> get
