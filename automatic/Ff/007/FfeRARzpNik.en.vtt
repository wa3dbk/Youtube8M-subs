00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.350 

putting<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:13.610> holder<00:01:14.610> which<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.000> made

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
putting it in this holder which is made

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.429 
putting it in this holder which is made
of<00:01:15.479> out<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.869> rubber

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.789 

okay<00:01:19.439> and

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.039 

now<00:01:23.759> I'm<00:01:24.149> working<00:01:24.929> first<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.969> one<00:01:27.539> one

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
now I'm working first on the one one

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.700 
now I'm working first on the one one
fell<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.649> the<00:01:29.210> 1000<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.289> is<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
fell on the 1000 and this is the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.020 
fell on the 1000 and this is the
movement<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.369> I'm<00:01:32.579> making<00:01:33.950> I'm<00:01:34.950> not<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.490> pro

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
movement that I'm making I'm not a pro

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.609 
movement that I'm making I'm not a pro
at<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.990> yet<00:01:37.859> and<00:01:38.810> I<00:01:39.810> hope<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.319> will<00:01:40.590> be

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
at this yet and I hope that I will be

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.469 
at this yet and I hope that I will be
but<00:01:41.069> basically<00:01:42.469> I'm<00:01:43.700> guessing<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.209> more

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
but basically I'm guessing this is more

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:54.469 
but basically I'm guessing this is more
of<00:01:49.100> using<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.280> stone<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.679> becoming<00:01:53.479> you

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
of using this stone and becoming you

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.350 
of using this stone and becoming you
know<00:01:54.630> doing<00:01:54.989> it<00:01:55.110> right<00:01:55.700> is<00:01:56.700> about<00:01:57.209> practice<00:01:57.869> so

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
know doing it right is about practice so

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.609 
know doing it right is about practice so
in<00:02:00.360> time<00:02:01.549> I'm<00:02:02.549> pretty<00:02:02.849> sure<00:02:03.259> that<00:02:04.259> I'll<00:02:04.590> be

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
in time I'm pretty sure that I'll be

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:13.220 
in time I'm pretty sure that I'll be
able<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:06.170> do<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:10.730> better<00:02:11.730> than<00:02:12.540> I'm<00:02:12.750> doing<00:02:13.079> it

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
able to do it better than I'm doing it

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.050 
able to do it better than I'm doing it
now<00:02:13.590> okay<00:02:14.280> but<00:02:14.700> for<00:02:14.940> now<00:02:16.519> this<00:02:17.519> is<00:02:17.579> the<00:02:17.790> way<00:02:18.030> I

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
now okay but for now this is the way I

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.620 
now okay but for now this is the way I
did<00:02:18.299> it

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
did it

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.789 
did it
I've<00:02:19.140> seen<00:02:19.440> some<00:02:20.340> some<00:02:20.879> people<00:02:21.500> use<00:02:22.500> this

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
I've seen some some people use this

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.860 
I've seen some some people use this
stone<00:02:23.099> in<00:02:23.459> a<00:02:23.579> different<00:02:24.090> way<00:02:24.239> as<00:02:24.420> some<00:02:24.720> people

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
stone in a different way as some people

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:38.650 
stone in a different way as some people
do<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.440> way

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.809 

okay

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:51.740 

so<00:02:43.510> there<00:02:44.379> you<00:02:44.500> go<00:02:45.269> one<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:48.010> two<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:49.680> three

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
so there you go one and two and three

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.039 
so there you go one and two and three
basically<00:02:52.750> I'm<00:02:52.930> working<00:02:53.409> trying<00:02:53.709> to<00:02:53.799> work<00:02:55.049> it

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
basically I'm working trying to work it

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.050 
basically I'm working trying to work it
does<00:02:56.290> move<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.709> little<00:02:56.890> bit<00:02:57.069> as<00:02:57.459> you<00:02:57.670> can<00:02:57.849> see

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
does move a little bit as you can see

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.890 
does move a little bit as you can see
the<00:02:58.390> rubber<00:02:58.900> does<00:02:59.530> move<00:02:59.769> a<00:02:59.799> little<00:03:00.010> bit<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:00.900> I

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
the rubber does move a little bit and I

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.119 
the rubber does move a little bit and I
might<00:03:02.260> you<00:03:02.799> know<00:03:02.950> like<00:03:03.810> do<00:03:04.810> something<00:03:05.140> fix<00:03:05.950> it

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.650 

like<00:03:53.980> I<00:03:54.100> think<00:03:54.160> that<00:03:54.430> finally<00:03:54.970> older<00:03:55.300> workers

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
like I think that finally older workers

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.450 
like I think that finally older workers
fade<00:03:55.960> out<00:03:56.140> and<00:03:56.410> as<00:03:56.560> you<00:03:56.680> can<00:03:56.800> see<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:57.220> blade

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
fade out and as you can see the blade

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.670 
fade out and as you can see the blade
now<00:03:58.200> he's<00:03:59.200> better<00:04:00.330> entering<00:04:01.330> a<00:04:01.630> little<00:04:02.590> bit

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
now he's better entering a little bit

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.510 
now he's better entering a little bit
better<00:04:02.860> than<00:04:03.370> before<00:04:03.550> it's<00:04:04.300> still<00:04:04.840> up<00:04:05.020> good

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
better than before it's still up good

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.170 
better than before it's still up good
see<00:04:06.520> not<00:04:06.730> perfect<00:04:07.260> but<00:04:08.260> it's<00:04:08.730> getting<00:04:09.730> there

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
see not perfect but it's getting there

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.340 
see not perfect but it's getting there
you<00:04:10.390> know<00:04:12.090> now<00:04:13.090> I'm<00:04:13.240> going<00:04:13.450> to<00:04:13.510> try<00:04:13.690> to<00:04:13.720> see<00:04:14.110> if

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
you know now I'm going to try to see if

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.640 
you know now I'm going to try to see if
they're<00:04:14.680> moving<00:04:15.010> towards<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:16.260> we<00:04:17.260> haven't

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
they're moving towards the we haven't

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.370 
they're moving towards the we haven't
read<00:04:17.890> is<00:04:18.790> going<00:04:19.090> to<00:04:19.239> finish<00:04:19.540> the<00:04:19.810> job

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
read is going to finish the job

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.850 
read is going to finish the job
okay<00:04:21.340> so<00:04:21.400> I'm<00:04:21.700> not<00:04:22.480> working<00:04:23.880> with<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.860> 3000

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
okay so I'm not working with the 3000

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:42.129 
okay so I'm not working with the 3000
great

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:49.029 

the<00:04:42.710> feeling<00:04:43.430> of<00:04:44.590> the<00:04:46.389> 303,000<00:04:47.389> grid<00:04:47.889> it<00:04:48.889> is

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
the feeling of the 303,000 grid it is

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.290 
the feeling of the 303,000 grid it is
totally<00:04:49.610> different

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
totally different

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.860 
totally different
it's<00:04:50.509> almost<00:04:50.960> as<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.770> blade<00:04:52.009> is<00:04:52.449> not<00:04:53.449> doing

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
it's almost as the blade is not doing

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.399 
it's almost as the blade is not doing
anything<00:04:54.139> just<00:04:54.680> sleeping<00:04:55.490> and<00:04:56.110> you<00:04:57.110> don't

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:57.409 
anything just sleeping and you don't

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:02.409 
anything just sleeping and you don't
feel<00:04:57.770> this<00:05:00.340> you<00:05:01.340> know<00:05:01.460> anything<00:05:01.909> is<00:05:02.060> stopping

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
feel this you know anything is stopping

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.100 
feel this you know anything is stopping
the<00:05:02.780> blade<00:05:03.050> from<00:05:03.319> just<00:05:03.650> sleeping<00:05:04.780> on<00:05:05.780> the

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
the blade from just sleeping on the

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.200 
the blade from just sleeping on the
stone<00:05:06.439> as<00:05:07.900> opposed<00:05:08.900> to<00:05:09.110> before<00:05:09.909> when<00:05:10.909> I<00:05:10.939> was

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
stone as opposed to before when I was

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.689 
stone as opposed to before when I was
using<00:05:11.449> it<00:05:11.719> on<00:05:11.870> the<00:05:11.990> 1,000<00:05:12.830> I<00:05:12.979> actually<00:05:13.250> did

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
using it on the 1,000 I actually did

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.379 
using it on the 1,000 I actually did
feel<00:05:14.060> that<00:05:14.770> there<00:05:15.770> is<00:05:15.800> some<00:05:16.190> resistance<00:05:16.729> and

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
feel that there is some resistance and

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:23.800 
feel that there is some resistance and
that<00:05:18.199> the<00:05:18.349> blade<00:05:18.590> is<00:05:19.090> you<00:05:20.090> know<00:05:20.620> being<00:05:22.810> being

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
that the blade is you know being being

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.350 
that the blade is you know being being
grinded<00:05:25.840> over<00:05:26.840> here<00:05:27.400> you<00:05:28.400> don't<00:05:28.610> feel<00:05:28.940> it<00:05:29.120> you

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
grinded over here you don't feel it you

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.390 
grinded over here you don't feel it you
feel<00:05:29.979> almost<00:05:30.979> as<00:05:31.430> the<00:05:31.610> blade<00:05:31.909> is<00:05:32.360> just

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
feel almost as the blade is just

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.529 
feel almost as the blade is just
floating<00:05:34.419> on<00:05:35.419> the<00:05:36.020> surface<00:05:36.259> of<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:36.919> stone<00:05:37.539> so

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
floating on the surface of the stone so

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:45.629 
floating on the surface of the stone so
just<00:05:38.779> gonna<00:05:38.990> give<00:05:39.169> it<00:05:39.289> the<00:05:40.689> last<00:05:41.689> few<00:05:42.879> strokes

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
just gonna give it the last few strokes

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:50.529 
just gonna give it the last few strokes
and<00:05:46.639> I'm<00:05:46.879> gonna<00:05:47.090> test<00:05:47.690> it<00:05:47.930> and<00:05:49.240> pretty<00:05:50.240> sure

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:50.539 
and I'm gonna test it and pretty sure

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:55.390 
and I'm gonna test it and pretty sure
that<00:05:51.020> this<00:05:51.289> will<00:05:51.590> finish<00:05:51.830> the<00:05:52.069> job<00:05:54.400> stone

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
that this will finish the job stone

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.300 
that this will finish the job stone
worked<00:05:55.909> on<00:05:56.210> the<00:05:56.330> 1,000<00:05:57.229> and<00:05:57.529> I<00:05:57.620> worked<00:05:57.889> it<00:05:58.099> on

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
worked on the 1,000 and I worked it on

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.680 
worked on the 1,000 and I worked it on
the<00:05:59.440> sharpening<00:06:00.500> sharpening<00:06:01.219> it<00:06:01.400> on<00:06:01.610> the<00:06:01.940> 1000

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
the sharpening sharpening it on the 1000

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.369 
the sharpening sharpening it on the 1000
then<00:06:03.080> I<00:06:03.199> sharpen<00:06:03.650> it<00:06:03.740> on<00:06:03.979> the<00:06:04.599> 3000<00:06:05.599> and<00:06:05.810> as<00:06:06.229> you

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:06.379 
then I sharpen it on the 3000 and as you

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:11.290 
then I sharpen it on the 3000 and as you
can<00:06:06.500> see<00:06:06.560> there's<00:06:07.009> some<00:06:07.669> brown<00:06:08.800> material<00:06:10.300> on

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
can see there's some brown material on

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.779 
can see there's some brown material on
the<00:06:11.419> surface<00:06:11.629> of<00:06:12.110> the<00:06:12.229> stone<00:06:12.500> both<00:06:13.219> on<00:06:13.520> both

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
the surface of the stone both on both

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:18.430 
the surface of the stone both on both
sides<00:06:14.120> and<00:06:14.479> I<00:06:15.409> think<00:06:15.680> this<00:06:15.860> is<00:06:17.020> it's<00:06:18.020> basically

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
sides and I think this is it's basically

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:24.119 
sides and I think this is it's basically
it's<00:06:18.650> the<00:06:18.919> knife<00:06:20.020> is<00:06:21.020> is<00:06:21.469> really<00:06:22.240> this<00:06:23.240> gray

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:24.129 
it's the knife is is really this gray

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:26.890 
it's the knife is is really this gray
gray<00:06:25.129> stuff<00:06:25.490> is<00:06:25.759> really<00:06:26.060> the<00:06:26.240> sharpening<00:06:26.719> of

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
gray stuff is really the sharpening of

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.070 
gray stuff is really the sharpening of
the<00:06:27.080> knife<00:06:27.550> it's<00:06:28.550> the<00:06:28.819> metal<00:06:29.060> that<00:06:29.750> the<00:06:29.900> knife

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
the knife it's the metal that the knife

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.790 
the knife it's the metal that the knife
loses<00:06:30.819> to<00:06:31.819> the<00:06:31.940> stone<00:06:32.469> looks<00:06:33.469> like<00:06:33.740> that<00:06:34.009> and

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
loses to the stone looks like that and

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.920 
loses to the stone looks like that and
it<00:06:36.800> came<00:06:37.069> it<00:06:37.400> came<00:06:37.580> out<00:06:37.789> really<00:06:38.120> nice<00:06:38.360> I<00:06:38.719> mean

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:42.139 
the blade is cutting the paper really

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:47.110 
the blade is cutting the paper really
nice<00:06:42.289> as<00:06:42.529> you<00:06:42.620> can<00:06:42.800> see<00:06:43.779> no<00:06:44.779> problemo<00:06:46.120> I'm

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 
nice as you can see no problemo I'm

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.640 
nice as you can see no problemo I'm
happy<00:06:47.779> with<00:06:47.900> the<00:06:48.110> way<00:06:48.500> the<00:06:48.800> stone<00:06:49.330> is<00:06:50.330> working

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
happy with the way the stone is working

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.659 
happy with the way the stone is working
and<00:06:52.759> it<00:06:53.759> took<00:06:53.970> me<00:06:54.030> about<00:06:54.210> 15<00:06:55.050> minutes<00:06:55.080> to<00:06:55.669> get

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:56.669 
and it took me about 15 minutes to get

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:59.689 
and it took me about 15 minutes to get
to<00:06:56.880> this<00:06:57.470> sharpness<00:06:58.470> which<00:06:59.190> is<00:06:59.340> good<00:06:59.490> enough

00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 
to this sharpness which is good enough

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:01.909 
to this sharpness which is good enough
for<00:06:59.910> me<00:07:00.090> I<00:07:00.270> mean<00:07:00.479> I<00:07:00.570> probably<00:07:00.930> could<00:07:01.139> get<00:07:01.410> even

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 
for me I mean I probably could get even

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:05.029 
for me I mean I probably could get even
better<00:07:02.340> but<00:07:03.300> you<00:07:03.690> know<00:07:03.870> for<00:07:04.229> a<00:07:04.470> kitchen<00:07:04.650> knife
