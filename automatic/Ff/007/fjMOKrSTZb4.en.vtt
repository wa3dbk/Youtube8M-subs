run<00:01:20.860> right<00:01:21.009> into<00:01:21.070> it<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.590> that<00:01:23.800> was<00:01:23.920> pretty

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
run right into it so that was pretty

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.710 
run right into it so that was pretty
special<00:01:24.250> I<00:01:27.000> think<00:01:28.000> one<00:01:28.119> of<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.300> things<00:01:28.330> about

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
special I think one of the things about

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.600 
special I think one of the things about
this<00:01:28.990> game<00:01:29.170> that's<00:01:29.350> nice<00:01:29.530> as<00:01:29.770> you<00:01:29.890> get<00:01:30.070> good<00:01:30.460> at

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
this game that's nice as you get good at

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.580 
this game that's nice as you get good at
the<00:01:30.729> game<00:01:30.759> and<00:01:31.149> there's<00:01:31.810> still<00:01:32.080> stuff<00:01:32.229> that's

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
the game and there's still stuff that's

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.859 
the game and there's still stuff that's
a<00:01:32.679> little<00:01:32.710> difficult<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:33.520> just<00:01:34.479> because<00:01:34.750> it

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
a little difficult and just because it

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.320 
a little difficult and just because it
requires<00:01:35.289> such<00:01:35.590> precision<00:01:35.950> that<00:01:36.789> any<00:01:37.000> little

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
requires such precision that any little

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.100 
requires such precision that any little
mistake<00:01:37.420> can<00:01:37.990> ruin<00:01:38.890> a<00:01:39.280> run<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.750> you've<00:01:40.899> really

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
mistake can ruin a run so you've really

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.410 
mistake can ruin a run so you've really
gotta<00:01:41.350> be<00:01:41.619> on<00:01:41.860> your<00:01:41.920> game<00:01:42.160> all<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:42.880> time<00:01:42.910> that

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
gotta be on your game all the time that

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.200
