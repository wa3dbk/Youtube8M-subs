00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.529
 back to my channel today I bring you then 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.900
 some small purchases that I made in a 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.549
 cutting opportunities center 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.750
 English is good about make - up and what 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.310
 happens is that you see that in these centers 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.410
 of opportunities because they sell it in 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.590
 this brand well I'm talking about the 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.680
 mark in helix that I think I know 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.260
 will come to mean new yor cosmetics 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:33.519
 Well, I'm going to show you a little 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:36.680
 every little thing hit who stings 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:38.449
 I usually do not usually carry it and 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.310
 Well there was quite enamels 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.590
 colors 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.810
 and well, I was really called by the 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.420
 attention this you already know that I am from 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.000
 dark colors here it looks a little 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.080
 more blue but it's a tonality 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.590
 between blue and purple are not like my 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.340
 T-shirt worth more is pulling the purple to 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.340
 see if with another light 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.110
 you see here 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.110
 and it's going to be exactly 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.659
 that color that you see there is worth the truth 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.210
 is that it is a 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:20.509
 It is a very beautiful color glaze very 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:23.730
 powerful is the number 078 and I leave it 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:30.330
 isolated tasting 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:32.340
 now the 078 and it cost me 23 euros is 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.440
 pretty good I have not tried it yet 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.600
 I'll tell you what such coverage is so 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.140
 duration that cut of finishing according 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.680
 well then now we also go to 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.740
 another that buys but this time is a 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.820
 let's say a lip dye puts that hard 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.820
 about 16 hours 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:00.729
 cosmetics and it is the tone 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.729
 498 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.840
 here it came to be this kind of format is 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.910
 as if it were a marker, then you 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.490
 you're going through your lips and it's going 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.990
 having the lip this yes I have 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.959
 tried it stays more red than I 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.220
 I wanted to but it's pretty good 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.830
 duration the truth is that it is quite 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.440
 strong now at 16 16 hours 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.390
 and more than 16 hours not bad lasts 2 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.360
 well the only drawback that 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.050
 I find this type of product is that 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.830
 I do not know if 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:43.090
 is spinning because you can not see it coming out 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.340
 product or if it is tightening that is to say no 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.630
 I do not find it as it is dosed well 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.680
 the product I do not know if it's going 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.320
 directly soaking I know what is the 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.970
 lipstick sponge I guess it does 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.870
 will soak directly 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.270
 worth another little thing 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:06.810
 a volume and zador of lips 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.850
 ballet type 2 this is the strawberry 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.340

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.260

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:26.490
 I'm here the color is quite big 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:31.050
 which is a very soft pink with a 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:34.010
 sub-golden tone of putting the drop 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.010
 with the light 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:42.599
 here we see it now 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:47.460
 It is very nice to tell you that it has vitamin 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:50.370
 It has cinnamon and it has 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:53.900
 ginger king jr 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.900
 ginger that is generated 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.320

 Well, you can see the volume effect of 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.460
 done when applying it the truth is that it 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.690
 Note plenty defect because no 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.990
 you are like a tingling sensation 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.940
 very similar to the looks of marc 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.980
 but much more intense give it the 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.510
 feeling is much stronger one the 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.500

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.810
 this I think was in four euros 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.610

 It has a completely powdery finish 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.640
 but it does show a small effect 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.500
