00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
installed yet I've just got to route it

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.939 
installed yet I've just got to route it
down<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.340> frame<00:00:17.580> here<00:00:18.350> it<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.470> installed<00:00:19.859> on

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
down the frame here it is installed on

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.840 
down the frame here it is installed on
the<00:00:20.010> post<00:00:20.250> here<00:00:20.520> need<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.939> zoom<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.300> that

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
the post here need to zoom in to that

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.279 
the post here need to zoom in to that
see<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.000> just<00:00:24.180> slides<00:00:24.420> in<00:00:24.630> right<00:00:24.810> here<00:00:25.140> and

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
see it just slides in right here and

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.800 
see it just slides in right here and
then<00:00:26.130> there's<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.430> screw<00:00:26.789> two<00:00:27.210> screws<00:00:27.570> that

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
then there's a screw two screws that

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.810 
then there's a screw two screws that
connected<00:00:28.320> right<00:00:28.439> there<00:00:28.680> that's<00:00:29.279> really<00:00:29.670> it

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
connected right there that's really it

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.170 
connected right there that's really it
for<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.810> bottom<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.759> mean<00:00:32.759> around<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.090> up

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
for the bottom I mean around it up

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.979 
for the bottom I mean around it up
through<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:34.579> then<00:00:35.579> here's<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.600> other<00:00:36.719> end<00:00:36.930> of

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
through and then here's the other end of

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.720 
through and then here's the other end of
the<00:00:37.079> cable<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:38.040> just<00:00:38.219> wraps<00:00:38.430> through<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
the cable it just wraps through the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.080 
the cable it just wraps through the
frame<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.890> a<00:00:40.890> lot<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.040> I'm<00:00:41.640> sure<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> lot<00:00:41.969> of

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
frame and a lot of I'm sure a lot of

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.290 
frame and a lot of I'm sure a lot of
bikes<00:00:42.239> probably<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> little<00:00:43.140> different<00:00:44.300> this

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
bikes probably a little different this

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.819 
bikes probably a little different this
camera<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.719> much<00:00:45.840> shorter<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.260> I've<00:00:46.620> got

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
camera is much shorter so I've got

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.200 
camera is much shorter so I've got
everything<00:00:47.309> kind<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.550> at<00:00:47.670> an<00:00:47.760> angle<00:00:47.850> here

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
everything kind of at an angle here

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.979 
everything kind of at an angle here
unfortunately<00:00:48.710> but<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.890> install<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.370> cable

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
unfortunately but to install this cable

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.479 
unfortunately but to install this cable
you<00:00:51.989> simply<00:00:53.510> slide<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:55.250> through<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.370> hole

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
you simply slide this through the hole

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.520 
you simply slide this through the hole
make<00:00:56.760> sure<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.059> get<00:00:57.360> slots<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.050> line<00:00:58.289> up

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
make sure you get slots that line up

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.639 
make sure you get slots that line up
which<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:59.039> do<00:00:59.359> now<00:01:00.359> it's<00:01:01.230> going<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> be<00:01:01.500> really

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
which we do now it's going to be really

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.070 
which we do now it's going to be really
hard<00:01:01.859> for<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.190> pull<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:03.080> probably

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
hard for you to pull that probably

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
hard for you to pull that probably
aren't<00:01:04.229> going<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> be<00:01:04.559> able<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.769> pull<00:01:04.949> it

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
aren't going to be able to pull it

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.810 
aren't going to be able to pull it
through<00:01:05.339> without<00:01:06.080> taking<00:01:07.430> pair<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.520> pliers

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
through without taking pair of pliers

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.280

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
what I was doing

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.300 
what I was doing
holding<00:02:08.500> this<00:02:08.940> like<00:02:09.940> such<00:02:10.269> here<00:02:11.130> like<00:02:12.130> that

holding this like such here like that
fully<00:02:12.670> engaged<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.540> then<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.410> made<00:02:14.590> it

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
fully engaged and then it made it

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.250 
fully engaged and then it made it
sliding<00:02:16.239> into<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.450> actual<00:02:16.780> clutch<00:02:16.989> lever

sliding into the actual clutch lever

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.210 
sliding into the actual clutch lever
really<00:02:17.769> easy<00:02:17.950> so<00:02:19.320> kind<00:02:20.320> of<00:02:20.380> a<00:02:20.440> short<00:02:20.650> video<00:02:20.950> but
