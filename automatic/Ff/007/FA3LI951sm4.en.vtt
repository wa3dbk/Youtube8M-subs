just is scary to me and it just seems

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.020 
just is scary to me and it just seems
like<00:02:05.219> natural<00:02:05.820> would<00:02:06.060> be<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.479> better<00:02:06.719> way<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.899> go

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
like natural would be a better way to go

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
and like I said breathable tears easily

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.720 
and like I said breathable tears easily
in<00:03:24.209> both<00:03:24.389> directions<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.500> it's<00:03:25.829> and<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.430> only

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
in both directions and it's and you only

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.580 
in both directions and it's and you only
need<00:03:27.150> like<00:03:27.449> about<00:03:27.750> an<00:03:27.840> inch<00:03:27.989> and<00:03:28.139> a<00:03:28.199> half<00:03:28.230> of

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
need like about an inch and a half of

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.740 
need like about an inch and a half of
the<00:03:28.650> tape<00:03:28.889> and<00:03:29.220> here<00:03:30.000> you're<00:03:30.180> getting<00:03:30.299> 10

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
the tape and here you're getting 10

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.490 
the tape and here you're getting 10
yards<00:03:31.319> and<00:03:31.620> it's<00:03:31.739> very<00:03:32.040> cheap<00:03:32.370> so<00:03:33.329> this<00:03:34.049> is<00:03:34.319> my

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
yards and it's very cheap so this is my

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.039 
yards and it's very cheap so this is my
recommendation<00:03:34.709> for<00:03:35.370> for<00:03:36.239> using<00:03:36.599> this<00:03:36.720> for

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
recommendation for for using this for

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.309 
recommendation for for using this for
your<00:03:37.199> forehead<00:03:37.849> and<00:03:38.849> so<00:03:39.299> again<00:03:39.840> we're<00:03:40.019> we're

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
treating this area here so you would

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.300 
treating this area here so you would
just<00:03:42.269> try<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.840> separate<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.680> little<00:03:43.979> bit<00:03:44.280> of

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
just try to separate that little bit of

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.199 
just try to separate that little bit of
wrinkling<00:03:44.780> put<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.930> tape<00:03:46.199> in<00:03:46.530> this<00:03:47.220> area<00:03:47.669> here

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
wrinkling put the tape in this area here
