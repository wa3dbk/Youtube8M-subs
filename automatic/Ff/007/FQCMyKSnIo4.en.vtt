00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.460
 hello I am Pablo shrimp welcome to 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.320
 planet recycles and another Thursday more with 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.720
 you wish many many many 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.259
 many many more Thursdays with you 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.480
 this time we recycle some branches of 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.239
 tree with which we will make a type 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.790
 picture or parchment or where you can hang 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:32.610
 already notified or photographs of the 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.950
 friends of the person you love in short 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.530
 It is also a very good idea to 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.950
 give this February 14 do not believe but 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.449
 as much much much much much these branches 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.420
 I found them in a park that is 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.929
 near my house I found them not thrown 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.850
 they are going to cut it, not even this is not done 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:53.219
 so if you want to know how it's done 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.470
 this little picture keeps seeing the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.470
 video 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.470
 materials 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.910
 branches a rope or loop 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:10.130
 photos cards or some memory of that 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.130
 special person 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.040
 process 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.320
 if you have and you are going to use a guide drill 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.540
 I'll give you points to know where you'll do the 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.330
 holes 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.530
 If you are a minor , ask for help from a 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.240
 adult 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.240
 and so it has to be 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.159
 if you do not have a drill you can skip 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.410
 this step after I made a first knot what 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.940
 I went through one of the holes so 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.950
 so do not leave 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.020
 and if a knot in the part where the 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.020
 another branch so you do not get off 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.590
 of the part where your design will hang 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.590
 you should leave a little more rope 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.969
 if there are no holes another idea that 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.549
 could work is that reveal the branch 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:10.149
 with the rope and tie a knot 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.149
 fix them 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.570
 and so continue to do it for all 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.570
 holes 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.269
 Y 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.840
 Something like that has to be left for you 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.560
 now it's time to decorate with photos 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.450
 letters or some memory of that person 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.590
 I used clothes hooks I painted them 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.590
 in white and ready 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.920
 What did you think about this idea? 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.140
 aside as already tomorrow is the day of san 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.330
 valentine you still have time since it is very 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.920
 easy and quick to do if you liked the 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.260

 remember to recycle is wise goodbye
