00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.270
 how was your work for the plane at 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.660
 Lyon in France in 2011 and what effects 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.660
 He had 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.610
 in the lyon I presented two works 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.590
 one is called 1051 and it has been shown to you 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:30.200
 also here in the bow is a 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:32.239
 video-installation in which a clock or 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.460
 better said needles clock 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.450
 watch play with the limit proposed by 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.450
 db for the architecture 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.829
 and then 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.980
 we also present a project much 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.739
 more ambitious in an abandoned factory 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.200
 in the outskirts of Lyon that is called 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.370
 marienbad 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.470
 and it was the reproduction of the garden from which 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:03.820
 appears in the movie a year ago marin 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.820
 Kingdom flag of the 61st years I think 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.799
 and there were several coincidences the 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.270
 window would not see the installation 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.159
 it was located more or less to the same 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.049
 height that someone had put the 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.830
 camera to do one of the more shots 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.740
 known from the movie 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.460
 what interested me in that presentation 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.460
 it was mostly 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.750
 make a garden appear like a garden 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.479
 extremely rational also French in the 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.409
 half of a vacant lot full of 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.450
 trash or absolutely abandoned of such 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.070
 way that seems like a kind 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.920
 of college photomontage but real one what 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.330
 I saw and I felt that it had fallen as 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.800
 if it was a kind of UFO in that 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.920
 Abandoned ground 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.470
 I think it was two jobs that yes 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.490
 well they were not shown in the place 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.490
 established a connection with each other 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.420
 both presented something like a 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.800
 kind of time stopped in one 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.800
 obviously in a much more way 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:22.150
 clear on the clock while on the 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.720
 another was a reference to another time and 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.720
 to another space 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.549
 what specific force does the idea reach? 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.200
 of the stopped time that reappears with 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:35.310
 Frequency in your work 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.980
 is that I try not to think too much is in 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:43.860
 general that is a concept or an image 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:46.350
 that appears without me filtering it 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.910
 So in that sense I sometimes prefer 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.880
 not inquire too no 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.450
 I feel that inevitably appears 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.830
 but I prefer not to interpret those 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.020
 contents 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.390
 It's the viewer's task 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.760
 what it means for your work one 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.250
 exhibition as Lyon air and as the 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.490
 biennial of Lyon in which your works 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.380
 between act in both cases not or so 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.650
 less dialogue with so many works 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:20.510
 international artists 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.510
 biennials are events 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.470
 that one can take advantage of different 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.470
 ways 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.910
 and it depends a lot on the state that one is 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.500
 find is not open to establish 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.200
 contacts with other people to establish 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.370
 new fantastic relationships because 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.940
 you talk to people who come from 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.489
 different sides and it takes everything very 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.470
 nice and very very rich and other times 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.180
 you get involved in work and do not 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.380
 wants to know more about the rest of the 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.690
 world 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.400
 it's strange because one travels to make a 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.870
 international sample and sometimes one is 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:01.230
 as enclosed but in general the idea 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.750
 of the finals is very interesting to 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.310
 level of exchange in general one is 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.940
 relates a lot with artists from 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.380
 different sides of the world and places 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.200
 that one does not even have thought 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.740
 to visit 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.110
 and it's that very rich experience 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.100
 how is it then to expose in the 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.100
 local circuit 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:29.080
 I do not know there's something I was wondering 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.810
 this was when he came here and 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.510
 said that the strange situation is because 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.730
 I know the city I come I come in my 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.900
 auto up here station or arrived and 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.830
 greet people is not something that does not 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.550
 happens when one is going to travel to 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:49.940
 outside not that if people 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:52.880
 let's say a few days because they do not understand 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:56.200
 and to get to places it's like 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.200
 arrive forever for the first time 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.229
 then I feel a familiarity 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:03.879
 check that obviously I do not have when 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.040
 I travel outside sive I feel that that's not 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:08.200
 It's like my house 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.630
 he spends several strange experiences 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:14.520
 also the then 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.319
 I dont know 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.910
 I feel very different as a place very 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.680
 family 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.900
 it does not have anything to do with him 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.240
 made to exhibit outside by more than 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.080
 we are all artists of different 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.080
 parts of the world 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.490
 for my test it's something very very familiar 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.490
 I feel very at home 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.560
 how do you relate to the work of a 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:42.710
 curator how you evaluate and experience the 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.370
 A curator's job is very difficult is 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.370
 very difficult 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.270
 at first imagine that it will be 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.880
 a biennial because the curator knows that 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.150
 to be the biennial 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.560
 one can read texts can even 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.560
 talk to the curator can care 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.890
 tell you things about what is going to be 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.890
 the viral 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.990
 but the 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.860
 the final notion is what one has 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:14.400
 when when you see the sample 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.400
 Y 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:22.220
 and that help is when one compares opone 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.410
 by dialogue the text that the 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:28.000
 curator the text that we read the 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:30.010
 foundation of the biennial and what one sees 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.050
 and this was one of the few cases where 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:35.060
 that I really felt 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.319
 I felt that it comes to strong connection between 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.940
 between that text and 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:42.620
 the sample 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:47.030
 apart from that it was a very rare biennial 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:48.890
 for me for my point of view because in 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.610
 a biennial as if to say a biennial 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:54.970
 expressionist a biennial with a lot 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.970
 intensity 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:01.449
 with much 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:04.110
 and presence of the artist's self with 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:05.730
 many subjective expressions 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.500
 ie the opposite of what 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.740
 it would be a cold sample of art 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.740
 conceptual 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:17.500
 I found it very emotional and all that 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.500
 he thought a lot 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.000
 and remember the text that I had read in 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.009
 a first time and I recognized that 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.789
 I knew what the text is coming from and that 

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:27.789
 it seemed very good
