00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.429
 planned to teach with some vehicles 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.769
 portatropas which at this time 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:13.230
 they carry anti- aircraft missiles whose function 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.219
 is this to keep sovereignty in our 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:21.710
 country 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:26.130
 here what are the antiaircraft 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.199
 here you can take as I come from a 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.430
 man finish this is an address that 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.610
 it's in an east 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.760
 a missile that is multiple has three 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.540
 missiles at one position and subsequently 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.600
 on this side you have the anti-aircraft guns 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.540
 whose function is to address the airspace 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.220
 As we can have that reach 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.770
 enough to be able to beat or 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.199
 serve offensive running we have good 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.750
 this is he has a special name 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.210
 this unit in this case 23 are given 3 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.370
 well and it is this one that is around here is from 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.950
 long-range 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:09.259
 which are allowed as I say 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:11.509
 factor destroy or neutralize vectors 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.610
 offensive airs how many of these 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.610
 vehicles has the air force we have 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.850
 enough enough like this 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.040
 this here the function of this is 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.380
 against two vectors offensive beings like 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.080
 know how our 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.680
 president this we are dissuasive 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.450
 we are a dissuasive air force 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.820
 peaceful we seek peace but 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.450
 we also have the we keep the 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.170
 integrity of our country of lord 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:44.140
 and the one that follows that that is a system 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.899
 radar which portable which we 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.439
 allows you to monitor the space addresses and 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.390
 this is taken as the transfer by 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.509
 we climb, I can be on land 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.220
 we bring in air normally it's going to 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.299
 favorable relative positions that we 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.390
 allow this to monitor the space of two 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.390
 hours 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.690
 lage that allows us this flavor of the 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.519
 airspace as I say no when the 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.550
 country requires us we are ready 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.620
 we to be able to watch over our 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.800
 as it is as mandated by 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.800
 Constitution
