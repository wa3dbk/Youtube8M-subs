here now fishing is one of the skills

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.330 
here now fishing is one of the skills
that<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.870> can<00:00:43.020> start<00:00:43.260> quite<00:00:43.590> early<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
that you can start quite early in the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.400 
that you can start quite early in the
game<00:00:44.520> because<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.450> doesn't<00:00:45.840> take<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.200> much

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
game because it doesn't take that much

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.650 
game because it doesn't take that much
to<00:00:46.680> get<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.160> running<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.670> think<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
to get it up and running I think the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.690 
to get it up and running I think the
pole<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.140> rest<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.739> stuff<00:00:50.129> will<00:00:50.340> run<00:00:50.520> up

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
pole and rest of the stuff will run up

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.119 
pole and rest of the stuff will run up
in<00:00:50.879> two<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.300> three<00:00:51.329> hundred<00:00:51.600> credits<00:00:52.199> which
