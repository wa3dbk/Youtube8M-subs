00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
right what about the carriage it's

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.730 
right what about the carriage it's
raised<00:02:37.580> right<00:02:38.150> because<00:02:38.630> it's<00:02:39.230> secret<00:02:39.410> from

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
raised right because it's secret from

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.080 
raised right because it's secret from
who<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.370> hypothalamus<00:02:40.640> is<00:02:41.090> working<00:02:41.950> right

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
who the hypothalamus is working right

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.340 
who the hypothalamus is working right
then<00:02:44.090> we<00:02:44.240> have<00:02:44.270> tertiary<00:02:45.370> hypothyroidism

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.190 

tertiary<00:02:51.350> hypothetical<00:02:52.010> what<00:02:52.310> do<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:52.490> see<00:02:53.200> so

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
tertiary hypothetical what do you see so

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.640 
tertiary hypothetical what do you see so
low<00:02:54.440> it's<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.550> low<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:56.210> it's<00:02:56.960> not<00:02:57.110> so<00:02:57.260> low<00:02:57.440> why

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
low it's a low and it's not so low why

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.320 
low it's a low and it's not so low why
because<00:02:58.160> touching<00:02:58.370> hyperthyroidism<00:02:59.090> is

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
because touching hyperthyroidism is

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.810 
because touching hyperthyroidism is
nothing<00:02:59.660> but<00:02:59.780> there's<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:01.160> fact<00:03:01.460> in<00:03:01.640> the

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
nothing but there's the fact in the

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.610 
nothing but there's the fact in the
hypothalamus<00:03:02.450> that's<00:03:02.720> what<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.020> TR<00:03:03.320> Chi<00:03:03.500> will

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
hypothalamus that's what the TR Chi will

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.350 
hypothalamus that's what the TR Chi will
grow<00:03:03.800> once<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.280> th<00:03:04.520> is<00:03:04.730> loaned<00:03:04.970> there<00:03:05.180> is<00:03:05.240> no

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
grow once the th is loaned there is no
