00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
we're covering the type 25 and this is

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.530 
we're covering the type 25 and this is
actually<00:00:08.429> going<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.760> be<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.970> first<00:00:09.210> assault

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
actually going to be the first assault

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.120 
actually going to be the first assault
rifle<00:00:09.929> that<00:00:09.960> I'm<00:00:10.110> covering<00:00:10.469> on<00:00:10.620> my<00:00:10.769> channel

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
rifle that I'm covering on my channel

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.009 
rifle that I'm covering on my channel
the<00:00:11.490> first<00:00:11.730> diamond<00:00:12.030> assault<00:00:12.450> rifle<00:00:12.780> for<00:00:12.900> that

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
the first diamond assault rifle for that

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.509 
the first diamond assault rifle for that
matter<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.500> reason<00:00:13.920> why<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.070> chose<00:00:14.340> the

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
matter and the reason why I chose the

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.630 
matter and the reason why I chose the
type<00:00:14.790> 25<00:00:15.120> over<00:00:15.960> let's<00:00:16.139> say<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.470> mtar<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.310> am

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
type 25 over let's say the mtar the am

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.390 
type 25 over let's say the mtar the am
94<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.630> scar-h<00:00:18.990> or<00:00:19.350> any<00:00:19.529> other<00:00:19.740> assault<00:00:20.070> rifle

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
94 the scar-h or any other assault rifle

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.400 
94 the scar-h or any other assault rifle
for<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.670> matter<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:21.060> because<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.689> type<00:00:21.960> 25

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
for that matter is because the type 25

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.470 
for that matter is because the type 25
is<00:00:22.590> probably<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.130> most<00:00:23.369> versatile<00:00:24.060> assault

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
is probably the most versatile assault

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.269 
is probably the most versatile assault
rifle<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:25.019> can<00:00:25.140> possibly<00:00:25.500> use<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:26.070> black

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
rifle that you can possibly use in black

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.339 
rifle that you can possibly use in black
ops<00:00:26.460> 2<00:00:26.609> because<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.449> fact<00:00:27.660> has<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.869> very<00:00:28.140> low

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
ops 2 because it in fact has a very low

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.410 
ops 2 because it in fact has a very low
recoil<00:00:28.590> pattern<00:00:29.130> but<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.580> also<00:00:29.730> has<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.150> very

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
recoil pattern but it also has a very

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.420 
recoil pattern but it also has a very
high<00:00:30.750> fire<00:00:31.080> rate<00:00:31.289> it's<00:00:31.470> actually<00:00:31.859> on<00:00:32.070> par<00:00:32.399> with

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
high fire rate it's actually on par with

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.560 
high fire rate it's actually on par with
the<00:00:32.759> mp7

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
the mp7

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.450 
the mp7
and<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.020> vector<00:00:34.350> k10<00:00:34.559> which<00:00:34.950> are<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.309> course

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
and the vector k10 which are of course

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.910 
and the vector k10 which are of course
smg's<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.329> they<00:00:36.750> also<00:00:36.989> just<00:00:37.380> like<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.620> type

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
smg's and they also just like the type

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.220 
smg's and they also just like the type
25<00:00:38.250> shoot<00:00:38.640> at<00:00:38.730> about<00:00:38.940> 900<00:00:39.719> rounds<00:00:40.020> per<00:00:40.110> minute

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
25 shoot at about 900 rounds per minute

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.560 
25 shoot at about 900 rounds per minute
now<00:00:40.770> because<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.489> type<00:00:41.730> 25<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.420> in

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
now because of that the type 25 is in

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.479 
now because of that the type 25 is in
fact<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.930> very<00:00:43.230> great<00:00:43.590> gun<00:00:43.829> even<00:00:44.190> at<00:00:44.309> close

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
fact a very great gun even at close

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.250 
fact a very great gun even at close
ranges<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.750> kind<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.079> reason

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
ranges and that is kind of the reason

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.630 
ranges and that is kind of the reason
why<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.500> feel<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> most

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
why I feel like that is the most

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.490 
why I feel like that is the most
versatile<00:00:48.180> gun<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.629> because<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.230> I

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
versatile gun and because of that I

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.200 
versatile gun and because of that I
actually<00:00:49.680> put<00:00:50.100> together<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.489> very<00:00:50.820> Russia

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
actually put together a very Russia

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.150 
actually put together a very Russia
friendly<00:00:51.629> class<00:00:51.870> as<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.469> can<00:00:52.620> see<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:53.039> the

friendly class as Russia friendly as it

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.990 
friendly class as Russia friendly as it
is<00:01:13.740> firstly<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.460> quick-draw<00:01:14.970> handle

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
is firstly the quick-draw handle

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.999 
is firstly the quick-draw handle
allowing<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.259> zoom<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.979> little

allowing you to zoom in just a little

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.320 
allowing you to zoom in just a little
bit<00:01:17.220> faster<00:01:17.729> when<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:17.939> comes<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.240> those

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
bit faster when it comes to those

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.149 
bit faster when it comes to those
close-range<00:01:18.869> engagements<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:20.040> is

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
close-range engagements and this is

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.560 
close-range engagements and this is
actually<00:01:20.580> kind<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> thing<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.210> makes

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
actually kind of the thing that makes

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.300 
actually kind of the thing that makes
this<00:01:21.720> class<00:01:21.930> combined<00:01:22.500> with<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.770> adjustable

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
this class combined with the adjustable

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.100 
this class combined with the adjustable
stock<00:01:23.580> which<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> third<00:01:24.540> attachment<00:01:25.020> on

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
stock which is the third attachment on

my gun because those two together kind

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.760 
my gun because those two together kind
of<00:01:27.150> create<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.689> same<00:01:27.960> effect<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.619> would

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
of create the same effect that you would

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.830 
of create the same effect that you would
usually<00:01:28.920> get<00:01:29.280> with<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.579> SMGs<00:01:30.090> because<00:01:30.720> of

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
usually get with the SMGs because of

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.969 
usually get with the SMGs because of
course<00:01:31.049> thanks<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> quick-draw<00:01:31.770> handle

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
course thanks to the quick-draw handle

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.800 
course thanks to the quick-draw handle
you<00:01:32.430> zoom<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:32.970> as<00:01:33.150> fast<00:01:33.420> as<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.689> would

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
you zoom in just as fast as you would

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.319 
you zoom in just as fast as you would
normally<00:01:34.229> do<00:01:34.409> an<00:01:34.590> SMG<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.430> fact<00:01:35.880> you're<00:01:36.030> zoomin

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
normally do an SMG in fact you're zoomin

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.450 
normally do an SMG in fact you're zoomin
even<00:01:36.600> faster<00:01:37.049> they<00:01:37.170> would<00:01:37.320> normally<00:01:37.650> do<00:01:37.770> SMG

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
even faster they would normally do SMG

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.310 
even faster they would normally do SMG
and<00:01:38.670> because<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.420> adjustable<00:01:39.990> stock<00:01:40.170> you

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
and because of the adjustable stock you

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.990 
and because of the adjustable stock you
can<00:01:40.470> strafe<00:01:40.799> around<00:01:40.829> corners<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.759> you

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
can strafe around corners just like you

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.240 
can strafe around corners just like you
would<00:01:42.150> normally<00:01:42.600> do<00:01:42.810> with<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.140> SMGs<00:01:43.680> now<00:01:44.159> of

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
would normally do with the SMGs now of

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.740 
would normally do with the SMGs now of
course<00:01:44.460> with<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> assault<00:01:45.030> rifles<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.420> can't

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
course with the assault rifles you can't

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.300 
course with the assault rifles you can't
stray<00:01:46.049> round<00:01:46.259> horns<00:01:46.680> if<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.860> don't<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
stray round horns if you don't have the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.280 
stray round horns if you don't have the
adjustable<00:01:47.820> stock<00:01:48.030> simply<00:01:48.720> because<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.110> move

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
adjustable stock simply because you move

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.080 
adjustable stock simply because you move
way<00:01:49.560> too<00:01:49.590> slow<00:01:50.100> if<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.670> with<00:01:50.790> empty

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
way too slow if you do it with empty

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.999 
way too slow if you do it with empty
adjustable<00:01:51.509> stock<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:51.840> therefore<00:01:52.290> definitely

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
adjustable stock so therefore definitely

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.350 
adjustable stock so therefore definitely
put<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.520> adjustable<00:01:54.060> stock<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.329> don't

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
put on the adjustable stock you don't

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.969 
put on the adjustable stock you don't
have<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.810> put<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.229> quick-draw<00:01:55.649> handle<00:01:55.680> if

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
have to put on the quick-draw handle if

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.740 
have to put on the quick-draw handle if
you<00:01:56.040> don't<00:01:56.250> want<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:57.030> can<00:01:57.210> easily<00:01:57.360> switch

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
you don't want to you can easily switch

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.480 
you don't want to you can easily switch
it<00:01:57.899> up<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.170> something<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.770> fast<00:01:59.070> mags<00:01:59.310> or

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
it up with something like fast mags or

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.100 
it up with something like fast mags or
anything<00:01:59.759> else<00:02:00.060> for<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.270> matter<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.750> then

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
anything else for that matter and then

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.749 
anything else for that matter and then
last<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:01.469> not<00:02:01.590> least<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.920> use<00:02:02.040> these<00:02:02.189> silencers

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
last but not least I use these silencers

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.280 
last but not least I use these silencers
simply<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.329> stay<00:02:03.540> off<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.869> mini-map<00:02:04.140> while

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
simply to stay off the mini-map while

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.020 
simply to stay off the mini-map while
I'm<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.799> enemy<00:02:05.070> spawns<00:02:05.399> because<00:02:05.939> of

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
I'm in the enemy spawns because of

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.340 
I'm in the enemy spawns because of
course<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.360> don't<00:02:06.600> want<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.869> show<00:02:07.049> up<00:02:07.200> as<00:02:07.320> a

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
course you don't want to show up as a

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.600 
course you don't want to show up as a

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
when you're in the enemy spawns because

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.780 
when you're in the enemy spawns because
if<00:02:10.380> that<00:02:10.500> happens<00:02:10.710> you<00:02:11.040> are<00:02:11.190> most<00:02:11.460> likely

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
if that happens you are most likely

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.150 
if that happens you are most likely
going<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.420> die<00:02:12.810> now<00:02:13.410> taking<00:02:13.740> a<00:02:13.800> look<00:02:13.830> at<00:02:14.040> my

course use the Galesburg now this of

course use the Galesburg now this of
course<00:02:17.820> a<00:02:18.120> great<00:02:18.360> combination<00:02:18.750> together<00:02:19.200> with

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
course a great combination together with

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.230 
course a great combination together with
the<00:02:19.620> silencer<00:02:20.190> because<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.820> course<00:02:21.000> if<00:02:21.150> you

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
the silencer because of course if you

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.730 
the silencer because of course if you
are<00:02:21.360> rushing<00:02:21.630> around<00:02:21.720> he<00:02:22.020> goes<00:02:22.230> for<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.530> keeps

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
are rushing around he goes for a keeps

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.470 
are rushing around he goes for a keeps
you<00:02:22.860> off<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.220> mini-map<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.820> together<00:02:24.300> with

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
you off the mini-map and together with

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.150 
you off the mini-map and together with
the<00:02:24.600> silencer<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.200> also<00:02:25.350> won't<00:02:25.680> show<00:02:25.980> up<00:02:26.010> on

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
the silencer you also won't show up on

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.650 
the silencer you also won't show up on
the<00:02:26.280> mini-map<00:02:26.610> when<00:02:26.790> you're<00:02:26.940> actually<00:02:27.360> firing

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
the mini-map when you're actually firing

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.930 
the mini-map when you're actually firing
so<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.350> ghost<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:28.740> silencer<00:02:29.250> combination<00:02:29.790> is

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
so the ghost in silencer combination is

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.130 
so the ghost in silencer combination is
definitely<00:02:30.450> something<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.080> would

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
definitely something that I would

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.350 
definitely something that I would
recommend<00:02:31.410> on<00:02:31.860> basically<00:02:32.490> every<00:02:32.850> single<00:02:33.180> gun

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
recommend on basically every single gun

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.000 
recommend on basically every single gun
for<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.630> matter<00:02:33.780> now<00:02:34.320> take<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.560> look<00:02:34.800> at<00:02:34.920> my

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
for that matter now take a look at my

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.710 
for that matter now take a look at my
second<00:02:35.400> perks<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.850> in<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.120> case<00:02:36.330> I<00:02:36.540> use

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
second perks and in this case I use

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.750 
second perks and in this case I use
toughness<00:02:37.260> in<00:02:37.410> scavenger<00:02:38.010> both<00:02:38.490> of<00:02:38.640> these

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
toughness in scavenger both of these

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.490 
toughness in scavenger both of these
perks<00:02:39.060> aren't<00:02:39.330> effect<00:02:39.600> very<00:02:39.870> great<00:02:40.110> toughness

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
perks aren't effect very great toughness

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.990 
perks aren't effect very great toughness
make<00:02:40.680> sure<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.070> you<00:02:41.190> don't<00:02:41.370> flinch<00:02:41.700> off<00:02:41.850> of

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
make sure that you don't flinch off of

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.760 
make sure that you don't flinch off of
target<00:02:42.360> winner<00:02:42.540> actually<00:02:43.020> being<00:02:43.230> shot<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:43.650> in

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
target winner actually being shot so in

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.830 
target winner actually being shot so in
those<00:02:43.860> close-quarters<00:02:44.550> situations

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
those close-quarters situations

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.000 
those close-quarters situations
toughness<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:46.020> kind<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.440> must-have<00:02:46.800> and

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
toughness is kind of a must-have and

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.530 
toughness is kind of a must-have and
it's<00:02:47.160> definitely<00:02:47.520> going<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.000> save<00:02:48.360> your<00:02:48.480> ass

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
it's definitely going to save your ass

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.990 
it's definitely going to save your ass
quite<00:02:49.020> a<00:02:49.050> few<00:02:49.260> times<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.770> scavenger<00:02:50.700> because

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
quite a few times and scavenger because

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.460 
quite a few times and scavenger because
like<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:51.240> said<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.720> start<00:02:51.959> of<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.080> video<00:02:52.170> the

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
like I said the start of the video the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.740 
like I said the start of the video the
type<00:02:52.740> 25<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.520> very<00:02:53.820> high<00:02:54.030> fire<00:02:54.330> rate<00:02:54.570> and

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
type 25 is a very high fire rate and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.570 
type 25 is a very high fire rate and
with<00:02:55.170> that<00:02:55.320> high<00:02:55.440> fire<00:02:55.709> rate<00:02:55.860> also<00:02:56.070> comes<00:02:56.490> from

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
with that high fire rate also comes from

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.340 
with that high fire rate also comes from
crack<00:02:56.820> if<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.090> run<00:02:57.330> out<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.480> ammo<00:02:57.720> quite<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.140> lot

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
crack if you run out of ammo quite a lot

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.170 
crack if you run out of ammo quite a lot
so<00:02:58.590> scavenger<00:02:59.070> is<00:02:59.220> going<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.550> help<00:02:59.790> you<00:02:59.940> out<00:03:00.030> in

single<00:03:05.910> class<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.300> I<00:03:06.540> posted<00:03:06.930> so<00:03:07.140> far<00:03:07.170> we

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
single class that I posted so far we

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.710 
single class that I posted so far we
just<00:03:07.950> exterior<00:03:08.580> actually<00:03:08.940> allows<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.510> aim

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
just exterior actually allows you to aim

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.930 
just exterior actually allows you to aim
down<00:03:09.750> sights<00:03:10.290> faster<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:11.040> also<00:03:11.280> allows<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:11.910> to

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
down sights faster it also allows you to

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.240 
down sights faster it also allows you to
hipfire<00:03:12.450> faster<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:13.560> also<00:03:13.650> allows<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.220> to

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
hipfire faster and it also allows you to

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.580 
hipfire faster and it also allows you to
climb<00:03:14.670> obstacles<00:03:15.269> and<00:03:15.420> mental<00:03:15.780> obstacles<00:03:15.959> Fox

climb obstacles and mental obstacles Fox

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.810 
climb obstacles and mental obstacles Fox
that<00:03:16.800> you<00:03:16.890> would<00:03:17.010> normally<00:03:17.160> do

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
that you would normally do

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.400 
that you would normally do
now<00:03:18.090> in<00:03:18.209> those<00:03:18.330> close<00:03:18.570> quarter<00:03:18.930> situations

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
now in those close quarter situations

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.690 
now in those close quarter situations
you<00:03:19.470> might<00:03:19.620> think<00:03:19.920> that's<00:03:20.070> not<00:03:20.310> going<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:20.580> help

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
you might think that's not going to help

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.430 
you might think that's not going to help
you<00:03:20.880> out<00:03:21.000> that<00:03:21.209> much<00:03:21.239> but<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.900> main<00:03:22.080> reason

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
you out that much but the main reason

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.229 
you out that much but the main reason
that<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:22.620> actually<00:03:22.830> use<00:03:23.220> dexterity<00:03:23.820> is<00:03:23.940> because

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
that I actually use dexterity is because

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.030 
that I actually use dexterity is because
the<00:03:24.420> fact<00:03:24.600> that<00:03:24.720> we<00:03:24.930> -<00:03:25.230> they're<00:03:25.500> deeper<00:03:25.830> it

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
the fact that we - they're deeper it

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.400 
the fact that we - they're deeper it
becomes<00:03:26.160> very<00:03:26.700> very<00:03:27.000> easy<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.989> flank<00:03:28.290> your

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
becomes very very easy to flank your

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.360 
becomes very very easy to flank your
opponents<00:03:28.920> let's<00:03:29.070> say<00:03:29.220> you're<00:03:29.340> playing

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
opponents let's say you're playing

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.430 
opponents let's say you're playing
something<00:03:29.940> like<00:03:30.269> team<00:03:30.660> deathmatch<00:03:30.870> on<00:03:31.140> Yemen

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
something like team deathmatch on Yemen

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.140 
something like team deathmatch on Yemen
and<00:03:31.800> they're<00:03:32.100> actually<00:03:32.310> camping<00:03:32.940> in<00:03:33.060> the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
and they're actually camping in the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.850 
and they're actually camping in the
building<00:03:33.510> in<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.720> back<00:03:33.900> now<00:03:34.080> with<00:03:34.230> dexterity

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
building in the back now with dexterity

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.500 
building in the back now with dexterity
it's<00:03:35.220> only<00:03:35.400> gonna<00:03:35.610> take<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:36.030> about<00:03:36.209> five

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
it's only gonna take you about five

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.390 
it's only gonna take you about five
seconds<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.170> get<00:03:37.290> up<00:03:37.470> there<00:03:37.650> by<00:03:37.860> climbing<00:03:38.370> the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
seconds to get up there by climbing the

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.430 
seconds to get up there by climbing the
rocks<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.390> course<00:03:39.600> without<00:03:39.780> dexterity

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
rocks and of course without dexterity

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.080 
rocks and of course without dexterity
that's<00:03:40.560> going<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:40.830> take<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.190> literally<00:03:41.550> ages

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
that's going to take you literally ages

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.850 
that's going to take you literally ages
so<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.330> is<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.540> main<00:03:42.840> reason<00:03:42.870> why<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.440> used

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
so that is the main reason why I used

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.420 
so that is the main reason why I used
