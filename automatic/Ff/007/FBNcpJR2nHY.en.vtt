00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.820
 Hi 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.989
 today's coach from rubber fish fishing yes 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.579
 not the classic rubber fish on land 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.379
 I am natural or fishing 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.790
 but actually she does not do it 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.210
 always like to throw a few 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.559
 it always like to have stayed and I 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.660
 I've been relatively slim is part 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.280
 decided today because the rather less 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.230
 Rights are to be expected there in the open water 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.030
 but further in something deeper 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.530
 maybe more on the tooth and 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.110
 there are slim rubbers to me always that 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.670
 ideal but there is a problem where 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.519
 I have my box with mine here 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.780
 slim body and slim 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:11.420
 Body as I said very good for pharmacists 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.340
 I have the beautiful nice soft here 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.010
 Rubber compound they move very well 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.110
 but everything is so difficult 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.680
 box with slim bodies like me though 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.650
 me once 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.290
 because, for once, throw a few 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:27.530
 user so it is the problem i 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.360
 have now had a 10 gram head and 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.860
 I'd like to switch to me now 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.680
 would like to get to the bottom a bit faster 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.109
 and I want a bit harder and me 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.509
 say a little more bells on 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:40.429
 tomorrow 3 kopp the beautiful too 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.219
 feel the route that makes you even the 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:47.060
 Zander really salvaged and therefore take 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:49.280
 I'm all heavy lead now I come 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.929
 So take a 15 gram lead now 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.329
 head that this flat this 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.890
 waters relatively heavy and never 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.549
 do not forget do not take too long 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.139
 hagen many anglers try convulsively 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.729
 The hooks here behind their exit to 

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:03.380
 do not let then you stiffen the 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.909
 whole rubber fish and when he comes on 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.219
 then only the rear part causes 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.990
 not if he can be short and here 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:10.880
 the front comes out then the whole thing 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.800
 things are about to snap off and that's exactly what 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.680
 makes the ex crucial stimulus appeal 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.209
 in the moment where the bottom is ticking 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.010
 So 15 grams of lead head is already one 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.240
 a little bit big and now you look 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.590
 time on here shows the camera so yes 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.140
 if I agree with this beautiful one now 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.080
 take and push me on the blog 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.280
 or at the top , yes, yes 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.879
 to bump your eyes 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.470
 a giant global front not really 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.459
 beautiful 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.390
 that is the problem of 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.640
 slim soft lures 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.709
 I hurdle this but like a lot needs 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.470
 to make a little something on lead head 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.450
 you can buy them the heads 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.000
 not that little bump here in front 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.860
 yes, where have this knob the yes 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.520
 rubber fish should hold on completely 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.750
 I hope I can find one now 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.730
 yes here I have one I need it with 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.510
 which brand that is but has 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.820
 none at all 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.600
 he has a little hook cd here 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:16.860
 This hook will do the same 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.570
 he has the huge advantage that the 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.110
 rubber fish not disfigured 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:25.380
 you can do the thing so beautiful spirits 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.660
 Push forward and hook 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.750
 The parents really nice the rubber 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.510
 fishproof without bumping it 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.700
 or to be ripped off 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.890
 now you want to be 30 varieties heads 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.890
 In the program you can be there on the 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.820
 help water easily 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.350
 this is a bit 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.670
 oversized the thing I have 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.930
 my little side and not 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.600
 That's why I take my big one 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.220
 I have to blow up to trippers 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.650
 when the motives are in the house 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.299
 that is in holland is desired 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.049
 if I am here with the 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.760
 page cutter go there yes and three 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:07.980
 times in the course then I've been here 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:10.030
 free the lead from the head you can 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.960
 look very nice now 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.990
 If we are so a bit 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.670
 pushed back the thing then do 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.760
 I now with name Seitschneider here 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:23.660
 very carefully the whole lead neck 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.190
 here from the bait always nice 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.710
 on the blogs do not settle here 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.040
 sabine against falls thus avoid 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.040
 can 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.710
 that is possible a bit early 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.360
 especially in a completely ungar one 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.950
 Side cutters, of course, much too long 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.560
 is now working for this is a 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.650
 emergency solution not because I just now 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:47.300
 would have accepted none without 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:49.430
 this lead neck and zack finished there 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.060
 we have the lead head wonderful without 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.190
 lead neck very important and can 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.130
 so that's how it works 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.930
 but if you are so messy 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.580
 reason then shifts the rubber 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.740
 It is clear that freedom has its own 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.180
 Sinning solling that comedian hold on 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.760
 that's why I always have a bit 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.750
 second adhesive of a bag and me 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.970
 do not do that like many 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.960
 Specialists then here in front one 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.220
 make drips on it 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:21.170
 yes, and then they kind of leave that 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:22.160
 rubber fish often use the look yes then 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.400
 he sticks to the front 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.440
 I do not like that because it comes 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.820
 more often before that the three heads themselves 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.620
 not so good with that 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.240
 second adhesive then the white will bloom 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.950
 testify as disgusting 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.660
 That's why I'm just doing a little here 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.260
 layer of adhesive on the hook 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.990
 leg 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.750
 that does not last as well but it is me 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.600
 Do not take that so loud now 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.860
 from the native beautiful white them 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.780
 the easy and ready is the paint 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.980
 that lasts well enough and therefore quite a few 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.960
 to be able to throw 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.360
 the rubber for not deface the 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.110
 eyes are already clean can be 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.060
 pull on it 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:03.190
 that's what it must look like now it can start 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.190
 People often go out of their way to happiness
