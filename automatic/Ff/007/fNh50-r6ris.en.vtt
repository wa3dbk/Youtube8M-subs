hi I'm Douglas Rainey Master Cooper at
Sagamore<00:00:08.290> Napa<00:00:08.920> California<00:00:09.450> I'm<00:00:10.450> going<00:00:10.719> to

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:10.780 
Sagamore Napa California I'm going to

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.689 
Sagamore Napa California I'm going to
show<00:00:10.930> you<00:00:10.959> how<00:00:11.260> we<00:00:11.320> pressure<00:00:11.920> check<00:00:12.250> barrels

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:12.699 
show you how we pressure check barrels

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:14.670 
show you how we pressure check barrels
to<00:00:12.910> check<00:00:13.119> for<00:00:13.360> any<00:00:13.570> leaks<00:00:13.690> that<00:00:14.170> we<00:00:14.289> may<00:00:14.440> find

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
to check for any leaks that we may find

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.029 
to check for any leaks that we may find
in<00:00:14.920> the<00:00:15.039> wood<00:00:15.250> we<00:00:15.850> have<00:00:16.029> two<00:00:16.299> gallons<00:00:16.720> of<00:00:17.039> 140

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
in the wood we have two gallons of 140

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.060 
in the wood we have two gallons of 140
degree<00:00:18.430> water<00:00:18.789> and<00:00:19.119> say<00:00:19.660> the<00:00:19.840> barrel<00:00:20.170> I'm<00:00:20.770> now

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
degree water and say the barrel I'm now

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.640 
degree water and say the barrel I'm now
gonna<00:00:21.280> apply<00:00:21.670> and<00:00:22.090> a<00:00:22.360> test<00:00:22.780> bong<00:00:23.080> it<00:00:23.320> has<00:00:23.620> a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
gonna apply and a test bong it has a

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.210 
gonna apply and a test bong it has a
one-way<00:00:24.580> valve<00:00:24.610> on<00:00:25.150> the<00:00:25.270> inside<00:00:25.720> it<00:00:26.410> opens<00:00:26.950> and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
one-way valve on the inside it opens and

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.609 
one-way valve on the inside it opens and
allows<00:00:27.400> air<00:00:27.940> pressure<00:00:28.240> to<00:00:28.539> go<00:00:28.690> in<00:00:28.869> and<00:00:29.110> then<00:00:29.470> it

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
allows air pressure to go in and then it

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.529 
allows air pressure to go in and then it
closes<00:00:29.920> when<00:00:30.310> we<00:00:30.460> take<00:00:30.760> out<00:00:30.940> the<00:00:31.090> air<00:00:31.240> pressure

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
closes when we take out the air pressure

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.470 
closes when we take out the air pressure
so<00:00:31.869> the<00:00:32.590> air<00:00:32.770> and<00:00:32.949> water<00:00:33.190> trapped<00:00:33.850> inside<00:00:34.090> the

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
so the air and water trapped inside the

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.180 
so the air and water trapped inside the
barrel<00:00:34.840> and<00:00:34.989> the<00:00:35.199> air<00:00:35.350> should<00:00:35.649> force<00:00:35.980> the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
barrel and the air should force the

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.579 
barrel and the air should force the
water<00:00:36.340> through<00:00:36.489> any<00:00:36.999> weak<00:00:37.659> spots<00:00:38.019> that<00:00:38.230> may<00:00:38.530> be

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:38.589 
water through any weak spots that may be

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:41.309 
water through any weak spots that may be
on<00:00:38.829> the<00:00:38.980> barrel<00:00:39.370> and<00:00:39.519> if<00:00:40.300> we<00:00:40.480> find<00:00:40.719> any<00:00:41.050> leaks

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:41.319 
on the barrel and if we find any leaks

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:43.139 
on the barrel and if we find any leaks
I'll<00:00:41.589> show<00:00:41.920> you<00:00:41.980> the<00:00:42.190> proper<00:00:42.579> way<00:00:42.609> that<00:00:42.789> they

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
I'll show you the proper way that they

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:56.740 
I'll show you the proper way that they
should<00:00:43.179> be<00:00:43.359> fixed

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.020 

firstly<00:00:57.530> I'm<00:00:57.710> going<00:00:57.890> to<00:00:57.980> check<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.400> heads<00:00:58.670> and

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
firstly I'm going to check the heads and

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.930 
firstly I'm going to check the heads and
their<00:00:59.150> own<00:00:59.300> there<00:00:59.570> ends<00:00:59.990> of<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.230> steps<00:01:00.880> see<00:01:01.880> if

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
their own there ends of the steps see if

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.340 
their own there ends of the steps see if
we<00:01:02.060> can<00:01:02.239> find<00:01:02.480> any<00:01:02.720> leaks

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
we can find any leaks

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.500 
we can find any leaks
if<00:01:03.680> not<00:01:04.339> I'll<00:01:04.820> check<00:01:05.300> the<00:01:05.449> body<00:01:05.690> of<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:06.020> barrel

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
if not I'll check the body of the barrel

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.130 
if not I'll check the body of the barrel
and<00:01:08.510> we<00:01:08.570> have<00:01:09.350> a<00:01:09.380> leak<00:01:10.240> so<00:01:11.240> I'll<00:01:11.479> show<00:01:11.720> you<00:01:11.780> the

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
and we have a leak so I'll show you the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:20.600 
and we have a leak so I'll show you the
proper<00:01:12.410> way<00:01:12.650> to<00:01:12.680> fix<00:01:13.070> this<00:01:13.310> one

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.670 

now<00:01:21.030> I'm<00:01:21.180> going<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.479> scrape<00:01:21.689> away<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.049> water

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
now I'm going to scrape away the water

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.800 
now I'm going to scrape away the water
this<00:01:23.070> Lincoln<00:01:23.460> here<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.880> that'll<00:01:24.360> allow<00:01:24.420> me

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
this Lincoln here and that'll allow me

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.260 
this Lincoln here and that'll allow me
to<00:01:24.990> see<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.380> exact<00:01:25.799> point<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.759> water<00:01:27.000> is

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
to see the exact point that the water is

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.630 
to see the exact point that the water is
being<00:01:27.479> forced<00:01:27.869> through<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.229> wood<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:29.369> I'm

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
being forced through the wood so I'm

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.080 
being forced through the wood so I'm
going<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.939> use<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.390> peg<00:01:30.840> here<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.680> hammer

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
going to use the peg here and the hammer

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.609 
going to use the peg here and the hammer
with<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.240> peg<00:01:33.479> I'm<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.110> punch<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.590> hole

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
with the peg I'm going to punch a hole

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.560 
with the peg I'm going to punch a hole
where<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.729> water's<00:01:36.210> coming<00:01:36.420> through<00:01:38.570> going

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
where the water's coming through going

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.770 
where the water's coming through going
to<00:01:39.630> take<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> pack<00:01:40.229> out<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:41.330> fill<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.570> hole

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
to take the pack out and fill the hole

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.620 
to take the pack out and fill the hole
I've<00:01:43.229> made<00:01:43.590> with<00:01:43.830> this<00:01:44.039> bio<00:01:44.490> here<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.000> almost

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
I've made with this bio here is almost

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.570 
I've made with this bio here is almost
like<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.899> wooden<00:01:46.289> golf<00:01:46.890> tee<00:01:49.130> now<00:01:50.130> I'm<00:01:50.280> going<00:01:50.490> to

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
like a wooden golf tee now I'm going to

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.850 
like a wooden golf tee now I'm going to
insert<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.509> hole<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.960> we<00:01:52.080> made<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:54.860> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
insert and the hole that we made and the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.820 
insert and the hole that we made and the
sounder<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.429> barrel<00:01:56.789> tells<00:01:57.060> me<00:01:57.330> that<00:01:57.479> the

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
sounder the barrel tells me that the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.249 
sounder the barrel tells me that the
spiral<00:01:58.830> is<00:01:58.950> all<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.459> way<00:01:59.580> in<00:01:59.610> I'm<00:02:00.090> now<00:02:01.049> going

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
spiral is all the way in I'm now going

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.749 
spiral is all the way in I'm now going
to<00:02:01.350> trim<00:02:01.679> off<00:02:01.830> this<00:02:02.039> by<00:02:04.159> one<00:02:05.159> side<00:02:05.459> then<00:02:05.729> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
to trim off this by one side then the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.090 
to trim off this by one side then the
other<00:02:08.989> once<00:02:09.989> it's<00:02:10.170> off<00:02:10.380> we're<00:02:10.649> going<00:02:10.799> to<00:02:10.890> use

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
other once it's off we're going to use

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.059 
other once it's off we're going to use
some<00:02:11.459> sandpaper<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.540> smooth<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.959> over<00:02:14.090> and

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
some sandpaper to smooth it over and

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.770 
some sandpaper to smooth it over and
anywhere<00:02:17.069> you<00:02:17.130> scrape<00:02:17.730> would<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.239> open<00:02:18.599> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
anywhere you scrape would you open the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.039 
anywhere you scrape would you open the
pores<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.410> we<00:02:19.739> always<00:02:19.920> use<00:02:20.099> some<00:02:20.519> sandpaper<00:02:21.049> to

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
pores so we always use some sandpaper to

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.140 
pores so we always use some sandpaper to
close<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.530> pores<00:02:22.799> back<00:02:23.099> up<00:02:23.340> on<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.730> end<00:02:23.970> of

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
close the pores back up on the end of

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.930 
close the pores back up on the end of
the<00:02:24.299> sleeve<00:02:24.570> here<00:02:24.920> after<00:02:25.920> sandpaper<00:02:26.459> in<00:02:26.730> the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
the sleeve here after sandpaper in the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.000 
the sleeve here after sandpaper in the
wood<00:02:27.359> to<00:02:27.600> make<00:02:27.750> all<00:02:27.989> nice<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.500> smooth<00:02:28.769> I'm

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
wood to make all nice and smooth I'm

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.949 
wood to make all nice and smooth I'm
going<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.489> look<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:29.940> check<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.480> rest<00:02:30.690> of<00:02:30.870> the

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
going to look and check the rest of the

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.050 
going to look and check the rest of the
barrel<00:02:31.350> because<00:02:31.799> now<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.250> pressure<00:02:32.700> is

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
barrel because now the pressure is

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.060 
barrel because now the pressure is
wanting<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.450> find<00:02:33.780> another<00:02:34.200> weak<00:02:34.530> spot<00:02:34.859> if

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
wanting to find another weak spot if

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.860 
wanting to find another weak spot if
there's<00:02:35.430> another<00:02:35.700> weak<00:02:35.970> spot<00:02:36.239> in<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.420> barrel

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
there's another weak spot in the barrel

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.600 
there's another weak spot in the barrel
we'll<00:02:37.470> show<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.650> how<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:37.920> fix<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.519> too

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.660 

and<00:02:42.700> you<00:02:43.390> can<00:02:43.570> see<00:02:43.780> on<00:02:43.960> the<00:02:44.830> other<00:02:45.040> head<00:02:45.400> at<00:02:45.580> the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
and you can see on the other head at the

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.520 
and you can see on the other head at the
barrel<00:02:46.030> we<00:02:46.180> have<00:02:46.210> our<00:02:46.480> green<00:02:46.750> leek<00:02:47.020> on<00:02:47.320> the

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
barrel we have our green leek on the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.250 
barrel we have our green leek on the
head<00:02:47.740> so<00:02:48.580> this<00:02:49.210> is<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.420> completely<00:02:50.020> different

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
head so this is a completely different

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260 
head so this is a completely different
facts<00:02:50.830> from<00:02:51.100> what<00:02:51.340> we<00:02:51.490> just<00:02:51.520> done<00:02:51.940> on<00:02:52.210> the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
facts from what we just done on the

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.260 
facts from what we just done on the
other<00:02:52.450> side<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:54.040> now<00:02:54.460> I'm<00:02:54.610> going<00:02:54.820> to<00:02:54.910> scrape

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
other side so now I'm going to scrape

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.260 
other side so now I'm going to scrape
the<00:02:55.510> wood<00:02:55.720> here<00:02:56.110> when<00:02:56.770> I<00:02:56.800> scrape<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.370> wood<00:02:57.610> you

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
the wood here when I scrape the wood you

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.830 
the wood here when I scrape the wood you
can<00:02:58.450> see<00:02:58.690> this<00:02:58.990> direction<00:02:59.680> is<00:03:00.010> smooth<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:01.600> that

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
can see this direction is smooth so that

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.050 
can see this direction is smooth so that
means<00:03:02.080> I'm<00:03:02.290> going<00:03:02.530> wet<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.950> green<00:03:03.190> the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
means I'm going wet the green the

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.840 
means I'm going wet the green the
opposite<00:03:04.600> direction<00:03:04.780> is<00:03:05.440> rough<00:03:05.860> so<00:03:06.190> I'm<00:03:06.580> going

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
opposite direction is rough so I'm going

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.690 
opposite direction is rough so I'm going
against<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:07.360> grain<00:03:07.600> so<00:03:07.810> I<00:03:08.530> know<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.070> fix<00:03:09.520> this

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
against the grain so I know to fix this

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.120 
against the grain so I know to fix this
particular<00:03:10.090> type<00:03:10.780> of<00:03:10.810> leek<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.470> have<00:03:11.770> to<00:03:11.950> go

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
particular type of leek I have to go

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.010 
particular type of leek I have to go
with<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.490> direction<00:03:12.880> of<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.270> grain<00:03:13.540> so<00:03:13.840> I'm

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
with the direction of the grain so I'm

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.050 
with the direction of the grain so I'm
going<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.320> go<00:03:14.440> just<00:03:14.770> half<00:03:15.190> an<00:03:15.340> inch<00:03:15.520> above<00:03:15.820> the

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
going to go just half an inch above the

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.440 
going to go just half an inch above the
leek<00:03:16.750> so<00:03:17.290> I'm<00:03:17.650> going<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:17.980> use<00:03:18.160> a<00:03:18.190> small<00:03:19.090> chisel

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
leek so I'm going to use a small chisel

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.229 
leek so I'm going to use a small chisel
here<00:03:19.870> so<00:03:20.350> here<00:03:20.739> I'm<00:03:20.920> going<00:03:21.370> maybe<00:03:21.760> half<00:03:22.060> an

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
here so here I'm going maybe half an

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.229 
here so here I'm going maybe half an
inch<00:03:26.280> now<00:03:27.280> I'm<00:03:27.430> going<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:27.730> take<00:03:27.910> out<00:03:28.090> the

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
inch now I'm going to take out the

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.990 
inch now I'm going to take out the
chisel<00:03:28.600> and<00:03:28.830> I'll<00:03:29.830> check<00:03:30.160> that<00:03:30.430> my<00:03:30.610> wooden

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
chisel and I'll check that my wooden

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.600 
chisel and I'll check that my wooden
wedge<00:03:31.360> is<00:03:31.690> slightly<00:03:32.050> wider<00:03:32.470> than<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:33.220> chisel

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
wedge is slightly wider than the chisel

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.150 
wedge is slightly wider than the chisel
if<00:03:33.970> it's<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.420> same<00:03:34.630> width<00:03:34.900> as<00:03:35.080> a<00:03:35.140> chisel<00:03:35.830> it

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
if it's the same width as a chisel it

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.910 
if it's the same width as a chisel it
would<00:03:36.400> leak<00:03:36.640> either<00:03:37.030> side<00:03:37.510> so<00:03:38.470> always

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
would leak either side so always

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.370 
would leak either side so always
slightly<00:03:39.370> wider<00:03:39.760> so<00:03:40.390> that<00:03:40.420> we<00:03:40.660> have<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:41.020> force

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
slightly wider so that we have to force

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.710 
slightly wider so that we have to force
the<00:03:41.470> end<00:03:41.650> to<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.190> hole<00:03:42.790> that<00:03:43.000> we've<00:03:43.180> made

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
the end to the hole that we've made

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.100 
the end to the hole that we've made
always<00:03:44.590> across<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.430> grain<00:03:45.670> never<00:03:46.270> lengthways

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
always across the grain never lengthways

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.720 
always across the grain never lengthways
with<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.530> grain<00:03:47.769> or<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:48.190> would<00:03:48.310> split<00:03:48.610> the

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
with the grain or you would split the

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.710 
with the grain or you would split the
grain<00:03:49.030> all<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:50.049> way<00:03:50.170> up<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.650> this<00:03:50.980> head<00:03:51.220> piece

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
grain all the way up the this head piece

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.660 
grain all the way up the this head piece
so<00:03:52.720> now<00:03:52.870> I'm<00:03:52.989> gonna<00:03:53.170> hammer<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:54.220> piece<00:03:54.459> end

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
so now I'm gonna hammer the piece end

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.750 
so now I'm gonna hammer the piece end
here

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.610 

I'm<00:04:01.760> going<00:04:02.150> to<00:04:02.239> trim<00:04:02.510> off<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.959> excess<00:04:03.379> wood

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
I'm going to trim off the excess wood

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:11.290 
I'm going to trim off the excess wood
with<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.099> chisel<00:04:04.610> here<00:04:09.489> we<00:04:10.489> cut<00:04:10.790> from<00:04:11.030> both

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
with the chisel here we cut from both

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
with the chisel here we cut from both
sides<00:04:15.579> so<00:04:16.579> that<00:04:16.609> I've<00:04:16.790> left<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.750> middle<00:04:17.930> part

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
sides so that I've left the middle part

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.600 
sides so that I've left the middle part
of<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.470> wedge<00:04:18.709> in<00:04:18.949> there<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:21.190> now<00:04:22.190> I'll<00:04:22.340> take

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
of the wedge in there and now I'll take

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.710 
of the wedge in there and now I'll take
it<00:04:22.940> and<00:04:23.090> trim<00:04:23.540> off<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:23.930> excess<00:04:24.380> wood<00:04:24.680> yeah

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:37.450 

with<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:29.900> scraper<00:04:30.580> I'll<00:04:31.720> scrape<00:04:32.720> it<00:04:32.960> and<00:04:36.460> as

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
with the scraper I'll scrape it and as

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.640 
with the scraper I'll scrape it and as
always<00:04:37.790> any<00:04:38.330> where<00:04:38.570> you<00:04:38.720> scrape<00:04:39.110> would<00:04:39.350> you

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
always any where you scrape would you

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.560 
always any where you scrape would you
open<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:40.130> pores<00:04:40.430> so<00:04:40.729> now<00:04:40.880> we'll<00:04:41.120> close<00:04:41.270> the

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
open the pores so now we'll close the

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:49.600 
open the pores so now we'll close the
pores<00:04:46.960> I'll<00:04:47.960> now<00:04:48.229> give<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.620> barrel<00:04:48.950> one<00:04:49.160> final

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
pores I'll now give the barrel one final

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.550 
pores I'll now give the barrel one final
check<00:04:49.850> make<00:04:50.570> sure<00:04:50.600> there's<00:04:50.960> no<00:04:51.110> more<00:04:51.290> leaks

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
check make sure there's no more leaks

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.830 
check make sure there's no more leaks
before<00:04:51.889> we<00:04:52.340> release<00:04:52.760> the<00:04:52.970> air<00:04:53.120> pressure<00:04:53.510> and

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
before we release the air pressure and

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:01.330 
before we release the air pressure and
drain<00:04:54.169> the<00:04:54.350> water<00:04:58.240> so<00:04:59.240> no<00:04:59.750> leaks<00:05:00.020> on<00:05:00.380> the<00:05:01.130> head

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
drain the water so no leaks on the head
