00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
be should be smooth like this I think me

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.239 
be should be smooth like this I think me
knowing<00:00:45.659> who<00:00:46.659> I<00:00:46.719> was<00:00:47.019> first<00:00:47.379> you<00:00:47.800> know<00:00:47.949> figure

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
and he he doesn't take time didn't take
