00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.490
 the pokemon do not exist true 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.480
 I am what you might call a hacker 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.059
 well maybe not exactly it would be something 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.250
 as well as a video game hacker created 

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:29.710
 new games by using others that already 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.199
 there are extra levels added 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.600
 new objects I upload to the network for 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:36.129
 that everyone down and so on I have 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.019
 to say that the ones I like the most 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.229
 modify are those of the franchise 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:43.089
 pokémon I must however warn that a 

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:45.190
 Although , without a doubt, the majority 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.229
 of you know what a creepy is 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.329
 pasta and he knows that most of them 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.609
 they are just stories that try to 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.829
 scare them by preventing them to reconcile the 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:56.140
 I dream at night this story without 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.629
 However, it is not invented, let 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.760
 start at the beginning just 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.760
 finish the blue pokemon modification 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.470
 in which he had changed some things 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.660
 just with the intention of having fun and in 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.240
 no case thinking that I could get out 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.340
 the backlash was after giving him the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.320
 last touches when I realized 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.090
 that had already modified all the games 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.420
 of existing Pokémon to date 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.130
 except one green leaf pokemon and being 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.440
 this one the only one left to hack 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.900
 I decided it would be special 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.570
 my favorite pokemon has always been ever 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.180
 that's why I decided that in this last game 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.130
 would make him the protagonist of it 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.990
 contrary to what one might think is 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.450
 pretty easy to modify the story 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.330
 of the game if you have the knowledge and 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.370
 appropriate programs the title that I decided 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.500
 give to this last version was the one of 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.440
 pokemon apocalypse or poc era lips is 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.720
 I know what you are thinking sounds a little 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.880
 catastrophic but it 's a bit my way of 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.190
 be or at least it was supposed to be 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.830
 it would be easy for it to create a new 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.900
 evolution for hebe using the stone 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.690
 mole and suppress the rest of possible 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.420
 evolutions that have existed since that moment 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.800
 could never evolve in holten flar 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.660
 eon etcetera 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.790
 the only way he allows that 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.340
 would evolve was to give that sees of 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.380
 dark before they ask you to give that 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.660
 see is not a copy of man or is not 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.640
 based on this in no way but a 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.110
 new pokémon that has nothing to do with 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.900
 any of the above 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.850
 likewise change your attacks the only 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.890
 attack that you could supposedly use 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.870
 it would be a curse for what I was inspired 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.860
 in certain creepy pastas that you and I should 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.570
 to admit 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.760
 however, it did not work as expected 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.310
 give that behind having everything arranged 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.290
 run the rom the game file in 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.050
 the visual emulator I'm progressing from my 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.060
 computer and I started to play everything started 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.160
 as I should, I soon arrived at the 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.050
 teacher lab or here I'll choose 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.750
 to which I made the only character 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.760
 selectable start was after choosing 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.250
 e when the first thing happened 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.320
 unexplained the teacher started to 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.940
 talk about depressing and sad things 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.100
 for which I had not programmed it 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.840
 with my rival that I called pain that 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.090
 It was located to the left of my 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.610
 character that he named the penalty of 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.370
 suddenly he came out of his pib there is something that 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.440
 I had not scheduled either. 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.570
 behind my character in the same way 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.700
 that itches chute follows in yellow pokemon 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.560
 except because when I turned to talk 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.420
 with him appeared an image of his face 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.060
 with a decomposed look and great 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.790
 Despite this, it made me very disappointed but 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.739
 After a few moments I decided to continue 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.780
 time the typical combat with me began 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.970
 rival I realized that his attacks 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.489
 they were not the ones that I had programmed 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.920
 instead of having curse I counted 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.970
 only with deadly song frustration 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.920
 and dibi of pain 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.050
 by knowing what all the 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.820
 attacks I opted for frustration 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.770
 be the only attack movement 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.020
 direct that was almost in shape 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.480
 Instant the charm under my rival 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.640
 pain fell with a crash at the same time 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.890
 that there was a legend on screen that 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.930
 he said out in one fell swoop is not 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.060
 necessary to say that my surprise was 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.310
 capital but I was also seized by a 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.860
 feeling of some excitement for 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.810
 to deny it if he had a pokémon that 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.210
 could knock down from a single attack could 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.280
 kill all opponent maybe even 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.970
 win the pokemon league with only hebe 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.790
 I thought I would go up to level 37 say that without 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.370
 be able to learn new attacks not 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.320
 I wanted to use mimes mime with him so 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.870
 I had to capture new pokémon to 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.270
 I finally came across a stone 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.130
 mole on Mt. Moon finally had the 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.470
 possibility of making my evolution 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.000
 pokemon to give to see for it 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.220
 select the stone from the menu 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.500
 inventory and try to apply the aebe 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.510
 but it seems that he had other plans 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.640
 and here was where things got fucked 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.380
 really the first time appeared a 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.030
 question mark when trying to 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.710
 make it evolve 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.140
 on the third try I heard the scream 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.810
 heeled of crying hebe and the text 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.540
 please do not make me evolve not 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.850
 you know who I am, I was stunned already 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.460
 that obviously I had not 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.950
 introduced that line of dialogue but 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.860
 being the stupid idiot that I am what 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.780
 try one last time then it appeared 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.600
 the typical screen of evolution and of 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.460
 finally evolved to give to see in 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.680
 that moment I felt bad but at 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.040
 react instantly and I said to myself 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.710
 nonsense the pokemon do not exist true 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.570
 after this I looked carefully at 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.330
 the image of giving that sees and I realized 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.760
 that something was not going as it should 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.500
 he had dark hair purple eyes and the 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.960
 clear abdomen as it had 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.090
 designed now had an expression 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.920
 in his face that I had not conceived 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.630
 when I created it was almost a grimace 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.090
 mocking the face of a murderer 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.100
 deranged besides the fur was 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.680
 smeared with blood on the tail and 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.420
 ears however the most disturbing of 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.520
 everything is that I was trying to learn a 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.320
 movement a new attack that there was not 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.900
 seen in my life called hole of 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.120
 worm did not know what the attack 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.250
 able to do but considering that only 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.860
 I had three attacks I did not have to erase 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.539
 none to make room for it immediately 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.610
 I hurried to run around the area in 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.770
 look for a weak pokemon to prove it 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.530
 God, I wish it had never happened to me 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.410
 past that idea by the head a ratico 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.389
 level 26 tea appeared then I 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.639
 he seemed to see the fear reflected in his 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:15.130
 face although I would not know how to say it to science 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:17.860
 true at that moment everything happened so 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.840
 fast I could hardly react without 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.720
 order yourself in no way give that 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.580
 he used wormhole screen 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.260
 it melted black and did not return to the 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.280
 normality despite waiting for a 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.139
 weather 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.419
 that's why I closed the visual boy emulator 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:33.789
 advance and try to calm down a bit 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:35.889
 nerves that were on the skin this 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:38.289
 I was becoming absolutely crazy 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:40.180
 just take a second the view of the 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:42.160
 screen but when I looked at the 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.650
 monitor was when I lost my mind 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.389
 definitely the disheveled face of 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.389
 couple who stared at me 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:51.550
 flashing a thunderous sound 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:54.010
 of heartbreaking scream began to come out of 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.110
 the speakers a series of lines of 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.470
 text began to appear below the 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.990
 little bit 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.900
 where you could read the following 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:04.480
 what happens master you created me is not 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.430
 this what you wanted I am losing 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.070
 the reason and that is why he wrote this 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.930
 so you can read it probably not 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.850
 they will create me and they will think that it is another 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.830
 story to scare people after 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.470
 of everything it is normal that they think for 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:20.230
 yourselves the pokemon do not exist 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:22.330
 true from the moment it happened 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.910
 what happened to give that the bm has been 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:27.580
 following everywhere I see it in all 

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:30.250
 the sites the pc screen in the 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:32.410
 laptop even I have game boy color it 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:34.750
 freezes the screen and when I go back to 

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.430
 turn it on there is watching me while 

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.020
 blink with that horrible grimace 

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.880
 proceeding screams that they would do 

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.010
 shudder at anyone even 

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.990
 while they hear this has their eyes 

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.090
 injected in blood stuck in me to 

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.610
 through my television I implore you 

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:51.300
 viewer do not make my mistakes 

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.300
 please
