it looks like a lot of seasoning but a

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.920 
it looks like a lot of seasoning but a
lot<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.940> seasoning<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.510> cooks<00:01:03.719> right

off<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.350> falls<00:01:04.799> off<00:01:06.080> so<00:01:07.080> whenever<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.950> stick

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
off and falls off so whenever you stick

off and falls off so whenever you stick
this<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.520> i'm<00:01:08.670> not<00:01:08.820> going<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:08.970> add<00:01:09.119> salt

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
this on i'm not going to add salt

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.500 
this on i'm not going to add salt
because<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.619> seasoning<00:01:11.100> i<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.490> already<00:01:12.180> has

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
because the seasoning i have already has

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.780 
because the seasoning i have already has
a<00:01:12.540> bunch<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.990> salt<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.670> look

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
a bunch of salt in it so if you can look

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.249 
a bunch of salt in it so if you can look
at<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.000> back<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.330> your<00:01:15.450> seasoning<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.200> you

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
at the back of your seasoning and you

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.100 
at the back of your seasoning and you
see<00:01:16.820> salt<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.180> first<00:01:18.420> ingredient<00:01:18.600> more

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
see salt as the first ingredient more

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.420 
see salt as the first ingredient more
than<00:01:19.229> likely<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.619> has<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> bunch<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.189> salt

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
than likely it has a bunch of salt

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.620 
than likely it has a bunch of salt
already<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.090> don't<00:01:21.270> need<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.450> add

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
already in it so you don't need to add

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.890 
already in it so you don't need to add
salt<00:01:23.570> more<00:01:24.570> pepper<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:26.759> reason<00:01:27.509> why<00:01:27.630> my

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
salt more pepper the reason why my

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.050 
salt more pepper the reason why my
chicken<00:01:28.200> fajita<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.799> going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> become<00:01:29.700> so

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
chicken fajita is going to become so

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.200 
chicken fajita is going to become so
tinder<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.780> because<00:01:31.470> my<00:01:31.880> seasoning<00:01:32.880> already

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210
