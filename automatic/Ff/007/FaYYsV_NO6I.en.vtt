 boil it a little bit I say previously 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.430

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.410
 cooking and no longer play there we're going to 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.140

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.210
 next recipe that create calditos the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.269
 design want to want let's see the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.790
 ingredients for this recipe we are going to 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:54.090
 use a cooked chicken breast and 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.660
 shredding a liter and a half of broth 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.840
 chicken two chilies chipotle can one 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.899
 cup of frozen mixed vegetables a 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.750
 cup of white rice cooked a pasta 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.780
 cooked chickpeas three tablespoons of 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.080
 Chicken consommé an avocado cut in 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.170

 in cubes and a cup of chopped coriander 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.480
 let's make the broth is very easy 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.400
 let's put the consommé first 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.400
 that to make the consomme I will 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.940
 I recommend 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.960
 that before boiling the chicken 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.550
 remove skin and remove fats so that 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.150
 then at the time that it is already 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:42.270
 leaving the juice of the chicken there is less 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.430
 possible of fat in our case we are going to 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.640
 lower the fire to the rice so that it does not 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.680
 we are going to burn ok let's add the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.820
 Chile 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.130
 22 pieces of chili broth 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.840
 let's add 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.010
 the vegetables that are here the hotel 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.160
 carrot 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.050
 and peas that actually can already 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.660
 you do the variation with the 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.500
 vegetables as you prefer can 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.270
 put chard spinach broccoli this 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.390
 does not stop from the broths that actually 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.010
 they can finish adding what they want 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.370
 ok now let's also add the 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.370
 rice 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.820
 that rice now so it would have to 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.550
 be our carbohydrate this dish 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:37.310
 it is complete has vegetable proteins 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.230
 carbohydrates has everything then 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.200
 it really is a dish in which 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.420
 we could trust to eat and have so 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.260
 as the complete feed for a 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.090
 food be light we are not going to add 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.970
 the chickpeas that is the chickpeas is a 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.960
 excellent source of fiber and equally 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.870
 of beneficial acids for the heart and 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.050
 all and all the circulatory system 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.930
 let's season with chicken bouillon in 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.219
 powder 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.989
 and that they could also 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:11.650
 Park with salt and pepper to taste 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:15.310
 I'm going for the consommé because it's going to 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.370
 give that flavor put support we need 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.819
 a chicken caldito not support to caldito 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.670
 chicken 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.730
 and we are also going to add the chick 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.290
 this bravo so that the rest of the 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.030
 flavor that was left and is frayed 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.829
 is previously boiled with this 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.840
 we recover the consommé that we have here 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.840
 already put but let's go back to 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.770
 incorporate to the broth so that they resume the 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.640
 taste 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.640
 in the chick 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.270
 to not get sick 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.930
 Calista of good milking is well me 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.170
 I can consent well, that's it 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.420
 let's boil and it's that easy and 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.230
 nothing else will accompany a 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.549
 avocados 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.659
 jazz or panela love cilantro and yes 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.739
 they want to continue 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.739
 there is a tortillita 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:16.060
 how rich are we going to a cut but then 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.060
 paste we come back with more 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.340

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.710
 one of the most popular dishes in 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.259

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.930
