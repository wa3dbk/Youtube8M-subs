00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.170
 is that I put what I put aside 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.010
 of having the fat make me like 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.800
 allergic reactions and the other day I 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.429
 I bought this makeup 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.629
 it is worth the same word 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.230
 it says 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.879

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.079
 you can use the ones with the skin 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.300
 fat is a type of makeup you can 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.460
 use a matifying makeup yo 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.930
 for 13 days testing it and the truth is 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.360
 I'm quite happy because I 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.210
 they have left me with granites 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.460
 well all day and I do not get those 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.670
 happy brightness because there are makeups 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.800
 they say they are for fur 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.480
 fats and all that but if you're all the 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.030
 day and you are very hot and that ends 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.899
 coming out bright and these hot days 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.539

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:11.410

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:14.119
 of that this makeup is from kiko 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.940

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.979
 it is very important to protect ourselves from the sun 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.400
 both in winter and in summer 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.390
 forget 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.520
 well in about 30 milliliters 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:35.090
 I bought the number 2 beige 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.500
 rose that what I always tell you you have 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.110
 to take when buying a 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.540
 Make up the tone that is the same as 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.290
 your skin tone so that you prevent that 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:49.340
 go bad or you see the most expensive roll 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:52.030
 then this is what you have to shake 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.030
 First 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:59.580
 I'm going to talk a little bit so it's liquid 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.760
 it spreads quite well and what 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.100
 I always tell you also to avoid 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.780
 excess makeup face put you 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.569
 first the makeup in the hand and the 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.569
 hand you are taking to put it in 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.069
 our face is worth and thus we avoid that 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.379
 there would be excesses and spots on the face 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.900
 then I want to tell you about this 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:24.409
