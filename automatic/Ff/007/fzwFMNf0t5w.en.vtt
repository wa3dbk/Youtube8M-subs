00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:08.820
 this network was started in 2001 and 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.379
 and not close to being finished yet so the 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.360
 part that was done first and 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:15.059
 electronic before monday that the decor 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.580
 here is the module to ask from 3 to nmes 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.410
 different that can be controlled on 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.170
 every way to receive 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.039
 knowing that he has three voices on network 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.910
 so each one can select 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.250
 the food that we want with 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.710
 visualized by a vuse puts this is the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.480
 building a new plate that 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.010
 will be for layar in slow regnard which 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.400
 now I'm done a little bit 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.409
 default since all my system blocks 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.820
 evolved with the time you see 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:43.589
 now I put blogs on a 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.870
 plate that I go back because work 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.870
 underneath lying down it was more possible 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.020
 we also see the transistors of 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.850
 power I do not know and dishes 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.040
 which is a very good solution 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.410
 here is a little essay to correspond 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.540
 however terral the one that is before 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.510
 condom terral with each time a 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.700
 opportunity to see the meaning on the way 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.770
 without it being very good it's very 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.840
 rudimentary as a system must 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.520
 know that I'm doing that hop a little bit and I 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.920
 am like all of them I am often 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.450
 in a hurry to see the result 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.510
 so that's the right work that's there 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.210
 obvious with possibility on the tracks 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.140
 to stop or not stopped for ways that's 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.520
 the old plates that are 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.050
 currently still in operation 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.110
 although she is in bad 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.090
 posture but hey that's a part too 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.350
 there is a lot of wiring to do with 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.660
 the new systems the new ones 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.580
 modules that they use the cars 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.250
 power couplers go from a network 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.440
 to each other like that 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.540
 I know how interactive for 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.980
 system blocks and 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.270
 and it allows me to avoid accidents 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.280
 as I have had many times and 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.620
 to have premises that falls for example 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.080
 when we see the opto couplers and 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.520
 the knob that serves to accelerate or 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.760
 restricted access to the dying of the judgments 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.790
 the red led lights up years when the train 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.660
 is there and he is busy 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.280
 visualization of the red light green light 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.110
 also on the map and on 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.210
 last I visualized the florange 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.770
 also the loose 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.800
 on the network we see in passing 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.060
 saved cable that allow for 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.270
 know sending 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.240
 phase 1 2 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.890
 7 mobile with petals it smells that everything 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.950
 is almost removable except the mountain 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.130
 rch she turn buckle and laly 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.350
 coheed the future economy 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.950
 this woman 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.950
 this mine 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.790
 the passage having she knowing she 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.060
 is currently on track 2 and who has 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.060
 could arrive 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.570
 80-104 50 visits to tran 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.520
 cross to see some motorists 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.350
 the italy station currently in 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.360
 sailing and what game 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.250
 it's not yet tanger by niels albert 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.240
 the green and it goes very badly at the 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.520
 beer outlet we can see well 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.020
 servoing the switches that 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.290
 are ordered this share of ideas 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.460
 we show ourselves a little further three 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.680
 networks the first thing to do 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.240
 it was the automatic electricity there 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.270
 we come back from junction between two 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.720
 elements month is the time that will 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.730
 save them 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.160
 the jetty as all have talked about it's a 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.010
 fault 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.870
 1 so here I ordered to the train 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.319
 to go from there to see it so 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.910
 he will spend on the mud flipping 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.960
 them 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.960
 so he does not have any other 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.970
 he will go up because there 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.470
 compared to my 2001 network I 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.780
 removed a cross and so I did 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.330
 a passage over which greatly 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.010
 simplified 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.030
 working from 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.920
 the 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.700
 in the tunnels there are pictures that 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.569
 are for him 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.870
 these people here in the passage of 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.870
 viaduct 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.560
 sale virtually everything is bought 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.240
 used to wake up just cosmonauta 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.350
 behind me the garage door there it's 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.460
 a heroine I had 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.920
 in front of the growl is sure that I will be 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.860
 not so there to arrive on a thug 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.840
 hot or his passing at one time 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.240
 that he has passed I order of aiguilhe 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.790
 so that's a motor cut theirs 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:21.820
 lawyers are practically the 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:24.730
 train restarts on the way back 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.410
 like a poor 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.210
 the movie actors I have plans that 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.330
 are missing to show you their agreement 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.620
 but hey that's the lights so 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.570
 why five types of steps because 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.520
 all the tests are refuted effect that 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.040
 some constant consumptions so 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.080
 the orange plates the block it is not 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.000
 far the wagon more he is almost 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.620
 so he'll go to orange 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.300
 so here I order access again 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.979
 in the other direction so 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.599
 I have different referral engines 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.599
 fooling the rococo 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.650
 so classify the motors and 2/3 of 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.770
 the natan the bath co 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.690
 facing AIDS 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.539
 I'm scared she's frankly 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.980
 okay so get them back on track 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.830
 on his voice 2 in kiel 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.090
 excuse scrap 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.150
 I often used there 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.480
 boudou jean made 50 watts at the end 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.100
 I had a little bit forgotten 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.500
 goes back game 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.500
 everything and it practically 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.470
 here we go adema a little fast 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.580
 knowing that I made a stupid tour of 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:36.000
 Incest cement 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.830
 conventional car wagon 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.360
 German with a Swiss loco but me 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.509
 I know the pleasure of seeing 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.509
 trains 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:49.480
 it's great here we go before 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.490
 comments ranging from terral we review the 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.760
 mountain that obviously hides the loop 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.380
 and the future the lookout for the future the country 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.720
 since for the moment act of wood that 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.800
 is done we go back to the station we pass on 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:06.360
 the junctions between them 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.360
 you have this question 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:14.060
 honestly, no 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:15.320
 he evolves his goal 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.150
 so he 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.570
 someone you see so the occar and this 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.750
 2nd right so there are the routes 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.440
 in bone works it 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.440
 it is necessary now 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.980
 1 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.110
 the 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.330
 when it passed my real 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.680
 classics are made to put me the m 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:40.020
 50 successes 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:42.009
 this is the case here it is the system of 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.639
 telecom routes we see well 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:47.350
 update of the led a penny and so 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.910
 those of the diode system that's 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.979
 the role story they little 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.020
 engines still making homemade the 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:56.020
 automatic block and with the 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.270
 to flights the pipelike switches that 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.410
 are electrically controlled and steps 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.680
 in a way how is that only in 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.100
 more marked by transistor break 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.670
 who am I going to 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.800
 functioning it is 

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:10.230
 net so I have a shutdown system 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:13.050
 automatic in case I have a problem 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:14.310
 since this case there the quick cij on 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.500
 the train does not restart what is 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.570
 often crisp reese nature this 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.810
 system avoids many 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:24.250
 contents still the junction and 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.250
 I will finish this Baptist 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:32.030
 had you just learned it east 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.030
 see you soon for a next movie
