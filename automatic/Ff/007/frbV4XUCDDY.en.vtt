00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
in front of going too slow and then they

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.500 
in front of going too slow and then they
do<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.930> aggressive<00:02:35.530> pull<00:02:35.739> out<00:02:36.300> that's<00:02:37.300> why

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
do it aggressive pull out that's why

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.240 
do it aggressive pull out that's why
when<00:02:37.720> you<00:02:37.810> pass<00:02:38.080> you're<00:02:38.590> only<00:02:38.830> supposed<00:02:39.069> to

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
when you pass you're only supposed to

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.910 
when you pass you're only supposed to
pass<00:02:39.519> like<00:02:40.000> it<00:02:40.180> like<00:02:40.390> 10<00:02:41.230> kilometers<00:02:41.739> an<00:02:41.830> hour

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
pass like it like 10 kilometers an hour

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.229 
pass like it like 10 kilometers an hour
quicker<00:02:42.340> than<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:42.700> person<00:02:42.880> then<00:02:43.120> you're

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
quicker than the person then you're

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.970 
quicker than the person then you're
passing<00:02:43.660> like<00:02:43.840> if<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:43.989> cars<00:02:44.170> doing<00:02:44.380> 60<00:02:44.800> I

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
passing like if the cars doing 60 I

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.040 
passing like if the cars doing 60 I
should<00:02:45.430> pass<00:02:45.640> them<00:02:45.850> at<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.000> maximum<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:46.630> 70

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
should pass them at a maximum of 70

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.040 
should pass them at a maximum of 70
which<00:02:47.560> is<00:02:47.709> not<00:02:47.890> what<00:02:47.920> I'm<00:02:48.220> doing<00:02:48.870> but<00:02:49.870> for

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
which is not what I'm doing but for

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.210 
which is not what I'm doing but for
safety's<00:02:50.410> sake<00:02:50.590> yeah<00:02:50.830> that's<00:02:51.040> what<00:02:51.130> you

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
safety's sake yeah that's what you

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.380 
safety's sake yeah that's what you
should<00:02:51.340> do<00:02:51.430> when<00:02:51.519> you<00:02:51.640> pass<00:02:51.819> cars<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.239> just

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
should do when you pass cars you just

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.640 
should do when you pass cars you just
pass<00:02:52.569> them<00:02:52.690> at<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:52.870> slow<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:53.380> way<00:02:53.500> if<00:02:53.560> they

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
pass them at a slow that way if they

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.930 
pass them at a slow that way if they
start<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:53.890> do<00:02:53.980> something<00:02:54.220> I<00:02:54.310> expect<00:02:54.340> well

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
start to do something I expect well

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.640 
start to do something I expect well
actually<00:02:55.120> it's<00:02:55.360> not<00:02:55.450> true<00:02:55.690> either<00:02:55.720> like<00:02:56.290> well

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
actually it's not true either like well

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.020 
actually it's not true either like well
if<00:02:56.709> you're<00:02:56.799> passing<00:02:57.130> like<00:02:57.250> one<00:02:57.489> car<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:57.880> can

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
if you're passing like one car you can

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.520 
if you're passing like one car you can
pass<00:02:58.180> them<00:02:58.330> quickly<00:02:58.600> just<00:02:58.959> get<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.200> over<00:02:59.260> with

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
pass them quickly just get it over with

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.809 
pass them quickly just get it over with
but<00:02:59.920> if<00:03:00.010> you're<00:03:00.069> passing<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.459> whole<00:03:00.610> line<00:03:00.790> of

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
but if you're passing a whole line of

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.220 
but if you're passing a whole line of
cars<00:03:01.120> like<00:03:01.269> you're<00:03:01.450> given<00:03:01.959> which<00:03:02.200> is

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
cars like you're given which is

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.289 
cars like you're given which is
comparable<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.830> filtering<00:03:03.280> after<00:03:03.819> filtering

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
comparable to filtering after filtering

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.470 
comparable to filtering after filtering
the<00:03:04.569> rule<00:03:04.780> is<00:03:05.459> like<00:03:06.459> no<00:03:06.640> more<00:03:06.910> than<00:03:07.090> ten

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
the rule is like no more than ten

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.670 
the rule is like no more than ten
quicker<00:03:07.930> than<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.230> people<00:03:08.380> that<00:03:08.590> you're

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
quicker than the people that you're

filtering and that doesn't make sense as

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
if you're there's a long line of cars

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.490 
if you're there's a long line of cars
and<00:03:13.360> you're<00:03:13.450> passing<00:03:13.840> by<00:03:13.930> them<00:03:14.110> on<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.290> side

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
and you're passing by them on the side

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.830 
and you're passing by them on the side
you're<00:03:14.650> flying<00:03:14.980> along<00:03:15.340> doing<00:03:15.850> 15<00:03:16.299> quicker

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
you're flying along doing 15 quicker

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.660 
you're flying along doing 15 quicker
than<00:03:17.019> they<00:03:17.200> are<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:17.680> wanted<00:03:18.160> them<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.340> decide<00:03:18.519> to

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
than they are I wanted them to decide to

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.550 
than they are I wanted them to decide to
pull<00:03:18.850> over<00:03:18.880> to<00:03:19.239> stop<00:03:19.510> or<00:03:19.780> something<00:03:20.170> or<00:03:20.290> open

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
pull over to stop or something or open

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.250 
pull over to stop or something or open
the<00:03:20.680> door<00:03:20.890> like<00:03:21.310> you're<00:03:21.430> screwed

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.809 

but<00:03:24.650> yeah<00:03:24.860> if<00:03:24.950> you're<00:03:25.040> just<00:03:25.099> passing<00:03:25.310> like<00:03:25.640> a

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
but yeah if you're just passing like a

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.699 
but yeah if you're just passing like a
vehicle<00:03:26.480> like<00:03:26.510> a<00:03:26.629> bus<00:03:26.930> or<00:03:27.110> something<00:03:27.170> you<00:03:27.560> sure

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
vehicle like a bus or something you sure

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.350 
vehicle like a bus or something you sure
as<00:03:27.830> hell<00:03:27.980> don't<00:03:28.159> limit<00:03:28.459> yourself<00:03:28.879> to<00:03:28.939> doing<00:03:29.209> it

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
as hell don't limit yourself to doing it

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.819 
as hell don't limit yourself to doing it
at<00:03:29.480> only<00:03:29.720> ten<00:03:29.959> quicker<00:03:30.200> than<00:03:30.379> they're<00:03:30.530> doing

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
at only ten quicker than they're doing
