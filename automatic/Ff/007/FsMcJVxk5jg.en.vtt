campaign and I also been a lot of people
when<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.460> was<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> young<00:01:26.880> child<00:01:28.159> in<00:01:29.159> retrospect<00:01:29.759> I

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
when I was a young child in retrospect I

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.120 
when I was a young child in retrospect I
probably<00:01:29.880> deserved<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.890> thing<00:01:32.070> about

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
probably deserved it the thing about

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.530 
probably deserved it the thing about
being<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.549> kid<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.030> kind<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
being a kid is you kind of have to

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.420 
being a kid is you kind of have to
experience<00:01:34.110> those<00:01:34.380> dumb<00:01:34.710> kid<00:01:34.979> moments<00:01:35.369> in

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
experience those dumb kid moments in

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.370 
experience those dumb kid moments in
order<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.790> learn<00:01:35.970> did<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.869> knew<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.259> was

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
order to learn did I knew it was

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.620 
order to learn did I knew it was
probably<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.890> bad<00:01:38.130> idea<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.670> lower<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.150> lit<00:01:39.420> match

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
probably a bad idea to lower a lit match

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.469 
probably a bad idea to lower a lit match
onto<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> patch<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.380> dry<00:01:40.710> brush<00:01:41.210> probably<00:01:42.210> so

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
onto a patch of dry brush probably so

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.300 
onto a patch of dry brush probably so
but<00:01:43.110> did<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.380> think<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.649> could<00:01:43.829> handle<00:01:44.009> it

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
but did I think I could handle it

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.819 
but did I think I could handle it
absolutely<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.869> learned<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.439> could

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
absolutely and I learned that I could

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.010 
absolutely and I learned that I could
not<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.820> also<00:01:48.090> could<00:01:48.420> not<00:01:48.450> lie<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.840> my

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
not and that I also could not lie to my

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.420 
not and that I also could not lie to my
parents<00:01:49.049> effectively<00:01:49.860> about<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.220> because

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
parents effectively about it because

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.190 
parents effectively about it because
they<00:01:50.549> realized<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.180> seconds<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.869> was<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
they realized in seconds that I was the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.530 
they realized in seconds that I was the
one<00:01:52.290> responsible<00:01:52.409> for<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.130> inferno<00:01:53.549> but

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
one responsible for that inferno but

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.670 
one responsible for that inferno but
seriously<00:01:54.810> I'm<00:01:55.110> going<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.350> live<00:01:55.500> by<00:01:55.619> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
seriously I'm going to live by the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.170 
seriously I'm going to live by the
philosophy<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.399> doing<00:01:56.670> all<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.820> your<00:01:57.030> dumb
