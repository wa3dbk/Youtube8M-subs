record<00:02:51.770> probably<00:02:52.010> not<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.220> best<00:02:52.250> idea

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
record probably not the best idea

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.640 
record probably not the best idea
because<00:02:53.120> i<00:02:53.150> really<00:02:53.600> can't<00:02:53.810> speak<00:02:54.110> i<00:02:54.260> have<00:02:54.440> that

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
because i really can't speak i have that

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.390 
because i really can't speak i have that
like<00:02:55.270> after<00:02:56.270> exam<00:02:56.690> mine<00:02:57.020> i<00:02:57.050> guess<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.860> it

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
like after exam mine i guess and it

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.610 
like after exam mine i guess and it
really<00:02:58.820> sucks<00:02:59.240> because<00:02:59.420> like<00:02:59.840> my<00:03:00.050> mind<00:03:00.290> is<00:03:00.410> all

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
really sucks because like my mind is all

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.140 
really sucks because like my mind is all
over<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:01.040> place<00:03:01.070> and<00:03:01.460> I<00:03:01.520> don't<00:03:01.730> know<00:03:01.850> what<00:03:02.030> I'm
