00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.880 

so<00:00:27.760> most<00:00:28.760> of<00:00:28.970> the<00:00:29.030> major<00:00:29.570> systems<00:00:30.350> on<00:00:30.530> the<00:00:30.650> car

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
so most of the major systems on the car

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.390 
so most of the major systems on the car
very<00:00:31.310> similar<00:00:31.790> to<00:00:31.820> what<00:00:31.940> they<00:00:32.180> were<00:00:32.240> last<00:00:32.540> year

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
very similar to what they were last year

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.960 
very similar to what they were last year
last<00:00:34.400> year<00:00:34.700> we<00:00:34.820> had<00:00:34.850> a<00:00:34.970> fuel-injected<00:00:36.970> race

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
last year we had a fuel-injected race

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.330 
last year we had a fuel-injected race
motorbike<00:00:38.600> engine<00:00:39.080> this<00:00:39.710> year<00:00:39.980> we<00:00:40.100> switched

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
motorbike engine this year we switched

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.820 
motorbike engine this year we switched
to<00:00:40.489> a<00:00:40.520> different<00:00:40.580> one<00:00:41.150> that<00:00:41.420> is<00:00:41.600> a<00:00:41.830> carbureted

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
to a different one that is a carbureted

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.010 
to a different one that is a carbureted
engine<00:00:43.190> but<00:00:43.340> it<00:00:43.400> has<00:00:43.489> a<00:00:43.520> starter<00:00:44.030> motor<00:00:44.239> which

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
engine but it has a starter motor which

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.880 
engine but it has a starter motor which
makes<00:00:45.290> our<00:00:45.470> lives<00:00:45.620> a<00:00:45.830> lot<00:00:45.950> easier<00:00:47.890> the

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
makes our lives a lot easier the

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.070 
makes our lives a lot easier the
electric<00:00:49.370> drive<00:00:49.640> system<00:00:49.670> is<00:00:50.540> completely

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
electric drive system is completely

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.350 
electric drive system is completely
unchanged<00:00:52.070> we<00:00:52.340> just<00:00:52.580> put<00:00:52.730> a<00:00:52.760> lot<00:00:52.940> of<00:00:52.970> effort

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
unchanged we just put a lot of effort

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.740 
unchanged we just put a lot of effort
into<00:00:53.650> really<00:00:54.650> getting<00:00:54.950> it<00:00:55.070> working<00:00:55.250> to<00:00:55.699> the

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
into really getting it working to the

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.660 
into really getting it working to the
its<00:00:56.750> fullest<00:00:57.110> capacity<00:00:57.260> because<00:00:57.949> last<00:00:58.340> year

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
its fullest capacity because last year

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.430 
its fullest capacity because last year
had<00:00:58.940> a<00:00:58.970> lot<00:00:59.239> of<00:00:59.270> problems<00:00:59.870> and<00:01:00.050> never<00:01:00.230> really

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
had a lot of problems and never really

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.320 
had a lot of problems and never really
worked<00:01:00.770> very<00:01:01.130> well<00:01:01.220> on<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:04.250> telemetry<00:01:04.580> system

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
worked very well on the telemetry system

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.300 
worked very well on the telemetry system
the<00:01:05.479> data<00:01:05.690> collection<00:01:06.290> is<00:01:06.410> also

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the data collection is also

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.389 
the data collection is also
we<00:01:08.820> also<00:01:08.970> revamped<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.960> year<00:01:10.380> we're<00:01:11.100> running

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
we also revamped this year we're running

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.429 
we also revamped this year we're running
a<00:01:11.490> full-blown<00:01:12.030> computer<00:01:12.750> with<00:01:12.960> wireless

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
a full-blown computer with wireless

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.410 
a full-blown computer with wireless
Ethernet<00:01:14.009> so<00:01:14.369> we're<00:01:14.490> moving<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.820> lot<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.090> data

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
Ethernet so we're moving a lot of data

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.050 
Ethernet so we're moving a lot of data
so<00:01:15.720> we'll<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> really<00:01:16.320> good<00:01:16.970> handle<00:01:17.970> on

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
so we'll have a really good handle on

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.730 
so we'll have a really good handle on
what's<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.960> car<00:01:19.170> technically

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
what's going on in the car technically

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.270 
what's going on in the car technically
and<00:01:20.490> will<00:01:20.729> be<00:01:20.880> really<00:01:21.210> able<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.780> tune<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.590> so

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
and will be really able to tune it so

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:59.540 
and will be really able to tune it so
it's<00:01:23.430> performing<00:01:23.939> as<00:01:24.060> well<00:01:24.090> as<00:01:24.420> possible

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.610
