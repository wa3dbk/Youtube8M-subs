00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
the only problem I see with this title

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.320 
the only problem I see with this title
is<00:05:28.699> for<00:05:29.180> one<00:05:29.330> it's<00:05:30.139> slow<00:05:30.529> not<00:05:31.370> for<00:05:31.639> movement<00:05:31.909> or

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
is for one it's slow not for movement or

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.269 
is for one it's slow not for movement or
anything<00:05:32.569> like<00:05:32.839> that<00:05:32.900> but<00:05:33.439> the<00:05:33.559> enemies<00:05:34.069> are

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:34.279 
anything like that but the enemies are

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:36.549 
anything like that but the enemies are
far<00:05:34.759> and<00:05:34.939> few<00:05:35.029> in<00:05:35.240> between<00:05:35.360> it's<00:05:36.199> not<00:05:36.379> the

00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:36.559 
far and few in between it's not the

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:38.649 
far and few in between it's not the
beat'em<00:05:37.039> up<00:05:37.189> fest<00:05:37.550> at<00:05:37.789> the<00:05:37.819> other<00:05:38.089> games<00:05:38.360> were

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
beat'em up fest at the other games were

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:40.689 
beat'em up fest at the other games were
you<00:05:39.259> have<00:05:39.379> plenty<00:05:39.650> of<00:05:39.800> time<00:05:39.889> to<00:05:40.099> get<00:05:40.370> the<00:05:40.550> roll

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
you have plenty of time to get the roll

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:42.760 
you have plenty of time to get the roll
and<00:05:40.969> it<00:05:41.180> should<00:05:41.360> really<00:05:41.599> be<00:05:41.719> a<00:05:41.870> slugfest<00:05:42.259> of

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
and it should really be a slugfest of

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.790 
and it should really be a slugfest of
epic<00:05:43.219> proportion<00:05:43.969> and<00:05:44.779> number<00:05:45.110> two<00:05:45.289> the

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
epic proportion and number two the

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.469 
epic proportion and number two the
amount<00:05:46.099> of<00:05:46.189> stuff<00:05:46.460> on<00:05:46.639> the<00:05:46.759> screen<00:05:46.879> is<00:05:47.270> really

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
amount of stuff on the screen is really

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.600 
amount of stuff on the screen is really
great<00:05:47.749> to<00:05:47.900> look<00:05:48.050> at<00:05:48.259> but<00:05:48.559> it<00:05:48.949> forces<00:05:49.219> the<00:05:49.430> game

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
great to look at but it forces the game

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.850 
great to look at but it forces the game
to<00:05:49.789> lag<00:05:49.999> in<00:05:50.240> some<00:05:50.479> places<00:05:50.749> and<00:05:51.110> that<00:05:51.259> is<00:05:51.499> not

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
to lag in some places and that is not

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.820 
to lag in some places and that is not
okay<00:05:52.430> I<00:05:53.089> would<00:05:53.779> have<00:05:53.870> been<00:05:53.990> fine<00:05:54.289> with<00:05:54.529> fewer

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
okay I would have been fine with fewer

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.519 
okay I would have been fine with fewer
graphics<00:05:55.430> and<00:05:55.639> better<00:05:55.939> game<00:05:56.270> speed<00:05:56.659> sure<00:05:57.289> the

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:57.529 
graphics and better game speed sure the

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:59.889 
graphics and better game speed sure the
slowdown<00:05:57.770> is<00:05:58.189> rare<00:05:58.460> but<00:05:58.849> it<00:05:58.939> does<00:05:58.969> happen<00:05:59.210> more

00:05:59.889 --> 00:05:59.899 
slowdown is rare but it does happen more

00:05:59.899 --> 00:06:02.079 
slowdown is rare but it does happen more
often<00:06:00.080> than<00:06:00.409> I<00:06:00.439> would<00:06:00.559> like<00:06:00.919> so<00:06:01.879> yeah<00:06:02.029> you
