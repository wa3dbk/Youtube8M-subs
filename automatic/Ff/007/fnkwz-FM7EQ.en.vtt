is<00:01:48.970> this<00:01:49.630> real<00:01:49.960> randomness<00:01:50.710> in<00:01:51.009> these<00:01:51.310> petals

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
is this real randomness in these petals

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.020 
is this real randomness in these petals
but<00:01:52.509> there's<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:52.900> structure<00:01:53.590> and<00:01:54.009> the<00:01:54.549> tiles

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
but there's a structure and the tiles

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.390 
but there's a structure and the tiles
you<00:01:55.330> can<00:01:55.360> really<00:01:55.750> you<00:01:56.110> customize<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.799> colors

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
you can really you customize the colors

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.870 
you can really you customize the colors
and<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.030> format<00:01:58.479> color<00:01:59.290> first<00:02:00.159> using<00:02:00.820> the

and the format color first using the
daka<00:02:01.060> shape<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.720> bins<00:02:01.960> all<00:02:02.580> as<00:02:03.580> we<00:02:03.729> do

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
daka shape and the bins all as we do

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.820 
daka shape and the bins all as we do
this<00:02:04.000> so<00:02:04.450> once<00:02:04.750> they've<00:02:04.930> done<00:02:05.140> it<00:02:05.590> critic

art<00:02:11.200> absolutely<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:12.160> thought<00:02:12.459> I<00:02:12.489> was<00:02:12.730> looking

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
art absolutely I thought I was looking

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.440 
art absolutely I thought I was looking
for<00:02:13.239> I<00:02:13.450> really<00:02:13.870> gravitated<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.550> series<00:02:16.150> of

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
for I really gravitated to the series of

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.449 
for I really gravitated to the series of
petals<00:02:16.840> I'll<00:02:17.050> still<00:02:17.319> have<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.530> large-scale

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
petals I'll still have a large-scale

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.059

piece<00:02:18.910> of<00:02:19.120> art<00:02:19.420> it'll<00:02:19.870> just<00:02:20.110> be<00:02:20.260> several

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
piece of art it'll just be several

piece of art it'll just be several
pieces<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.580> art<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.120> especially<00:02:23.459> who<00:02:24.459> wants<00:02:24.760> to

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
pieces of art so especially who wants to

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
do the math that nice especially

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.370 
do the math that nice especially
colorful<00:02:33.910> art<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.420> how<00:02:34.780> do<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:34.959> make<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.200> work

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
colorful art and how do you make it work

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.830 
colorful art and how do you make it work
generally<00:02:36.100> speaking<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.880> more<00:02:36.910> intense<00:02:37.540> and

generally speaking the more intense and

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.289 
generally speaking the more intense and
