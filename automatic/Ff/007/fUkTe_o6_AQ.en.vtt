00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.980 
got these scuff FPS competition it's the
wired<00:00:28.019> controller<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.830> got<00:00:29.519> both<00:00:30.269> sticks<00:00:30.689> don't

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990

more comfortable their higher than the
ps3<00:00:36.149> controller<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.960> then<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.200> like<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> same

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
ps3 controller so then I like the same

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.139 
ps3 controller so then I like the same
exact<00:00:38.129> sticks<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.640> they're<00:00:38.790> pretty<00:00:38.969> similar

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
exact sticks but they're pretty similar

you ever played with one of those I did
the<00:00:42.270> normal<00:00:42.750> AV<00:00:43.079> configurations<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.950> back

the normal AV configurations on the back
paddles<00:00:44.610> left<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.899> right<00:00:46.079> speed<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:47.129> i

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
paddles left is a the right speed and i

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.150 
paddles left is a the right speed and i
plan<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:47.820> tactical<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:49.289> that's<00:00:49.469> jump<00:00:49.890> and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
plan on tactical so that's jump and

plan on tactical so that's jump and
knife<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.260> might<00:00:52.559> actually<00:00:52.680> switch<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.129> to

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
knife and I might actually switch it to

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.220 
knife and I might actually switch it to
d4<00:00:53.550> all<00:00:53.610> I'm<00:00:53.730> not<00:00:53.879> positive<00:00:54.059> because<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.690> i

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
d4 all I'm not positive because I i

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.529 
d4 all I'm not positive because I i
heard<00:00:55.770> they<00:00:55.949> nerfed<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.370> knife<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.329> black

heard they nerfed the knife on a black
ops<00:00:57.750> 2<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.289> might<00:00:58.440> not<00:00:58.469> be<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:59.039> big<00:00:59.309> an

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
ops 2 so that might not be as big an

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.750 
ops 2 so that might not be as big an
advantage<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.350> also<00:01:01.350> got<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> scuff<00:01:02.070> grip<00:01:02.399> on

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
advantage I also got the scuff grip on

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.649 
advantage I also got the scuff grip on
the<00:01:02.850> back<00:01:03.059> feels<00:01:03.930> really<00:01:04.170> good<00:01:04.350> i<00:01:04.409> like<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.920> i

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
the back feels really good i like it i

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.820 
the back feels really good i like it i
recommend<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.750> but<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:06.990> not<00:01:07.080> necessary<00:01:07.590> so

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
recommend it but it's not necessary so

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.170 
recommend it but it's not necessary so
like<00:01:07.950> if<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.130> want<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.369> save<00:01:08.520> yourself<00:01:08.640> i

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
like if you want to save yourself i

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.270 
like if you want to save yourself i
think<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.570> was<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:09.720> fifteen<00:01:10.080> dollars<00:01:10.530> and

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
think it was like fifteen dollars and

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.850 
think it was like fifteen dollars and
that'd<00:01:11.490> be<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> good<00:01:11.820> place<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.210> do<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.770> make<00:01:13.770> it

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
that'd be a good place to do it make it

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.990 
that'd be a good place to do it make it
a<00:01:13.890> little<00:01:13.979> more<00:01:14.100> affordable<00:01:14.610> for<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.820> guys<00:01:14.970> i

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
that long to get used to it took me like

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.810 
that long to get used to it took me like
a<00:01:45.479> day<00:01:45.750> maybe<00:01:45.990> two<00:01:46.159> I've<00:01:47.159> seen<00:01:47.340> some<00:01:47.490> reviews

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
a day maybe two I've seen some reviews

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.490 
a day maybe two I've seen some reviews
up<00:01:47.970> saying<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.360> took<00:01:48.509> them<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> couple<00:01:48.720> weeks<00:01:49.140> I

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
up saying it took them a couple weeks I

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.440 
up saying it took them a couple weeks I
don't<00:01:49.710> really<00:01:50.009> know<00:01:50.549> why<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.149> we've<00:01:51.240> taken

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
don't really know why and we've taken

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.389 
don't really know why and we've taken
that<00:01:51.689> long<00:01:51.899> didn't<00:01:52.409> take<00:01:52.560> me<00:01:52.710> long<00:01:52.740> at<00:01:53.009> all<00:01:53.130> I

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
that long didn't take me long at all I

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.940 
that long didn't take me long at all I
really<00:01:53.909> liked<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:55.320> notice<00:01:55.740> and

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
really liked it and I notice and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.380 
really liked it and I notice and
improved<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.310> jump<00:01:56.490> shot<00:01:56.700> almost<00:01:57.060> like<00:01:57.180> right

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
improved to jump shot almost like right

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.929 
improved to jump shot almost like right
away<00:01:58.100> I've<00:01:59.100> been<00:01:59.219> jumped<00:01:59.490> shopping<00:01:59.790> since

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
away I've been jumped shopping since

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.700 
away I've been jumped shopping since
like<00:02:00.119> literally<00:02:00.540> since<00:02:00.659> call<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.930> duty<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
like literally since call of duty to the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.399 
like literally since call of duty to the
entire<00:02:01.979> time<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:03.030> really<00:02:03.630> didn't<00:02:03.840> think<00:02:03.869> when<00:02:04.320> I

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
entire time I really didn't think when I

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.080 
entire time I really didn't think when I
was<00:02:04.500> watching<00:02:04.590> other<00:02:04.890> reviews<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.939> would

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
was watching other reviews that it would

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.479 
was watching other reviews that it would
be<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> huge<00:02:06.600> huge<00:02:06.899> difference<00:02:07.439> between<00:02:07.829> being

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
be a huge huge difference between being

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.910 
be a huge huge difference between being
able<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.879> aim<00:02:09.060> while<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.690> jump<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.470> then<00:02:10.679> just

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
able to aim while you jump and then just

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.790 
able to aim while you jump and then just
switching<00:02:11.310> from<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.580> aim<00:02:11.730> stick<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
switching from the aim stick to the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.440 
switching from the aim stick to the
button<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.070> jump<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.520> then<00:02:14.610> back<00:02:14.880> like<00:02:15.300> that

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
button to jump and then back like that

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.180 
button to jump and then back like that
second<00:02:15.990> half<00:02:16.170> second<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.590> takes<00:02:16.800> didn't

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
second half second it takes didn't

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.580 
second half second it takes didn't
really<00:02:17.400> think<00:02:17.490> I'd<00:02:17.610> make<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.790> big<00:02:17.970> difference

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
really think I'd make a big difference

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.780 
really think I'd make a big difference
but<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.710> actually<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.190> did<00:02:20.370> make<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.610> big

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
but it actually it did make a big

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.940 
but it actually it did make a big
difference<00:02:20.970> for<00:02:21.150> me<00:02:21.270> at<00:02:21.390> least<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.930> can<00:02:22.470> aim<00:02:22.650> the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
difference for me at least I can aim the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.690 
difference for me at least I can aim the
entire<00:02:23.190> time<00:02:23.490> it's<00:02:24.480> not<00:02:24.600> like<00:02:25.430> feels<00:02:26.430> really

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
entire time it's not like feels really

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.210 
entire time it's not like feels really
natural<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.750> way<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.680> back<00:02:28.860> button<00:02:29.100> is

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
natural to the way the back button is

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.300 
natural to the way the back button is
placed<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:30.930> just<00:02:31.140> hit<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.440> jump<00:02:31.890> like<00:02:32.190> I

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
placed you just hit that jump like I

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.820 
placed you just hit that jump like I
said<00:02:32.370> aim<00:02:32.700> immediately<00:02:33.420> now<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.320> do<00:02:34.530> actually

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
said aim immediately now I do actually

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.540 
said aim immediately now I do actually
knife<00:02:35.130> people<00:02:35.490> with<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.000> B<00:02:36.150> button<00:02:37.070> being<00:02:38.070> on

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
knife people with the B button being on

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.950 
knife people with the B button being on
the<00:02:38.640> back<00:02:38.820> because<00:02:39.090> earlier<00:02:39.540> playing<00:02:39.840> on

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
the back because earlier playing on

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.720 
the back because earlier playing on
tactical<00:02:40.380> it's<00:02:40.530> kind<00:02:40.710> of<00:02:40.770> awkward<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.220> just<00:02:41.430> go

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
tactical it's kind of awkward to just go

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.190 
tactical it's kind of awkward to just go
to<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.910> be<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.240> fast<00:02:42.480> I'd<00:02:42.690> rather<00:02:42.840> just<00:02:43.080> try

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
to the be that fast I'd rather just try

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.910 
to the be that fast I'd rather just try
to<00:02:43.260> shoot<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.590> guy<00:02:44.930> but<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:45.960> yeah<00:02:46.320> so<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.650> really

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
to shoot the guy but I yeah so it really

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.090 
to shoot the guy but I yeah so it really
improved<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.430> aspect<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.030> my<00:02:48.120> game<00:02:48.150> as<00:02:48.480> well

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
improved that aspect of my game as well

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.730 
improved that aspect of my game as well

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
whole tutorial on how to set it up to

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.150 
whole tutorial on how to set it up to
make<00:02:56.790> sure<00:02:56.910> that<00:02:57.090> I'll<00:02:57.210> stick<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:59.010> make

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
make sure that I'll stick and to make

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.180 
make sure that I'll stick and to make
sure<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.970> actually<00:03:00.540> reads<00:03:01.350> every<00:03:01.650> single<00:03:02.070> time

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190

sure it actually reads every single time
you<00:03:02.220> pull<00:03:02.550> it<00:03:02.640> cuz<00:03:02.790> sometimes<00:03:02.910> if<00:03:03.210> you<00:03:03.300> said

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
you pull it cuz sometimes if you said

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.750 
you pull it cuz sometimes if you said
the<00:03:03.540> trigger<00:03:03.750> is<00:03:03.840> too<00:03:03.990> low<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.860> can<00:03:04.980> get<00:03:05.160> pull

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the trigger is too low you can get pull

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.370 
the trigger is too low you can get pull
it<00:03:05.850> back<00:03:06.030> once<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.540> then<00:03:06.630> it'll<00:03:06.840> stick<00:03:07.110> in<00:03:07.260> on

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
it back once and then it'll stick in on

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.170 
it back once and then it'll stick in on
either<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.650> mortal<00:03:08.250> just<00:03:08.430> keep<00:03:08.640> shooting<00:03:08.820> even

better<00:03:23.760> more<00:03:24.030> responsive<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:24.870> really<00:03:25.320> like<00:03:25.470> the

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
better more responsive I really like the

better more responsive I really like the
huge<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:26.310> triggers<00:03:26.610> ops<00:03:26.820> 2<00:03:27.060> because<00:03:28.020> it

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
huge the triggers ops 2 because it

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.710 
huge the triggers ops 2 because it
doesn't<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.670> saves<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.090> time<00:03:30.300> it<00:03:30.540> doesn't

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
doesn't it saves you time it doesn't

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.290 
doesn't it saves you time it doesn't
really<00:03:31.650> waste<00:03:32.190> any<00:03:32.489> time<00:03:32.580> at<00:03:32.910> all<00:03:33.030> when<00:03:33.239> you

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
really waste any time at all when you

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.030 
really waste any time at all when you
won't<00:03:33.750> pull<00:03:34.050> it<00:03:34.140> down<00:03:34.320> pull<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:34.590> down<00:03:34.770> pull<00:03:34.950> it

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
won't pull it down pull it down pull it

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.160 
won't pull it down pull it down pull it
down<00:03:35.190> just<00:03:35.400> shoots<00:03:35.670> immediately<00:03:36.270> and<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:36.930> goes

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
down just shoots immediately and it goes

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.590 
down just shoots immediately and it goes
right<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:37.500> where<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:38.160> shoot<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:39.090> sweet<00:03:39.360> spot

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
right to where you shoot the sweet spot

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.050 
right to where you shoot the sweet spot
they<00:03:39.780> call<00:03:39.989> it<00:03:40.140> on<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.380> controller<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:41.580> then

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
they call it on the controller and then

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.170 
they call it on the controller and then
right<00:03:42.270> back<00:03:42.450> up<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.930> where<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.940> have<00:03:45.060> it

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
right back up to where you have it

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.740 
right back up to where you have it
adjusted<00:03:45.270> to<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.190> it's<00:03:47.190> actually<00:03:47.580> it<00:03:48.239> doesn't

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
adjusted to and it's actually it doesn't

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.540 
adjusted to and it's actually it doesn't
not<00:03:49.140> a<00:03:49.170> lot<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.500> movement<00:03:49.950> in<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.130> triggers<00:03:50.430> at

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
not a lot of movement in the triggers at

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.630 
not a lot of movement in the triggers at
always<00:03:50.820> needed<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.120> shoot<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:52.530> having<00:03:53.100> the

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
always needed to shoot it so having the

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.580 
always needed to shoot it so having the
big<00:03:53.880> long<00:03:54.180> normal<00:03:54.720> triggers<00:03:55.020> are<00:03:55.170> kind<00:03:55.320> of<00:03:55.440> a

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
big long normal triggers are kind of a

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.979 
big long normal triggers are kind of a
waste<00:03:55.920> of<00:03:56.190> time<00:03:56.640> and<00:03:56.970> in<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.450> game<00:03:57.630> like<00:03:57.660> all<00:03:57.959> a

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
waste of time and in a game like all a

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.100 
waste of time and in a game like all a
duty<00:03:58.320> where<00:03:58.530> you<00:03:58.620> die<00:03:58.860> so<00:03:59.190> quickly<00:04:00.110> every

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
duty where you die so quickly every

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.290 
duty where you die so quickly every
little<00:04:01.260> half<00:04:01.680> second<00:04:02.100> second<00:04:02.489> matters<00:04:02.850> so<00:04:03.120> any

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
little half second second matters so any

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.550 
little half second second matters so any
advantage<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:03.840> can<00:04:03.870> get<00:04:04.110> over<00:04:04.440> your

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
advantage you can get over your

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.970 
advantage you can get over your
competition<00:04:05.030> definitely<00:04:06.030> an<00:04:06.120> added<00:04:06.239> plus<00:04:06.980> and

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
competition definitely an added plus and

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.800 
competition definitely an added plus and
overall<00:04:08.280> it's<00:04:08.459> just<00:04:08.580> a<00:04:08.670> lot<00:04:08.880> better<00:04:09.209> than<00:04:09.540> any

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
overall it's just a lot better than any

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.540 
overall it's just a lot better than any
other<00:04:09.870> controller<00:04:10.290> tried<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:11.040> was<00:04:11.280> actually

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
other controller tried I was actually

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.270 
other controller tried I was actually
really<00:04:11.790> excited<00:04:12.000> for<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.660> razer<00:04:12.870> onza<00:04:13.280> their

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
really excited for the razer onza their

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.190 
really excited for the razer onza their
controller<00:04:14.730> i<00:04:15.000> can<00:04:15.630> actually<00:04:15.780> lined<00:04:16.080> up

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
controller i can actually lined up

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.130 
controller i can actually lined up
reordering<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:16.830> I<00:04:17.040> got<00:04:17.850> it<00:04:18.030> I<00:04:18.180> almost<00:04:18.510> hated<00:04:18.930> it

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
reordering it I got it I almost hated it

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.810 
reordering it I got it I almost hated it
immediately<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.830> controller<00:04:20.130> is<00:04:20.310> really<00:04:20.549> big

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
immediately the controller is really big

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.990 
immediately the controller is really big
and<00:04:20.850> bulky<00:04:21.269> and<00:04:21.750> awkward<00:04:21.989> in<00:04:22.410> your<00:04:22.560> hands<00:04:23.000> the

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
and bulky and awkward in your hands the

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.490 
and bulky and awkward in your hands the
added<00:04:24.240> triggers<00:04:24.570> over<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.840> top<00:04:25.020> didn't<00:04:25.320> feel

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
added triggers over the top didn't feel

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.390 
added triggers over the top didn't feel
natural<00:04:25.710> at<00:04:26.010> all

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
natural at all

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.920 
natural at all
and<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:27.060> trigger<00:04:27.300> on<00:04:27.389> the<00:04:27.479> back<00:04:27.630> which<00:04:27.780> is

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
and the trigger on the back which is

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.510 
and the trigger on the back which is
kind<00:04:28.110> of<00:04:28.139> too<00:04:28.290> long<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:28.590> like<00:04:28.949> swooping<00:04:29.400> I

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
kind of too long and like swooping I

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.550 
kind of too long and like swooping I
didn't<00:04:29.790> I<00:04:29.970> guess<00:04:30.479> that<00:04:30.630> did<00:04:30.780> not<00:04:30.900> like<00:04:31.110> it<00:04:31.139> one

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
didn't I guess that did not like it one

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.100 
didn't I guess that did not like it one
bit<00:04:31.910> it's<00:04:32.910> actually<00:04:33.180> in<00:04:33.300> my<00:04:33.419> room<00:04:33.630> still<00:04:33.900> just

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
bit it's actually in my room still just

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.719 
bit it's actually in my room still just
bitter<00:04:34.560> collecting<00:04:35.009> dust<00:04:35.190> actually<00:04:35.580> went

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
bitter collecting dust actually went

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.050 
bitter collecting dust actually went
back<00:04:35.880> to<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.330> regular<00:04:36.570> xbox<00:04:37.229> controller<00:04:38.060> and

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
back to the regular xbox controller and

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.580 
back to the regular xbox controller and
the<00:04:39.150> scuffle<00:04:39.449> obviously<00:04:39.720> is<00:04:39.810> built<00:04:40.020> off<00:04:40.139> xbox

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
the scuffle obviously is built off xbox

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.110 
the scuffle obviously is built off xbox
control<00:04:40.889> they<00:04:41.039> just<00:04:41.220> add<00:04:41.370> features<00:04:41.820> to<00:04:41.850> make

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
control they just add features to make

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.260 
control they just add features to make
it<00:04:42.330> better<00:04:42.479> and<00:04:42.979> because<00:04:43.979> i<00:04:44.310> use<00:04:44.639> the<00:04:44.850> Hansa

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
it better and because i use the Hansa

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.990 
it better and because i use the Hansa
and<00:04:45.539> so<00:04:45.690> how<00:04:45.960> bad<00:04:46.259> that<00:04:46.620> was<00:04:46.889> it<00:04:47.639> really<00:04:47.820> makes

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
and so how bad that was it really makes

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.120 
and so how bad that was it really makes
me<00:04:48.120> appreciate<00:04:48.210> how<00:04:49.020> well<00:04:49.350> they<00:04:49.590> actually<00:04:49.919> did

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
me appreciate how well they actually did

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.879 
me appreciate how well they actually did
make<00:04:50.340> this<00:04:50.580> stuff<00:04:50.910> like<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:51.900> back<00:04:52.080> panels<00:04:52.620> are

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
make this stuff like the back panels are

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.010 
make this stuff like the back panels are
absolutely<00:04:53.580> perfect<00:04:54.150> do<00:04:54.660> not<00:04:54.780> like<00:04:54.930> those

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
absolutely perfect do not like those

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.390 
absolutely perfect do not like those
little<00:04:55.229> buttons<00:04:55.470> if<00:04:55.740> you<00:04:55.860> I<00:04:56.130> don't<00:04:56.250> know<00:04:56.310> if

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
little buttons if you I don't know if

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.770 
little buttons if you I don't know if
anyone<00:04:56.669> had<00:04:56.789> a<00:04:56.820> modder<00:04:57.060> controller<00:04:57.479> if<00:04:57.660> you

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
anyone had a modder controller if you

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.300 
anyone had a modder controller if you
but<00:04:58.020> you<00:04:58.350> might<00:04:58.590> have<00:04:58.620> seen<00:04:58.889> them<00:04:59.100> there's

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
but you might have seen them there's

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.100 
but you might have seen them there's
just<00:04:59.430> a<00:04:59.520> tiny<00:04:59.729> little<00:04:59.880> button<00:05:00.660> in<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:00.930> back

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
just a tiny little button in the back

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
this controller is that sometimes it

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:26.779 
this controller is that sometimes it
will<00:05:24.660> readily<00:05:24.960> shoot<00:05:25.430> like<00:05:26.430> if<00:05:26.520> one<00:05:26.610> of<00:05:26.729> my

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
will readily shoot like if one of my

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.890 
will readily shoot like if one of my
teammates<00:05:27.150> yells<00:05:27.620> it<00:05:28.620> will<00:05:28.770> just<00:05:29.570> shoot<00:05:30.570> off<00:05:30.870> a

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
doesn't happen that often maybe like

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.490 
doesn't happen that often maybe like
once<00:06:07.289> twice<00:06:07.530> a<00:06:07.590> day<00:06:07.919> I<00:06:08.130> play<00:06:08.789> for<00:06:08.849> good<00:06:09.500> couple

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
once twice a day I play for good couple

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.469 
once twice a day I play for good couple
matches<00:06:10.860> every<00:06:11.099> day<00:06:11.220> so<00:06:11.280> it's<00:06:11.520> not<00:06:11.639> like<00:06:12.419> I

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
matches every day so it's not like I

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.060 
matches every day so it's not like I
don't<00:06:12.750> play<00:06:12.960> but<00:06:13.470> yeah<00:06:13.650> it<00:06:13.740> just<00:06:13.800> hasn't

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
don't play but yeah it just hasn't

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.200 
don't play but yeah it just hasn't
really<00:06:14.370> been<00:06:14.460> too<00:06:14.669> much<00:06:14.760> at<00:06:14.909> issue<00:06:15.030> for<00:06:15.300> me<00:06:15.949> um

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
really been too much at issue for me um

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.520 
really been too much at issue for me um
yeah<00:06:18.210> so<00:06:18.330> that's<00:06:18.570> pretty<00:06:18.930> much<00:06:19.020> what<00:06:19.229> I<00:06:19.289> think

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
yeah so that's pretty much what I think

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.620 
yeah so that's pretty much what I think
I<00:06:19.830> think<00:06:20.669> it's<00:06:20.789> definitely<00:06:21.120> worth<00:06:21.330> the<00:06:21.510> money

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
I think it's definitely worth the money

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.100 
I think it's definitely worth the money
I<00:06:21.990> you<00:06:22.440> can<00:06:22.560> go<00:06:22.680> out<00:06:22.830> search<00:06:23.190> for<00:06:23.460> one<00:06:23.610> of<00:06:23.729> the

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
I you can go out search for one of the

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.899 
I you can go out search for one of the
e-codes<00:06:25.110> discount<00:06:26.099> codes<00:06:26.280> I<00:06:26.520> think<00:06:26.699> I<00:06:26.760> use

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:26.909 
e-codes discount codes I think I use

like Woody's or some like that I don't
even<00:06:28.289> know<00:06:28.530> I<00:06:28.770> think<00:06:29.580> I<00:06:29.639> just<00:06:29.849> go<00:06:30.000> with<00:06:30.210> it<00:06:30.330> and

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
even know I think I just go with it and

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.939 
even know I think I just go with it and
then<00:06:30.570> enter<00:06:30.780> whichever<00:06:31.199> one<00:06:31.349> I<00:06:31.380> saw<00:06:31.620> you're
