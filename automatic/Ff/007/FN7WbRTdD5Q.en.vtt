00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.200 

we<00:00:22.260> just<00:00:22.529> got<00:00:22.710> worse<00:00:22.980> as<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.340> got<00:00:23.490> older<00:00:23.519> you

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
we just got worse as I got older you

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.220

know<00:00:24.300> go<00:00:24.510> on<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.900> off<00:00:24.990> different

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
know go on and off different

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.259 
know go on and off different
prescriptions<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.369> eventually<00:00:26.939> my<00:00:27.029> body

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
prescriptions and eventually my body

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.490 
prescriptions and eventually my body
would<00:00:27.480> get<00:00:27.599> immune<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.230> I'd<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.470> a

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
would get immune to and I'd have a

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.929 
would get immune to and I'd have a
seizure<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.099> then<00:00:29.220> we<00:00:29.279> would<00:00:29.369> just<00:00:29.550> change<00:00:29.789> to

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
seizure so then we would just change to

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.759 
seizure so then we would just change to
another<00:00:30.179> prescription<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:31.380> went<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:31.590> that

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
another prescription and went on that

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.920 
another prescription and went on that
way<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:32.099> years<00:00:32.460> till<00:00:33.360> eventually<00:00:33.780> just

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
way for years till eventually just

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.880

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
to step in and you want to take it away

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.950 
to step in and you want to take it away
and<00:01:55.759> you<00:01:56.030> want<00:01:56.180> to<00:01:56.240> put<00:01:56.390> yourself<00:01:56.509> in<00:01:56.869> their

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
place I tell her that if I could trade

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.480 
place I tell her that if I could trade
with<00:01:59.600> you<00:01:59.720> I<00:01:59.750> would<00:02:00.170> sew<00:02:00.740> this<00:02:00.830> laser<00:02:01.100> surgery

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
with you I would sew this laser surgery

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.039 
with you I would sew this laser surgery
was<00:02:01.610> like<00:02:01.640> my<00:02:01.820> last<00:02:02.030> hope<00:02:02.270> I<00:02:02.540> had<00:02:02.750> no<00:02:02.930> other

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
was like my last hope I had no other

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.920 
was like my last hope I had no other
options<00:02:03.470> I<00:02:03.560> didn't<00:02:03.740> know<00:02:03.799> what<00:02:03.950> else<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.220> do<00:02:04.930> in

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
options I didn't know what else to do in

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.630 
options I didn't know what else to do in
terms<00:02:06.140> of<00:02:06.350> looking<00:02:06.590> at<00:02:06.680> other<00:02:06.860> medicines<00:02:07.399> we

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
terms of looking at other medicines we

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.249 
terms of looking at other medicines we
knew<00:02:07.790> that<00:02:07.970> wasn't<00:02:08.179> going<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.600> be<00:02:08.690> effective

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
knew that wasn't going to be effective

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.620 
knew that wasn't going to be effective
for<00:02:09.470> her<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:10.160> so<00:02:10.970> this<00:02:11.360> surgery<00:02:12.370> was<00:02:13.630> reading

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
for her and so this surgery was reading

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.410 
for her and so this surgery was reading
more<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:14.959> her<00:02:15.260> her<00:02:15.620> last-ditch<00:02:16.340> effort<00:02:16.880> to

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
more of her her last-ditch effort to

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.420 
more of her her last-ditch effort to
become<00:02:17.600> seizure<00:02:18.260> free<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:18.709> she<00:02:19.100> was<00:02:19.310> the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
become seizure free and she was the

for<00:02:31.760> epilepsy<00:02:32.000> this<00:02:32.840> is<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.170> procedure<00:02:33.800> that
