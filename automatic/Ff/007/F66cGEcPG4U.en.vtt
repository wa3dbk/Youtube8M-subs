00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.510
 then the new furniture of theil ashima our series 4 of its 5 the 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.789
 first grossi rating comes 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:17.139
 of a building scattered in 6 4 which replaces the metal 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:22.189
 and if kate is a material obtained by the fusion of carbon and polyamide 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.539
 which finally allows to have agility as strong as the states do not 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.359
 not even thought that with a much lighter weight what will it allow to 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.640
 gaining sensation since I was forced on a reel to support him 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.620
 in addition to sensations and fine 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.890
 a good level of throwing combat at the level of touch that his 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.090
 peers today he pointed out what allows us to bring over 100 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.060
 centimeters to say a master by turns of crank is furniture that 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.070
 is really meant adp each distance friends big reels 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.570
 hence the interest of being able to bring back at least one meter per crank turn 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.570
 which allows fisheries large distances 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.880
 of course pointed out that this offers an extremely powerful killer moment one has 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.660
 really 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.110
 so that they largely prevent prevented from doing in all 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.810
 terms 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.400
 or even sin on his lawyer a problem 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.400
 So the advantage on this new menu 6 4 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.380
 it is equipped with a constant good health system that is to say that 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.720
 we do not make several turns to arrive at an optimal tension without 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.399
 pressure can be passed 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.740
 here a tension that is balanced by doing that 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.540
 return 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.300
 not even a complete turn by making three quarter turn 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.670
 we already have a pension it is very very difficult it will come out 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.060
 another important point therefore concerning these medium distances with respect the 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.830
 place of profiles in fact the output of the a9 at the coil which 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.920
 is called hen arches that will allow when you go to launch a it's going 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.000
 actually allow it's orientation this inclination allow it 1 a 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.140
 unfolding the film during the optimal throw with the least friction 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.450
 possible 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.240
 so you will still gain in distance 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.990
 this system actually to be placed in all the mechanisms are set up 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.750
 around nÃ®mes works very fluidly at the gears 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.440
 level of crank turns 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.960
 finished it's really very very nice to use the lawyers 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.730
 of the same manual palin in the rotation that really think the minister the most 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.760
 possible fluid so that the sensations are diverted
