that<00:00:29.340> maybe<00:00:30.119> but<00:00:30.779> they<00:00:31.170> didn't<00:00:31.439> let<00:00:31.560> that

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
that maybe but they didn't let that

what happened early in the game from

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.410 
what happened early in the game from
your<00:01:15.990> perspective<00:01:16.880> then<00:01:17.880> they<00:01:17.970> bothered<00:01:18.330> us

your perspective then they bothered us
with<00:01:18.630> their<00:01:18.780> pressure<00:01:19.020> I'm<00:01:19.890> letting<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.310> they

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
with their pressure I'm letting it they

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.789 
with their pressure I'm letting it they
did<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.820> good<00:01:20.970> job<00:01:21.030> denying<00:01:21.750> our<00:01:22.020> wings<00:01:22.229> getting

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
did a good job denying our wings getting

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.240 
did a good job denying our wings getting
us<00:01:22.890> out<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.070> our<00:01:23.610> sets<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.299> little<00:01:24.900> bit<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
us out of our sets a little bit so the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.700 
us out of our sets a little bit so the
pressure<00:01:26.490> bothered<00:01:26.909> us<00:01:27.000> early<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.710> think

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
some easy buckets so their pressure

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.609
