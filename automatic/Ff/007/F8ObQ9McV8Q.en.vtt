00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.080 
agree you know those were some bad
things<00:03:15.260> about<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.650> game<00:03:15.830> but<00:03:16.459> it<00:03:16.640> wasn't<00:03:16.970> that

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
things about the game but it wasn't that

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.060 
things about the game but it wasn't that
much<00:03:17.330> where<00:03:17.630> you<00:03:17.750> know<00:03:17.959> I<00:03:18.230> just<00:03:18.890> stopped

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
much where you know I just stopped

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.070 
much where you know I just stopped
playing<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.370> game<00:03:19.519> all<00:03:19.700> together<00:03:19.850> actually<00:03:20.269> to

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
playing a game all together actually to

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.900 
playing a game all together actually to
put<00:03:21.260> it<00:03:21.290> in<00:03:21.440> you<00:03:21.620> know<00:03:21.769> to<00:03:22.130> make<00:03:22.549> some<00:03:22.760> sense

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
put it in you know to make some sense

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.880 
put it in you know to make some sense
here<00:03:23.209> I<00:03:23.420> really<00:03:23.930> never<00:03:24.080> had<00:03:24.200> a<00:03:24.380> problem<00:03:24.680> with

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
here I really never had a problem with

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.280 
here I really never had a problem with
no<00:03:25.070> mp40<00:03:25.790> or<00:03:25.910> stopping<00:03:26.150> power<00:03:26.390> there<00:03:27.200> was

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
no mp40 or stopping power there was

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.720 
no mp40 or stopping power there was
actually<00:03:27.650> one<00:03:27.680> thing<00:03:27.920> where<00:03:28.340> people<00:03:28.370> like

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
actually one thing where people like

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.190 
actually one thing where people like
slide<00:03:29.030> on<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.239> ground<00:03:29.450> like<00:03:29.570> a<00:03:29.600> snake<00:03:29.989> and

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
slide on the ground like a snake and

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.750 
slide on the ground like a snake and
that<00:03:30.410> kind<00:03:30.620> of<00:03:30.739> knowing<00:03:30.980> me<00:03:31.130> at<00:03:31.220> some<00:03:31.430> points

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
that kind of knowing me at some points

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.670 
that kind of knowing me at some points
in<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:31.910> game<00:03:31.940> but<00:03:32.750> that<00:03:32.930> wasn't<00:03:33.320> really<00:03:33.350> that

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
in the game but that wasn't really that

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.560 
in the game but that wasn't really that
bad<00:03:33.890> cuz<00:03:34.220> you<00:03:34.310> know<00:03:34.400> I<00:03:34.459> just<00:03:34.489> really<00:03:34.910> that<00:03:35.390> just

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
bad cuz you know I just really that just

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.090 
bad cuz you know I just really that just
encouraged<00:03:36.019> me<00:03:36.110> to<00:03:36.140> drop<00:03:36.410> shot<00:03:36.650> more<00:03:36.890> you<00:03:36.980> know

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
shoot him in the head that's a free hand

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.000 
shoot him in the head that's a free hand
shot<00:03:38.540> pretty<00:03:38.720> much<00:03:38.959> so<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:39.590> know<00:03:39.769> I<00:03:39.950> don't

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
shot pretty much so you know I don't

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.560 
shot pretty much so you know I don't
know<00:03:40.250> why<00:03:40.400> people<00:03:40.430> complain<00:03:41.030> about<00:03:41.180> that

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
know why people complain about that

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.720 
know why people complain about that
maybe<00:03:41.959> maybe<00:03:42.350> people<00:03:43.280> just<00:03:43.310> didn't<00:03:43.580> want<00:03:43.700> to

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
maybe maybe people just didn't want to

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.949 
maybe maybe people just didn't want to
play<00:03:43.880> around<00:03:44.060> smart<00:03:44.540> or<00:03:44.660> something<00:03:44.840> like<00:03:44.900> that

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
play around smart or something like that

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.570 
play around smart or something like that
maybe<00:03:45.290> cuz<00:03:45.680> it<00:03:45.830> was<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.010> old<00:03:46.130> call<00:03:46.370> duty

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
maybe cuz it was the old call duty

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.470 
maybe cuz it was the old call duty
nobody<00:03:47.299> wanted<00:03:47.510> to<00:03:47.600> play<00:03:47.720> tactical<00:03:48.230> and<00:03:48.350> stuff
