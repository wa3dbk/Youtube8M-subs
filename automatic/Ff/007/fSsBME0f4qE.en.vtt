00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
are really overpowered still thought

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.539 
are really overpowered still thought
they<00:01:54.420> are<00:01:54.630> primary<00:01:55.259> they<00:01:56.040> said<00:01:56.399> they're

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
they are primary they said they're

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.550
