00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.280
 who 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.739
 the cellars do not get into the focus did he 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.980
 will prepare plenty of room and a lot 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:57.640
 tonight and using the media 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:01.900
 Korean and I'm sure you're going 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.119
 to worship and I had appreciated then we 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.160
 had through nyala the chance to 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.410
 discover a lot of products sometimes 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.960
 we were brought a lot of things from 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.740
 dried fish 18 abalone abuse 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.420
 all sorts 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.580
 so we tried both to respect 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.320
 our our habits because I wanted 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.910
 neither do we work at 200% of the 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.590
 staff and then both 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.910
 to nest these products there to arrive 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.009
 a mix that is interesting 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.880
 tip so you're going to have overall 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.310
 in each point 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.039
 seaweed is it that's the party that 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.229
 slab tonight that's it but we wanted 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.430
 we also wanted it was important for 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.200
 we and it is in greediness 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.910
 I did not want to work the products 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.100
 to work the products because 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.810
 otherwise count in the excess of exoticism and 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:55.380
 I would not have been totally 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:02:01.950
 satisfied it is a great progress 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.950
 replace in order to restore 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.930
 it was strong the mayor which is a very 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.579
 good 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.319
 it is the emission franÃ§ois hollande 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.109
 initiated there are two things behaving 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.420
 good but it does not matter 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:39.700
 flavors things and at the same time it's 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.920
 not so different than that so we're not 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.959
 not destabilized we invest on the 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.879
 ear products it was a beautiful 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.469
 challenge is against the ads where 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:51.459
 I also have one next to them could 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:53.650
 explain by taking them back to the 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.409
 products for codes but the 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.639
 merge with the culture of the surveyed 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:04.079
 French and it happened that these are 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.079
 high level 2 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:15.659
 it's true that we want to know 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:18.599
 more each time I am received a dish 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:21.549
 Canadians and where to find it 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:24.640
 it's proof that cooking is 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:29.400
 international since they are 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.780
 ingredients reading Korean products 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.440
 but it's a way of comolli that is 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.760
 extremely French is actually 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.340
 could not say what is the purpose 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.959
 it's just very, very good but it's 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.870
 probably the first time that 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.190
 someone exactly eat that we 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.970
 are the first to eat that 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.980
 exactly 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.470
 and that's the magic of cooking 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.970
 consumes 2 billion on this earth 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.980
 but there at this precise moment 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.120
 there is something very new that 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.120
 is invented and his crutches
