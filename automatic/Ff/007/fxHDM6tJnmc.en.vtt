00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 you pulled back on something and then 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:09.719
 fall back on grammar easier 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:13.400
 compared to the fixed times 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.170
 makes the concentration go down a little 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.860
 the grit 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.080
 maybe it can be too 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.480
 negative has also happened in the past and 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.830
 he said something like we said there is 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.740
 the siena fallen on the triple azio 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.030
 will become a mistake for me 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.680
 unforgettable has nothing to do with the injury 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.410
 my back has nothing to do with it 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.090
 I have mistaken an element for myself 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.880
 of extreme simplicity 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:41.500
 I can do the triple axel also with 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:44.500
 eyes closed and frank it really says 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.440
 it was incredible not to make a mistake 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:52.030
 triple axel if I remember well it says more 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.850
 chosen by European budapest in 2004 a 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.440
 come even he remembered says no 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.270
 I am maker man 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.560
 I'm here to win but what 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.560
 I wanted was active 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.360
 I write for you I say triple bull that in 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.360
 combination 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.500
 the really arrives 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.500
 cat but still standing 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.280
 saluzzo 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.479
 and then saw how the race had gone 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.060
 of his direct opponents he folded 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.950
 no global framework to follow 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.159
 four that should be completed instead 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.280
 very well too 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.530
 in this case, go down by level 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.150
 he was not a problem indeed 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.459
 took advantage of this opportunity as well 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.060
 passionate about the short practically without 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.060
 mistakes 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.260
 shafiq that follows rightly does not have 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.600
 risked how he would have noticed how you had 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.290
 said to know that you did away with it and 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.690
 an almost net path I am a god in 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.870
 negative but for what concerns the 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.060
 triple axel but rightly seeing the 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.850
 mistakes of others perhaps not being able to you 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.750
 obviously approaching a fernandez ha 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:56.810
 avoided risking the fourth change in 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:01.100
 this combination plus initial run 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:05.000
 simple without big problems 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.610
 in short, shafiq beseghi and that is it 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.700
 moved to paris to train him and 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.910
 grenoble and trains with claude for i 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.100
 in his programs and worked also 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.600
 Easter camerlengo another great talent 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.280
 Yesterday we talked about Italian talents 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.380
 who went abroad other 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.380
 but the authorities fear that the 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.270
 Milan 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:33.630
 the crying implemented its own definite framework 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.400
 easiest dosimeters thanks made of 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.060
 all but of the hand did not put it on 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.060
 ice 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.780
 meanwhile on the page 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.050
 Europeans 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.509
 so many are 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.210
 or subscribers we are delighted with that 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:56.050
 that there are these 500 comments 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:59.479
 all naturally very sorry but 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.580
 also keep the symbol 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.879
 Busch still very great too 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.849
 I finally had the proof that he is human 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:10.430
 both today is true today showed of 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:13.840
 be human because it effects the mini that 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.840
 now he had a lot of hundred 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:19.800
 but never, never ever, ever ever 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.710
 yes but then when we make mistakes 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.740
 sorry i'm sorry 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:31.650
 but as we often say, however, apart from him 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:35.070
 it seems to me the cat because in short this 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:38.670
 are already second return let's see why 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:41.130
 he always knows then from 98 to 98 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.900
 European Championships in Milan and Milan 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.710
 one in the north of Rome was my first 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.710
 rai comment 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:54.510
 let's talk about the story a good one comes 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:06:02.970
 score is noticeable if who and why 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:04.470
 30 646 and an important score in the era 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.380
 the one obviously for which obviously 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:10.800
 I worked this as a world limit 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.600
 it is a very important result because 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.290
 in short, you move so many you know i 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:19.590
 skaters we have rome in the kof you 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:23.850

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:28.730
