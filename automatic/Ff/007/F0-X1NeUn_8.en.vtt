00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.270
 that is very rich something that is pretty 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.029
 nutritious has a lot of iron has the 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.400
 carbohydrate of the potato true and has 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.369
 the protein because it's going to be clear 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.710
 chick that some spinach puree with 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.229
 potato that many do not have very rich 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.479
 we go with the ingredients for the 

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:42.269
 chicken burgers what I've done is 

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:53.100
 explained only the chicken without any 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:56.129
 kind of hamburger dressings half 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.719
 they have absolutely no salt and 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.210
 pepper the salt retains liquids our 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.430
 organism 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.780
 there is no separate is a matter of custom 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.520
 be our pain us from 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.100
 small that is newly introduced 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.320
 in food we use it to the 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.450
 natural flavors of food 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.580
 obviously it will not have need 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.890
 put him to talk about demanding that you have 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.170
 something that has sugar or is the most 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.270
 natural that one can do 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:28.220
 accustomed to the palate to be sensitive 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.050
 to the flavors used neither fat nor salt 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.060
 and pepper and cumin so for the 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.850
 first moms is first by data 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.970
 that we can give them zero seasonings is 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.220
 more food to the natural, let's remember 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.840
 that babies do not eat like 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.420
 we should not feed as 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.119
 we are adults that is a 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.810
 totally different diet I have a one 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:54.470
 Daddy just be that done to the 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.170
 when they are cut 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.850
 I'm going to crush it with the fork 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.850
 perfect new smooth ways 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.450
 and then add spinach 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:15.070
 that you already have the spinach parboiled 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.070
 and drained but it is passed in the past 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:25.830
 and good since the spinach a source of 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.680
 iron 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:34.860
 well mixed with the potato it feels like 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.680
 that more richer and then then what 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.050
 we can we will apply life in fine 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.350
 fine tub depending on the age of the baby 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.680
 because the liquefies in the crush do not sting 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.610
 very little ones that already agree 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.240
 you what better than moms who 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.060
 they know their children yes, the best is 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.900
 bet on healthy and natural nutrition 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.900
 exact 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.760
 we have used milk because there are many 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.769
 flaws to lactose used to 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.230
 butter because they are processed fats 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:13.129
 and they still give him to breastfeed they can use 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:17.689
 your own good milk there is that there 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:19.760
 to ask if we give a lot 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:21.560
 the temperature of this breast milk if 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.219
 they lose their properties not exact what 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.340
 good question 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:26.690
 very good question well and good I'm going to 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.250

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.250
 I will add here 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.770
 and spinach the natural 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:42.030
 totally natural flavors 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.030
 today we learn to eat healthy 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:50.430
 good and good and here is forming 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.430
 a natural puree 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.599
 how rich it looks there are seeing in 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.900
 camera lean a little bit more to 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.900
 remove 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.390

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.920

 100% nutrition 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:22.090
 I like it is to opt for a food 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.090
 healthy perfect 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.360
 they have offered us to steam now if 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.099
 you want to add a little bit of flavor 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.639
 add a little quinoa or wheat 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:37.539
 minced can be added up 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.940
 grated carrot knock him out the moment 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.680

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.770
 grated all very scratched but that the 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.919

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.120

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.130
 now we have iron with carbohydrates 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.430

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:14.090

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.160
 I prefer the food without salt I always 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:35.300
 I live in my house please the minimum of 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.560
 salt because I retain the liquids and do not 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.169
 let's put it here because that's how 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.100
 must be presented to the baby so punch 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.960

 Steamed chick but it has another texture 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:20.630
