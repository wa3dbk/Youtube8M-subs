00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:13.580
 Hi, girls today but let's learn to 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.640
 to make milk carton stickers 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.890
 for the image and filled in 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.830
 I cut the front of my box of 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.019
 milk and I'll glaze this part 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.590
 light that is on the inside of the 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.839
 box and others I put my finger to 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.410
 use it as a measure to make the 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:36.230
 easy adhesives various rectangles and 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.500
 then when it dries I'll spend another 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.270
 layer of the base I chose more of 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.910
 flowers so I can show my 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.790
 How do you fill the flowers? 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.910
 I will leave the registration fee for the 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.760
 video of several of 500 that will help you 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.160
 when it's time to stamp now with the brush 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.629
 Half a piece of art, I'm going to fill some 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.820
 flowers with pink enamel always taking 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.410
 careful not to exceed the contour 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.390
 for example not to be blurred 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.390
 I used a scorer and in the yellow enamel 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.119
 to make the kernels of flowers remember 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.940
 people that I used the small plaque 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.130
 enamels will let the 2011 description 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.530
 blog link with all your 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.690
 information 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.270
 the flowers of different shapes stopped 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.920
 of animals 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.490
 I think this combination of rose 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.220
 lilac is very cute 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.500
 the enamel of the flowers arrive 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.770
 the muse a strawberry cherry for me 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.460
 help to release the phase of our box 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.930
 little care is taken not to tear and 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.560
 neither girl 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.840
 I apply with my finger on the nail 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.450
 stretching to avoid bubbles and 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.070
 I also sometimes use a little bit of the toothpick 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.220
 to fix professionals always taking 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.100
 be careful not to damage the 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.220
 give the finish of fixing the sticker I 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.229
 I use more traviÃº I expect some 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.260
 and bought sticks of 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.510
 cherry tree I can solve because 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.510
 He was honored that he was left 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.880
 sticker gently passes to 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.950
 spoil what's already on the nail 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.360
 then just recover what is left over 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.550
 cotton and acetone 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.620
