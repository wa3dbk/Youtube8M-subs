00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.790
 hi friends of gt5 i am stratus yo os 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.469
 I bring a new video for the channel and 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.719
 good guys today I bring you a trick to 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.910
 to be able to enter all the secret areas 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.609
 of the train is worth, for example, 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.189
 dragons in the driver's cabin 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.230
 we go in all those areas that could be 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.420
 call hidden is worth areas to which 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.680
 can not be accessed normally and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.060
 good has to accompany by Ivan 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.070
 forever to leave on your channel the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.170
 description and well then let's start 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.750
 with the trick, the first thing is how it is 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.329
 logical we have to be mounted on a 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.239
 train is worth this, needless to say 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.829
 but good to be clear and good then 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.930
 what we have to do is go to the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.000
 front of the train we have to 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.559
 then put at the end at the beginning of 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.690
 everything is worth just what it would be 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.059
 the train cabin because we have to 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.670
 put on there is worth good now 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.170
 we say one thing you have to have 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.719
 absolutely all your money in the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.340
 bank is worth unlike other tricks 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.320
 that you had to have money in hand 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.390
 this one does not have to have everything in the bank 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.010
 and what you have to have is a 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.900
 of these two contacts that I am going to 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.240
 say now bruce and that is the one 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.130
 I sell you testosterone or the sea 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.570
 ok with either of the two work 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.479
 good what you have to do is call 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.460
 to bruce and in this case it's worth and we're going to 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.720
 ask testosterone test data for what 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.490
 The only thing we have to do is leave the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.410
 open menu to ask her to hit a jump 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.060
 and when we hit a jump give the 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.680
 just like to buy it, it's worth 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.619
 cancel quickly or you give the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.479
 circle so that so that I like you 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.280
 you're going to be in the middle floating in the 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.810
 air is worth the train will go through 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.060
 in front of you and you while giving 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.070
 circles will you come back to look like so 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.840
 which then you can appear here is worth 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.060
 The faster you do unless you 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.649
 you are going to move towards the back 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.450
 of the train is worth as you have seen I have 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.920
 done pretty fast and I was just 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.110
 here in this car that would be what in the 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.630
 good cabin because as you see now we are going 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.429
 to try it again it's worth it but not 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.750
 we need to go to the point I have 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.060
 done at the tip of the train for 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.649
 try to enter the cabin is good 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.300
 now what we are going to try to enter is 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.920
 in a wagon because we do the same 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.110
 same operation we call bruce and 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.640
 we ordered testosterone but before 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.829
 we have to hit a jump 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.360
 remember we jump we press to the x and 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.470
 the time that we create 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.240
 convenient 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.010
 and we give the circle to cancel and 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.410
 come back as you see me this time has 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.360
 appeared inside a car as you see and 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.950
 now obviously clear as 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.160
 except this wagon because in the same way 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.570
 we go back to jump we press to the X 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.040
 we cancel with the circle and we will appear 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.510
 I thought I was in the same car 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.980
 but I realized that not seeing this 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.840
 yellow part said host because there is no 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.630
 changed wagon the past of a wagon 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.420
 who was right behind me like 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.280
 You see, it's a pretty curious thing and 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.080
 It's pretty cool here, as you can see 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.700
 done again and I have been out of 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.130
 that yellow wagon I was in that 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.420
 is that that was right there in front and 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.240
 well, you guys basically the 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.550
 little trick is this is a curiosity I do not know 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.020
 I do not know if we can shoot out 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.209
 I do not think so but you can 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.040
 try it and other things like you see how 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.230
 you know there are many types of trains not 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.000
 they all have the same type of wagon or 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.860
 be that you can try with all 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.150
 the trains that you see and well then I already 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.250
 leave in the comments if you have 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.690
 liked the trick and other and good 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.550
 guys because nothing the only thing I wanted 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.290
 tell you is that give you favorite light if 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.959
