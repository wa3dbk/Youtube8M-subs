00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.930
 hello my dear lovers 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.240
 Easter eggs referrals and indeed everything 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.490
 interesting in today's video games 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.490
 release I decided to dedicate and resident evil 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.150
 5 game developed by the published company 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.239
 capcom 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.340
 and she came out in March 2009 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.890
 Well, let's go along with Chris Redfield 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.230
 his partner, Shiva alomar, will plunge into 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:46.930
 game world and look for everything hidden from us 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:48.580
 and so begin in the second chapter pursuing 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.650
 minions wesker and on the edge 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.629
 huge career you can stumble upon 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.580
 outdoor toilet closed door 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.830
 if we approach it on the screen 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.440
 The signed action button will light up. 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.659
 questions push her and our hero politely 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.489
 knocks on the toilet door, but what if 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.740
 then try to move away from it 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.750
 then the door swings open out of 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.090
 the toilet on us throws infected 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.430
 a local resident whose exact hook 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.229
 you can send back and by the way i don't 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:20.799
 I thought that all infected can also 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:23.170
 use the toilet episode when 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.030
 albert wesker tears off his glasses and throws 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.860
 them and then engages with our 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.350
 heroes in one of the commercials of the game 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.790
 present in the film resident evil 4 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.950
 life after death 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.890
 but actually it was all taken from 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.780
 movie drive 1998 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.810
 where I find out all the same external attributes 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.300
 that and take away ra and human reaction and 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.550
 long cloak by the way this movie is still 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.550
 pore is one of my favorite 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.570
 Ouroboros symbol in the form of a collapsed in 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.700
 snake ring biting its tail 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.860
 and meaning to eternity and infinity 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.690
 used by Japanese developers in 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.730
 as a character not only in this game 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.100
 also named after him 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.489
 corporation in the game from devil may edge 2 and 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:26.250
 mystical ritual playing sir blood curse 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:29.519
 and what do uroboros know for you ? 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.010
 basically next one of the similar moments 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.080
 4 pieces can be found here is 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.150
 that chris can sit down on one of 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.640
 chairs only in the previous part of it 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.090
 the pose was more epic and the chair 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.090
 better 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.370
 another reference to the last part is 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.980
 that as in the fourth part of the resident 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.880
 evil final boss hit comes from 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.880
 rpg-7 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.580
 it's already 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.620
 traveling around the city covered by the virus 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.160
 on the walls of houses in many places you can 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.950
 notice 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.750
 poster about new album release all 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.970
 Hopkins called mosaic 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.430
 in huge numbers exactly the same 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.269
 posters can be seen in the game dead 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.580
 rising 2 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.830
 Apparently these two games are in one 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.190
 the universe and the zombie apocalypse in these 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.470
 games 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.180
 very similar by the way both of them were 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.180
 developed by capcom 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.040
 Well, today it was the last 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.050
