00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
with readily sediment that is deposited

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.350 
with readily sediment that is deposited
at<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.600> bottom<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> can<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:09.770> this<00:01:11.360> size

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
at the bottom of the can and this size

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.200 
at the bottom of the can and this size
one<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.869> usually<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.950> take<00:01:14.670> around

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
one is usually going to take around

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.270 
one is usually going to take around
eighty<00:01:15.659> percent<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.380> all<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.040> sediment

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
eighty percent of all the sediment

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.880 
eighty percent of all the sediment
deposited<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.900> bottom<00:01:19.140> as<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.740> can

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:37.370 

more

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.600 

right<00:01:38.380> here<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:42.040> I<00:01:43.530> hope<00:01:44.530> you<00:01:45.100> can<00:01:45.310> see

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
right here that I hope you can see

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:58.080 
right here that I hope you can see
perfectly<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:49.210> my<00:01:49.630> guess

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.080 

so<00:01:59.090> this<00:01:59.960> is<00:02:00.140> all<00:02:00.380> this<00:02:00.830> is<00:02:00.890> all<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:01.580> have<00:02:01.850> to

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
so this is all this is all you have to

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.450 
so this is all this is all you have to
do<00:02:02.270> every<00:02:02.720> month<00:02:02.960> in<00:02:03.229> which<00:02:03.619> we<00:02:03.890> have<00:02:04.190> like

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
do every month in which we have like

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.219 
do every month in which we have like
crystal<00:02:05.000> clear<00:02:05.500> water<00:02:06.500> in<00:02:06.920> your<00:02:07.130> camp<00:02:07.430> and<00:02:08.229> it

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.380 
crystal clear water in your camp and it
