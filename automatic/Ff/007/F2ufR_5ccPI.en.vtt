00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
mushroom now I'm pretty sure these work

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.500 
mushroom now I'm pretty sure these work
like<00:01:07.950> grass<00:01:08.220> blocks<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.790> my<00:01:08.880> ceiling<00:01:09.270> blocks

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
like grass blocks and my ceiling blocks

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.230 
like grass blocks and my ceiling blocks
they<00:01:09.720> eventually<00:01:09.960> grow<00:01:11.030> they<00:01:12.030> eventually

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
they eventually grow they eventually

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.240 
they eventually grow they eventually
have<00:01:12.689> stuff<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.080> them<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.680> will<00:01:13.830> grow<00:01:14.070> into

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
have stuff on them that will grow into

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.310 
have stuff on them that will grow into
the<00:01:14.430> regular<00:01:14.729> mushroom<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> stuff

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
the regular mushroom that have the stuff

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.190 
the regular mushroom that have the stuff
on<00:01:16.439> top<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.799> whatever<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.960> that's<00:01:18.960> what<00:01:19.140> I'm

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
on top on whatever so that's what I'm

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.100 
on top on whatever so that's what I'm
going<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.409> show<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.950> fire<00:01:20.310> block<00:01:21.110> so

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
going to show you is the fire block so

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.870 
going to show you is the fire block so
the<00:01:22.530> ID<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.220> fire<00:01:23.430> block<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:24.270> 51<00:01:25.520> so<00:01:26.520> this

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the ID for the fire block is 51 so this

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.819 
the ID for the fire block is 51 so this
works<00:01:27.270> kind<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:27.720> any<00:01:27.990> flood<00:01:28.290> steal<00:01:28.590> or

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
works kind of like any flood steal or

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.819 
works kind of like any flood steal or
fire<00:01:29.040> charge<00:01:29.369> as<00:01:29.790> -<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:31.049> doesn't<00:01:31.380> really<00:01:31.590> have

fire charge as - it doesn't really have

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.160 
fire charge as - it doesn't really have
any<00:01:32.130> type<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.549> damage<00:01:33.210> bar<00:01:33.600> or<00:01:33.750> anything<00:01:33.900> so

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
any type of damage bar or anything so

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.050
