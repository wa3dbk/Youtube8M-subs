00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:18.270
 and as we all know youtube is the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.609
 page to see and upload more videos 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.320
 big internet on this page 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.960
 we can find from videos of 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.960
 terror covers videoblogs and much more 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.760
 but a while ago there is a genre of 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.340
 videos that is dominating the network for 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.399
 good or bad that genre as well 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.829
 says the title are the gameplays but 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.629
 what kind of gameplays I do not talk about 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.819
 those gameplays that are for the purpose of 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.760
 tell us something like the guides 

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:46.979
 games or others I talk about those channels 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.899
 you go in and all you see are two 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:52.190
 they are three games and next to the title 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.190
 says something like that 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.050
 those channels that are dedicated to profiting 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.270
 over exploiting a game that if not 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.190
 was because they earn money playing not what 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.350
 they would have stopped playing long ago 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.479
 time and that the only thing we see in everything 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.130
 the video is to a guy saying what 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.530
 is doing in the game that is 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.150
 playing already knowing that we ourselves 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.850
 We can see what he does with our 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.740
 own eyes so that they have an idea of 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.970
 what I 'm talking about I 'm going to show you 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.759
 there are examples all how good 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.619

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.869
 milking amiba that minecraft haha â€‹â€‹go 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:35.610

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.600
 You have liked to share it with all your 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.580
 friends as I also pretended that 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.830
 do with the other 40 series that 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.110
 I have the same game with more than 900 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.700
 chapters in each one so see you 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.009
 in the next video that will be in 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.450
 two minutes wait what a volcano is 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.820
 of emotions like this 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.969
 hello to everything what happens my mother does not 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.490
 want in my house how are we 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.810
 new here in call of duty the cop4 and the 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.869
 today I will talk about the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.570
 originality surely more than one is 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.580
 some good youtuber came to your head 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.370
 now I want to make a criticism about 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.290
 this because I think the gameplays are 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.530
 those responsible for the decline in 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.049
 youtube easy to make videos of that type 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.730
 it is equal to lack of originality to be 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.950
 on youtube in order to profit 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.739
 thanks to the little requirement and point of 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.650
 critical view of people and other fashion 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.989
 reason I do not see him some are going to say and if 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.700
 they do it for fun because I 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.709
 I answer that if this they would do it for 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.810
 fun they would only play it and not what 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.360
 they would upload to youtube since it would not 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.470
 joke record what you're playing 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.930
 saying what you're doing and 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.760
 screaming overacted mind to upload it 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.370
 to youtube knowing that the video will be 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.680
 public the only sense that I see him 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.500
 that's getting money with the game bitches 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.079
 now they will tell me but this in what affects 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.540
 easy youtube much of the 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.380
 bigger youtubers upload this kind of 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.270
 videos 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.520
 when someone just starts in 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.230
 youtube the impression it will have will be 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.820
 the site is a place where they hang 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.940
 videos playing and without saying anything 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.130
 productive and two things can happen one 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.050
 is to take youtube as a site where 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.660
 wasting time is the goal of who 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.970
 enter or two if you are one of these people 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.400
 with undeveloped criteria start at 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.290
 make videos of this type and thus forming 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.990
 a vicious circle of new creators 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.910
 of gameplays every hour another reason for the 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.830
 which the gameplays are the decay of 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.200
 youtube and the same youtubers with 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.940
 good jobs is because youtube is no longer 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.830
 rewards people for the quality of 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.900
 work edition and time that I take 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.150
 making a video of an average of 5 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.700
 minutes but it rewards the videos that 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.070
 they can retain more people and, like all 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.830
 we know the fucking gameplays last longer than 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.810
 25 minutes so the longer and 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.940
 more time people have stayed 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.880
 watching the video more promotion they give to the 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.370
 author for this big youtubers are not 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.880
 recognized or have fewer subscribers 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.310
 of those who deserve want another reason 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.530
 let's see these gameplays are always 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.310
 new games and without end to what I 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.400
 I mean with 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.680
 I mean the multiplayer now that 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.599
 has this bad adding that the 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.550
 most people who see this type of 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.290
 videos have the requirement and criteria 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.870
 on the floor and this I just 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.150
 mention give result that this person 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.980
 is going to go buy that game just because 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.110
 his idol does it too and the biggest 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.120
 part of those games are games 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.010
 repetitive that come out every year with the 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.280
 only purpose of selling copies to these 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.180
 people lacking in already know that 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.550
 regardless of whether the game is 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.889
 good or bad this makes the games 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.110
 good and new are undervalued and 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.110
 Generic and overexploited dominate 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.850
 the sales already to conclude I must say 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.740
 that this video was not just for 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.479
 complain but I did it because I 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.639
 I support good youtubers with 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.650
 excellent jobs that unfortunately 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.900
 nowadays they are not being taken into account 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.850
 and they do not have the same recognition that 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.880
 they have other youtubers that I do not want 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.620
 mention good now I say goodbye without 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.080
 before reminding you that I was not talking 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.030
 of all those who do pain plays but 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.040
 of those people who have in their channel 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.110
 videos of three divided fashion games 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.060
 in 80 parts each 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.070
 if someone bothered the video by 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.080
 please I would like you to go to the link 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.940
 which is in the description that 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.130
 will redirect to a video of me where 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.620
 I'll be collecting signatures for people who 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.640
 he wants me to delete this video without further 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.640
 say greetings 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:35.719
 yes
