was clearly improving over time I use
one<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.469> those<00:00:58.559> interesting<00:00:59.100> moments<00:00:59.460> where

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
one of those interesting moments where

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.819

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.780 
things where everyone learns at
different<00:02:01.350> paces<00:02:01.500> there's<00:02:01.920> your<00:02:02.100> players<00:02:02.460> who

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
different paces there's your players who

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.539 
different paces there's your players who
grind<00:02:03.689> hundreds<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.469> thousands<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.040> games<00:02:05.310> in

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
grind hundreds and thousands of games in

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.889 
grind hundreds and thousands of games in
practice<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.149> when<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.420> see<00:02:06.630> them<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
practice and when you see them in the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.660 
practice and when you see them in the
next<00:02:06.990> tournament<00:02:07.500> there's<00:02:07.890> somewhat

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
next tournament there's somewhat

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.309 
next tournament there's somewhat
different<00:02:09.119> they're<00:02:09.270> not<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.539> revolutionary

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
different they're not in revolutionary

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.780 
different they're not in revolutionary
and<00:02:10.590> also<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.099> get<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.310> chance<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.580> see<00:02:11.760> that

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
and also you get the chance to see that

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.370 
and also you get the chance to see that
these<00:02:12.000> players<00:02:12.330> no<00:02:12.810> matter

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
these players no matter

these players no matter
who<00:02:13.440> they<00:02:13.650> are<00:02:13.830> they<00:02:14.460> never<00:02:14.730> do<00:02:15.000> drastic

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
who they are they never do drastic

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.420 
who they are they never do drastic
changes<00:02:15.990> from<00:02:16.200> game<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.470> game<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.920> game<00:02:17.070> day

changes from game to game to game day

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.970 
changes from game to game to game day
there's<00:02:18.000> always<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.720> slow<00:02:19.290> meticulous

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
there's always that slow meticulous

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.200 
there's always that slow meticulous
plotting<00:02:20.430> process<00:02:20.850> I<00:02:20.910> think<00:02:20.970> that's

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
plotting process I think that's

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.940 
plotting process I think that's
important<00:02:21.690> for<00:02:21.810> any<00:02:21.990> Starcraft<00:02:22.560> player<00:02:22.830> to

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
important for any Starcraft player to

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.140 
important for any Starcraft player to
see<00:02:23.100> because<00:02:23.460> it's<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:23.730> easy<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:23.970> beat

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
see because it's so easy to beat

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.610 
see because it's so easy to beat
yourself<00:02:24.480> up<00:02:24.570> after<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> couple<00:02:25.050> losses<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.500> go

the kickoff of the day for me I was like
this<00:03:05.220> is<00:03:05.280> really<00:03:05.820> awesome<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.750> they<00:03:07.080> get

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
this is really awesome that they get

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.020 
this is really awesome that they get
this<00:03:07.530> ability<00:03:07.800> to<00:03:08.100> do<00:03:08.220> just<00:03:08.490> that<00:03:08.640> I<00:03:08.820> think

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
this ability to do just that I think

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.550 
this ability to do just that I think
it's<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:09.330> important<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.810> just<00:03:10.020> see<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.440> these

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.620 
it's so important to just see that these
players<00:03:10.920> are<00:03:11.040> not<00:03:11.520> competitors<00:03:12.240> their

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
players are not competitors their

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.110 
players are not competitors their

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
collaborators sure they're just ripping

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.300 
collaborators sure they're just ripping
each<00:03:15.240> other<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.480> pieces<00:03:15.660> within<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.230> game<00:03:16.410> but

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
each other to pieces within the game but

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.460 
each other to pieces within the game but
outside<00:03:17.940> they're<00:03:18.750> always<00:03:18.960> willing<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.380> help

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470
