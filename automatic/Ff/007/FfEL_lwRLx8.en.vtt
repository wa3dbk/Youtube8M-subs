usual way we open up SteelSeries most

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.100 
usual way we open up SteelSeries most
paths<00:01:41.700> which<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.240> break<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.630> seal<00:01:42.869> right

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
paths which is to break this seal right

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.499 
paths which is to break this seal right
here<00:01:43.700> it's<00:01:44.700> an<00:01:44.850> outside<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:47.149> pour<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.329> most

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
here it's an outside and pour the most

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.840 
here it's an outside and pour the most
pad<00:01:48.780> out<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.259> other<00:01:49.560> side<00:01:49.950> actually<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
pad out the other side actually like the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.310 
pad out the other side actually like the
packaging<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.509> most<00:01:51.720> pads<00:01:51.930> it's<00:01:52.110> kind<00:01:52.290> of

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
packaging on the most pads it's kind of

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.969 
packaging on the most pads it's kind of
clever<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:53.369> see<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.640> mousing<00:01:54.090> surface<00:01:54.979> holds

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
clever you see the mousing surface holds

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.130 
clever you see the mousing surface holds
it<00:01:56.070> all<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.219> place<00:01:56.729> pretty<00:01:57.119> well<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.960> can

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
it all in place pretty well so you can

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.289 
it all in place pretty well so you can
