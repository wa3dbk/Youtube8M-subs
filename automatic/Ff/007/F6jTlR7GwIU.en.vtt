00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:13.419
 hello everyone today on the channel we weave 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.889
 one more his lanyard called his lanyard 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:17.470
 nodules yes because what to do with 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.600
 many sites on the Internet have 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.740
 such a topic that he called him 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.290
 calls baptized 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.450
 although in my opinion knives from Chris Riva 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.880
 this is completely different given 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:33.640
 lanyard but only wants such calls 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.070
 so we need a piece of paracord then 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.900
 centimeter somewhere 60 70 it is sweet 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.200
 some kind of bracelet to which apple 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.079
 u earlier well and where are we doing it today 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.270
 we make a lanyard for a woman this one 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:50.110
 million will one yes here's such 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.820
 good little legs even 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.850
 he has at building she 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.890
 stick it so that it does not open the template does not 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.860
 opened yes everything has a dark hole 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.899
 already ready cleaning 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.629
 through which we are the first action we 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:07.210
 must skip our pass pro map 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.460
 did I burn to do such here 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.920
 conscience about the source such that it was 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.960
 it is convenient to pass well so about we pass 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.899
 through 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.270
 but part of them is only on the hole of the knife and 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:22.270
 find the middle 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.549
 remember we weaved like a lanyard 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.880
 snake yes that's the way the video can 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.810
 look and there the first action is the ideal 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.670
 here here is a knot 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.310
 and so today's lanyard will stand and 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.899
 for from from a set of such nodules found 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.789
 center and the first action skip 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:43.299
 left above right above just 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:48.310
 cross over yes they've lowered and now 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:50.740
 by the same end under all that is 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.229
 it turns out like a loop 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.749
 eat above and below 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.729
 now take the right end and here 

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:59.409
 the crosshair is this water and here we are 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.680
 now cross this crosshair 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.360
 here 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:09.460
 look at this loop that is under all 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.460
 miss under everything and here in this loop and 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:20.150
 pull it up so it doesn't fall 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:24.650
 we pull up and we have this 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.670
 here is a bundle need to raise a little higher 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.010
 there is a little blow away so that when you open 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.310
 us the lanyard does not interfere with the lanyard here 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.470
 here's a little loop, this will be the 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.709
 what i lie down here went ion and gave 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.620
 open and here we are now all nishtyak 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.060
 skull mix it all was first 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.550
 action she will always be repeated 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:53.330
 that is, skip over we have 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:55.150
 crosshair second under all through 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:02.300
 crosshair loop 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:03.370
 pulled up what you do so he and 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.799
 can attack 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.799
 how to arrange in order not to interfere 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.360
 infection well, in general, we now have 2 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.920
 stars 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.200
 pull up to the first y turns out so 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.940
 and everything is basically here now and 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.980
 we repeat as many times as we do 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.810
 i must pause for now 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.739
 because we don't want to hold ours 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.870
 miracle in one position 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:34.070
 Well, let's see what happened in the end and 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.040
 so in the end we get this this 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:41.120
 lanyard i did here literally how much 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:45.410
 Well, 8 to 8 beetles turned out this 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:49.780
 countryman yes I think it will be very convenient 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.580
 that is, if it hangs on your pocket 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.020
 on the pocket need and learn such a topic 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.470
 black will be very convenient for him 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.670
 getting basically all you ready he 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.400
 so stretches by the way in all directions 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.280

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.430
