00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hi to all the girls if diaboliks 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.940
 and I'm here for my favorites of the month 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.910
 November 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.679
 so I do not have a lot of makeup to 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.080
 properly speaking in this month of November 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.820
 since I did not wear makeup 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.139
 many months of November because of a 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.690
 fracture which I stayed a lot 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.820
 at my house trying to recover this 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.490
 fracture I'm still trying 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.289
 to try to recover so I have not 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.769
 spend my time makeup to be 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.550
 honest 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.199
 so that's all so well so I 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.180
 I'm not in my quest that I'm 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.620
 more happy keys on my nails and whose 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.079
 you have a lot of things in term 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.510
 so so to start with the only ones 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.550
 makeup things you have the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.770
 March palette of bluff guy bourdin who has 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.989
 did not help it white mile one night stand 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.930
 so I used today so I 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.680
 used the bronzing powder the illuminator 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.449
 is one of the bluffs so here I was 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.180
 bronzing powder in fixtures and this 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.300
 blog here so here is maybe there 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.980
 limited edition that I also love 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.210
 that it was part of an editing kit 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.769
 limited that you saw in my role 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.750
 sephora who was part of the kit 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.780
 blue with little lip pencils 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.189
 this one so that the lip pencil the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.680
 only who in the kit and a velvet 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.820
 it's the nude color lover and it's 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.130
 the one I'm wearing today 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.250
 and I really like it's a kind of 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.619
 rose with golden iridescent brilliance 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.400
 but not too much and I like the texture 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.930
 I like sketched side 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.600
 I think about application practices and 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.850
 I love just 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.010
 so that's silently we're considering before 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.530
 to continue with the nails in his use 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.780
 that I liked a lot this month it's 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.910
 this product is so sweet as age 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.920
 express from home dior so that 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.420
 I use for the face what I like 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.740
 in this scrub compared to others 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.230
 pity I used in the past 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.730
 is actually we start when we get 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.770
 give a cream we do not say that there is 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.780
 grains in it and in fact there are plenty 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.000
 small grains actually it's 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.290
 ptp very small grain traits but these 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.800
 small grains they are very very big 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.300
 amount 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.860
 so in fact it's like I'm applying 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.900
 grains directly on my skin I 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.540
 find it well exfoliating well abrasive 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.130
 at the same time it's soft and comfortable 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.440
 and I really like this scrub all 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.810
 simply in fact 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.700
 tombola ledoux express scrub so 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.280
 so here we finish with the nails 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.550
 after there will be the application of the month 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.530
 also the small object of the month then 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.600
 favorite of this month in colors of 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.130
 varnish is this one so the jelly in 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.340
 mini because I bought it in the 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.500
 Kit iconic fort at coop cei 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.420
 this one of little kids is strong conic 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.310
 you have four colors in and 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.080
 it is the color so very well known 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.360
 who is malaga wine who is the color 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.000
 that I have a lot to wear this month than 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.380
 I wear today of course and that 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.900
 I love it I love the color I love it 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.910
 I like the fluid of the product 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.500
 so here I think maybe me 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.640
 buy it bigger because there we 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.459
 little it does not hold me very long 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.900
 but in any case I am very 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.350
 satisfied and that was my color this 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.269
 November then also in point of 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.180
 nail view that I loved this month 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.950
 it's the so- called dry drops from okaÃ¯di 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.519
 these are the drops that are going to 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.519
 allow to dry the varnish there is 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.290
 more in fact I have them completely 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.700
 there is no more teaching at all, so I tell him 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.920
 say the inl is actually after each 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.600
 layer of polish I told myself dai for 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.190
 really speed up those sages of varnish 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.209
 before moving on to another layer but 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.890
 it's anyway I left a 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.310
 little bit dried varnish it really 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.110
 helped stabilize the polish to him at the 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.340
 freeze to allow others to pass 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.860
 layers of varnish which I really 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.000
 loved it on july 10th of shangai and i 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.280
 want to receive a soon because 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.389
 so I recommended it also favorite 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.120
 of this month could find enough 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.599
 so strong has to salit m 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.569
 it is the rail stage which is a top coat 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.890
 with ccsa fast play so this allows 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.900
 to dry your polish that hear 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.879
 as quickly while also 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.650
 ability to dry the top coat 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.569
 itself dries quickly so it is 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.040
 very well so that I use in addition to 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.819
 ten pride from nokia and which I put 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.349
 my little drops 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.909
 I was wearing my day top coat 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.810
 little drops really to allow 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:02.819
 to have a top and above all 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.019
 to really have the most drying 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.090
 fast possible because wait for 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.650
 a varnish is really boring and honey 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.790
 wind at the level of the protection side what 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.200
 his comrades as host I found 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.609
 that's great when I saw them I issued 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.870
 on everything but varnished lately that 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.400
 I put on my chanel taboo that 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.199
 I had loved last month shot 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.489
 knowing malaga wine i love holding that 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.079
 it gives and shine and she is 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.479
 really very intense they last very 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.630
 a long time so I love so favorite 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.220
 object of this month before moving to the 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.979
 map in holiday application this month in 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.020
 does that normally I wear it a 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.940
 slow game vix ready for life him in 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.789
 do that with a little hoodie 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.130
 and small duration and actually it's okay 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:39.539
 down to the sleeves that a 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.400
 pants and in fact that's what we 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:43.229
 call a year less than 10 so this is a 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.630
 pajamas one piece in quotation marks if 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.940
 you prefer in fact I live in that 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.169
 I lived in it all the month of May I 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.910
 continue with they live in his tooth 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.169
 any month in downhill because I think 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.770
 actually saw that I'm at home only in 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.780
 my fracture 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.099
 I do not want to dress I have not 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.479
 want to get out mesh when I travel 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.620
 and allowed to catch cold without having to 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.330
 lay layers of things 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.830
 no what I know is that I live in 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.479
 my computer so I'm in underwear 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.960
 often said but seen without textures 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.370
 polar is really great and I'm 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.539
 really at the shopi a little hood that 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.169
 is super cute with small 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:15.000
 ears is this a great tool that is 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.979
 super cute I love I have 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.599
 bought on the site of the town to the point 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:23.760
 as so b2o h2o dot com which is a 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:26.160
 fashion site just like the day before 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.349
 either in fact that of an English site and he 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.539
 there are a lot of bronze i still animal and 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:31.949
 this one I cracked on it and I'm 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.289
 so much of course I'm so 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.150
 hot it's so comfortable 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.130
 honestly stretchy in front of you are 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.590
 quiet and you 're warm without 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.110
 to be necessarily super ugly in your 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.060
 holding you are comfortable and that's 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.909
 really what I've been looking for in this 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.130
 object for my so that I can 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:52.409
 recover properly while being at 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.479
 hot because right now we can get 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:56.760
 to say it does not make it 50 degrees either 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:59.039
 out so here and now in 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.969
 last in this month's favorite app 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:05.669
 here the mythical but in two this time 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:07.620
 ci the plan versus versus zombies two names 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.090
 who is at stake I would like to be 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.889
 would not bother strategy but if that's 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.409
 a little bit that makes it the principle is that 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:15.389
 you must plant plants in 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:16.889
 your garden to prevent zombies 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:19.200
 to invade your home in fact the 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:21.270
 plants are the barrier between your home 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.830
 your house and the zombies 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.150
 so in fact the goal is to place 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.400
 plants at very ready places 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.320
 precise to be able that these plants 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.370
 attacked zombies so the tunes the 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.750
 zombies arrive are worth so that's 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.000
 really this strategy game of 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:36.300
 placement that find in a lot of 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.789
 things and then I love this game what 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:42.630
 really it's a system of levels 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:43.889
 unlike the old versus 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.840
 zombies that was not quite 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:48.180
 like that without a level system a little 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:52.669
 like all games you want to 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:55.110
 tell you about application so that's it 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:57.090
 prunes long enough favorite applications 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.229
 this month so this is the set of 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.580
 favorites mas sales so 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:01.139
 I hope all this video will have you 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.860
 as always do not forget about you 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:03.860
 subscribe lease
