in on anything I don't think that border
is<00:01:55.680> safe<00:01:55.890> on<00:01:56.009> shield<00:01:56.310> at<00:01:56.490> all<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.790> oh<00:01:57.229> I

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
is safe on shield at all is it oh I

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.040 
is safe on shield at all is it oh I
think<00:01:58.470> so<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.820> think<00:02:00.300> cuz<00:02:00.570> she<00:02:00.720> can<00:02:00.840> float

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
think so I I think cuz she can float

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.450 
think so I I think cuz she can float
back<00:02:01.229> while<00:02:01.500> she<00:02:01.649> does<00:02:01.800> it<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.369> like

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
back while she does it it's like

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.070 
back while she does it it's like
retreating<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:03.240> she's<00:02:03.450> falling<00:02:03.780> into<00:02:03.990> you

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
retreating if she's falling into you

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.719 
retreating if she's falling into you
that's<00:02:04.259> one<00:02:04.440> thing<00:02:04.619> but<00:02:04.860> that's<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.460> don't

would<00:02:40.380> change<00:02:40.500> anything<00:02:40.709> yeah<00:02:41.070> but<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.280> guess<00:02:41.400> I

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
would change anything yeah but I guess I

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.190 
would change anything yeah but I guess I
did<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.820> lot<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.000> stupid<00:02:42.239> that's<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.720> same<00:02:42.959> um

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
did a lot of stupid that's the same um

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.990 
did a lot of stupid that's the same um
maybe<00:02:43.590> it's<00:02:43.799> just<00:02:43.890> if<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.250> smash<00:02:44.519> throne<00:02:44.790> so

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
maybe it's just if you smash throne so

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.160 
maybe it's just if you smash throne so
if<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.180> do<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.299> hard<00:02:45.540> throw<00:02:45.780> I'm<00:02:45.989> not<00:02:46.110> sure

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
if you do the hard throw I'm not sure

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.449 
if you do the hard throw I'm not sure
but<00:02:46.320> I<00:02:46.500> know<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.739> it<00:02:46.950> kills<00:02:47.100> in<00:02:47.220> one<00:02:47.250> hit

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
but I know that it kills in one hit

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.160 
but I know that it kills in one hit
because<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:47.730> definitely<00:02:47.970> be<00:02:48.299> lot<00:02:48.720> in<00:02:48.870> asset
