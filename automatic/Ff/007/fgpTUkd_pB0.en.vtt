00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.689
 cool viewer recently wandering around 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.270
 I was looking for an Internet about what you can 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.369
 tell and found you count 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.720
 you have no idea how cool it is 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:34.460
 yet we have such a review for the women to him what 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:37.640
 it will be your way dmc and right now the Volga and 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.850
 once again hello dude chuvikha no matter 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.970
 which of us doesn't like superheroes them 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.979
 colorful costumes and forces forced many 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.379
 kids write boiling water at one time 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:52.580
 report I still pray for posters 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.890
 spiderman is not something that now 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.199
 children quite at the end of the past 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.129
 of the month started the sale of another game 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.949
 about superhero 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:04.600
 super heroes boot and pro superhero 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.600
 mutants who pennile long neck 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.740
 why super hero him head if 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.440
 add prefix anti I'll think about 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.240
 this deadpool is so harsh that hired 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.270
 to develop your own game 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.060
 zadokhlikov from high lunar studio cho 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.290
 what cho say high moon studios on him 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.300
 spent and so what came out igrulya 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.280
 is it really crazy? 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.250
 chestnut hear rocÃ© mixing shooter and 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.500
 overly charismatic characters 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.540
 or grohl chill you monotonous count 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.610
 which is not why the planet was released but also 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.760
 the price for the game in the incentive is complete 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.760
 in order 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:10.100
 this is an important part in the game isn't it 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.260
 absolutely current gamers do not need a plot 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.890
 and you only need time to press on them 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:21.320
 keep ahead and we probably 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:23.480
 not cut out when all the mad tie in 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.750
 that the deadpool wanted his own game 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.880
 and therefore politely asked a friend 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.060
 developers from high moon studios and 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:36.530
 gash everything would not have appeared yet 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:40.850
 damn hockey script suspected words 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.970
 everywhere crap can read a few words 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.580
 okay scene 1 dark rainy night 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.340
 deadpool but not like media magnate than for 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:55.459
 light which baba and blah blah 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:57.620
 It is fucking and it's fucking WHO 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.380
 a lot of plot plot pretty 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.060
 just well that is typical comic skaya 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.760
 it comes down to what you need to install 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.739
 the main villain getting through the crowd 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.930
 raging and shooting meat 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.480
 it seems like helping in this case deadpool 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.940
 there will be x- men what a surprise 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.180
 which is spelled out here rather for jackdaws 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.590
 something like this well except for only 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.540
 cable led cable 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.220
 lord but also the names that 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:34.730
 will periodically be involved big 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:37.620
 Hack and because it was already accurate and 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.810
 viewer you should know something else in 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.010
 the game there is a shop but a sort 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.400
 pumping method 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.319
 can you tell me about it 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.440
 the store will tell you more in detail 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.890
 deadpool who am i to talk about 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.569
 his store he will kill me oh by the way to 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.760
 the plot this store has no 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.530
 relationship is what I included that certificate about 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.810
 pumping weapons in the review subgroup 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.810
 the plot is not as not affected 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:23.039
 really gameplay is pretty 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:24.960
 a big problem in this game, and in fact 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:28.880
 it comes down to what you need to chop 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.880
 fuse shoot shoot 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.440
 to some psycho maniac is 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.320
 could have come to taste but even him 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.599
 it will quickly get tired more than that gopnik from 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.599
 each populated popping especially under 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:47.610
 end of the game under and so much that the pattern 2 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:49.680
 just does not stand at all who 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.900
 then you should take a sedative 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.260
 what is the time for us to wrap up and broadcast 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.660
 last words personal and think game 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.820
 left very bad for her ass 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.450
 humor and complete lack of moral 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.789
 foundations 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:08.430
 moreover there oh i haven't finished 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:10.530
 that I now was such an intelligentsia as 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.270
 always insight me me now 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.039
 more care who it will clean well 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.469
 ok no matter we seem deviated from 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.860
 Turn on the light 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:22.909
 black is shorter in my subjective 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.770
 Needless to say, the game came out in the middle 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:27.479
 funny situation fun joke 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.310
 the charisma of the protagonist is very clear 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.949
 registered in the game however if 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.199
 ponder something really game 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.719
 monotonous gameplay it is fast 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.610
 bothers what i do more all the same 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:40.830
 would recommend this game to a fan of it 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.830
 character well or those who stayed in 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.680
 the development of 10 years as I therefore play 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.319
 it is worth going at least for deadpool or he 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:53.310
 I come home to you and but watching the children and 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:06:01.020
 the exact okay total character comic 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:06:04.460
 situation mayhem before the gameplay oh well 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:07.289
 ok well agree monotonous and and boring 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.719
 so still no more than yes 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:12.150
 Grafon did not disappoint as his own 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:14.939
 musical arrangement that before the plot 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.430
 Well, I think it's not worth it. 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:20.399
 to mention him for deadpool know it yourself 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:25.370
 that it is better for him to remain a couple of forts about 

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:25.370
 which you did not tell yes what I 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:34.289
 guys is another story and 

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:37.800
 by the way we have run out of air 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:40.139
 time to go to make tea while my 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.270
 casual youtube viewer if at all 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:45.990
 has anyone seen me now or 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:48.150
 heard and not important go if you liked 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.970
 it obligatory to thumbs up 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:54.720
 I who might like a shit 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:56.730
 subscribe to the channel of the church means to 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.680
 really and if you don't suddenly 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:03.390
 I liked all the questions to 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:05.670
 intellectuals and by the way I forgot yet 

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:08.070
 something to mention control in the game 

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:10.850
 complete shit so play better on 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.850
 gamepad and 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:17.920
 dad paul i know you are somewhere near and i am 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:21.100

 what did you do there just a little 

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:26.920
 surprise for our player that is unimportant but 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.750
 you have to move every person in the account 

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:32.890
 if we want to conquer 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:37.750
 and you, too, it comes to my game floor 

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:43.450
 the game is seriously easier to become an ass 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:46.650
 puppy go to battle now said 

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.650
