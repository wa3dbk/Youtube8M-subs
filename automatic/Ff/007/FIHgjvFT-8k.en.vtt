00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
it'll probably tear the box apart if we

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.690 
it'll probably tear the box apart if we
would<00:01:59.420> pull<00:01:59.720> it<00:01:59.810> all<00:01:59.959> the<00:01:59.989> way<00:02:00.140> but<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:01.039> remove

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.520 

that's<00:02:21.790> how<00:02:22.000> i<00:02:22.030> clicked<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:22.930> you're<00:02:23.170> hearing

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
that's how i clicked that you're hearing

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.850 
that's how i clicked that you're hearing
there<00:02:23.740> is<00:02:24.040> just<00:02:25.170> representation<00:02:26.170> how<00:02:26.410> strong

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
there is just representation how strong

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.260 
there is just representation how strong
the<00:02:27.070> metal<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.930> magnetic<00:02:29.590> attraction<00:02:29.830> is<00:02:30.310> to

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
the metal the magnetic attraction is to

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.920 
the metal the magnetic attraction is to
this<00:02:31.920> metal<00:02:32.920> adapter<00:02:33.490> to<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:34.620> magnetic<00:02:35.620> disk

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
this metal adapter to the magnetic disk

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.280 
this metal adapter to the magnetic disk
so<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:38.500> can<00:02:38.680> use<00:02:38.830> this<00:02:39.070> with<00:02:39.400> hands-free
