Lil<00:00:21.840> red<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:23.250> stuff<00:00:23.730> they<00:00:23.849> put<00:00:23.880> in

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
Lil red is the stuff they put in

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.970 
Lil red is the stuff they put in
swimming<00:00:24.300> pools<00:00:24.419> and<00:00:24.809> what<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.590> does<00:00:25.649> is

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
swimming pools and what this does is

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.859 
swimming pools and what this does is
going<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.189> measure<00:00:26.399> how<00:00:26.880> much<00:00:27.059> hydrogen<00:00:27.540> there

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
going to measure how much hydrogen there

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.589 
going to measure how much hydrogen there
is<00:00:28.079> or<00:00:28.590> how<00:00:28.770> much<00:00:28.950> oxygen<00:00:29.130> there<00:00:29.700> is<00:00:29.849> by<00:00:30.540> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
is or how much oxygen there is by the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.840 
is or how much oxygen there is by the
way<00:00:30.750> my<00:00:30.930> lovely<00:00:31.259> wife<00:00:31.619> Gayle<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.040> thank<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.669> I

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
way my lovely wife Gayle in thank you I

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.570 
way my lovely wife Gayle in thank you I
ground<00:00:33.180> for<00:00:33.300> Gail<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> night<00:00:33.780> here<00:00:33.960> yeah

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.970 

now<00:00:38.580> when<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.030> find<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.750> lot<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.140> hydrogen<00:00:40.530> acid

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
now when you find a lot of hydrogen acid

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.920 
now when you find a lot of hydrogen acid
in<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.220> liquid<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.790> going<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.240> be<00:00:42.360> bright

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
in this liquid is going to be bright

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.600 
in this liquid is going to be bright
orange<00:00:43.350> or<00:00:43.470> bright<00:00:43.680> yellow<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.070> means<00:00:44.130> lots

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
orange or bright yellow that means lots

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.580 
orange or bright yellow that means lots
of<00:00:44.760> hydrogen<00:00:45.090> lots<00:00:45.240> of<00:00:45.360> acid<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.440> got

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
of hydrogen lots of acid if it's got

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.960 
of hydrogen lots of acid if it's got
oxygen<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.340> it's<00:00:47.490> going<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> be<00:00:47.790> in<00:00:47.880> the

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
oxygen in it it's going to be in the

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.300 
oxygen in it it's going to be in the
purple<00:00:48.300> range<00:00:48.480> okay<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.250> be

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.310 
purple range okay so this is going to be

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.760 
purple range okay so this is going to be
looking<00:00:50.490> for<00:00:50.850> hydrogen<00:00:51.270> or<00:00:51.329> oxygen<00:00:51.450> so<00:00:52.290> she's

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
looking for hydrogen or oxygen so she's

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.590 
looking for hydrogen or oxygen so she's
going<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.980> stir<00:00:53.190> these<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.790> I'm<00:00:54.360> going<00:00:54.540> to

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
going to stir these up and I'm going to

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.080 
going to stir these up and I'm going to
put<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.989> few<00:00:55.410> drops<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:56.130> each<00:00:56.310> one<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.579> these<00:00:56.790> and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
put a few drops in each one of these and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.180 
put a few drops in each one of these and
try<00:00:57.810> to<00:00:57.900> do<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> same<00:00:58.500> number<00:00:58.770> drops<00:00:59.070> in

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
try to do like the same number drops in

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.830 
try to do like the same number drops in
each<00:00:59.250> one<00:00:59.460> here<00:00:59.610> so<00:00:59.730> we<00:00:59.790> can<00:00:59.880> got<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> same<00:01:00.360> and

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
each one here so we can got the same and

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.620 
each one here so we can got the same and
you'll<00:01:01.770> see<00:01:01.950> what<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.250> doing<00:01:02.399> here<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.450> this

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
you'll see what it's doing here is this

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.509 
you'll see what it's doing here is this
looking<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.170> hydrogen<00:01:04.649> or<00:01:04.829> looking<00:01:05.339> for

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
looking for hydrogen or looking for

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.200 
looking for hydrogen or looking for
oxygen<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:07.100> you'll<00:01:08.100> see<00:01:08.310> since<00:01:08.880> we<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.120> came

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
oxygen and you'll see since we just came

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.800 
oxygen and you'll see since we just came
out<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.390> Easter<00:01:09.720> Egg<00:01:09.870> season<00:01:10.229> here<00:01:11.540> we<00:01:12.540> get<00:01:12.690> all

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
out of Easter Egg season here we get all

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.120 
out of Easter Egg season here we get all
different<00:01:13.170> kinds<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.409> colors<00:01:13.620> which<00:01:13.830> means<00:01:14.040> we

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
different kinds of colors which means we

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.380 
different kinds of colors which means we
got<00:01:14.250> all<00:01:14.400> different<00:01:14.520> kinds<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.940> hydrogen

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
got all different kinds of hydrogen

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.500 
got all different kinds of hydrogen
amounts<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.900> our<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.200> our<00:01:16.740> liquid<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:18.000> starting

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
amounts in our in our liquid so starting

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.780 
amounts in our in our liquid so starting
off<00:01:18.659> with<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> ones<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.470> they<00:01:20.250> advertise

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
off with the ones that they advertise

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.250 
off with the ones that they advertise
the<00:01:20.970> most<00:01:21.210> we're<00:01:21.659> going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.810> start<00:01:21.990> off<00:01:22.110> with

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
the most we're going to start off with

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.190 
the most we're going to start off with
soda<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.370> is<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.610> same<00:01:23.820> as<00:01:24.000> Pepsi<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.630> it

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
soda and this is the same as Pepsi if it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.960 
soda and this is the same as Pepsi if it
says<00:01:25.380> diet<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:25.979> way<00:01:26.280> worse<00:01:26.549> than<00:01:26.580> just

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
says diet it's way worse than just

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.940 
says diet it's way worse than just
regular<00:01:27.120> soda<00:01:27.479> how<00:01:28.200> can<00:01:28.380> something<00:01:28.590> be<00:01:28.710> way

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
regular soda how can something be way

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.250 
regular soda how can something be way
worse<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.580> you<00:01:30.150> can<00:01:30.299> see<00:01:30.360> there's

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
worse but it is you can see there's

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.050 
worse but it is you can see there's
nothing<00:01:31.680> redeeming<00:01:31.950> about<00:01:32.100> them<00:01:32.549> it's<00:01:32.850> got<00:01:33.030> a

nothing redeeming about them it's got a

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.210 
nothing redeeming about them it's got a

think<00:02:48.610> well<00:02:48.700> that's<00:02:48.790> pretty<00:02:49.000> neutral<00:02:49.330> but

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
think well that's pretty neutral but

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.210 
think well that's pretty neutral but
there's<00:02:50.290> two<00:02:50.470> types<00:02:50.680> of<00:02:50.830> minerals<00:02:50.980> in<00:02:51.160> the

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
there's two types of minerals in the

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.740 
there's two types of minerals in the
world<00:02:51.400> there's<00:02:51.580> organic<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:52.180> inorganic<00:02:52.240> your

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
world there's organic and inorganic your

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.750 
world there's organic and inorganic your
body<00:02:52.990> can<00:02:53.170> only<00:02:53.260> absorb<00:02:53.590> organic<00:02:54.100> which<00:02:54.580> is<00:02:54.730> a

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
body can only absorb organic which is a

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.750 
body can only absorb organic which is a
plant-based<00:02:55.150> mineral<00:02:55.750> they<00:02:56.440> go<00:02:56.680> by<00:02:56.920> all<00:02:57.490> the

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
plant-based mineral they go by all the

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.070 
plant-based mineral they go by all the
inorganic<00:02:58.090> minerals<00:02:58.510> which<00:02:58.750> means<00:02:58.930> you<00:02:58.989> can

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
inorganic minerals which means you can

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.390 
inorganic minerals which means you can
get<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.200> dump<00:02:59.500> truck<00:02:59.560> load<00:02:59.950> full<00:03:00.160> of<00:03:00.250> minerals

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
get a dump truck load full of minerals

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.520 
get a dump truck load full of minerals
which<00:03:00.700> are<00:03:00.820> which<00:03:01.209> are<00:03:01.360> inorganic<00:03:01.600> your<00:03:02.320> body

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
which are which are inorganic your body

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.630 
which are which are inorganic your body
can<00:03:02.739> absorb<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:03.130> but<00:03:03.250> it's<00:03:03.340> like<00:03:03.430> taking

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
can absorb it but it's like taking

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.180 
can absorb it but it's like taking
baking<00:03:04.180> soda<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.630> adding<00:03:05.350> it<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.709> acid

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
baking soda and adding it to the acid

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.220 
baking soda and adding it to the acid
it'll<00:03:06.670> change<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.060> pH<00:03:07.239> so<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:07.930> looks<00:03:08.170> more

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
it'll change the pH so it looks more

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.680 
it'll change the pH so it looks more
neutral<00:03:08.890> but<00:03:09.340> it's<00:03:09.489> no<00:03:09.640> more<00:03:09.820> beneficial<00:03:10.570> as

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
neutral but it's no more beneficial as

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.540 
neutral but it's no more beneficial as
you<00:03:10.810> notice<00:03:11.110> it<00:03:11.500> still<00:03:11.769> had<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:11.980> real<00:03:12.310> high

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
you notice it still had a real high

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.420 
you notice it still had a real high
positive<00:03:13.209> orp<00:03:13.870> like<00:03:14.019> in<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.230> 450<00:03:14.680> range<00:03:14.860> now

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
positive orp like in the 450 range now

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.740
