00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.690 
the fusion works is that you can combine
a<00:01:38.509> demon<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.229> a<00:01:39.319> creature<00:01:39.590> together<00:01:39.920> for

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
a demon and a creature together for

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.669 
a demon and a creature together for
example<00:01:40.789> I<00:01:41.299> took<00:01:41.359> the<00:01:41.749> Lord<00:01:41.990> himself<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.499> main

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
example I took the Lord himself the main

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.649 
example I took the Lord himself the main
character<00:01:43.100> of<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.340> game<00:01:43.490> and<00:01:43.759> I<00:01:44.119> took<00:01:44.420> a

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
character of the game and I took a

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.899 
character of the game and I took a
creature<00:01:45.229> cat<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:46.159> I<00:01:46.219> combined<00:01:46.639> those<00:01:46.850> two

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
creature cat and I combined those two

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.120 
creature cat and I combined those two
together<00:01:47.359> in<00:01:47.539> a<00:01:47.630> fusion<00:01:47.929> and<00:01:48.350> I<00:01:48.560> created<00:01:48.920> what

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
together in a fusion and I created what

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.279 
together in a fusion and I created what
happens<00:01:49.429> to<00:01:49.609> be<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:50.060> cat<00:01:50.569> gun<00:01:50.899> which<00:01:51.170> was

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
happens to be a cat gun which was

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.440 
happens to be a cat gun which was
relatively<00:01:51.829> useful<00:01:52.219> and<00:01:52.639> the<00:01:52.939> way<00:01:53.090> this<00:01:53.240> whole

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
relatively useful and the way this whole

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.660 
relatively useful and the way this whole
system<00:01:53.960> works<00:01:54.170> is<00:01:54.409> that<00:01:54.619> you<00:01:54.679> have<00:01:55.100> to<00:01:55.249> train

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
system works is that you have to train

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.609 
system works is that you have to train
the<00:01:55.880> creatures<00:01:56.359> when<00:01:56.899> you<00:01:57.049> fuse<00:01:57.380> them

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
the creatures when you fuse them

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.050 
the creatures when you fuse them
together<00:01:57.799> because<00:01:58.310> as<00:01:58.520> long<00:01:58.759> as<00:01:58.819> the

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
together because as long as the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.550 
together because as long as the
creatures<00:01:59.359> are<00:01:59.509> powerful<00:01:59.990> enough<00:02:00.049> you're

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
creatures are powerful enough you're

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.139 
creatures are powerful enough you're
going<00:02:00.709> to<00:02:00.770> have<00:02:00.979> a<00:02:01.009> much<00:02:01.520> more<00:02:01.700> stronger

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
going to have a much more stronger

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.059 
going to have a much more stronger
attacks<00:02:02.420> another<00:02:03.139> thing<00:02:03.380> you<00:02:03.530> can<00:02:03.679> do<00:02:03.829> is

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
attacks another thing you can do is

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:05.469 
attacks another thing you can do is
combine<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:04.520> prunie<00:02:04.909> with<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:05.240> pruning

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
combine a prunie with the pruning

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.539 
combine a prunie with the pruning
together<00:02:05.899> and<00:02:06.109> you<00:02:06.170> make<00:02:06.319> a<00:02:06.350> giant<00:02:06.829> one<00:02:06.979> now

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
together and you make a giant one now

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.279 
together and you make a giant one now
there<00:02:07.729> is<00:02:07.909> a<00:02:07.939> catch<00:02:08.360> though<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:08.840> only<00:02:09.020> have

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
there is a catch though you only have

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.140 
there is a catch though you only have
six<00:02:09.709> turns<00:02:10.009> that<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.369> could<00:02:10.520> use<00:02:10.729> your<00:02:10.880> fusion

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
six turns that you could use your fusion

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.360 
six turns that you could use your fusion
until<00:02:11.870> they<00:02:11.990> diffuse<00:02:12.590> and<00:02:12.800> then<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:13.160> have<00:02:13.280> to

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
until they diffuse and then you have to

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.950 
until they diffuse and then you have to
wait<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.700> certain<00:02:13.940> amount<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.210> turns<00:02:14.450> ends

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
wait to a certain amount of turns ends

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.600 
wait to a certain amount of turns ends
and<00:02:15.140> then<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.620> could<00:02:15.770> fuse<00:02:16.040> them<00:02:16.220> once

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
and then you could fuse them once

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.160 
and then you could fuse them once
but<00:02:17.000> that's<00:02:17.150> one<00:02:17.330> of<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.510> new<00:02:17.660> mechanics

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
but that's one of the new mechanics

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.780 
but that's one of the new mechanics
they've<00:02:18.530> also<00:02:18.770> brought<00:02:19.070> back<00:02:19.310> some<00:02:19.550> stuff

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
they've also brought back some stuff

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.610 
they've also brought back some stuff
such<00:02:20.060> as<00:02:20.090> upcoming<00:02:20.660> characters<00:02:21.080> characters

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
such as upcoming characters characters

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.190 
such as upcoming characters characters
from<00:02:21.710> past<00:02:22.010> games<00:02:22.310> into<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:22.970> one<00:02:23.210> which<00:02:24.050> is<00:02:24.080> a

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
from past games into this one which is a

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.740 
from past games into this one which is a
really<00:02:24.500> cool<00:02:24.590> addition<00:02:24.950> altogether<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:25.940> of

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
really cool addition altogether and of

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.450 
really cool addition altogether and of
course<00:02:26.990> one<00:02:27.320> of<00:02:27.350> my<00:02:27.470> personal<00:02:27.950> favorites<00:02:28.340> is

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
course one of my personal favorites is

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.430 
course one of my personal favorites is
when<00:02:29.150> you're<00:02:29.300> attacking<00:02:29.750> in<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:29.930> game<00:02:30.230> you

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
when you're attacking in the game you

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.780 
when you're attacking in the game you
can<00:02:30.650> take<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:30.920> few<00:02:31.250> of<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.400> characters

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
can take a few of the characters

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.000 
can take a few of the characters
together<00:02:31.970> put<00:02:32.870> them<00:02:32.990> into<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.290> certain<00:02:33.710> pattern

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
together put them into a certain pattern

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.130 
together put them into a certain pattern
and<00:02:34.400> they<00:02:34.520> can<00:02:34.730> do<00:02:34.880> up<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.330> triple<00:02:35.960> attack

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
and they can do up to a triple attack

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.440 
and they can do up to a triple attack
which<00:02:36.770> is<00:02:36.920> really<00:02:37.220> cool<00:02:37.490> so<00:02:38.000> when<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.300> see

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
which is really cool so when you see

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.180 
which is really cool so when you see
these<00:02:38.600> little<00:02:38.810> mechanics<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.710> you<00:02:39.860> have<00:02:40.010> like

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
these little mechanics and you have like

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.160 
these little mechanics and you have like
basically<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:40.790> little<00:02:40.970> cutscene<00:02:41.450> of<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:41.750> special

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
basically a little cutscene of a special

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.840 
basically a little cutscene of a special
attack<00:02:42.410> going<00:02:42.620> on<00:02:42.890> that's<00:02:43.340> probably<00:02:43.640> one<00:02:43.820> of

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
attack going on that's probably one of

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.580 
attack going on that's probably one of
my<00:02:44.000> favorite<00:02:44.450> moments<00:02:44.810> of<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.020> game<00:02:45.200> you<00:02:45.410> do

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
my favorite moments of the game you do

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.380 
my favorite moments of the game you do
have<00:02:45.830> that<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.280> one<00:02:46.760> of<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:46.880> things<00:02:47.030> I<00:02:47.180> did

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
have that and one of the things I did

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.090 
have that and one of the things I did
notice<00:02:47.600> in<00:02:47.780> this<00:02:47.959> is<00:02:48.140> they<00:02:48.260> tweak<00:02:48.800> the

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
notice in this is they tweak the

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.100 
notice in this is they tweak the
counter-attack<00:02:49.610> in<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.090> game<00:02:50.270> a<00:02:50.450> quite<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.840> lot

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
counter-attack in the game a quite a lot

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.199 
counter-attack in the game a quite a lot
in<00:02:51.230> this<00:02:51.380> title<00:02:51.650> but<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.280> mean<00:02:52.520> is<00:02:52.820> like<00:02:52.850> when

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
in this title but I mean is like when

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.880 
in this title but I mean is like when
you<00:02:53.330> attack<00:02:53.540> an<00:02:53.690> enemy<00:02:53.810> they<00:02:54.410> have<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:54.620> chance

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
you attack an enemy they have a chance

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.130 
you attack an enemy they have a chance
to<00:02:54.980> counter-attack<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.880> or<00:02:56.120> vice<00:02:56.390> versa<00:02:56.450> and

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
to counter-attack you or vice versa and

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.930 
to counter-attack you or vice versa and
this<00:02:57.590> one<00:02:57.800> there's<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.100> lot<00:02:58.160> of<00:02:58.550> counter

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
this one there's a lot of counter

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.610 
this one there's a lot of counter
attacking<00:02:59.180> going<00:02:59.630> on<00:02:59.780> for<00:02:59.959> example<00:03:00.050> there<00:03:00.530> was

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
attacking going on for example there was

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.080 
attacking going on for example there was
a<00:03:00.650> portion<00:03:00.950> in<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.220> game<00:03:01.370> at<00:03:01.550> least<00:03:01.700> a<00:03:01.820> couple

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
a portion in the game at least a couple

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.030 
a portion in the game at least a couple
times<00:03:02.239> in<00:03:02.570> my<00:03:02.660> playthrough<00:03:03.140> where<00:03:03.620> we<00:03:03.830> pretty

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
times in my playthrough where we pretty

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.250 
times in my playthrough where we pretty
much<00:03:04.160> counter-attack<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.270> total<00:03:05.690> of<00:03:05.900> nine

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
much counter-attack a total of nine

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.310 
much counter-attack a total of nine
times<00:03:06.709> I<00:03:07.100> attacked<00:03:07.820> he<00:03:08.270> attacked<00:03:08.630> I<00:03:08.840> attack

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
times I attacked he attacked I attack

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.640 
times I attacked he attacked I attack
etc<00:03:09.620> etc<00:03:10.209> until<00:03:11.209> one<00:03:11.420> of<00:03:11.450> us<00:03:11.690> was<00:03:11.989> dead<00:03:12.230> at<00:03:12.470> that

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
etc etc until one of us was dead at that

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.930 
etc etc until one of us was dead at that
you<00:03:12.920> know<00:03:13.040> at<00:03:13.160> first<00:03:13.190> you<00:03:13.550> kind<00:03:13.760> of<00:03:13.850> got

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
you know at first you kind of got

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.880 
you know at first you kind of got
annoying<00:03:14.209> but<00:03:14.450> then<00:03:14.660> again<00:03:14.810> it's<00:03:15.470> really

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
annoying but then again it's really

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.740 
annoying but then again it's really
useful<00:03:16.250> during<00:03:16.430> combat<00:03:16.850> mechanics<00:03:17.000> so<00:03:17.540> it's

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
useful during combat mechanics so it's

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.060 
useful during combat mechanics so it's
you<00:03:18.080> know<00:03:18.200> some<00:03:18.440> of<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.590> things<00:03:18.800> that<00:03:18.890> you

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
you know some of the things that you

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.410 
you know some of the things that you
might<00:03:19.250> want<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.489> watch<00:03:19.640> out<00:03:19.820> for<00:03:19.880> in<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.239> game

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
might want to watch out for in the game

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.390 
might want to watch out for in the game
but<00:03:20.930> other<00:03:21.080> than<00:03:21.230> that<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.650> combat<00:03:22.010> is<00:03:22.100> really

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
but other than that the combat is really

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.550 
but other than that the combat is really
smooth<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:22.880> plays<00:03:23.120> well<00:03:23.390> as<00:03:23.690> for<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.380> sound

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
smooth it plays well as for the sound

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.320 
smooth it plays well as for the sound
overall<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.220> sound<00:03:25.459> was<00:03:25.670> really<00:03:25.970> good<00:03:26.120> for

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
overall the sound was really good for

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.509 
overall the sound was really good for
this<00:03:26.450> title<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.989> soundtrack<00:03:27.560> was<00:03:27.799> fantastic

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
this title the soundtrack was fantastic

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.430 
this title the soundtrack was fantastic
solicitude<00:03:29.150> just<00:03:29.420> like<00:03:29.570> all<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.870> past<00:03:30.110> games

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
and I was relatively surprised of how

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.509 
and I was relatively surprised of how
well<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:32.989> English<00:03:33.380> voice<00:03:33.620> actors<00:03:34.100> were<00:03:34.250> for

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
well the English voice actors were for

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.580 
well the English voice actors were for

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.590 
this title I mean especially the person
who's<00:03:36.739> playing<00:03:36.920> as<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.519> Lord<00:03:37.760> himself<00:03:38.330> he

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
who's playing as the Lord himself he

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.720 
who's playing as the Lord himself he
just<00:03:38.810> brought<00:03:39.049> just<00:03:39.440> all<00:03:39.680> kinds<00:03:40.160> he<00:03:40.310> really

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
just brought just all kinds he really

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.670 
just brought just all kinds he really
felt<00:03:41.000> like<00:03:41.060> he<00:03:41.330> was<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.690> Lord<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.200> he<00:03:42.380> really

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
felt like he was the Lord and he really

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.710 
felt like he was the Lord and he really
fit<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:43.070> character<00:03:43.459> perfectly<00:03:44.090> for<00:03:44.630> the

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
fit the character perfectly for the

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.780 
fit the character perfectly for the
humor<00:03:45.080> that<00:03:45.230> happened<00:03:45.650> in<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.980> game<00:03:46.010> but<00:03:46.640> just

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
humor that happened in the game but just

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.400

all<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.180> characters<00:03:47.570> altogether<00:03:48.140> I<00:03:48.260> think

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
all the characters altogether I think

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.690 
all the characters altogether I think
they<00:03:48.739> did<00:03:48.890> an<00:03:48.980> extremely<00:03:49.310> good<00:03:49.640> job

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
they did an extremely good job

the characters were relatively polished

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.470 
the characters were relatively polished
and<00:03:59.600> just<00:04:00.170> fit<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.530> tone<00:04:00.709> really<00:04:01.250> well<00:04:01.459> as<00:04:01.670> for

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
and just fit the tone really well as for

over<00:04:15.079> and<00:04:15.350> over<00:04:15.650> again<00:04:15.739> however<00:04:16.519> if<00:04:16.790> you're

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
over and over again however if you're

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.460 
over and over again however if you're
the<00:04:17.030> type<00:04:17.209> of<00:04:17.239> person<00:04:17.390> who's<00:04:17.840> not<00:04:18.019> really<00:04:18.140> that

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
the type of person who's not really that

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.289 
the type of person who's not really that
big<00:04:18.650> in<00:04:18.799> RPGs<00:04:19.519> and<00:04:19.700> this<00:04:19.820> is<00:04:19.970> something<00:04:20.239> that's

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
big in RPGs and this is something that's

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.819 
big in RPGs and this is something that's
probably<00:04:20.630> not<00:04:20.810> going<00:04:21.019> to<00:04:21.109> hold<00:04:21.229> you<00:04:21.440> off<00:04:21.590> or

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
probably not going to hold you off or

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.890 
probably not going to hold you off or
probably<00:04:22.580> only<00:04:22.820> going<00:04:23.120> to<00:04:23.210> play<00:04:23.360> once<00:04:23.660> and<00:04:23.840> you

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
probably only going to play once and you

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.870 
probably only going to play once and you
might<00:04:24.080> want<00:04:24.260> to<00:04:24.320> wait<00:04:24.440> for<00:04:24.650> a<00:04:24.680> price<00:04:24.950> drop<00:04:25.160> but

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
might want to wait for a price drop but

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.240 
might want to wait for a price drop but
like<00:04:26.240> I<00:04:26.360> said<00:04:26.570> if<00:04:26.780> you're<00:04:26.930> big<00:04:27.169> RPG<00:04:27.680> fan<00:04:27.919> then

like I said if you're big RPG fan then

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.380 
like I said if you're big RPG fan then

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
this is definitely going to hold you

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.070 
this is definitely going to hold you
over

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
over
