 as I know you give a lot 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.250
 as in china in december 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.280
 and software and I see that it works and 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.580
 it helps people 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.580
 it's not bad 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.640
 that's what you're asking for your agreement to 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.050
 routine control of the deal to wrong i 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:53.320

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:57.910
 ok low language and we earn less 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.850
 French next I accept and then 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.380
 there he will ask you for a key 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.930
 activation was going to open the 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.530
 text point file that is in the 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.660

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:19.800
 men at prices from there on control of 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:23.950
 next following next on the wall wii 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:27.340
 installed and see hunger install 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.870
 so I did a little accelerated on 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.180
 the installation that will take 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.920
 a few minutes I think so we get 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.920
 found after be 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.290
 so here we are 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.110
 installing the class software 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.850
 very important he is better a little 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.580
 Registry Editor Message 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.820
 so it's super important such support on 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:59.210
 wii is ok here so do not forget this 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.100
 we will not walk visit the site 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.970
 web of prob ricochet railways go 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.910
 put on their website 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.330
 and finished hop and normally you have 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.870
 2 cinema 4d on your desktop two icons 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.610
 so it's very simple actually have it there 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.690
 why zico just mine 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.530

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.470
 the 32 8 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.750

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.540

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.460
 so we'll make the second one be up 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.330

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.540
 the four-year schedule 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.210
 and here it is in some of its green island and 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.910

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.510

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:44.630
