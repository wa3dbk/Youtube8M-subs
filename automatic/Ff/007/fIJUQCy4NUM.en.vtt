00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 and welcome to the cooking show 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.589
 Love today, I'll show you somebody like that 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.120
 heinz vegetables like a black root at 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.120
 cooking knows reserves 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.470
 So what does he need of course 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.660
 of course this is a black root 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.460
 very sensitive what the cooking is concerned because 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.130
 if you cook them then they will get it 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.450
 slightly yellowish so you get them 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.160
 not so nice as you know that 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.020
 like to wish or as always 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.879
 it is suggested in some pictures 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.489
 but I'll show you how to do that on the 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:01:07.420
 can best make at home so the 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:01:16.119
 high will first look that this 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:17.050
 chances can stain me all recum 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.940
 I think you can already see one now 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.470
 difference 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.050
 the cooked ones are now in the bowl 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.390
 cent plus the fresh black root is 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.050
 in difference it knows it so 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.490
 slightly brownish that's just because 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.619
 if i am now this scissor here this 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.060
 short one does not see yet but so 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.890
 if I lie for a minute two now 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.470
 Let's go on to say on like 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.700
 Dandelion will know that and he is 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.560
 actually responsible for that 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.260
 this black root comes to an end 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.960
 of course, turn brown again and there 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:53.640
 There's a little trick I 'm glad that 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.640
 here are open at 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.320
 So our water and the little dick 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.869
 the sign now bears the problem 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.780
 acid war minerals pharmacy and the 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.200
 keeps the white vegetables so white too 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.909
 lie 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.269
 I'll say right away we're there 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.190
 go and say we'll see each other 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:16.720
 You see, it's cooking right now 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:20.730
 and before that really takes off 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.730
 still aboard vegetables 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.650
 we'll do that in there 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.090
 Normally, this would be 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.200
 black- root during the buying process 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.280
 lightly tan the way it does 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.230
 has seen 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.480
 but that does not happen we do 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.550
 now ascorbic acid to that is nothing 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.209
 other than vitamin c that's what you get 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.000
 lemon is mainly found in one 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.770
 lemon kiwi but you could now too 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.450
 take lemon juice but there are still 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.510
 not such a nice effect as long 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.030
 ascorbic acid 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.049
 So another tip on ascorbic acid like 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.799
 you should of course for children 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.799
 keep away 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.969
 so that now a half spoon in it 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:13.709
 you do not see that, but he does not 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:15.790
 Looks like these stay much more beautiful 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.799
 price 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.420
 like these I believe in the better 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.319
 differed to come do not look 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.989
 if I am now 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.519
 I take out one now and put 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.060
 that aside, I think you know what I mean 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.830
 my 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.540
 brown and white i believe 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.849
 the proof has already been provided 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.219
 Let's cook them as they soften 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.810
 are and he could be the black root 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.760
 really for a very nice 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.489
 Take winter vegetables for example if 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.379
 Mix it with jokes and carrots 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.590
 and that's easy with cherry 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.939
 I tell you this is one 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.510
 taste experience you did so even 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:52.299
 not eaten 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.370
 So I live that would say that was it 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.590
 next to you saw vegetables white 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.420
 it's not art when you do that 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.799
 right material or the right one 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.689
 I will have food to go with it 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.090
 probably link to it if I have 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.620
 a fix where to refer ascorbic acid 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.090
 I think I can do that 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.450
 Amazon but I'm not 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.579
 for sure 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.040
 if I find I link that you 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.299
 you can look there for the times could 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.579
 Try it if you are interested 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.709
 could now each vegetable what I 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.359
 really so easily repainted for that 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.310
 also take cauliflower 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.580
 there is a flower parade if you have them 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.470
 who cooked according to the professors 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.110
 and black or so yellowish that can 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.699
 to prevent everything with this acid 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.520
 that it really looks snowy white 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:37.120
 so if nobody cares vegetables 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.460
 So again a horse with money goes to 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.919
 for example with turmeric the case, I think 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.120
 now up there or there or there I have to 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.550
 let's see where it fits best 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.990
 a link leads directly to the next video 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.870
 and there you can look like you 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.240
 vegetable colors so i hope i will 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.030
 could show you something again 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.030
 this sense until the next video 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.030
 streams
