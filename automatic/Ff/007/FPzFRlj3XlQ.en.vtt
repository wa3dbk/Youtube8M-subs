the diamond camouflage in advanced

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.600 
the diamond camouflage in advanced
warfare<00:00:09.960> so<00:00:10.559> there's<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.830> bunch<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.160> kind<00:00:11.519> of

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
warfare so there's a bunch of kind of

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.490 
warfare so there's a bunch of kind of
tedious<00:00:12.030> challenges<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:12.900> you<00:00:13.019> need<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.320> do

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
tedious challenges that you need to do

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.169 
tedious challenges that you need to do
in<00:00:13.710> advanced<00:00:13.980> warfare<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.549> get<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.790> camo

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
in advanced warfare to get the camo

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.269 
in advanced warfare to get the camo
meanwhile<00:00:15.839> improve<00:00:16.260> these<00:00:16.410> colonies<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:16.890> can

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
meanwhile improve these colonies you can

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.800 
meanwhile improve these colonies you can
kind<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.580> just<00:00:17.789> play<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.150> game<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.359> little<00:00:18.600> bit

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
kind of just play the game a little bit

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.240

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
more and eventually you get all the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.400 
more and eventually you get all the
camels<00:00:20.699> but<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.449> game<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.840> do<00:00:22.050> need<00:00:22.260> to

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
camels but in this game you do need to

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.230 
camels but in this game you do need to
go<00:00:22.560> quite<00:00:23.130> out<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.369> your<00:00:23.670> way<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:23.850> I'm<00:00:24.090> gonna

teach you guys the easiest way to
accomplish<00:00:26.849> each<00:00:27.300> challenge<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.140> get<00:00:28.349> the

diamond<00:00:28.920> camo<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.609> first<00:00:29.820> one<00:00:30.090> for

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
diamond camo so the first one for

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.569 
diamond camo so the first one for
assault<00:00:30.840> rifle<00:00:31.199> specifically<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.309> AV

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
assault rifle specifically is the AV

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.910 
assault rifle specifically is the AV
longshot<00:00:33.420> medals<00:00:33.840> it's<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.260> my<00:00:34.440> opinion<00:00:34.620> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
longshot medals it's in my opinion the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.340 
longshot medals it's in my opinion the
most<00:00:35.190> difficult<00:00:35.790> but<00:00:36.360> with<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:36.809> trick<00:00:37.140> it

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
most difficult but with this trick it

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.220 
most difficult but with this trick it
should<00:00:37.590> be<00:00:37.770> relatively<00:00:38.190> easy<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.910> normally<00:00:39.840> to

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
should be relatively easy so normally to

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.600 
should be relatively easy so normally to
get<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.410> longshot<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.040> know<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.219> need<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.430> be

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
get a longshot you know you need to be

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.400 
get a longshot you know you need to be
pretty<00:00:41.940> far<00:00:42.149> distance<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.050> gonna<00:00:43.140> take

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
pretty far distance and it's gonna take

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.619 
pretty far distance and it's gonna take
quite<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.710> few<00:00:43.800> bullets<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.460> kill<00:00:44.489> but<00:00:45.300> if<00:00:45.329> you

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
quite a few bullets to kill but if you

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.510 
quite a few bullets to kill but if you
go<00:00:45.809> into<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.079> hardcore<00:00:46.379> match<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:47.039> only<00:00:47.190> takes

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
go into a hardcore match it only takes

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.240 
go into a hardcore match it only takes
one<00:00:47.850> or<00:00:48.149> two<00:00:48.539> bullets<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.350> kill<00:00:49.379> with<00:00:50.100> an

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
one or two bullets to kill with an

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.340 
one or two bullets to kill with an
assault<00:00:50.520> rifle<00:00:50.610> from<00:00:51.000> from<00:00:51.570> any<00:00:51.780> range<00:00:52.110> and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
assault rifle from from any range and

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.170 
assault rifle from from any range and
for<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.219> reason<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.670> like<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.910> use<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
for this reason I like to use the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.029 
for this reason I like to use the
thermal<00:00:54.420> sight<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.469> find<00:00:55.710> kind<00:00:55.980> of

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
thermal sight and I like to find kind of

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.459 
thermal sight and I like to find kind of
a<00:00:56.100> long<00:00:56.430> line<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.760> sight<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.449> map<00:00:58.079> maybe

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
a long line of sight in the map maybe

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.349 
a long line of sight in the map maybe
from<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.890> corner<00:00:59.250> maybe<00:00:59.430> not<00:00:59.699> but<00:00:59.910> just<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.120> long

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
from a corner maybe not but just a long

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.330 
from a corner maybe not but just a long
line<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.600> sight<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.559> look<00:01:01.739> down<00:01:02.010> and

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
line of sight that you can look down and

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.210 
line of sight that you can look down and
get<00:01:02.579> those<00:01:02.760> long<00:01:03.090> shot<00:01:03.600> medals<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:05.100> is

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
get those long shot medals so this is

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.820 
get those long shot medals so this is
relatively<00:01:05.670> easy<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.420> hardcore<00:01:07.200> modes<00:01:07.530> it

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
relatively easy in hardcore modes it

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.500 
relatively easy in hardcore modes it
took<00:01:08.010> me<00:01:08.159> about<00:01:08.400> four<00:01:08.909> games<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.450> think

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
took me about four games I think

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.480 
took me about four games I think
compared<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> softcore<00:01:10.950> modes<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.310> would<00:01:11.400> have

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
compared to softcore modes it would have

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.429 
compared to softcore modes it would have
taken<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.000> much<00:01:12.060> longer<00:01:12.420> because<00:01:12.689> by<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.320> time

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
taken so much longer because by the time

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.289 
taken so much longer because by the time
you<00:01:13.770> shoot<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.130> enemy<00:01:14.490> from<00:01:14.790> far<00:01:15.060> away

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
you shoot the enemy from far away

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.050 
you shoot the enemy from far away
they're<00:01:15.780> already<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.530> know<00:01:16.650> be<00:01:17.070> alerted<00:01:17.580> that

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
they're already you know be alerted that

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.580 
they're already you know be alerted that
you<00:01:18.299> hit<00:01:18.479> them<00:01:18.659> once<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.110> they'll<00:01:19.200> be<00:01:19.320> able<00:01:19.409> to

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
you hit them once and they'll be able to

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.890 
you hit them once and they'll be able to
escape<00:01:19.890> before<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.820> other<00:01:21.030> bullets<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.689> get

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
escape before your other bullets can get

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.660 
escape before your other bullets can get
to<00:01:22.049> them<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> next<00:01:22.860> challenge<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.400> 80

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
to them so the next challenge is 80

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.660 
to them so the next challenge is 80
headshots<00:01:24.479> now<00:01:24.780> my<00:01:25.680> method<00:01:26.130> for<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.369> may<00:01:26.610> be

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
headshots now my method for this may be

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.690 
headshots now my method for this may be
a<00:01:26.790> little<00:01:27.000> bit<00:01:27.240> counterintuitive<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.500> may<00:01:28.619> be

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
a little bit counterintuitive you may be

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.679 
a little bit counterintuitive you may be
thinking<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.150> want<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.390> go<00:01:30.540> in

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
thinking that you just want to go in

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.719 
thinking that you just want to go in
there<00:01:30.840> Rambo<00:01:31.259> style<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.770> city<00:01:32.159> hello<00:01:32.490> to

into<00:03:09.350> objective<00:03:09.860> game<00:03:10.040> modes<00:03:10.100> and<00:03:10.520> just<00:03:10.910> go

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
into objective game modes and just go

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.600 
into objective game modes and just go
bananas<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:11.900> next<00:03:12.350> two<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:12.800> the<00:03:12.920> final<00:03:13.430> two

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
bananas the next two and the final two

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.660 
bananas the next two and the final two
also<00:03:14.420> go<00:03:14.750> hand-in-hand<00:03:15.260> these<00:03:16.190> are<00:03:16.370> in<00:03:16.550> my

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
also go hand-in-hand these are in my

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.550 
also go hand-in-hand these are in my
opinion<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.180> most<00:03:17.390> tedious<00:03:18.080> and

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
opinion the most tedious and

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.860 
opinion the most tedious and
time-consuming<00:03:19.030> however<00:03:20.030> not<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.420> most

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
time-consuming however not the most

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.510 
time-consuming however not the most
difficult<00:03:21.410> they're<00:03:21.530> not<00:03:21.650> very<00:03:21.830> difficult<00:03:22.070> so

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
difficult they're not very difficult so

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.080 
difficult they're not very difficult so
it's<00:03:23.140> 150<00:03:24.140> kills<00:03:24.410> with<00:03:24.890> no<00:03:25.130> perks<00:03:25.490> for<00:03:25.970> the

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
it's 150 kills with no perks for the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.390 
it's 150 kills with no perks for the
carbon<00:03:26.570> camo<00:03:26.990> and<00:03:27.200> 200<00:03:27.740> kills<00:03:27.980> with<00:03:28.190> no

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
carbon camo and 200 kills with no

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.780 
carbon camo and 200 kills with no
attachments<00:03:29.030> for<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:30.050> gold<00:03:30.650> camo<00:03:31.310> challenge

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
attachments for the gold camo challenge

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.970 
attachments for the gold camo challenge
so<00:03:31.970> in<00:03:32.570> my<00:03:32.840> opinion<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.350> best<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:33.890> most

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
so in my opinion the best and most

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.160 
so in my opinion the best and most
efficient<00:03:34.550> way<00:03:34.580> is<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.150> do<00:03:35.390> these<00:03:35.510> at<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:35.840> same

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
efficient way is to do these at the same

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.530 
efficient way is to do these at the same
time<00:03:36.650> now<00:03:36.920> it's<00:03:37.070> maybe<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.400> little<00:03:37.670> bit<00:03:37.940> more

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
time now it's maybe a little bit more

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.000 
time now it's maybe a little bit more
frustrating<00:03:39.320> than<00:03:39.470> if<00:03:39.590> you<00:03:39.680> did<00:03:39.860> it

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
frustrating than if you did it

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.890 
frustrating than if you did it
separately<00:03:40.730> but<00:03:41.180> it's<00:03:41.330> definitely<00:03:41.540> gonna

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
separately but it's definitely gonna

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.600 
separately but it's definitely gonna
save<00:03:42.170> you<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:42.320> lot<00:03:42.530> of<00:03:42.590> time<00:03:42.920> in<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.220> long<00:03:43.400> run

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
save you a lot of time in the long run

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.640 
save you a lot of time in the long run
so<00:03:43.820> I<00:03:43.850> suggest<00:03:44.450> you<00:03:44.630> do<00:03:45.020> those<00:03:45.170> together<00:03:45.380> you

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
so I suggest you do those together you

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.920 
so I suggest you do those together you
know<00:03:45.860> maybe<00:03:46.040> slap<00:03:46.370> on<00:03:46.550> a<00:03:46.610> few<00:03:46.910> extra<00:03:47.150> kill

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
know maybe slap on a few extra kill

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.360 
know maybe slap on a few extra kill
streaks<00:03:48.260> just<00:03:48.620> because<00:03:48.830> you'll<00:03:49.010> have<00:03:49.130> some

streaks just because you'll have some

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.820 
streaks just because you'll have some
