00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
is really awesome because even hound

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.560 
is really awesome because even hound
hours<00:02:53.680> really<00:02:53.980> powerful<00:02:54.490> and<00:02:54.700> as<00:02:54.970> if<00:02:55.240> he's<00:02:55.390> not

I<00:03:26.740> was<00:03:26.890> I<00:03:27.100> thought<00:03:27.430> I<00:03:27.790> think<00:03:28.750> that<00:03:28.959> I<00:03:28.990> thought

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
I was I thought I think that I thought

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.710 
I was I thought I think that I thought
it<00:03:29.530> was<00:03:29.680> going<00:03:29.830> to<00:03:29.890> have<00:03:30.040> a<00:03:30.070> focus<00:03:30.550> sash<00:03:30.760> so

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
it was going to have a focus sash so

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.630 
it was going to have a focus sash so
that's<00:03:32.110> why<00:03:32.320> I<00:03:32.350> went<00:03:32.709> front<00:03:33.040> of<00:03:33.160> with<00:03:33.370> both

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
that's why I went front of with both

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.280 
that's why I went front of with both
because<00:03:34.060> I<00:03:34.090> knew<00:03:34.330> that<00:03:34.360> he<00:03:34.630> could<00:03:34.810> be<00:03:34.959> trouble

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
because I knew that he could be trouble

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.470 
because I knew that he could be trouble
you<00:03:36.130> know<00:03:36.250> because<00:03:36.550> they're<00:03:36.820> they're<00:03:37.240> usually

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
you know because they're they're usually

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.230 
you know because they're they're usually
either<00:03:37.870> just<00:03:38.350> attackers<00:03:38.920> or<00:03:39.130> screen<00:03:39.670> throw

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
either just attackers or screen throw

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.040 
either just attackers or screen throw
uppers<00:03:40.630> so<00:03:41.730> either<00:03:42.730> one<00:03:43.330> of<00:03:43.360> those<00:03:43.570> would<00:03:43.900> be

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
uppers so either one of those would be

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.230 
uppers so either one of those would be
bad<00:03:44.320> although<00:03:44.680> you<00:03:44.920> know<00:03:45.190> since<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.180> am

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
bad although you know since I am

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
kind of nullifies most of his attacking

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.479 
kind of nullifies most of his attacking
potential<00:03:52.240> so<00:03:53.110> then<00:03:53.530> he<00:03:53.680> just<00:03:53.860> throws<00:03:53.950> up<00:03:54.280> over

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
potential so then he just throws up over

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.960 
potential so then he just throws up over
other<00:03:54.700> he<00:03:55.480> throws<00:03:55.840> up<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:56.230> reflect<00:03:57.130> I<00:03:57.400> knock<00:03:57.760> him

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
other he throws up a reflect I knock him

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.850 
other he throws up a reflect I knock him
out<00:03:58.090> with<00:03:58.300> the<00:03:58.840> combined<00:03:59.200> efforts<00:03:59.320> of<00:03:59.620> Cujo

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
karpana um and then at this point you

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.960 
karpana um and then at this point you
know<00:04:26.500> just<00:04:26.860> all<00:04:27.070> right<00:04:27.190> let's<00:04:27.370> just<00:04:27.610> do<00:04:27.790> this

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
know just all right let's just do this

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
with sushi you know because it's one

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.000 
with sushi you know because it's one
hundred<00:04:36.880> percent<00:04:37.060> physical<00:04:37.660> so<00:04:38.200> it<00:04:38.560> doesn't

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
hundred percent physical so it doesn't

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.570 
hundred percent physical so it doesn't
do<00:04:39.310> like<00:04:39.550> anything<00:04:40.060> at<00:04:40.180> all<00:04:40.300> to<00:04:40.800> Agron<00:04:41.800> but

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
that is through through a reflect and

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.350 
that is through through a reflect and
massive<00:04:45.220> physical<00:04:45.520> defense<00:04:45.820> so<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.030> can't

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
massive physical defense so I can't

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.060 
massive physical defense so I can't
