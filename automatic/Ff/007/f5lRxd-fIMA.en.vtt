 vehicle is simply the most 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.579
 big game lived like any time 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.079
 you can find on gta 5 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:38.610
 you can see that there was a couple 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.440
 have found several so after you 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.250
 can honestly have fun with those 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.140

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.649
 little juice what you want huh 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.020

 frankly there is less to do not hurt 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.250
 of things what then to find this 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.159
 vehicle had to show directly on 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.020
 the map where it is located they are located 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.790
 right here from options 10 or here is the city 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.890
 will the highway and you get here 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.670
 on your right there will be a construction site 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.840
 and you'll see lots of new ones 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.840

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.579
 see right away the difference between 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.579
 this truck and the other bayonne 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.400
 the only downside of this truck is going on its 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.230
 his acceleration he is so heavy 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:58.490
 that he does not advance but hey we can not 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.970
 have all broken carding he goes to 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:08.190
 above all but 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:10.640
 as he wants the crashes all the little 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.640
 rector 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.390

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:23.090
 parry to my truck look at this we can 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.090
