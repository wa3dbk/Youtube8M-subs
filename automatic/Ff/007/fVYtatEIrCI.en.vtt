 Victor Baptist 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.810
 he knew 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.560
 in particular 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.550
 Belt not always and 2nd mariana is very simple both 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.100
 about 3% 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.899
 they are saying the true 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:31.130
 and if chips 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.730
 in the colors 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.730
 let's see how he plays 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.750

 isis bookmark in chorus says 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.330
 for starting to play the first thing I did 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.930
 remaining amount 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.330
 in fact the votes and 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.250
 verlander in the center 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.650
 an exterior hexagon 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.940
 another former student 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.940
 around 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.600
 I must start playing by placing the pieces that I know if you 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.850
 alternatively 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.850
 in corners 3 to 1 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.420
 the human relationship are very simple in their turn every player beating two 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.840
 Actions 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.060
 the first 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.900
 move one of your feet 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.070
 for example 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.740
 these could move 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.800
 the commission is that you want to move 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.920
 everything you see 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.290
 the address and by the time the board arrives on board 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.600
 open with three other piece desire yours against 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.060
 can catch you interest freely 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.610
 I am available for example we can see here we can see here 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.640
 that's why I'm here p 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.310
 and by the way is that greece 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.039
 always stopping some piece 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.359
 percent alarcÃ³n 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:13.649
 and then 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.649
 d change a flag position 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:20.539
 the flag must be able to move freely, it must not be held back 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.309
 others 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.509
 when moving, move it should be left 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:26.189
 at least 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.909
 will join two other flags is not worth leaving the flag 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.319
 opposition is well defined 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.939
 it is placed like this among others 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.809
 any 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:41.219
 similar position is worth for example it was speculated that haiti

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.569
 I must in a way 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:10.649
