00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:12.230
 very good videos on xbox must play 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:15.830
 dock etc etc and a curious fact how 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:19.490
 control external devices like 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.030
 TV or television receiver is 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.690
 cable or satellite 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:29.020
 then we go fast so that it does not take 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:34.260
 in uploading the video first we have a few 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.260
 little friends in xbox and the group 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.380
 I miss the group here the little friends 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.700
 playing the folk titan 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:46.280
 and we want to go to the TV because 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:51.420
 is about to start the final and 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.910
 we all know it's worth then 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:59.000
 we want to have the TV the first thing that 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.000
 we have to do is go to the guide worth 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.170
 we put in configuration we can 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:08.200
 do it here or with the start button that 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:12.320
 it would be the three stripes of a lifetime 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.670
 we go to screen and sound 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:20.030
 and here we go to the sound mixer 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.310
 we will have a bar that will decant us to 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.770
 where we want to hear more or 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.440
 less and above tells us the volume of 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.450
 the two applications is the same in the 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.170
 application to purchased is lower than 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.880
 volume 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.880
 so I always leave you here 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.190
 unless you want to listen to the TV 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.470
 while I play with the sound under white 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.090
 of the changes thing that I recommend here 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.810
 to microsoft that this sound mixer 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.210
 be much more accessible 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.730
 that is from the guide itself it would be 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.250
 perfect 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.250
 from the button is right here 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.950
 as always things to improve worth 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.890
 we are watching the TV channel worth 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.430
 but we want to see it while we play 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.950
 then this is not plan 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:14.040
 the plan is to see it coupled 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.989
 so what we do 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.989
 xbox dock tele 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:27.110
 ready to change channels simply 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:32.390
 we have to give the button twice 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:35.460
 guide is worth or say xbox change and you're 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.980
 xbox change 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.980
 you see xbox change 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.650
 to see little girl I will not touch the moral 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.640
 good 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.310
 Well, that's all a health and a health 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.750
 fast 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.750
 goodbye say goodbye
