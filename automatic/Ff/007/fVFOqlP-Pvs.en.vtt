about this though is the packaging it is

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.100 
about this though is the packaging it is
a<00:01:44.070> screw<00:01:44.790> top<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:47.030> it's<00:01:48.030> hard<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.600> control<00:01:48.840> the

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
the arm of the brush and Cipel it in and

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.460 
the arm of the brush and Cipel it in and
then<00:02:15.459> blend<00:02:15.879> it<00:02:15.970> out<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.840> find<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.230> works

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
then blend it out and I find that works

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.960 
then blend it out and I find that works
better<00:02:17.739> and<00:02:18.160> I'm<00:02:18.640> not<00:02:19.209> wasting<00:02:19.390> product<00:02:20.970> the

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
better and I'm not wasting product the

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.960 
better and I'm not wasting product the
consistency<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:22.870> this<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:23.769> that<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.670> not

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
consistency of this is that it is not

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.949 
consistency of this is that it is not
too<00:02:25.980> it's<00:02:26.980> not<00:02:27.250> too<00:02:27.610> thick<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.300> it's<00:02:28.480> not<00:02:28.720> too

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
too it's not too thick and it's not too

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.449 
too it's not too thick and it's not too
watery<00:02:29.349> I<00:02:30.239> just<00:02:31.239> put<00:02:31.420> that<00:02:31.450> little<00:02:31.780> bit<00:02:32.459> it's

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
watery I just put that little bit it's

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.120 
watery I just put that little bit it's
not<00:02:33.610> too<00:02:33.790> thick<00:02:34.090> it's<00:02:34.330> not<00:02:34.420> too<00:02:34.750> watery<00:02:35.140> so

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
not too thick it's not too watery so

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.800 
not too thick it's not too watery so
it's<00:02:36.489> not<00:02:36.610> gonna<00:02:36.790> make<00:02:37.239> a<00:02:37.269> big<00:02:37.390> mess

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
it's not gonna make a big mess

so<00:03:55.920> yeah<00:03:56.920> I<00:03:56.950> just<00:03:57.040> wish<00:03:57.459> it<00:03:57.519> was<00:03:57.819> and<00:03:58.030> I

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
so yeah I just wish it was and I

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.539 
so yeah I just wish it was and I
wouldn't<00:03:58.930> not<00:03:59.260> get<00:03:59.530> this<00:03:59.769> just<00:03:59.950> because<00:04:00.310> of

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
wouldn't not get this just because of

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.129 
wouldn't not get this just because of
the<00:04:00.700> packaging<00:04:01.209> because<00:04:01.420> of<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.630> screw-top

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
the packaging because of the screw-top

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.849 
the packaging because of the screw-top
but<00:04:02.799> I<00:04:03.010> do<00:04:03.579> wish<00:04:03.819> that<00:04:04.239> it<00:04:04.599> was<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:04.959> pump<00:04:05.470> because

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
but I do wish that it was a pump because

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.039 
but I do wish that it was a pump because
is<00:04:06.130> so<00:04:06.310> much<00:04:06.489> easier<00:04:06.880> to<00:04:07.180> control<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.810> amount

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
is so much easier to control the amount

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.490 
is so much easier to control the amount
that<00:04:08.170> comes<00:04:08.470> out<00:04:08.709> and<00:04:09.069> all<00:04:09.280> of<00:04:09.310> that<00:04:09.489> but

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
that comes out and all of that but

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.559 
that comes out and all of that but
whatever<00:04:11.500> I<00:04:11.590> can<00:04:11.980> live<00:04:12.160> with<00:04:12.340> it<00:04:12.549> but<00:04:13.060> yeah<00:04:13.329> I

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
whatever I can live with it but yeah I

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.960 
whatever I can live with it but yeah I
do<00:04:13.660> like<00:04:14.109> this<00:04:14.349> so<00:04:14.739> it<00:04:14.980> does<00:04:15.190> get<00:04:15.400> a<00:04:15.430> thumbs<00:04:15.760> up

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
do like this so it does get a thumbs up

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.000 
do like this so it does get a thumbs up
for<00:04:16.180> me<00:04:17.910> it<00:04:18.910> does<00:04:19.750> say<00:04:19.989> also<00:04:20.260> that<00:04:20.650> is<00:04:20.769> all-day

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
for me it does say also that is all-day

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.690 
for me it does say also that is all-day

wear

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.510 
wear
I<00:04:21.729> find<00:04:22.330> that<00:04:22.450> it<00:04:22.599> does

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
I find that it does

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.629 
I find that it does

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
lasts all day for me but I'm not sure if

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.760 
lasts all day for me but I'm not sure if
it's<00:04:27.819> because<00:04:27.970> I'm<00:04:28.300> using<00:04:28.539> it<00:04:28.750> with<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.530> magic

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
it's because I'm using it with the magic

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.339 
it's because I'm using it with the magic
perfecting<00:04:30.490> base<00:04:30.699> or<00:04:31.060> you<00:04:31.870> know<00:04:31.960> they<00:04:32.139> just

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
perfecting base or you know they just

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:35.430 
perfecting base or you know they just
the<00:04:32.680> claims<00:04:32.979> itself<00:04:33.460> so<00:04:34.050> you<00:04:35.050> know<00:04:35.139> I<00:04:35.169> don't

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
the claims itself so you know I don't

the claims itself so you know I don't
know<00:04:35.560> but<00:04:35.949> using<00:04:36.729> them<00:04:36.849> together<00:04:37.030> as<00:04:37.509> working

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
know but using them together as working

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.170 
know but using them together as working
very<00:04:38.199> well<00:04:38.319> for<00:04:38.710> me<00:04:38.830> so<00:04:38.860> I<00:04:39.039> do<00:04:39.190> like<00:04:39.639> that<00:04:39.879> if

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
very well for me so I do like that if

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.149 
very well for me so I do like that if
you<00:04:40.389> are<00:04:40.629> a<00:04:40.659> little<00:04:41.259> lighter<00:04:41.470> than<00:04:41.590> me<00:04:41.919> or

maybe even a little darker than me the

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.279 
maybe even a little darker than me the
shape<00:04:44.500> will<00:04:44.740> probably<00:04:45.340> work<00:04:45.550> for<00:04:45.819> you<00:04:46.289> there

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289
