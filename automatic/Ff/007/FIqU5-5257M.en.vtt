00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.860 
turf of wispy type appearance certainly
much<00:01:44.520> different<00:01:45.030> than<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.300> lawns<00:01:45.479> we'll<00:01:45.690> see

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
much different than the lawns we'll see

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
even tall fescue this is a good choice

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890

three-way<00:02:10.289> mix<00:02:10.670> you<00:02:11.670> can<00:02:11.790> see<00:02:12.030> why<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.270> is

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
three-way mix you can see why this is

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.960 
three-way mix you can see why this is
successful<00:02:13.140> is<00:02:13.590> because<00:02:13.950> we<00:02:14.100> have<00:02:14.280> areas<00:02:14.940> that

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
successful is because we have areas that

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.620 
successful is because we have areas that
are<00:02:15.150> Sun

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
are Sun

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.960 
are Sun
and<00:02:16.170> then<00:02:16.470> we<00:02:16.590> have<00:02:16.740> areas<00:02:17.070> that<00:02:17.250> have<00:02:17.700> some

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
and then we have areas that have some

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.480 
and then we have areas that have some
shade<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.380> Kentucky<00:02:19.800> bluegrass<00:02:20.010> and

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
shade so the Kentucky bluegrass and

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.400 
shade so the Kentucky bluegrass and
perennial<00:02:20.790> ryegrass<00:02:21.540> will<00:02:21.870> be<00:02:21.930> very<00:02:22.140> well<00:02:22.290> in

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
perennial ryegrass will be very well in

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.290 
perennial ryegrass will be very well in
the<00:02:22.470> sunny<00:02:22.710> areas<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.430> hopefully<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.090> fine

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
the sunny areas and hopefully the fine

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.180 
the sunny areas and hopefully the fine
fescue<00:02:24.810> will<00:02:24.990> kind<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.290> take<00:02:25.500> over<00:02:25.800> those<00:02:25.890> more

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
fescue will kind of take over those more

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.760

shade<00:02:26.430> prone<00:02:26.760> areas<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.300> succeed<00:02:27.720> there<00:02:28.050> so

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
shade prone areas and succeed there so

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.560 
shade prone areas and succeed there so

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
been looking at today one thing you're

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.390 
been looking at today one thing you're
gonna<00:02:57.960> notice<00:02:58.110> with<00:02:58.380> tall<00:02:58.560> fescue<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.070> it<00:02:59.250> does

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
gonna notice with tall fescue is it does

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.250 
gonna notice with tall fescue is it does
have<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.610> wider<00:02:59.880> leaf<00:03:00.210> blade<00:03:00.510> especially<00:03:01.200> if

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
have a wider leaf blade especially if

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.240 
have a wider leaf blade especially if
you<00:03:01.350> remember<00:03:01.680> back<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:01.890> when<00:03:02.100> we<00:03:02.130> were

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
you remember back to when we were

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.740 
you remember back to when we were
looking<00:03:02.370> at<00:03:02.550> that<00:03:02.670> fine<00:03:02.970> fescue<00:03:03.420> long<00:03:03.630> it

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
looking at that fine fescue long it

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.900 
looking at that fine fescue long it
looked<00:03:03.900> very<00:03:03.960> wispy<00:03:04.590> well<00:03:05.130> tall<00:03:05.370> fescue<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:05.880> a

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
looked very wispy well tall fescue is a

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.430 
looked very wispy well tall fescue is a
little<00:03:06.180> bit<00:03:06.300> wider<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:06.870> is<00:03:07.020> a<00:03:07.050> slightly

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
little bit wider so it is a slightly

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.770 
little bit wider so it is a slightly
different<00:03:07.680> appearance<00:03:08.190> but<00:03:09.120> if<00:03:09.540> you're

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
different appearance but if you're

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.240 
different appearance but if you're
looking<00:03:10.080> for<00:03:10.230> something<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.710> you're<00:03:11.040> not

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
looking for something that you're not

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.930 
looking for something that you're not
going<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.490> water

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
going to water

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.640 
going to water
hopefully<00:03:12.690> it'll<00:03:12.780> maintain<00:03:13.200> its<00:03:13.380> green<00:03:13.620> color

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
hopefully it'll maintain its green color

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.500 
hopefully it'll maintain its green color
a<00:03:14.100> little<00:03:14.220> bit<00:03:14.370> better<00:03:14.610> throughout<00:03:15.030> those<00:03:15.210> dry
