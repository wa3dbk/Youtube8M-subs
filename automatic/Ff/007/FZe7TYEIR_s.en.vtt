00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
padding stuff we got a supposed to fit

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.620

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
looks like game key thing not sure

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.860 
looks like game key thing not sure
that's<00:05:45.050> some<00:05:45.380> USB<00:05:45.710> software<00:05:46.370> stuff

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.490 

here<00:05:49.560> is<00:05:49.740> this<00:05:50.120> friction<00:05:51.120> lid<00:05:51.330> snap<00:05:51.750> like<00:05:52.470> a

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
here is this friction lid snap like a

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.370 
here is this friction lid snap like a
normal<00:05:52.890> lid<00:05:53.100> off<00:05:53.700> friction<00:05:54.210> would<00:05:54.330> here's<00:05:55.170> the

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
normal lid off friction would here's the

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.010 
normal lid off friction would here's the
speed<00:05:55.830> feed<00:05:56.130> I'm<00:05:56.430> probably<00:05:57.030> going<00:05:57.630> to<00:05:57.720> end<00:05:57.750> up

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
speed feed I'm probably going to end up

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.860 
speed feed I'm probably going to end up
putting<00:05:58.260> the<00:05:58.380> Sun<00:05:58.970> looks<00:05:59.970> really<00:06:00.240> nice<00:06:00.360> it's

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
putting the Sun looks really nice it's

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.830 
putting the Sun looks really nice it's
really<00:06:01.020> flexible<00:06:02.090> okay<00:06:03.090> doesn't<00:06:03.450> come<00:06:03.540> out<00:06:03.600> my

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
really flexible okay doesn't come out my

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.780 
really flexible okay doesn't come out my
hope<00:06:03.990> it<00:06:04.140> done<00:06:04.320> so<00:06:05.220> i'm<00:06:05.310> probably<00:06:05.490> going<00:06:05.700> to

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
hope it done so i'm probably going to

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.850 
hope it done so i'm probably going to
put<00:06:05.910> that<00:06:06.120> on<00:06:06.300> think<00:06:07.170> those<00:06:07.320> are<00:06:07.350> magnets

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
put that on think those are magnets

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.310 
put that on think those are magnets
right<00:06:08.010> there<00:06:08.250> and<00:06:08.580> here<00:06:09.480> the<00:06:09.660> extra<00:06:10.080> nose

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
right there and here the extra nose

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:18.920 
right there and here the extra nose
cones<00:06:13.910> react<00:06:14.910> the<00:06:15.090> giant<00:06:15.870> one<00:06:17.510> and<00:06:18.510> the<00:06:18.780> little

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
cones react the giant one and the little

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.380 
cones react the giant one and the little
one<00:06:21.890> and<00:06:22.890> here's<00:06:23.220> the<00:06:23.400> loader<00:06:23.670> i<00:06:23.790> got<00:06:24.090> smoke

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.390 
one and here's the loader i got smoke

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.500 
one and here's the loader i got smoke
smoke<00:06:25.020> and<00:06:25.950> yeah<00:06:26.340> so<00:06:26.670> i<00:06:27.000> think<00:06:27.180> it<00:06:27.360> has<00:06:27.480> a

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
smoke and yeah so i think it has a

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.720 
smoke and yeah so i think it has a
magnet<00:06:28.200> it<00:06:28.410> end<00:06:28.620> right<00:06:28.830> now<00:06:29.720> yeah<00:06:31.580> and<00:06:32.580> they

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:32.730 
magnet it end right now yeah and they

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.260 
magnet it end right now yeah and they
got<00:06:32.880> this<00:06:33.500> stop<00:06:34.500> where<00:06:34.770> a<00:06:34.980> lot<00:06:35.940> of<00:06:35.970> different
