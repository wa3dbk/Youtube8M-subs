00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
is here see that little ball here at

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.540 
is here see that little ball here at
first<00:00:28.750> I<00:00:28.900> thought<00:00:29.050> that<00:00:29.200> the<00:00:29.650> backboard<00:00:30.310> was

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
first I thought that the backboard was

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.180 
first I thought that the backboard was
the<00:00:30.759> score<00:00:31.119> he's<00:00:31.660> right<00:00:32.259> there<00:00:32.500> sorry<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:32.980> net

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
the score he's right there sorry the net

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.950 
the score he's right there sorry the net
it<00:00:34.060> was<00:00:34.180> kind<00:00:34.329> of<00:00:34.360> hard<00:00:34.510> to<00:00:34.570> figure<00:00:34.750> that<00:00:34.899> out

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
it was kind of hard to figure that out

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.950 
it was kind of hard to figure that out
at<00:00:35.200> first<00:00:35.410> um<00:00:35.890> yeah<00:00:36.760> so<00:00:36.790> it<00:00:37.359> is<00:00:37.480> is<00:00:37.690> you<00:00:37.809> have

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
at first um yeah so it is is you have

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.799 
at first um yeah so it is is you have
this<00:00:38.109> cool<00:00:38.410> little<00:00:39.300> basketball<00:00:40.300> net<00:00:40.629> that

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.800 
could be fun I guess you can do some
blocks<00:01:18.040> to<00:01:18.370> someone<00:01:18.820> jumps<00:01:19.090> up<00:01:19.240> in<00:01:19.420> front<00:01:19.540> of

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
blocks to someone jumps up in front of

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.470 
blocks to someone jumps up in front of
you<00:01:20.020> and<00:01:20.350> grab<00:01:20.620> the<00:01:21.490> ball<00:01:21.640> before<00:01:21.700> you<00:01:22.180> make<00:01:22.360> it

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
you and grab the ball before you make it

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.120 
you and grab the ball before you make it
in<00:01:22.660> so<00:01:23.050> you<00:01:23.530> know<00:01:23.650> that's<00:01:24.610> a<00:01:24.790> variation<00:01:25.360> to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
in so you know that's a variation to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.610 
in so you know that's a variation to
play<00:01:27.130> with<00:01:27.340> them<00:01:27.550> this<00:01:27.670> one<00:01:27.880> I<00:01:28.350> guess<00:01:29.350> it's<00:01:29.560> a

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
play with them this one I guess it's a

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.200 
play with them this one I guess it's a
little<00:01:29.650> more<00:01:29.950> fun<00:01:30.160> than<00:01:30.310> superblock<00:01:30.910> drop

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
little more fun than superblock drop

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.940 
little more fun than superblock drop
maybe<00:01:31.930> I<00:01:32.080> don't<00:01:32.320> know<00:01:32.380> it<00:01:32.440> depends<00:01:32.710> who<00:01:32.830> you

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
maybe I don't know it depends who you

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.630 
maybe I don't know it depends who you
are<00:01:33.100> right<00:01:33.510> so<00:01:34.680> yeah<00:01:35.680> and<00:01:35.860> they<00:01:36.130> also<00:01:36.280> give<00:01:36.520> you
