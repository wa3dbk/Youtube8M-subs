00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello people in this video I show 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.740
 you as well the screen of the sinus 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.260
 the two are no questions 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.740
 come up that is a pixelated or s 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:18.810
 standard or super sharp shows 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:23.449
 first of all a few pictures with high 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.449
 resolution such as this cat 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.000
 I do not have the best camera right now 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.940
 because you can see that there is no way 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.899
 any pixels are visible 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:47.309
 that's super spicy for you and that 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:53.520
 could probably do it myself now 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:55.890
 see the colors are natural and you 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.550
 would be presented without problems or at 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:05.750
 this fire picture there you can see that too 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:09.090
 the colors are alive and also fresh 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.960
 the resolution is at the screen 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:21.509
 pretty small but the pictures are 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:24.150
 shown here in a qualitative way as you can see 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:29.460
 now that it's a little red that's lying 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:35.000
 but camera now in real sat too dark 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.920
 purple that is blue down there 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.900
 jesus normal day normal 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.860
 but the red one can do that 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.509
 camera and how not pose 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.590
 So now at the next picture you can see 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:55.259
 here that it is more beautiful alive 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.079
 the colors there in the sky this contrast 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.750
 well illustrated here 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:06.350
 I find the next photo design 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:11.210
 this man with the gun is too 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:22.330
 I think that nice pictures are not nice 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:25.459
 since you have this dark brown color the 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.050
 dark brown should be so golden brown 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.050
 This is well illustrated 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:38.410
 and now let's go to the browser 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.410
 over and look at the writing 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.040
 For example, I go to google 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.040
 looking for something 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.160
 I think the screen is too much 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.709
 help the camera that 's why there's 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.709
 For example, we give spots 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:09.760
 somehow book a or bundesliga and 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.130
 look at the text here 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:21.019
 when google try results on 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:26.350
 that ran now and you can see that 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:30.640
 here everything is beautiful black the text and 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.640
 because you do not see any single pixel 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.100
 everything is super sharp 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.840
 and runs smoothly here 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.390
 I zoomed that far so far 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:49.150
 and the phone so far in front of the camera 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:51.660
 Keep it up to see how good that is 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.030
 is shown 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:59.260
 I can maybe do some screenshots 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.640
 Immediately in the links put so high 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.680
 then load a link in the 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.800
 So you describe yourself 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.330
 can look like the resolution and the 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.450
 graphic here is on the phone 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:14.459
 yes i will call me 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.459
 happy and see you next time
