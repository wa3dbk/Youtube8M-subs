00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.520
 friends of galaxies this time 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.610
 we have for you the review of the 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.330
 samsung galaxy tab 2 of 7 inches this 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.730
 tablet is a medium performance tablet 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.669
 High already has some months left 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.169
 here in Mexico but it is still a 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.759
 very good option if you do not 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.800
 requires a team with so many 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.230
 benefits so much power if really 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.399
 they will occupy it for the 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.770
 basic applications for school 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.770
 all that is very good equipment is the 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.010
 younger brother of the galaxy tab 2 and what 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.570
 the only one that changes are his this are 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.300
 some characteristics especially its 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.999
 size this good let's start with the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.089
 part of the outside that is where we 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:57.589
 interest right now and what 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.440
 we mentioned is a 7 screen 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:03.350
 inches its resolutions of 600 pixels 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:08.320
 wide x 1024 high is not a 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:10.640
 hd screen but it is a lls pls screen 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.770
 16 million colors which we 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.479
 indicates that it has good resolution and 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.550
 well for nothing that is going to look bad at 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.410
 otherwise it looks pretty good in this 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.940
 size by the polished city of the 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.750
 present 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:26.080
 compare with a ipad mini a galaxy 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.090
 nexus is the same size a little bit more 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.170
 or less the only thing that changes then is the 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.630
 thickness of what the frame is we go to the 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.490
 part of the outside what is the hardware in 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.700
 the front we have a camera 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.440
 gea and a proximity sensor the part 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.070
 below we have nothing the buttons are 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.220
 by version software here has the 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.080
 buttons included on the screen in the 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.540
 left side only we have the 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.470
 option for micro sd is that you can 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.360
 expand up to 32 GB internal memory 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.780
 It varies depending on the model that you 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.620
 buy the fun of wifi and 3g in 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.410
 this occasion is the wifi model and 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.660
 has 8 GB of internal memory in the 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.120
 right part we have the buttons of 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.570
 volume up and down here are reached 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.990
 to see the power button to turn off do 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.480
 the tablet and block the and unlock the 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.700
 in the top part we have 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.260
 the 3.5 earphone jack 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.590
 millimeters that is the standard of all 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.720
 the devices and the microphone for 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.190
 video calls also in the part of 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.319
 below that with we have the connector the 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.690
 which is 30 pins to whistle the 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.440
 samsung very similar to apple and two 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.110
 stereo speakers as you can see in the 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.440
 back we have only the 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.060
 3.2 megapixel camera and logo 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.590
 from samsung which is the only thing we have 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.270
 in the back as you can see 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.820
 Well, you do not have anything else 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:59.540
 quickly comparing sizes with your 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.400
 Big sister the galaxy tab 2 of 10.1 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.250
 inches as you can see then yes it is 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.220
 very noticeable the difference in sizes 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.830
 here as you can see 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.470
 yes yes it is enough for those three 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.600
 inches the design can be said to be 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:18.810
 the same rounded edges with the 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:20.790
 finished here as simulating metal 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.000
 and then with the same options is 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.910
 also does not have with flash led and 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.410
 as you can see and also has 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.959
 almost the same characteristics and 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.450
 they buy the size only by comparing 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.370
 quickly it's a good option is 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.200
 practice you can have a hand in 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.670
 against this if it's a little 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.459
 heavy indeed 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.550
 but this one has good size and it 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:52.180
 can manipulate quite well in the 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.770
 part of good software sorry this for 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.510
 finish with the hardware we have a 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.830
 dual-core processor to a giga 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.210
 hertz 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:03.490
 and a giga in ram this one has performance 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.200
 normal is not so fast having this 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.320
 stock rom that has base 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.420
 actually in android land 4.1.1 and the 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.340
 inning but it's not so fast this rom 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.760
 that they put in the factory in fact is 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:20.400
 quite heavy weigh almost 700 megabytes and 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:23.680
 bring andrew 4.1.1 and as you can see 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.540
 good is to do away with the hardware and 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.450
 the software because I say it here we go 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.800
 say bring Android 4.1.1 with the the 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.920
 touch interface is that we are already 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.810
 used to see all the phones 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:40.150
 samsung the interface is of 4.0 nature 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.570
 which is the mine that premieres the galaxy s3 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.700
 and as you can see and it feels good 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.120
 I tell them it's like more for students not 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.400
 it's so high performance but with the 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.230
 custom is greatly improved 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.870
 speed of this equipment are the 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:59.020
 applications that it brings by factory 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.669
 here what we have put is the root and if 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.090
 they want to see the root to be a tablet 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.980
 so visit our next video and 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.970
 We show you how to do the tutorial and 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.930
 we are also going to show you how 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.280
 install android 4.2.2 on this and others 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.990
 models under the same team but with 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.790
 its variations 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.650
 so keep an eye on the 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.820
 channel this is the interface with which 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.740
 comes the camera because we mention it brings 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.479
 front and back and all 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.760
 samsung applications 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:31.910
 let's quickly test the camera 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:35.200
 because they see that this is not how slow 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.200
 there is a picture 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:39.359
 is another picture and did not get to rip anything 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:43.189
 but good and this is the front camera 

00:05:39.359 --> 00:05:45.959
 VGA is to fix a fish and it is not very good 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:49.379
 but it just works fast the 

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:52.529
 camera can record hd video at 720p and 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:55.309
 Well, the photos are 3.1 megapixels with 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:58.439
 the main camera has the sensor 

00:05:55.309 --> 00:06:01.079
 brightness and can be set to equal the 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:05.009
 sensitivity we have the interface is of 

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:08.519
 from samsung that the truth does not look very 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:10.199
 I prefer with the 4.2 interface 

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:12.360
 pure we have the two bars of 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:14.159
 navigation here of notifications and the 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.839
 of configuration on this side but good 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:18.419
 you already do we will show that in our 

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:21.749
 next video and well then this is a 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.099
 very general review of this team that 

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:25.049
 you asked us a lot 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:27.419
 tutorials for this since we have web 

00:06:25.049 --> 00:06:29.639
 the root tutorials of the tap of 10.1 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:31.229
 inches but his sister was missing 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:34.529
 smaller so we hope you like it in 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:36.539
 the following videos and this review very 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:38.819
 in general with what is coming is 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:41.639
 galaxy is obviously brings multitasking and 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:43.979
 and all the options of android 4.1 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:46.680
 point 1 it seems to me that the first 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:47.699
 versions came with 4.0 streams 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.340
 before but you can update 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:52.830
 directly and if you connect it to your 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:55.050
 computer to samsung cais all ways 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.509
 better but our tutorials and they 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.360
 We will show how to install 4.2 in this 

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:02.460
 equipment that we already tested and it works 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.499
 much better than with the stock roma 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.139
 so keep up 

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:10.740
 well this would be all for the moment this 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:13.090
 was the review of galaxy tab 2 of 7.7 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.460
 inches to 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.770
