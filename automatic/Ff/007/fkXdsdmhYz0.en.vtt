the<00:01:03.729> other<00:01:03.850> six<00:01:04.239> beats<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:05.530> group<00:01:05.830> them<00:01:06.010> in

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
the other six beats you group them in

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.580 
the other six beats you group them in
three<00:01:06.580> groups<00:01:06.790> of<00:01:07.060> two<00:01:07.119> so<00:01:07.990> it's<00:01:08.110> the<00:01:08.200> opposite

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
three groups of two so it's the opposite

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.530 
three groups of two so it's the opposite
but<00:01:09.280> you're<00:01:09.760> always<00:01:09.970> going<00:01:10.180> to<00:01:10.240> put<00:01:10.390> the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
but you're always going to put the

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
accent on the second beat of each group

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.450 
accent on the second beat of each group
so<00:01:13.899> the<00:01:14.020> accent<00:01:14.380> is<00:01:14.469> going<00:01:14.619> to<00:01:14.680> be<00:01:14.799> on<00:01:15.009> seven

alright so how do we play this well
let's<00:01:36.130> see<00:01:36.310> we're<00:01:36.969> going<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.179> learn<00:01:37.359> a<00:01:37.600> very

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:37.749 
let's see we're going to learn a very

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:43.020 
let's see we're going to learn a very
basic<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.570> layout<00:01:40.810> is<00:01:40.990> Kompas<00:01:41.880> first<00:01:42.880> we're

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
basic so layout is Kompas first we're

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.880 
basic so layout is Kompas first we're
going<00:01:43.119> to<00:01:43.179> do<00:01:43.329> it<00:01:43.450> super<00:01:43.810> super<00:01:44.289> basic<00:01:44.439> and

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
going to do it super super basic and

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.649 
going to do it super super basic and
then<00:01:45.460> we'll<00:01:45.820> start<00:01:46.060> throwing<00:01:46.479> some

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
then we'll start throwing some

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.569 
then we'll start throwing some
embellishments<00:01:47.530> so<00:01:47.920> for<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.159> first<00:01:48.310> three

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
embellishments so for the first three

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.789 
embellishments so for the first three
beats<00:01:48.909> of<00:01:49.719> the<00:01:49.780> complies<00:01:50.439> we're<00:01:50.619> going<00:01:50.740> to

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
beats of the complies we're going to

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.539 
beats of the complies we're going to
play<00:01:50.890> an<00:01:51.219> F

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
play an F

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.660 
play an F
with<00:01:52.759> an<00:01:52.850> added<00:01:53.150> second<00:01:53.540> their<00:01:54.579> second<00:01:55.579> three

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
with an added second their second three

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.740 
with an added second their second three
beats<00:01:55.939> so<00:01:56.869> C<00:01:57.049> major<00:01:57.229> chord<00:01:57.520> so<00:01:58.520> second<00:01:58.909> half<00:01:59.540> of

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
beats so C major chord so second half of

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.480 
beats so C major chord so second half of
the<00:01:59.840> compass'<00:02:00.200> we're<00:02:00.770> going<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:00.979> alternate

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
the compass' we're going to alternate

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.330 
the compass' we're going to alternate
between<00:02:01.640> F<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:02.450> an<00:02:02.720> E<00:02:02.840> chord<00:02:02.869> F<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:03.920> then

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
between F and an E chord F and then

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.460 
between F and an E chord F and then
equal<00:02:04.720> it's<00:02:05.720> going<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:05.930> give<00:02:06.049> us<00:02:06.200> a<00:02:06.289> really

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
equal it's going to give us a really

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.110 
equal it's going to give us a really
frigid<00:02:08.590> flamenco<00:02:09.590> sound<00:02:09.800> okay<00:02:10.670> so<00:02:10.729> let's<00:02:11.030> see

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
frigid flamenco sound okay so let's see
