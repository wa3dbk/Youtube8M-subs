your<00:01:44.790> del<00:01:44.909> Toro's<00:01:45.270> plays<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:46.229> get<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.470> pop<00:01:46.680> and

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
your del Toro's plays you get to pop and

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.200

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
then you get to draw which is absolutely

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.929 
then you get to draw which is absolutely
broken<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.020> deck<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.860> yeah<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.340> know<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.729> lot
