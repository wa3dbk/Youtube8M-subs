wing is a unique vehicle it gives us the
chance<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:48.000> really<00:01:48.180> test<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.600> limits<00:01:48.810> of

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
chance to really test the limits of

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.469 
chance to really test the limits of
design<00:01:50.409> and<00:01:50.799> the<00:01:51.030> learning<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.119> will<00:01:52.299> get

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
design and the learning that will get

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.480 
design and the learning that will get
from<00:01:52.810> designing<00:01:53.409> tires<00:01:53.710> for<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:53.979> delta<00:01:54.310> wing

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
from designing tires for the delta wing

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.940 
from designing tires for the delta wing
is<00:01:55.030> something<00:01:55.420> that<00:01:55.509> we<00:01:55.630> can<00:01:55.780> apply<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.439> the

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
is something that we can apply to the

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.160 
is something that we can apply to the
tires<00:01:57.159> we<00:01:57.369> make<00:01:57.520> for<00:01:57.640> everyday<00:01:57.850> consumers<00:01:58.450> to

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
tires we make for everyday consumers to

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.590 
tires we make for everyday consumers to
continue<00:01:59.619> to<00:01:59.740> make<00:01:59.920> them<00:02:00.159> more

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
continue to make them more

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.630 
continue to make them more
fuel-efficient<00:02:01.600> last<00:02:02.020> longer<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:02.710> safer<00:02:03.280> and

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
fuel-efficient last longer and safer and

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.550 
fuel-efficient last longer and safer and
that's<00:02:03.759> really<00:02:03.820> why<00:02:04.090> we<00:02:04.210> race<00:02:04.420> in<00:02:04.659> the<00:02:05.229> delta

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
that's really why we race in the delta

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.840 
that's really why we race in the delta
wing<00:02:05.740> because<00:02:05.979> some<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.369> its<00:02:06.520> unique

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
wing because some of its unique

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.210 
wing because some of its unique
characteristics<00:02:07.750> really<00:02:08.679> will<00:02:08.830> allow<00:02:09.009> us<00:02:09.039> to

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
characteristics really will allow us to

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.190 
characteristics really will allow us to
push<00:02:09.519> the<00:02:09.670> boundaries<00:02:09.970> of<00:02:10.090> that<00:02:10.660> learning<00:02:10.810> and

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
push the boundaries of that learning and

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.530 
push the boundaries of that learning and
the<00:02:12.130> delta<00:02:12.430> wing<00:02:12.550> itself<00:02:12.700> is<00:02:13.090> really<00:02:13.390> an

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
the delta wing itself is really an

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.589 
the delta wing itself is really an
exercise<00:02:13.930> in<00:02:13.959> efficiency<00:02:14.769> a<00:02:15.599> lightweight

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
exercise in efficiency a lightweight

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.440 
exercise in efficiency a lightweight
vehicle<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.319> we<00:02:17.920> need<00:02:18.069> to<00:02:18.190> design<00:02:18.519> tires<00:02:18.880> that

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
vehicle and we need to design tires that

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.130 
vehicle and we need to design tires that
are<00:02:20.040> lightweight<00:02:21.040> very<00:02:21.640> very<00:02:22.510> fuel<00:02:22.720> efficient

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
are lightweight very very fuel efficient

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.680 
are lightweight very very fuel efficient
and<00:02:23.260> but<00:02:23.920> still<00:02:24.220> last<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.940> very<00:02:24.970> long<00:02:25.209> time<00:02:25.660> and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
and but still last a very long time and

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.190 
and but still last a very long time and
perform<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:27.580> very<00:02:27.819> high<00:02:27.970> levels<00:02:28.049> which<00:02:29.049> is

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
perform to very high levels which is

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.759 
perform to very high levels which is
what<00:02:29.349> we<00:02:29.470> do<00:02:29.709> in<00:02:30.340> racing<00:02:31.060> today<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:31.630> but<00:02:32.560> this

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
what we do in racing today and but this

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.680 
what we do in racing today and but this
vehicle<00:02:33.280> really<00:02:33.610> will<00:02:33.760> give<00:02:33.910> us<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.150> chance<00:02:34.180> to

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
vehicle really will give us a chance to

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.080 
vehicle really will give us a chance to
push<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.260> boundaries<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.799> learn<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:36.459> apply

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
push the boundaries and learn and apply

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.000 
push the boundaries and learn and apply
that<00:02:37.329> learning<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.840> what<00:02:38.380> we<00:02:38.500> do<00:02:38.650> every<00:02:38.860> day

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
that learning to what we do every day

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.500 
that learning to what we do every day
and<00:02:39.280> that's<00:02:39.370> why<00:02:39.549> we're<00:02:39.730> excited<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:40.120> be<00:02:40.239> part

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
and that's why we're excited to be part

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.620 
and that's why we're excited to be part
of<00:02:40.660> this<00:02:41.380> project
