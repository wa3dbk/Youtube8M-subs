00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
could be a good espresso and we take a

could be a good espresso and we take a
coffee<00:02:11.800> is<00:02:12.220> sort<00:02:12.430> of<00:02:12.460> banging<00:02:12.760> out<00:02:12.850> a<00:02:12.880> little

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
coffee is sort of banging out a little

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.230 
coffee is sort of banging out a little
bit<00:02:13.360> we<00:02:13.990> don't<00:02:14.170> clean<00:02:14.410> it<00:02:14.590> we<00:02:14.710> leave<00:02:14.860> an<00:02:15.010> old

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
bit we don't clean it we leave an old

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.440 
bit we don't clean it we leave an old
remaining<00:02:16.240> layer<00:02:16.450> of<00:02:16.750> previous<00:02:17.230> coffee<00:02:18.450> take

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450

a coffee we're just gonna press it a

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.450 
a coffee we're just gonna press it a
little<00:02:21.580> bit<00:02:21.940> it's<00:02:22.240> much<00:02:22.360> quicker<00:02:22.570> this<00:02:22.810> way

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
little bit it's much quicker this way

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.460 
little bit it's much quicker this way
and<00:02:24.460> we'll<00:02:24.580> put<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:24.850> in<00:02:24.910> there<00:02:25.230> now<00:02:26.230> what<00:02:26.350> we're

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
and we'll put it in there now what we're

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.900 
and we'll put it in there now what we're
gonna<00:02:26.560> do<00:02:26.680> now<00:02:26.920> is<00:02:27.100> just<00:02:27.190> leave<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.700> for<00:02:27.820> a

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
gonna do now is just leave it for a

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.790 
gonna do now is just leave it for a
little<00:02:28.120> bit<00:02:28.270> just<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.600> burn<00:02:28.930> their<00:02:29.320> top<00:02:29.530> layer

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
little bit just to burn their top layer

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.460 
little bit just to burn their top layer
just<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.130> give<00:02:30.280> it<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.400> little<00:02:30.520> more<00:02:31.470> thickness

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
just to give it a little more thickness

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.730 
just to give it a little more thickness
really<00:02:32.860> I<00:02:32.920> suppose<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:34.150> we'll<00:02:34.420> start<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:35.050> now

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
really I suppose and we'll start it now

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.199 
really I suppose and we'll start it now

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
looking at his grind so instead of

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.220 
looking at his grind so instead of
making<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.459> good<00:02:39.610> extraction<00:02:40.180> in<00:02:40.330> 25<00:02:40.750> seconds

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230
