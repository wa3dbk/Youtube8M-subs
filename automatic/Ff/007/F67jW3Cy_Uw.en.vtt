00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
away when you dock in I haven't had this

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.880 
away when you dock in I haven't had this
problem<00:00:27.779> since<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.199> updated<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.769> new

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
problem since I updated to the new

problem since I updated to the new
software<00:00:29.460> for<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> tab<00:00:30.140> but<00:00:31.430> sometimes<00:00:32.430> it's

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
software for the tab but sometimes it's

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.920 
software for the tab but sometimes it's
just<00:00:32.700> not<00:00:32.850> even<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.570> let's<00:00:33.690> go<00:00:33.780> ahead<00:00:33.840> and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
just not even that so let's go ahead and

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.150 
just not even that so let's go ahead and
just<00:00:34.079> give<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.320> shot<00:00:34.500> here<00:00:34.800> slide<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.399> and

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
just give it a shot here slide it in and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.950 
just give it a shot here slide it in and
there's<00:00:38.160> one<00:00:38.309> example<00:00:38.460> right<00:00:38.790> there<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.390> plug

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
there's one example right there I plug

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.069 
there's one example right there I plug
it<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:41.129> doesn't<00:00:41.309> usually<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.629> pops<00:00:42.840> up

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
it in and it doesn't usually it pops up

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.900 
it in and it doesn't usually it pops up
if<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.320> go<00:00:43.469> back<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> unboxing<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.789> this

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
if you go back to the unboxing of this

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.360 
if you go back to the unboxing of this
thing<00:00:45.379> it<00:00:46.379> turns<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.829> right<00:00:47.039> away<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.340> moment

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
thing it turns on right away the moment

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.670 
thing it turns on right away the moment
you<00:00:47.640> plug<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.329> there<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.469> just

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
you plug it in and there it is it just

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.100 
you plug it in and there it is it just
turned<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.360> should<00:00:51.629> be<00:00:51.660> doing<00:00:52.020> that

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
turned on so it should be doing that

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.220 
turned on so it should be doing that
right<00:00:52.170> away<00:00:52.789> that's<00:00:53.789> how<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.149> dismounted<00:00:55.050> and

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
right away that's how you dismounted and

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.470 
right away that's how you dismounted and
turn<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.590> back<00:00:55.620> off<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.190> should<00:00:56.460> go<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.059> just

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
turn it back off it should go and just

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.229 
turn it back off it should go and just
automatically<00:00:57.989> go<00:00:58.170> back<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> home<00:00:58.649> screen

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
automatically go back to the home screen

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.770 
automatically go back to the home screen
and<00:01:00.920> it<00:01:01.920> doesn't<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.760> unless<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.420> let<00:01:03.750> it

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
and it doesn't and unless I just let it

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.859 
and it doesn't and unless I just let it
sit<00:01:04.080> there<00:01:04.110> for<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.500> while<00:01:04.589> maybe<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.400> will<00:01:05.869> but

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
sit there for a while maybe it will but

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.510 
sit there for a while maybe it will but
that<00:01:07.170> shouldn't<00:01:07.500> be<00:01:07.680> happening<00:01:07.979> whatsoever

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
that shouldn't be happening whatsoever

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.000 
that shouldn't be happening whatsoever
prior<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.060> another<00:01:12.780> problem<00:01:13.350> was<00:01:13.619> that

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
prior to that another problem was that

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.880 
prior to that another problem was that
when<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.000> plugged<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.869> went<00:01:16.200> into<00:01:16.590> this

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
when you plugged it in it went into this

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.810 
when you plugged it in it went into this
uh<00:01:17.390> almost<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> lock<00:01:19.049> screen<00:01:19.369> where<00:01:20.369> it

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
uh almost like a lock screen where it

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.160 
uh almost like a lock screen where it
would<00:01:21.060> be<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.689> big<00:01:22.049> giant<00:01:22.290> clock<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:24.360> calendar

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
would be a big giant clock the calendar

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.219 
would be a big giant clock the calendar
main<00:01:25.799> calendar<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:27.450> couldn't<00:01:27.780> exit<00:01:28.110> out

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
main calendar and you couldn't exit out

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.109 
main calendar and you couldn't exit out
of<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.740> couldn't<00:01:29.070> press<00:01:29.520> home<00:01:29.759> button

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
of that you couldn't press home button

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.319 
of that you couldn't press home button
you<00:01:30.659> couldn't<00:01:31.400> tap<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.579> screen<00:01:32.880> anyway<00:01:33.270> you

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
you couldn't tap the screen anyway you

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.039

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
think that could get to the home to

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.670 
think that could get to the home to
screen<00:01:38.369> was<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.880> back<00:01:39.150> button<00:01:39.479> appear<00:01:40.110> you

screen was the back button appear you
double<00:01:41.009> tap<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.220> it'll<00:01:41.670> take<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> home

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
double tap that it'll take to the home

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.840 
double tap that it'll take to the home
screen<00:01:42.329> but<00:01:42.780> now<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.140> would<00:01:43.340> disengage<00:01:44.340> from

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
screen but now it would disengage from

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.719 
screen but now it would disengage from
the<00:01:45.090> keyboard<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.780> don't<00:01:46.770> know<00:01:46.950> why<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.490> it

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
the keyboard I don't know why that is it

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.789 
the keyboard I don't know why that is it
could<00:01:47.970> be<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> faulty<00:01:48.450> keyboard<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.259> need<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.619> go

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
could be a faulty keyboard I need to go

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.490 
could be a faulty keyboard I need to go
to<00:01:50.310> Verizon<00:01:50.610> see<00:01:51.119> if<00:01:51.270> that's<00:01:51.479> an<00:01:51.840> issue<00:01:52.079> maybe

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.219 
to Verizon see if that's an issue maybe
this<00:01:53.159> one<00:01:53.310> specifically<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:54.899> has<00:01:55.049> been

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
this one specifically but this has been

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.530 
this one specifically but this has been
a<00:01:55.259> problem<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.759> doesn't<00:01:57.210> seem<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.450> be

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
a problem and it doesn't seem to be

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.740

stuff<00:05:49.540> for<00:05:49.750> it<00:05:49.780> you<00:05:49.870> want<00:05:50.020> to<00:05:50.080> protect<00:05:50.380> it<00:05:50.560> but

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
stuff for it you want to protect it but

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.260 
stuff for it you want to protect it but
if<00:05:50.919> you<00:05:51.040> don't<00:05:51.160> care<00:05:51.400> for<00:05:51.460> the<00:05:51.700> you<00:05:51.910> know<00:05:52.000> the

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
if you don't care for the you know the

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.909 
if you don't care for the you know the
keyboard<00:05:52.630> you<00:05:53.320> can<00:05:53.440> just<00:05:53.560> toss<00:05:53.710> in<00:05:53.830> your

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
keyboard you can just toss in your

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.530 
keyboard you can just toss in your
backpack<00:05:54.250> just<00:05:54.400> like<00:05:54.550> that<00:05:54.760> that's<00:05:55.210> perfectly

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
backpack just like that that's perfectly

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.230 
backpack just like that that's perfectly
fine<00:05:55.780> too<00:05:56.080> so<00:05:56.470> that's<00:05:57.340> another<00:05:57.550> problem<00:05:57.760> but

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
fine too so that's another problem but

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.930 
fine too so that's another problem but
I'm<00:05:59.050> gonna<00:05:59.200> find<00:05:59.590> out<00:05:59.740> if<00:06:00.040> this<00:06:00.160> the<00:06:00.520> keyboard

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
I'm gonna find out if this the keyboard

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.700 
I'm gonna find out if this the keyboard
specifically<00:06:01.630> maybe<00:06:01.870> it's<00:06:02.020> just<00:06:02.110> mine<00:06:02.410> I

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
specifically maybe it's just mine I

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.050 
specifically maybe it's just mine I
could<00:06:03.100> have<00:06:03.220> a<00:06:03.250> bad<00:06:03.400> batch<00:06:03.700> because<00:06:04.000> it

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
could have a bad batch because it

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.640 
could have a bad batch because it
doesn't<00:06:04.300> seem<00:06:04.390> like<00:06:04.630> anyone<00:06:04.930> else<00:06:05.200> on<00:06:05.320> YouTube

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650
