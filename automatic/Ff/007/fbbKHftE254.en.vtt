pretty<00:00:42.300> much<00:00:42.450> just<00:00:42.570> did<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.379> minute<00:00:43.710> ago

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
pretty much just did that a minute ago

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.330 
pretty much just did that a minute ago
because<00:00:44.219> i<00:00:45.350> snapped<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.500> safety<00:00:46.829> pin<00:00:46.980> off<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
because i snapped the safety pin off the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.220 
because i snapped the safety pin off the
elastic<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.120> always<00:00:48.239> good<00:00:48.600> when<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.050> put

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
elastic so it's always good when you put

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.790 
elastic so it's always good when you put
the<00:00:49.350> safety<00:00:49.530> pin<00:00:49.710> on<00:00:50.059> your<00:00:51.059> elastic<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.620> make

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
the safety pin on your elastic to make

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.880 
the safety pin on your elastic to make
sure<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.640> nice<00:00:54.210> little<00:00:54.510> lip

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
sure you have a nice little lip

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
sure you have a nice little lip
otherwise<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.160> rip<00:00:56.309> your<00:00:56.460> safety<00:00:56.730> pin

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
otherwise you rip your safety pin

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.840 
otherwise you rip your safety pin
through<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.410> okay<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.980> what<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.129> do<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.430> I've

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
yeah I'd say just a little bit past my

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.960 
yeah I'd say just a little bit past my
halfway<00:01:29.700> point<00:01:30.030> for<00:01:31.220> your<00:01:32.220> bigger<00:01:32.520> thread

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
halfway point for your bigger thread

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.170 
halfway point for your bigger thread
your<00:01:33.299> 58<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.590> go<00:01:34.890> ahead<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.400> stick<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.790> pretty

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
your 58 I go ahead and I stick it pretty

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.210 
your 58 I go ahead and I stick it pretty
much<00:01:36.329> all<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.659> way<00:01:36.750> over<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.590> left<00:01:37.680> as<00:01:38.009> far

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
much all the way over to the left as far

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.330 
much all the way over to the left as far
as<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.430> left<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.210> needle<00:01:39.479> goes<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.900> left

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
as the left the needle goes to the left

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.899 
as the left the needle goes to the left
so<00:01:41.689> then<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.780> run<00:01:43.020> all<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.189> way<00:01:44.220> from<00:01:44.700> Alaska

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
so then I run all the way from Alaska

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.760 
so then I run all the way from Alaska
point2<00:01:45.450> last<00:01:45.659> point<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.079> then<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.560> have

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
point2 last point and then you have

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.649 
point2 last point and then you have
essentially<00:01:47.310> what<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.579> your<00:01:47.700> casing<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.570> now

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
essentially what is your casing so now

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.999 
essentially what is your casing so now
all<00:01:48.689> we<00:01:48.840> have<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.200> thread<00:01:49.560> elastic

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
all we have to do is thread elastic

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.560 
all we have to do is thread elastic
through<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.520> take<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:50.909> down<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.450> we're

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
through it and take it down so we're

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.230 
through it and take it down so we're
going<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.750> do<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.960> right<00:01:52.020> now<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:53.850> go<00:01:54.149> ahead

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
going to do that right now so go ahead

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.580 
going to do that right now so go ahead
and<00:01:54.659> grab<00:01:54.869> your<00:01:55.079> elastic

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.550 
few minutes ago it snapped through my
elastic<00:04:57.509> the<00:04:57.810> safety<00:04:58.050> pin<00:04:58.169> pulled<00:04:58.410> through

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
elastic the safety pin pulled through

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.719 
elastic the safety pin pulled through
because<00:04:58.710> one<00:04:58.949> I<00:04:58.979> didn't<00:04:59.250> have<00:04:59.340> it<00:04:59.430> to<00:04:59.520> the<00:04:59.610> end

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
because one I didn't have it to the end

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.090 
because one I didn't have it to the end
far<00:04:59.910> enough<00:05:00.060> and<00:05:00.360> 2<00:05:01.050> i'd<00:05:01.229> made<00:05:01.440> my<00:05:01.470> casing<00:05:01.949> too

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
far enough and 2 i'd made my casing too

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.050 
far enough and 2 i'd made my casing too
small<00:05:03.259> but<00:05:04.259> we're<00:05:04.650> right<00:05:04.889> at<00:05:05.130> the<00:05:05.190> end<00:05:05.729> of<00:05:05.910> it

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
small but we're right at the end of it

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:13.850 
small but we're right at the end of it
so<00:05:06.300> it<00:05:06.419> shouldn't<00:05:06.810> really<00:05:06.930> matter<00:05:11.270> okay

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860
