00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
was that your back foot jumped straight

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.310 
was that your back foot jumped straight
to<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.220> ground<00:02:34.430> right<00:02:34.850> away<00:02:35.209> which<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:36.049> fine

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
to the ground right away which is fine

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.830 
to the ground right away which is fine
and<00:02:36.590> that<00:02:36.890> is<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.070> good<00:02:37.400> way<00:02:37.579> to<00:02:37.640> practice<00:02:37.970> but

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
and that is a good way to practice but

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.349 
and that is a good way to practice but
you<00:02:39.650> do<00:02:39.859> have<00:02:40.070> to<00:02:40.220> get<00:02:40.340> that<00:02:40.519> full<00:02:40.850> scooping

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
you do have to get that full scooping

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.599 
you do have to get that full scooping
motion<00:02:41.540> with<00:02:41.840> your<00:02:41.870> back<00:02:42.260> foot<00:02:42.620> sometimes

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
motion with your back foot sometimes

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.410 
motion with your back foot sometimes
people<00:02:44.269> will<00:02:44.750> not<00:02:45.590> learn<00:02:46.370> that<00:02:46.670> full<00:02:46.940> scooping

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
people will not learn that full scooping

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.479 
people will not learn that full scooping
motion<00:02:47.600> because<00:02:48.290> they're<00:02:48.440> trying<00:02:48.799> too<00:02:49.459> hard

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
motion because they're trying too hard

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.330 
motion because they're trying too hard
to<00:02:50.120> concentrate<00:02:50.390> on<00:02:50.810> stepping<00:02:51.769> off<00:02:51.980> with

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340
