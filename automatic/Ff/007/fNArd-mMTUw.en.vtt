00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.929 
human consumption that Western people
will<00:01:58.170> like<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.710> they<00:01:58.920> felt<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.250> rapeseed<00:01:59.700> was

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
will like and they felt a rapeseed was

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.480 
will like and they felt a rapeseed was
too<00:02:00.149> high<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.409> erisa<00:02:01.649> cast<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.130> acid

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
too high in in the erisa cast and acid

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.760 
too high in in the erisa cast and acid
okay<00:02:02.729> yeah<00:02:02.990> whereas<00:02:03.990> like<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.229> said<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
okay yeah whereas like I said the the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.410 
okay yeah whereas like I said the the
Chinese<00:02:05.070> people<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.430> India<00:02:05.640> Indian<00:02:06.210> people

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
Chinese people in India Indian people

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.419 
Chinese people in India Indian people
didn't<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.780> problem<00:02:06.990> with<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:08.310> they

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
didn't have a problem with that so they

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.119 
didn't have a problem with that so they
created<00:02:08.729> canola<00:02:09.330> oil<00:02:09.539> well<00:02:10.289> canola<00:02:10.739> oil<00:02:10.890> went

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
created canola oil well canola oil went

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.650 
created canola oil well canola oil went
on<00:02:11.220> for<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.459> while<00:02:11.580> canola<00:02:12.209> went<00:02:12.390> on<00:02:12.450> for<00:02:12.629> a

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
on for a while canola went on for a

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.070 
on for a while canola went on for a
while

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
while

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.010 
while
created<00:02:13.410> oil<00:02:13.740> out<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.930> for<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.960> while

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
created oil out of it and for a while

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.510 
created oil out of it and for a while
there<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.440> was<00:02:16.620> everything<00:02:17.040> was<00:02:17.250> fine<00:02:17.490> and

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
there it was everything was fine and

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.550 
there it was everything was fine and
then<00:02:17.820> some<00:02:18.030> tests<00:02:18.330> came<00:02:18.480> out<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.810> said<00:02:19.020> all

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
then some tests came out that said all

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.710 
then some tests came out that said all
canola<00:02:20.220> oil<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.610> bad<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:21.060> causes<00:02:21.480> heart

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
canola oil is bad it causes heart

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.210 
canola oil is bad it causes heart
disease<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.200> rats<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.710> does<00:02:22.860> all<00:02:23.040> these

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
disease and rats it does all these

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.490 
disease and rats it does all these
terrible<00:02:23.490> things<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.150> also<00:02:24.720> everybody<00:02:25.380> was

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
terrible things and also everybody was

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.440 
terrible things and also everybody was
down<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:25.680> coconut<00:02:26.250> or<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.460> pardon<00:02:26.760> me<00:02:26.850> on<00:02:27.000> canola

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
down on coconut or a pardon me on canola

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.960 
down on coconut or a pardon me on canola
oil<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:28.800> thought<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.340> same<00:02:29.520> thing<00:02:29.550> as<00:02:29.820> well

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
oil and I thought the same thing as well

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.040 
oil and I thought the same thing as well
and<00:02:30.530> it<00:02:31.530> turns<00:02:31.740> out<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.810> there's<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.870> couple

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
and it turns out that there's a couple

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.050 
and it turns out that there's a couple
of<00:02:34.230> different<00:02:34.530> factors<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:35.730> fact<00:02:35.940> that

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
of different factors the fact that

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.420 
of different factors the fact that
canola<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:36.570> hybridized<00:02:37.110> from<00:02:37.770> rapeseed<00:02:38.220> or

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
canola is hybridized from rapeseed or

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.730 
canola is hybridized from rapeseed or
cross<00:02:38.640> pollinated<00:02:39.270> is<00:02:39.390> just<00:02:39.660> fine<00:02:39.870> the

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
cross pollinated is just fine the

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.070 
cross pollinated is just fine the
problem<00:02:41.100> is<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.940> great<00:02:42.390> percentage<00:02:42.780> of

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
problem is that a great percentage of

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.140 
problem is that a great percentage of
canola<00:02:43.380> oil<00:02:43.620> these<00:02:43.830> days<00:02:44.070> is<00:02:44.310> genetically

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
canola oil these days is genetically

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.800 
canola oil these days is genetically
modified<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:46.710> for<00:02:46.980> example<00:02:47.150> it's<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.510> they

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
modified so for example it's it they

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.630 
modified so for example it's it they
take<00:02:48.960> it<00:02:49.080> into<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.350> lab<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.860> they<00:02:50.010> they<00:02:50.460> mess

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
take it into the lab and they they mess

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.630 
take it into the lab and they they mess
with<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.850> genes<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:52.140> when<00:02:52.770> Roundup

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
with the genes so that when Roundup

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.790 
with the genes so that when Roundup
herbicide<00:02:54.180> or<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.320> different<00:02:55.590> kind<00:02:55.740> of

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
herbicide or a different kind of

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.110 
herbicide or a different kind of
herbicide<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.310> spread<00:02:56.640> on<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.820> field

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
herbicide to spread on a field

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.090 
herbicide to spread on a field
everything<00:02:57.630> else<00:02:57.780> will<00:02:57.930> die<00:02:58.140> but<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.740> canola

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
everything else will die but the canola

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.040 
everything else will die but the canola
will<00:02:59.310> live<00:02:59.490> that's<00:03:00.240> similar<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.630> what<00:03:00.870> they<00:03:00.990> do

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
will live that's similar to what they do

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.460 
will live that's similar to what they do
with<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.680> soy<00:03:02.340> exactly<00:03:03.090> yep<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.870> corn<00:03:04.290> and

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
with the soy exactly yep and corn and

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.710 
with the soy exactly yep and corn and
corn<00:03:04.860> so<00:03:05.700> there's<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.090> issue<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.600> other

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
corn so there's that issue the other

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.570 
corn so there's that issue the other
issue<00:03:06.990> is<00:03:07.020> that<00:03:07.170> most<00:03:07.470> canola<00:03:07.830> oil<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.130> buy<00:03:08.280> is

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
issue is that most canola oil you buy is

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.360 
issue is that most canola oil you buy is
refined<00:03:09.480> with<00:03:09.780> chemicals<00:03:10.709> such<00:03:10.860> as<00:03:10.890> hexane

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
refined with chemicals such as hexane

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.310 
refined with chemicals such as hexane
and<00:03:11.430> things<00:03:12.209> like<00:03:12.330> this<00:03:12.480> with<00:03:12.720> high<00:03:12.959> heat

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
and things like this with high heat

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.350 
and things like this with high heat
process<00:03:14.310> at<00:03:14.430> high<00:03:14.550> heat<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:14.880> causes<00:03:15.209> another

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
process at high heat that causes another

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.570 
process at high heat that causes another
problem<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:15.990> is<00:03:16.770> where<00:03:16.980> all<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.160> test

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
problem that is where all the test

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.570 
problem that is where all the test
results<00:03:17.700> came<00:03:18.150> from<00:03:18.390> this<00:03:18.630> kind<00:03:18.930> of<00:03:19.140> oil<00:03:19.580> so

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
results came from this kind of oil so

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.100 
results came from this kind of oil so
regardless<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.420> fact<00:03:21.600> that<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:21.870> didn't

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
regardless of the fact that it didn't

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.550 
regardless of the fact that it didn't
that<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.040> rats<00:03:23.640> metabolize<00:03:24.450> fat<00:03:24.840> different

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
that the rats metabolize fat different

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.100 
that the rats metabolize fat different
than<00:03:25.709> humans<00:03:26.180> there's<00:03:27.180> this<00:03:27.330> factor<00:03:27.750> mixed<00:03:28.019> in

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
than humans there's this factor mixed in

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.080 
than humans there's this factor mixed in
there<00:03:28.140> as<00:03:28.350> well<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:28.739> is<00:03:28.980> all<00:03:29.250> canola<00:03:29.610> oil<00:03:29.850> bad

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
there as well so is all canola oil bad

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.090 
there as well so is all canola oil bad
well<00:03:30.510> there<00:03:31.140> are<00:03:31.230> some<00:03:31.380> suggestions<00:03:31.800> out

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
well there are some suggestions out

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.840 
well there are some suggestions out
there<00:03:32.340> that<00:03:32.580> say<00:03:32.610> that<00:03:33.090> if<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:34.019> can<00:03:34.230> find

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
there that say that if you can find

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.380 
there that say that if you can find
organic<00:03:36.140> canola<00:03:37.140> oil<00:03:37.320> that<00:03:37.590> is<00:03:37.650> cold-pressed

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
organic canola oil that is cold-pressed

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.060 
organic canola oil that is cold-pressed
much<00:03:39.390> is<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.720> same<00:03:40.080> way<00:03:40.170> we<00:03:40.350> we<00:03:40.590> advise<00:03:40.860> people

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
much is the same way we we advise people

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.570 
much is the same way we we advise people
to<00:03:41.220> look<00:03:41.400> for<00:03:41.459> olive<00:03:42.060> oil<00:03:42.380> then<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.739> could<00:03:44.459> be

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
to look for olive oil then it could be

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.880 
to look for olive oil then it could be
fine<00:03:44.850> but<00:03:45.780> we<00:03:45.959> don't<00:03:46.170> really<00:03:46.260> know<00:03:46.650> because

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
fine but we don't really know because

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.800 
fine but we don't really know because
there's<00:03:47.130> not<00:03:47.250> enough<00:03:47.310> data<00:03:48.120> out<00:03:48.360> there<00:03:48.390> but

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
there's not enough data out there but

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.600 
there's not enough data out there but
it's<00:03:48.959> it's<00:03:49.230> most<00:03:49.709> likely<00:03:49.800> safer<00:03:50.400> than<00:03:50.489> what

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
it's it's most likely safer than what

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.270 
it's it's most likely safer than what
you<00:03:50.730> see<00:03:51.080> with<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.200> process<00:03:52.410> stuff<00:03:52.800> so<00:03:53.160> you're

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
you see with the process stuff so you're

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.150 
you see with the process stuff so you're
looking<00:03:53.489> for<00:03:53.640> organic<00:03:54.560> cold-pressed<00:03:55.560> and

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
looking for organic cold-pressed and

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.790 
looking for organic cold-pressed and
even<00:03:56.910> then<00:03:57.120> though<00:03:57.840> it's<00:03:58.019> safer<00:03:58.410> than<00:03:58.560> what

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
even then though it's safer than what

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.130 
even then though it's safer than what
you<00:03:58.890> normally<00:03:58.920> find<00:03:59.550> you<00:04:00.360> still<00:04:00.570> measure<00:04:00.780> no

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
you normally find you still measure no

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.300 
you normally find you still measure no
one's<00:04:01.320> really<00:04:01.500> sure<00:04:01.620> yeah<00:04:01.950> there's<00:04:02.160> not

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
one's really sure yeah there's not

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.340 
one's really sure yeah there's not
enough<00:04:02.519> data<00:04:02.760> on<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.209> however<00:04:03.780> flora<00:04:04.200> the

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
olive oil and tea do we know I don't

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.320 
olive oil and tea do we know I don't
know<00:04:17.370> that<00:04:17.519> there's<00:04:17.580> been<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:18.060> kind<00:04:18.269> of

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
know that there's been that kind of

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.240 
know that there's been that kind of
testing<00:04:19.109> done<00:04:19.260> I<00:04:19.470> haven't<00:04:19.739> seen<00:04:19.859> it<00:04:20.010> at<00:04:20.130> least

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
testing done I haven't seen it at least

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.520 
testing done I haven't seen it at least
anyway<00:04:20.669> but<00:04:20.989> because<00:04:21.989> I<00:04:22.080> always<00:04:22.289> thought<00:04:22.410> the

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
anyway but because I always thought the

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.710 
anyway but because I always thought the
canola<00:04:22.800> oil<00:04:23.010> is<00:04:23.160> bad<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:23.580> I<00:04:23.640> literally<00:04:24.300> put<00:04:24.570> it

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
canola oil is bad so I literally put it

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.450 
canola oil is bad so I literally put it
on<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.960> shelf<00:04:25.229> yeah<00:04:25.950> and<00:04:26.220> I

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
on the shelf yeah and I

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.460 
on the shelf yeah and I
use<00:04:26.610> olive<00:04:26.819> oil<00:04:27.060> for<00:04:27.300> salads<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:27.870> coconut<00:04:28.259> oil

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
use olive oil for salads and coconut oil

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.930 
use olive oil for salads and coconut oil
for<00:04:28.710> cooking<00:04:28.860> and<00:04:29.190> that<00:04:29.370> kind<00:04:29.550> of<00:04:29.610> thing<00:04:29.669> and

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
for cooking and that kind of thing and

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.140 
for cooking and that kind of thing and
so<00:04:30.740> comparing<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.860> two<00:04:32.039> I<00:04:32.220> haven't<00:04:32.639> really

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
so comparing the two I haven't really

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.540 
so comparing the two I haven't really
seen<00:04:33.479> the<00:04:34.169> data<00:04:34.350> between<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.830> two<00:04:34.979> there

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
seen the data between the two there

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.550 
seen the data between the two there
could<00:04:35.639> be<00:04:35.669> quite<00:04:35.910> comparable<00:04:36.240> mm-hmm<00:04:36.900> what's

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
could be quite comparable mm-hmm what's

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.350 
could be quite comparable mm-hmm what's
it's<00:04:37.800> interesting<00:04:38.190> that<00:04:38.550> you<00:04:38.880> know<00:04:39.000> here<00:04:39.240> we

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
it's interesting that you know here we

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.350 
it's interesting that you know here we
are<00:04:39.389> we<00:04:39.720> think<00:04:40.229> kennels<00:04:40.530> was<00:04:41.250> bad<00:04:41.490> then<00:04:42.150> we

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
are we think kennels was bad then we

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.059 
are we think kennels was bad then we
realize<00:04:42.720> that<00:04:42.990> that<00:04:43.319> certain<00:04:43.680> types<00:04:43.919> of

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
realize that that certain types of

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:45.830 
realize that that certain types of
canola<00:04:44.430> oil<00:04:44.699> is<00:04:44.910> bad<00:04:45.150> but<00:04:45.360> there's<00:04:45.539> some<00:04:45.720> that

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
canola oil is bad but there's some that

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.650 
canola oil is bad but there's some that
may<00:04:45.990> be<00:04:46.050> good<00:04:46.259> for<00:04:46.530> us<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:47.400> it's<00:04:48.030> quite<00:04:48.569> an

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
may be good for us and it's quite an

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.870 
may be good for us and it's quite an
interesting<00:04:48.900> topic<00:04:49.259> so<00:04:49.830> i<00:04:49.860> guess<00:04:50.220> for<00:04:50.490> all<00:04:50.669> of

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
interesting topic so i guess for all of

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.550 
interesting topic so i guess for all of
you<00:04:51.000> who<00:04:51.030> have<00:04:51.479> sent<00:04:51.750> us<00:04:51.870> that<00:04:51.900> question

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
you who have sent us that question

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.890 
you who have sent us that question
should<00:04:53.400> i<00:04:53.520> eat<00:04:53.729> canola<00:04:54.060> oil<00:04:54.330> should<00:04:54.569> i<00:04:54.630> should

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
should i eat canola oil should i should

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.020 
should i eat canola oil should i should
i<00:04:55.020> consume<00:04:55.380> canola<00:04:55.740> oil<00:04:56.009> i<00:04:56.220> guess<00:04:56.880> our

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
i consume canola oil i guess our

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.999 
i consume canola oil i guess our
responses<00:04:57.720> there<00:04:57.870> may<00:04:58.080> be<00:04:58.110> other<00:04:58.410> oils<00:04:58.830> out

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
responses there may be other oils out

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:00.650 
responses there may be other oils out
there<00:04:59.250> that<00:04:59.490> you<00:04:59.699> could<00:04:59.849> probably<00:05:00.060> consume

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
there that you could probably consume

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.779 
there that you could probably consume
and<00:05:00.870> they<00:05:01.410> would<00:05:01.620> we've<00:05:01.979> got<00:05:02.160> enough<00:05:02.430> evidence

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
and they would we've got enough evidence

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.969 
and they would we've got enough evidence
to<00:05:03.000> support<00:05:03.150> their<00:05:03.479> good<00:05:03.660> for<00:05:03.870> you<00:05:03.990> fewer

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
to support their good for you fewer

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.860 
to support their good for you fewer
questions<00:05:05.220> behind<00:05:05.759> them<00:05:05.880> as<00:05:06.000> well<00:05:06.210> right<00:05:06.539> and

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
questions behind them as well right and

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.450 
questions behind them as well right and
what<00:05:07.110> we<00:05:07.199> would<00:05:07.380> want<00:05:07.410> to<00:05:07.650> stay<00:05:07.830> away<00:05:08.039> from<00:05:08.070> her

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
what we would want to stay away from her

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.610 
what we would want to stay away from her
the<00:05:08.610> oil<00:05:08.820> is<00:05:09.060> that<00:05:09.330> you<00:05:09.750> know<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:10.080> canola<00:05:10.380> oil

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620

the oil is that you know the canola oil
that's<00:05:10.830> in<00:05:11.039> the<00:05:11.190> processed<00:05:11.669> food<00:05:11.940> so<00:05:12.509> when<00:05:12.660> we

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
that's in the processed food so when we

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.390 
that's in the processed food so when we
do<00:05:12.960> so<00:05:13.139> when<00:05:13.289> we<00:05:13.410> see<00:05:13.680> it<00:05:13.800> in<00:05:13.919> the<00:05:14.039> salad

dressings and when we see it in in the
chips<00:05:16.680> and<00:05:16.889> things<00:05:17.160> that<00:05:17.310> are<00:05:17.400> in<00:05:17.460> the<00:05:17.550> market

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
chips and things that are in the market

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.120 
chips and things that are in the market
that's<00:05:18.419> it's<00:05:18.750> not<00:05:18.930> good<00:05:19.380> oil<00:05:19.650> for<00:05:19.979> us<00:05:20.039> to

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
that's it's not good oil for us to

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.379 
that's it's not good oil for us to
consume<00:05:20.400> because<00:05:20.669> it's<00:05:20.820> not<00:05:21.030> been<00:05:21.150> processed

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
consume because it's not been processed

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.020 
consume because it's not been processed
right<00:05:21.840> and<00:05:22.199> this<00:05:22.560> hydrogen<00:05:23.030> hydrogenated

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
right and this hydrogen hydrogenated

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.520 
right and this hydrogen hydrogenated
right<00:05:24.330> and<00:05:24.720> and<00:05:24.930> it's<00:05:25.110> genetically

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
right and and it's genetically

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.170 
right and and it's genetically
engineered<00:05:25.919> I<00:05:25.979> think<00:05:26.190> ninety<00:05:26.729> percent<00:05:26.880> of

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
engineered I think ninety percent of

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.969 
engineered I think ninety percent of
canola<00:05:27.569> genetically<00:05:28.259> miles<00:05:28.440> around<00:05:28.770> there<00:05:28.949> i

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
canola genetically miles around there i

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.110 
canola genetically miles around there i
believe<00:05:29.220> it's<00:05:29.370> between<00:05:29.550> eighty<00:05:29.849> and<00:05:29.970> ninety

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
believe it's between eighty and ninety

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.570 
believe it's between eighty and ninety
it's<00:05:30.389> a<00:05:30.449> high<00:05:30.690> percentage<00:05:30.930> and<00:05:31.889> that's<00:05:32.340> just

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
it's a high percentage and that's just

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.730 
it's a high percentage and that's just
so<00:05:32.759> they<00:05:32.880> can<00:05:32.940> withstand<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.599> roundup<00:05:33.990> so<00:05:34.169> you

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
so they can withstand the roundup so you

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.210 
so they can withstand the roundup so you
know<00:05:34.860> when<00:05:35.220> when<00:05:35.520> you<00:05:35.550> eat<00:05:36.259> Canole<00:05:37.259> that's

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
know when when you eat Canole that's

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.060 
know when when you eat Canole that's
been<00:05:38.599> genetically<00:05:39.599> modified<00:05:40.259> it's<00:05:40.530> also<00:05:40.770> been

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
been genetically modified it's also been

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.189 
been genetically modified it's also been
sprayed<00:05:41.460> with<00:05:41.490> Roundup<00:05:41.729> and<00:05:42.300> so<00:05:42.990> they're

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
sprayed with Roundup and so they're

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.260 
sprayed with Roundup and so they're
consuming<00:05:43.800> the<00:05:44.130> sum<00:05:44.460> of<00:05:44.550> the<00:05:44.610> roundup<00:05:44.969> as<00:05:45.120> well

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
consuming the sum of the roundup as well

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.600 
consuming the sum of the roundup as well
yes<00:05:45.630> you<00:05:45.810> yeah<00:05:46.169> yeah<00:05:46.860> the<00:05:46.979> pesticide<00:05:47.430> is<00:05:47.580> a

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
yes you yeah yeah the pesticide is a

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.120 
yes you yeah yeah the pesticide is a
further<00:05:47.849> Asia<00:05:48.150> so<00:05:48.389> look<00:05:49.380> for<00:05:49.560> organic

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
further Asia so look for organic

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.350 
further Asia so look for organic
especially<00:05:50.699> when<00:05:50.820> you're<00:05:50.909> talking<00:05:51.030> about

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
especially when you're talking about

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.540 
especially when you're talking about
canola<00:05:51.780> oil<00:05:51.930> it's<00:05:52.169> really<00:05:52.409> important<00:05:53.009> but

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
canola oil it's really important but

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.550 
canola oil it's really important but
