cleaning by themselves the robots will
not<00:01:35.110> be<00:01:35.320> able<00:01:35.470> to<00:01:35.619> do<00:01:35.860> this<00:01:36.100> but<00:01:36.700> with<00:01:36.850> a<00:01:36.880> mash

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
not be able to do this but with a mash

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.719 
not be able to do this but with a mash
up<00:01:37.420> of<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.689> other<00:01:37.840> technologies<00:01:38.619> we<00:01:39.280> suspect

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
up of the other technologies we suspect

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.010 
up of the other technologies we suspect
that<00:01:39.880> we'll<00:01:40.060> be<00:01:40.210> able<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.509> automate<00:01:40.869> the

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
that we'll be able to automate the

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.890 
that we'll be able to automate the
system<00:01:41.350> so<00:01:42.009> we<00:01:42.610> may<00:01:42.790> need<00:01:43.119> to<00:01:43.270> use<00:01:43.299> some<00:01:43.659> Auto

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
system so we may need to use some Auto

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.670 
system so we may need to use some Auto

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
implement validate that the kit has been

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.110 
implement validate that the kit has been
built<00:02:15.900> correctly<00:02:16.520> that<00:02:17.520> has<00:02:17.610> been<00:02:17.760> delivered

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
built correctly that has been delivered

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.530 
built correctly that has been delivered
to<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.360> correct<00:02:19.040> operating<00:02:20.040> room<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:21.000> all<00:02:21.300> of

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
to the correct operating room so all of

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.820 
to the correct operating room so all of
those<00:02:21.720> things<00:02:22.080> combined<00:02:22.500> all<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.680> those

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
those things combined all of those

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.320 
those things combined all of those
technologies<00:02:23.190> combined<00:02:23.760> we<00:02:23.940> think<00:02:24.150> will<00:02:24.270> help

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
technologies combined we think will help

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.180 
technologies combined we think will help
us<00:02:24.510> automate<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.110> process<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:25.860> what<00:02:26.070> we

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
us automate this process so what we

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.920 
us automate this process so what we
envision<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.700> we'll<00:02:27.240> be<00:02:27.450> able<00:02:27.720> to

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
envision is that we'll be able to

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.280 
envision is that we'll be able to
automate<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.620> process<00:02:29.010> we'll<00:02:29.700> be<00:02:29.880> able<00:02:30.120> to

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
automate the process we'll be able to

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.660 
automate the process we'll be able to
decrease<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.500> processing<00:02:32.070> time<00:02:32.280> therefore

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
decrease the processing time therefore

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.940 
decrease the processing time therefore
you<00:02:33.180> can<00:02:33.360> get<00:02:33.480> greater<00:02:33.780> throughput<00:02:34.080> with

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
you can get greater throughput with

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.830 
you can get greater throughput with
greater<00:02:35.280> throughput<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:36.000> decrease<00:02:36.480> time<00:02:36.660> you

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
greater throughput and decrease time you

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.930 
greater throughput and decrease time you
can<00:02:36.990> also<00:02:37.110> get<00:02:37.350> greater<00:02:37.590> patient<00:02:37.950> throughput

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
can also get greater patient throughput

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.110 
can also get greater patient throughput
and<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.840> very<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.950> know<00:02:41.010> greatest<00:02:41.670> thing<00:02:41.910> is

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
and the very you know greatest thing is

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.110 
and the very you know greatest thing is
that<00:02:42.360> patient<00:02:43.050> safety<00:02:43.460> ensuring<00:02:44.460> that<00:02:44.670> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
that patient safety ensuring that the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.660 
that patient safety ensuring that the
sterile<00:02:45.600> implements<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:47.400> have<00:02:47.520> gone

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
sterile implements that have gone

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.400 
sterile implements that have gone
through<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:47.940> sterile<00:02:48.240> process<00:02:48.660> are<00:02:48.840> actually

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
through the sterile process are actually

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.410 
through the sterile process are actually
sterile<00:02:49.740> and<00:02:49.890> nothing<00:02:50.190> has<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.910> know<00:02:51.000> missed

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
sterile and nothing has you know missed

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.840 
sterile and nothing has you know missed
because<00:02:51.780> it's<00:02:51.960> a<00:02:52.020> human<00:02:52.260> eye<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:53.430> that's<00:02:53.610> the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
because it's a human eye so that's the

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.560 
because it's a human eye so that's the
number<00:02:54.510> one<00:02:54.630> thing<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:54.990> patient<00:02:55.380> safety
