ergonomically speaking this is a very
comfortable<00:00:25.800> pad<00:00:26.460> whoops<00:00:26.939> I'm<00:00:27.210> knocking<00:00:27.510> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
comfortable pad whoops I'm knocking the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.779 
comfortable pad whoops I'm knocking the
camera<00:00:27.930> around<00:00:28.160> it<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.429> fact<00:00:29.580> more

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
camera around it is in fact more

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.730 
camera around it is in fact more
comfortable<00:00:30.359> than<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.810> snare<00:00:31.050> pad<00:00:31.320> which<00:00:31.560> was

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
comfortable than the snare pad which was

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.580 
comfortable than the snare pad which was
a<00:00:31.769> step<00:00:32.040> up<00:00:32.070> from<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.790> nares<00:00:33.059> pad<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:34.290> like

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
a step up from the nares pad it's like

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.619 
a step up from the nares pad it's like
ah<00:00:36.620> how<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.680> describe<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:39.180> like<00:00:39.390> the

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
ah how to describe it it's like the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.979 
ah how to describe it it's like the
beginnings<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.500> what<00:00:40.559> became<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.399> ps1<00:00:42.090> pad

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
beginnings of what became the ps1 pad

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.680 
beginnings of what became the ps1 pad
it's<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:43.440> Sony<00:00:44.010> took<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.329> button

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
it's like Sony took the the button

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.810 
it's like Sony took the the button
layout<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.350> snares<00:00:46.620> but<00:00:47.129> took<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:47.610> these

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
layout of the snares but took it's these

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.910 
layout of the snares but took it's these
either<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:49.170> like<00:00:49.320> it's<00:00:49.559> growing

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
either like this it's like it's growing

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.770 
either like this it's like it's growing
the<00:00:50.100> prongs<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.850> we're<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.300> used<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.629> all

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
the prongs that we're so used to all

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.920 
the prongs that we're so used to all
modern<00:00:52.110> pads<00:00:52.379> now<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.940> makes<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.570> really

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
modern pads now and that makes it really

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.689 
modern pads now and that makes it really
comfortable<00:00:55.260> something<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> get<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> grip<00:00:56.760> of

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
comfortable something to get a grip of

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.840 
comfortable something to get a grip of
yeah<00:00:59.699> this<00:00:59.940> was<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.210> start<00:01:00.739> of<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:02.070> aspect<00:01:02.489> I

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
yeah this was the start of that aspect I

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.840 
yeah this was the start of that aspect I
think<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.480> button<00:01:03.809> layout<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.670> limited<00:01:05.670> there

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
think the button layout is limited there

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.030 
think the button layout is limited there
are<00:01:05.880> no<00:01:06.030> no<00:01:06.930> shoulder<00:01:07.320> pads<00:01:07.530> which<00:01:07.830> we've

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
are no no shoulder pads which we've

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.460 
are no no shoulder pads which we've
become<00:01:08.220> used<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.790> but<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.630> actual<00:01:09.900> shape<00:01:10.290> of

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
become used to but the actual shape of

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.130 
become used to but the actual shape of
the<00:01:10.530> pad<00:01:10.799> itself<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.450> see<00:01:12.659> where<00:01:12.930> this

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
the pad itself you can see where this

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.510 
the pad itself you can see where this
has<00:01:13.380> progressed<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.520> d-pad<00:01:17.150> um<00:01:19.250> this<00:01:20.250> is

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
has progressed to the d-pad um this is

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.060 
has progressed to the d-pad um this is
one<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.880> those<00:01:21.030> deep<00:01:21.720> pants<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.680> never

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
one of those deep pants that I can never

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.760 
one of those deep pants that I can never
quite<00:01:23.520> make<00:01:23.790> my<00:01:24.060> mind<00:01:24.360> up<00:01:24.570> about<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.170> it

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
quite make my mind up about and it

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.090 
quite make my mind up about and it
depends<00:01:26.340> very<00:01:26.400> much<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.330> pad<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:28.110> one<00:01:28.500> is

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
depends very much on the pad this one is

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.520 
depends very much on the pad this one is
pretty<00:01:29.430> good<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.630> got<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> nice<00:01:31.020> click

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.740 
to it some of them so loose that you
lose<00:01:37.470> all<00:01:37.829> feeling<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.520> precision<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.329> that

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
lose all feeling of precision and that

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.030 
lose all feeling of precision and that
