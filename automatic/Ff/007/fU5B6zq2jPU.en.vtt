00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
nicely I said to myself that this is

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.449 
nicely I said to myself that this is
something<00:03:18.780> interesting<00:03:18.989> something<00:03:19.470> new<00:03:19.830> why

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
something interesting something new why

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.330 
something interesting something new why

not try it so we have to sit down and

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.740
