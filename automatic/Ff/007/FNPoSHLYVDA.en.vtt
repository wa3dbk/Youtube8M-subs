I'm going to show you how to make it and
I'm<00:00:11.460> going<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.670> do<00:00:11.730> this<00:00:11.849> step<00:00:12.179> by<00:00:12.389> step<00:00:12.719> and

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
I'm going to do this step by step and

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.430 
I'm going to do this step by step and
layer<00:00:13.799> by<00:00:14.009> layer<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.549> guys<00:00:14.790> can<00:00:15.289> see<00:00:16.289> how<00:00:16.379> I

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
layer by layer so you guys can see how I

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.960 
layer by layer so you guys can see how I
make<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.800> really<00:00:17.130> easily<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.699> can<00:00:17.730> build

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
make it really easily and you can build

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.300 
make it really easily and you can build
it<00:00:18.060> yourself<00:00:18.500> so<00:00:19.500> here's<00:00:19.920> how<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.130> works

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
it yourself so here's how it works

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.460 
it yourself so here's how it works
there's<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.699> lever<00:00:21.240> here<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.720> when<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.050> hit<00:00:22.230> that

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
there's a lever here and when I hit that

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.590 
there's a lever here and when I hit that
just<00:00:23.340> going<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.550> put<00:00:23.850> water<00:00:24.060> down<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.510> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
just going to put water down on the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.420 
just going to put water down on the
wheat<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.930> all<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.439> wheat<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.980> going<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.279> come

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
wheat and all the wheat is going to come

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.160 
wheat and all the wheat is going to come
right<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.760> me<00:00:27.500> like<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.099> can<00:00:29.279> just<00:00:29.400> go

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
right to me like that so I can just go

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.549 
right to me like that so I can just go
turn<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.349> off<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:32.210> pick<00:00:33.210> up<00:00:33.329> all<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> weak<00:00:33.750> s

turn this off and pick up all the weak s
some<00:00:35.250> meat<00:00:35.399> might<00:00:35.610> get<00:00:35.760> stuck<00:00:35.940> up<00:00:36.120> here<00:00:36.510> but

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
some meat might get stuck up here but

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.360 
it's very minimal and yeah it's
completely<00:00:39.360> automatic<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.140> yeah<00:00:41.070> I'm<00:00:41.280> going

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
completely automatic so yeah I'm going

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.760 
completely automatic so yeah I'm going

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
thing you want to do is find yourself an

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.229 
thing you want to do is find yourself an
area<00:00:45.719> that's<00:00:46.070> ten<00:00:47.070> long<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:49.700> six<00:00:50.700> blocks<00:00:50.969> wide

area that's ten long and six blocks wide

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.290 
area that's ten long and six blocks wide
and<00:00:52.190> then<00:00:53.190> you're<00:00:53.399> going<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.610> take<00:00:53.850> your

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300

shovel or whatever tool you're going to
use<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.539> dig<00:00:57.750> down<00:00:57.899> one<00:00:58.500> block<00:00:59.149> along<00:01:00.149> here

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
use and dig down one block along here

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.380 
use and dig down one block along here
and<00:01:00.629> that's<00:01:01.350> going<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.500> be<00:01:01.590> seven<00:01:01.890> blocks<00:01:02.039> long

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
and that's going to be seven blocks long

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.179 
and that's going to be seven blocks long
so<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.780> dig<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> seven<00:01:04.500> block<00:01:04.650> long<00:01:04.860> trench

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
so just it dig a seven block long trench

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.370 
so just it dig a seven block long trench
and<00:01:05.430> then<00:01:06.240> when<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.510> get<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.229> eighth

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
and then when you get to the eighth

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.469 
and then when you get to the eighth
block<00:01:07.680> you're<00:01:07.890> going<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.070> dig<00:01:08.189> down<00:01:08.369> one<00:01:09.240> more

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
block you're going to dig down one more

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.969 
block you're going to dig down one more
and<00:01:09.720> that's<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.970> five<00:01:11.970> by<00:01:12.450> three

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
and that's going to be a five by three

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.219 
and that's going to be a five by three
so<00:01:13.979> dig<00:01:14.189> down<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.369> five<00:01:14.670> by<00:01:14.909> three<00:01:14.939> by<00:01:15.780> two<00:01:15.840> high

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
so dig down a five by three by two high

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.340 
so dig down a five by three by two high
hole<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.360> once<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.780> you're<00:01:19.259> going

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
hole and once you have that you're going

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.830 
hole and once you have that you're going
to<00:01:19.439> take<00:01:19.590> your<00:01:19.740> redstone<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.630> place<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.780> in

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
to take your redstone and place it in

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.039 
to take your redstone and place it in
the<00:01:21.930> one<00:01:22.080> wide<00:01:22.320> trench<00:01:23.270> like<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.509> all<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the one wide trench like this all the

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.840 
the one wide trench like this all the
way<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.320> seventh<00:01:25.590> block<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.100> then<00:01:26.759> you're

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
way to the seventh block and then you're

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.120 
way to the seventh block and then you're
going<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.000> take<00:01:27.119> your<00:01:27.270> pistons<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:28.130> diagonal

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
going to take your pistons and diagonal

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.590 
going to take your pistons and diagonal
from<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> last<00:01:29.490> piece<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.210> redstone<00:01:30.360> you're

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
from the last piece of redstone you're

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.690 
from the last piece of redstone you're
gonna<00:01:30.689> play<00:01:30.869> some<00:01:31.049> fist<00:01:31.650> facing<00:01:32.130> upward<00:01:32.430> and

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
gonna play some fist facing upward and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.510 
gonna play some fist facing upward and
these<00:01:33.479> are<00:01:33.570> going<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.720> be<00:01:33.810> sticky<00:01:34.200> pistons<00:01:34.590> but

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
these are going to be sticky pistons but

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.830 
these are going to be sticky pistons but
if<00:01:35.610> you're<00:01:35.700> going<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.880> use<00:01:36.030> regular<00:01:36.240> pistons

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
if you're going to use regular pistons

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.050 
if you're going to use regular pistons
you<00:01:37.799> would<00:01:37.920> place<00:01:38.130> them<00:01:38.340> one<00:01:38.579> block<00:01:38.850> higher

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
you would place them one block higher

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.810 
you would place them one block higher
and<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.420> make<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.619> trench<00:01:40.979> only<00:01:41.430> one<00:01:41.610> deep

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
and just make this trench only one deep

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.420 
and just make this trench only one deep
and<00:01:42.170> it<00:01:43.170> would<00:01:43.320> work<00:01:43.500> perfectly<00:01:43.979> fine<00:01:44.189> it's

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
and it would work perfectly fine it's

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.789 
and it would work perfectly fine it's
just<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> same<00:01:44.939> concept<00:01:45.530> just<00:01:46.530> with<00:01:46.770> a

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
just the same concept just with a

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.740 
just the same concept just with a
regular<00:01:47.220> pistons<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.939> hold<00:01:48.210> back<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.570> water

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
regular pistons to hold back the water

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.389 
regular pistons to hold back the water
I'm<00:01:49.020> using<00:01:49.259> sticky<00:01:49.740> pistons<00:01:50.070> because<00:01:50.250> it

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
I'm using sticky pistons because it

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.670 
I'm using sticky pistons because it
looks<00:01:50.610> better<00:01:50.869> when<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.960> final<00:01:52.290> products

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
looks better when the final products

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.499 
looks better when the final products
there<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.610> next<00:01:53.820> you're<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.060> take<00:01:54.240> your

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
there so next you're going to take your

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.569 
there so next you're going to take your
repeaters<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.880> place<00:01:56.880> them<00:01:57.060> facing<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:58.579> to

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
repeaters and place them facing in to

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.370 
repeaters and place them facing in to
the<00:01:59.670> Pistons<00:02:00.030> like<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.719> all<00:02:00.750> four<00:02:01.350> of

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
the Pistons like that so all four of

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.260 
the Pistons like that so all four of
them<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.740> then<00:02:02.700> you're<00:02:02.820> going<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.969> take<00:02:03.149> your

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
them and then you're going to take your

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.740 
them and then you're going to take your
redstone<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.810> bring<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.759> along<00:02:05.759> here<00:02:06.570> and

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
redstone and bring it along here and

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.350 
redstone and bring it along here and
place<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.170> all<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.590> extra<00:02:07.950> spots<00:02:08.239> so<00:02:09.239> that's

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
place it all the extra spots so that's

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.690 
place it all the extra spots so that's
going<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.629> be<00:02:09.929> powering<00:02:10.319> all<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.560> Pistons

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
going to be powering all the Pistons

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.510 
going to be powering all the Pistons
so<00:02:12.180> now<00:02:12.990> that<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.230> have<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.530> redstone<00:02:13.950> you're

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
so now that you have the redstone you're

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.449 
so now that you have the redstone you're
ready<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.790> move<00:02:14.880> on<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.240> next<00:02:15.300> step<00:02:15.599> so<00:02:16.459> now

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
ready to move on to the next step so now

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.470 
ready to move on to the next step so now
that<00:02:17.610> you've<00:02:17.760> done<00:02:17.880> that<00:02:17.940> you're<00:02:18.330> going<00:02:18.360> to

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
that you've done that you're going to

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.360 
that you've done that you're going to
want<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.660> hide<00:02:18.840> your<00:02:18.870> redstone<00:02:19.440> so<00:02:20.220> you're

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
want to hide your redstone so you're

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.890 
want to hide your redstone so you're
going<00:02:20.489> to<00:02:20.550> take<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.760> block<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.270> your<00:02:21.360> choice

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
going to take a block of your choice

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.830 
going to take a block of your choice
and<00:02:22.099> place<00:02:23.099> one<00:02:23.340> here<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.819> then<00:02:24.569> place<00:02:24.810> one

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
and place one here and then place one

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.080 
and place one here and then place one
over<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.410> redstone<00:02:25.770> like<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:26.819> it's<00:02:26.970> just

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
over the redstone like this so it's just

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.930 
over the redstone like this so it's just
over<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.870> first<00:02:28.080> redstone<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.800> place<00:02:29.730> a

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
over the first redstone and place a

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.690 
over the first redstone and place a
lever<00:02:30.239> here<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:30.750> when<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.860> right-click<00:02:32.489> or

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
lever here and when you right-click or

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.059 
lever here and when you right-click or
left-click<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.209> lever<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:34.590> that's<00:02:34.830> going<00:02:35.010> to

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
left-click the lever and that's going to

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.150 
left-click the lever and that's going to
make<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.310> Pistons<00:02:35.670> go<00:02:35.850> up<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.180> down<00:02:37.040> so<00:02:38.040> then

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
make the Pistons go up and down so then

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.330 
make the Pistons go up and down so then
you're<00:02:38.280> just<00:02:38.400> going<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.550> continue<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.810> wood

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
you're just going to continue the wood

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.410 
you're just going to continue the wood
across<00:02:41.340> here<00:02:43.370> until<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.550> get<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.790> here<00:02:45.120> and

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
across here until you get to here and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.910 
across here until you get to here and
here<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.600> continue<00:02:49.080> it<00:02:49.280> over<00:02:50.280> here<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.920> all

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
here and continue it over here and all

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.449 
here and continue it over here and all
the<00:02:53.250> way<00:02:53.340> over<00:02:53.370> here<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.600> other<00:02:54.630> end<00:02:54.870> and

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
the way over here to the other end and

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.140 
the way over here to the other end and
here's<00:02:56.459> where<00:02:56.700> you're<00:02:56.790> going<00:02:56.819> to<00:02:56.970> want<00:02:57.120> to

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
here's where you're going to want to

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.640 
here's where you're going to want to
hydrate<00:02:57.510> your<00:02:57.600> soil<00:02:57.870> because<00:02:58.230> this<00:02:58.380> is<00:02:58.500> where

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
hydrate your soil because this is where

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.259 
hydrate your soil because this is where
the<00:02:58.739> wheats<00:02:58.920> going<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.190> grow<00:02:59.310> so<00:03:00.060> you're<00:03:00.150> going

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
the wheats going to grow so you're going

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.780 
the wheats going to grow so you're going
to<00:03:00.360> dig<00:03:00.540> down<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.750> one-block<00:03:01.230> trench<00:03:01.730> all<00:03:02.730> the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
to dig down a one-block trench all the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.270 
to dig down a one-block trench all the
way<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:04.650> here<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.870> that's<00:03:06.870> going<00:03:07.019> to<00:03:07.080> be<00:03:07.280> the

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
way to here and that's going to be the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.420 
way to here and that's going to be the
same<00:03:08.610> path<00:03:09.600> as<00:03:09.900> where<00:03:10.080> you<00:03:10.170> put<00:03:10.380> your<00:03:10.560> lever

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
same path as where you put your lever

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.920 
same path as where you put your lever
and<00:03:11.700> you're<00:03:12.060> just<00:03:12.150> going<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.330> fill<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.720> up

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
and you're just going to fill that up

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.430 
and you're just going to fill that up
with<00:03:12.989> water<00:03:13.310> source<00:03:14.310> blocks<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.900> that's

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
with water source blocks and that's

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.319 
with water source blocks and that's
going<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.590> be<00:03:16.709> hydrating<00:03:17.190> your<00:03:17.280> soil<00:03:17.519> so<00:03:18.239> then

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
going to be hydrating your soil so then

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.319 
going to be hydrating your soil so then
you're<00:03:18.420> just<00:03:18.450> going<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.720> fill<00:03:18.870> that<00:03:18.930> back<00:03:19.230> over

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
you're just going to fill that back over

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.160 
you're just going to fill that back over
with<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.709> whatever<00:03:22.709> block<00:03:23.010> you're<00:03:23.220> using<00:03:24.170> so

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
with the whatever block you're using so

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.930 
with the whatever block you're using so
now<00:03:25.290> you're<00:03:25.470> going<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.650> need<00:03:25.799> to<00:03:25.920> place<00:03:26.760> the

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
now you're going to need to place the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.280 
now you're going to need to place the
water<00:03:27.120> that's<00:03:27.450> going<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:27.660> harvest<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.109> wheat

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
water that's going to harvest the wheat

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.289 
water that's going to harvest the wheat
so<00:03:29.010> you're<00:03:29.130> going<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.280> place<00:03:29.489> whatever<00:03:30.000> block

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
so you're going to place whatever block

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.340 
so you're going to place whatever block
you're<00:03:30.480> using<00:03:30.690> over<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.290> pistons<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:33.350> then

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
you're using over the pistons and then

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.160 
you're using over the pistons and then
you're<00:03:34.470> going<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.650> place<00:03:35.900> whatever<00:03:36.900> block

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
you're going to place whatever block

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.130 
you're going to place whatever block
you're<00:03:37.829> using<00:03:38.010> right<00:03:38.400> here<00:03:38.840> next<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:40.019> the

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
you're using right here next to the

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.870 
you're using right here next to the
piston<00:03:40.470> so<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.739> covers<00:03:40.920> up<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.220> Redstone<00:03:41.670> so

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
piston so it covers up the Redstone so

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.640 
piston so it covers up the Redstone so
it's<00:03:42.030> one<00:03:42.239> down<00:03:42.420> from<00:03:42.540> here<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:42.959> I'll<00:03:43.620> show

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
it's one down from here and I'll show

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.380 
it's one down from here and I'll show
you<00:03:43.859> when<00:03:44.130> it's<00:03:44.250> powered<00:03:44.579> and<00:03:44.820> unpowered<00:03:44.880> so

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
you when it's powered and unpowered so

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.180 
you when it's powered and unpowered so
this<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:45.799> unpowered<00:03:46.799> this<00:03:47.640> is<00:03:47.760> powered<00:03:48.150> and

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
this is unpowered this is powered and

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.670 
this is unpowered this is powered and
you're<00:03:50.190> going<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.340> go<00:03:50.519> up<00:03:50.700> one<00:03:50.970> more<00:03:51.180> block

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
you're going to go up one more block

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.140 
you're going to go up one more block
around<00:03:52.680> here<00:03:54.799> and<00:03:55.910> then<00:03:56.910> you're<00:03:57.000> going<00:03:57.090> to

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
place some glass here for looks so you

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.000 
place some glass here for looks so you
can<00:03:59.549> see<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.819> water<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.829> then<00:04:01.829> you're<00:04:01.890> going

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
can see the water and then you're going

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.750 
can see the water and then you're going
to<00:04:02.069> place<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.280> water<00:04:02.579> right<00:04:02.790> here<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:04.730> what<00:04:05.730> I

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
to place the water right here and what I

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.059 
to place the water right here and what I
usually<00:04:05.940> do<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.390> finish<00:04:06.660> it<00:04:06.780> off<00:04:06.930> is<00:04:07.170> place

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
usually do to finish it off is place

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.640 
usually do to finish it off is place
half<00:04:08.489> slabs

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
half slabs

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:17.110 
half slabs
sandstone<00:04:10.650> half<00:04:10.889> slabs<00:04:11.959> around<00:04:12.959> here

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.410

like this along the top too so it's

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.810 
like this along the top too so it's
going<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:21.660> look<00:04:21.810> like<00:04:21.930> this<00:04:22.170> now<00:04:22.490> so<00:04:23.490> now<00:04:23.640> all

you get from grass and I'll show you in
a<00:05:12.420> second<00:05:12.780> where<00:05:13.350> you<00:05:13.470> get<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:13.680> grass<00:05:13.890> so<00:05:14.190> if<00:05:14.400> I

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
a second where you get the grass so if I

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.520 
a second where you get the grass so if I
just<00:05:14.640> put<00:05:14.820> bonemeal<00:05:15.150> down<00:05:15.330> like<00:05:15.510> that<00:05:15.660> you<00:05:15.930> can

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
just put bonemeal down like that you can

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.970 
just put bonemeal down like that you can
find<00:05:16.800> this<00:05:16.950> grass<00:05:17.220> anywhere<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:17.850> you<00:05:18.480> hit<00:05:18.660> it

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
find this grass anywhere and you hit it

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.220 
find this grass anywhere and you hit it
sometimes<00:05:19.980> you<00:05:20.250> will<00:05:20.400> get<00:05:20.520> a<00:05:20.820> seed<00:05:21.810> that<00:05:21.840> pops

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
sometimes you will get a seed that pops

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:28.660 
sometimes you will get a seed that pops
out<00:05:22.440> and<00:05:22.650> hopefully<00:05:23.400> one<00:05:23.820> will<00:05:24.060> in<00:05:24.900> a<00:05:25.020> second

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:28.670 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.070 

so<00:05:29.670> yeah<00:05:29.820> ventually<00:05:30.120> a<00:05:30.270> seed<00:05:30.570> will<00:05:30.750> pop<00:05:30.900> out

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
so yeah ventually a seed will pop out

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.490 
so yeah ventually a seed will pop out
and<00:05:31.320> you'll<00:05:31.410> get<00:05:31.560> this<00:05:31.740> seed<00:05:32.040> and<00:05:33.350> you're<00:05:34.350> just

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
and you'll get this seed and you're just

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.320 
and you'll get this seed and you're just
going<00:05:34.620> to<00:05:34.650> hold<00:05:35.010> down<00:05:35.220> right<00:05:35.460> click<00:05:35.640> and<00:05:35.910> plant

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
going to hold down right click and plant

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.430 
going to hold down right click and plant
all<00:05:36.510> of<00:05:36.540> those<00:05:36.750> you<00:05:36.900> just<00:05:36.990> plan<00:05:37.230> them<00:05:37.320> like

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
all of those you just plan them like

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.920 
all of those you just plan them like
this<00:05:39.830> and<00:05:41.030> do<00:05:42.030> that<00:05:42.060> all<00:05:42.360> the<00:05:42.480> way<00:05:42.570> to<00:05:42.630> the<00:05:42.750> end

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
this and do that all the way to the end
