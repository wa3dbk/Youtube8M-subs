they'll help tear out the product so

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.580 
they'll help tear out the product so
here<00:01:42.079> they're<00:01:42.259> going<00:01:42.380> to<00:01:42.469> be<00:01:42.590> modifiers<00:01:43.189> and

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
here they're going to be modifiers and

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.599 
here they're going to be modifiers and
they're<00:01:45.590> not<00:01:45.710> going<00:01:45.859> to<00:01:45.950> have<00:01:46.069> any<00:01:46.280> kind<00:01:46.490> of

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
they're not going to have any kind of

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.719 
they're not going to have any kind of
price<00:01:46.850> but<00:01:47.450> they<00:01:47.630> will<00:01:47.810> have<00:01:48.049> a<00:01:48.079> tare<00:01:48.499> weight

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
price but they will have a tare weight

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.449 
price but they will have a tare weight
so<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.850> tear<00:01:50.149> is<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.719> amount<00:01:51.049> that<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:52.189> cup

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:52.459 
so the tear is the amount that the cup

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.029 
so the tear is the amount that the cup
ways<00:01:52.759> which<00:01:53.359> you<00:01:53.569> do<00:01:53.689> not<00:01:53.719> charge<00:01:54.109> for<00:01:54.229> some

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
ways which you do not charge for some

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.179 
ways which you do not charge for some
locations<00:01:55.520> do<00:01:55.759> charge<00:01:56.030> for<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.299> way<00:01:56.389> the<00:01:56.539> cup

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
locations do charge for the way the cup

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.620 
locations do charge for the way the cup
but<00:01:58.189> this<00:01:58.700> just<00:01:58.969> gives<00:01:59.179> you<00:01:59.329> an<00:01:59.420> opportunity

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
but this just gives you an opportunity

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.830 
but this just gives you an opportunity
to<00:02:00.109> input<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.740> tare<00:02:01.009> weight<00:02:01.039> and<00:02:01.569> it<00:02:02.569> just

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
to input the tare weight and it just

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.389 
to input the tare weight and it just
depends<00:02:03.200> on<00:02:03.289> how<00:02:03.409> your<00:02:03.619> business<00:02:03.740> is<00:02:04.069> going<00:02:04.130> to

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
depends on how your business is going to

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.680
