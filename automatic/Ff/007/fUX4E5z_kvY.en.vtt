 these are the only numbers or several 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.920
 one of several oils which is exactly 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.220
 contains lipids 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:23.660
 that penetrate our hair and 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:28.760
 make the structures better inside it 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:31.370
 clearly their area of ​​view is 1 our 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:36.290
 Russian women who leads her too 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.720
 channel on yu tuba awesome girl 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.470
 she exactly has a video about butter she 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.720
 something she is either a chemist or a biologist i 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.840
 I don't know for sure, but I will leave a link to her. 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.160
 video which is about where she spoke about 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.990
 butter and here I absolutely trust her and 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.800
 since the wasps we conquered it to me 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.709
 pain this i enjoyed and month and in 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:05.170
 spheres my hair does not get out the tips 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:09.020
 my generally soft silky glisten 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:12.140
 head does not get fat it as you know here 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.590
 ordinary oil you apply you flush and 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.239
 hair 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.920
 some weight is felt here 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.750
 some sort of grit they get fat 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.770
 nothing like that I put it on the night of 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.700
 whole head 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.920
 especially rubbing it in the scalp 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.350
 because it also contains sex ads to 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.070
 the real effect is very useful when 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.070
 seborrhea 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.170

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.060
 I advise here any coconut oil but I 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.360
 not refined body and refined 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.580
 I did not want I wanted with all substances 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.049
 helpful 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.160
 coconut oil refined it 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:56.440
 good to use on body skin 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.250
 unrefined I use on 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:07.940

 so indescribable girls can not tell me 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:17.980
 because i see the effect on the hair neither 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.980
 one mask didn't give me that effect 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:27.780

 enough for what I took next 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.300
 grated also took from the company 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.100
 pivot store in a cool dark place 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:36.000

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:38.390
 refrigerator it will help with the shipment 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.070
 three basics this is such a piece 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.680
 it smells delicious chocolate 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.940
 She took to do a massage 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.940
 scrub tile 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.870
 grains low 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:57.720
 with coffee beans that's a must 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.760
 I will show you how I do it and I have not yet 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.750
 I tried but I will tell you 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.330
 what I tried I tried this 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.920
 massage bar and toad and chocolate 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.940
 massage tile composition is not 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:17.150
 refined shea butter cocoa butter toad 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:22.110
 golden cocoa mass looks like this 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:26.480
 here so this is the tile tried 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:30.090
 apply three times after the fight not 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:32.640
 cool effect too she will die bland 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:35.490
 because when sending a cool effect 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.610
 but when our skin is dry when they 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:41.970
 enough moisture and nutrition and a bunch 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.940

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.320
 long sleeves there 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:04.070
 long sleeves so as not to 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:07.710
 stain the bed 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:11.040
