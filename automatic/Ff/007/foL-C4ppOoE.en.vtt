zx7<00:00:08.820> Ionis<00:00:09.179> well<00:00:09.389> ok<00:00:10.290> guys<00:00:10.469> I'm<00:00:10.679> doing<00:00:10.769> a

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
zx7 Ionis well ok guys I'm doing a

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.350 
zx7 Ionis well ok guys I'm doing a
top-down<00:00:11.250> approach<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:11.849> I'll<00:00:11.910> start<00:00:12.150> with<00:00:12.210> the

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
top-down approach so I'll start with the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.789 
top-down approach so I'll start with the
master<00:00:12.630> cylinder<00:00:12.840> although<00:00:13.380> if<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.590> want<00:00:13.740> to

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
master cylinder although if you want to

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.230 
master cylinder although if you want to
get<00:00:13.920> technical<00:00:14.070> about<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:14.670> should<00:00:14.940> start

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
get technical about it I should start

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.880 
get technical about it I should start
with<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.480> reservoir<00:00:15.960> but<00:00:16.350> well<00:00:16.619> let<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:16.770> one

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
with the reservoir but well let that one

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.310 
with the reservoir but well let that one
slip<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.970> first<00:00:18.359> thing<00:00:18.480> first<00:00:18.510> mounted<00:00:19.260> the

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
slip so first thing first mounted the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.230 
slip so first thing first mounted the
Brembo<00:00:19.619> MC<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.039> quite<00:00:20.340> simple<00:00:20.730> just<00:00:21.060> put<00:00:21.150> your

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
Brembo MC is quite simple just put your

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.540 
Brembo MC is quite simple just put your
bolts<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:21.869> forth<00:00:22.080> like<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.550> and

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
bolts on and so forth like that and

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.189 
bolts on and so forth like that and
anyone<00:00:23.939> knows<00:00:24.119> about<00:00:24.150> mechanical<00:00:24.779> advantage

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
anyone knows about mechanical advantage

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.060 
anyone knows about mechanical advantage
the<00:00:26.160> further<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.670> ie<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:28.289> part<00:00:28.650> as<00:00:28.859> close

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
the further it is ie this part as close

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.440 
the further it is ie this part as close
as<00:00:29.250> possible<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:31.619> real<00:00:31.740> clip<00:00:32.090> and<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.239> get

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
as possible to the real clip and you get

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.930 
as possible to the real clip and you get
more<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.690> an<00:00:34.050> advantage<00:00:34.489> if<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.550> bring<00:00:35.790> it

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
more of an advantage if you bring it

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.180 
more of an advantage if you bring it
more<00:00:36.030> close<00:00:36.360> closer<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.829> get<00:00:37.980> lesser

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
more close closer you get lesser

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.950 
more close closer you get lesser
advantage<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.239> called<00:00:39.420> simple

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
advantage it's just called simple

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.360 
advantage it's just called simple
mechanical<00:00:40.350> advantage<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.219> leverage

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
mechanical advantage and leverage

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.580 
mechanical advantage and leverage
effectively<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.930> I've<00:00:43.079> just<00:00:43.110> put<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
effectively so I've just put it in the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.639 
effectively so I've just put it in the
middle<00:00:43.739> point<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.370> just<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.760> useful<00:00:45.000> tote<00:00:45.620> ok

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
middle point and just a useful tote ok

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.490 
middle point and just a useful tote ok
now<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:47.100> quite<00:00:47.280> awkward<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.730> mount<00:00:47.910> this

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
now it's quite awkward to mount this

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.420 
now it's quite awkward to mount this
unfortunately<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.710> reason<00:00:49.950> for<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.129> is

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
unfortunately and the reason for that is

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.360 
unfortunately and the reason for that is
if<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.059> look<00:00:51.329> where<00:00:51.510> my<00:00:51.690> finger<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.440> don't

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
if you look where my finger is I don't

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.920 
if you look where my finger is I don't
know<00:00:53.550> if<00:00:53.640> that's<00:00:53.820> coming<00:00:54.090> clear<00:00:54.360> enough<00:00:54.690> oh

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
know if that's coming clear enough oh

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.049 
know if that's coming clear enough oh
yeah<00:00:55.770> ok<00:00:56.370> my<00:00:56.520> finger<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.059> there's<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.020> second

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
yeah ok my finger is there's the second

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.750 
yeah ok my finger is there's the second
outline<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.390> first<00:01:00.629> one<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:01.199> located

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
outline the first one is just located

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.850 
outline the first one is just located
right<00:01:02.760> here<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.600> as<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.049> can<00:01:04.199> see<00:01:04.260> it

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
right here and as you can see it

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.710 
right here and as you can see it
interferes<00:01:05.489> with<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.850> acceleration<00:01:06.390> cables

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
interferes with the acceleration cables

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.630 
interferes with the acceleration cables
now<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.350> actually<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.920> get<00:01:08.070> around<00:01:08.400> it

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
now you can actually just get around it

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.630 
now you can actually just get around it
but<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.299> does<00:01:09.510> mean<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:11.070> ability<00:01:11.610> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
but it does mean that the ability to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.890 
but it does mean that the ability to
actually<00:01:12.030> twist<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.650> Brembo<00:01:14.010> MC<00:01:14.900> rotational

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
actually twist the Brembo MC rotational

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.429 
actually twist the Brembo MC rotational
wise<00:01:16.340> from<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.580> datum<00:01:18.299> here<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:19.170> quite

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
wise from this datum here is quite

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.390 
wise from this datum here is quite
difficult<00:01:19.680> because<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.970> can<00:01:21.150> only<00:01:21.299> do<00:01:22.400> you

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
difficult because you can only do you

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.460 
difficult because you can only do you
can<00:01:23.490> only<00:01:23.640> do<00:01:23.790> about<00:01:23.970> through<00:01:24.390> about<00:01:24.960> 5<00:01:25.229> mil<00:01:25.439> I

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
can only do about through about 5 mil I

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.490 
can only do about through about 5 mil I
would<00:01:25.680> say<00:01:26.540> opposed<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.020> take<00:01:28.049> your

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
would say opposed to if you take your

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.710 
would say opposed to if you take your
stock<00:01:28.979> one<00:01:29.220> or<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.490> use<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.939> clutch<00:01:30.119> as<00:01:30.270> example

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
stock one or I use the clutch as example

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.030 
stock one or I use the clutch as example
you<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:30.930> rotate<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.259> as<00:01:31.470> much<00:01:31.590> as<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.740> want

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
you can rotate it as much as you want

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.580 
you can rotate it as much as you want
but<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.390> maximum<00:01:33.630> leverage<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.350> I've<00:01:34.439> got

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
but the maximum leverage that I've got

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.780 
but the maximum leverage that I've got
here<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.799> mean<00:01:34.950> I'm<00:01:35.100> comfortable<00:01:35.520> with<00:01:35.729> that

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
here I mean I'm comfortable with that

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.980 
here I mean I'm comfortable with that
anyway<00:01:36.420> if<00:01:37.549> I<00:01:38.549> put<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.880> here<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.479> feel

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
anyway if I put it here I feel

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.380 
anyway if I put it here I feel
comfortable<00:01:40.170> where<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.220> obviously<00:01:42.180> that's

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
comfortable where it is obviously that's

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.319 
comfortable where it is obviously that's
that's<00:01:42.750> where<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.960> want<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.670> if<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:45.000> do<00:01:45.180> get

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
that's where I want it if you do get

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.270 
that's where I want it if you do get
problems<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.899> know<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.350> acceleration<00:01:46.740> cables

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
problems I know the acceleration cables

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.670 
problems I know the acceleration cables
which<00:01:47.460> are<00:01:47.759> these<00:01:48.479> ones<00:01:48.720> here<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.500> get<00:01:49.649> a

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
which are these ones here you can get a

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.420 
which are these ones here you can get a
conversion<00:01:50.009> kit<00:01:50.220> for<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:50.670> side<00:01:50.939> which<00:01:51.840> is

conversion kit for this side which is

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.469 
conversion kit for this side which is

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.880 
think of the Zed x9r or the zx6r comment
on<00:01:57.570> my<00:01:57.689> head<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:57.960> I'll<00:01:58.079> find<00:01:58.290> out<00:01:58.500> put<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.799> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
on my head but I'll find out put in the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.639 
on my head but I'll find out put in the
article<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.579> we've<00:01:59.759> done<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.090> part<00:02:00.560> got<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
article so we've done that part got the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.550 
article so we've done that part got the
cables<00:02:02.040> down<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.969> here<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.420> make<00:02:03.570> sure<00:02:03.600> that

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
cables down to here and make sure that

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.200 
cables down to here and make sure that
you<00:02:04.740> get<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> cables<00:02:05.369> facing<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.000> right<00:02:06.180> way

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
you get the cables facing the right way

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.869 
you get the cables facing the right way
obviously<00:02:06.500> your<00:02:07.500> bottom<00:02:07.950> banjos<00:02:08.280> have<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.520> kink

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
obviously your bottom banjos have a kink

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.639 
obviously your bottom banjos have a kink
in<00:02:08.970> it

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
in it

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.770 
in it
so<00:02:09.829> I<00:02:10.129> put<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.579> other<00:02:10.729> way<00:02:10.879> where<00:02:11.150> these<00:02:11.569> were

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
so I put the other way where these were

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.110 
so I put the other way where these were
facing<00:02:12.489> what<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.670> other<00:02:13.790> way<00:02:13.909> as<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.090> can

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
facing what the other way as you can

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.119 
facing what the other way as you can
imagine<00:02:14.269> and<00:02:15.110> they<00:02:15.260> put<00:02:15.470> too<00:02:15.560> much<00:02:15.650> strain<00:02:15.950> on

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
imagine and they put too much strain on

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.970 
imagine and they put too much strain on
the<00:02:16.220> actual<00:02:17.079> braid<00:02:18.079> leave<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.470> brake<00:02:18.739> lines

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
the actual braid leave the brake lines

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.280 
the actual braid leave the brake lines
so<00:02:19.280> make<00:02:19.459> sure<00:02:19.489> you<00:02:19.670> go<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.879> right<00:02:20.060> way

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
so make sure you go to the right way

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.020 
so make sure you go to the right way
it's<00:02:21.290> last<00:02:21.470> nicely<00:02:21.890> set<00:02:22.099> up<00:02:22.129> I've<00:02:22.489> left<00:02:22.879> it

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
it's last nicely set up I've left it

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.699 
it's last nicely set up I've left it
loose<00:02:23.180> at<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.420> moment<00:02:23.810> as<00:02:24.140> pointless<00:02:24.439> to

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
loose at the moment as pointless to

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:25.899 
loose at the moment as pointless to
tighten<00:02:25.220> up<00:02:25.250> until<00:02:25.549> I've<00:02:25.640> got<00:02:25.760> all<00:02:25.849> the

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:25.909 
tighten up until I've got all the

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.789 
tighten up until I've got all the
calipers<00:02:26.269> in<00:02:26.299> place<00:02:26.599> right<00:02:27.260> next<00:02:27.500> we'd<00:02:27.709> be

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
calipers in place right next we'd be

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.519 
calipers in place right next we'd be
putting<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.069> calipers<00:02:28.400> on
