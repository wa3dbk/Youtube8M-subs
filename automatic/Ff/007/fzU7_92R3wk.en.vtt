00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:11.369
 dota dota2 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:14.699
 leagues legends in hand crisis all these 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:16.680
 moba games and we all agree 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:19.380
 once wanted to play them from 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.800
 third person and don't care what heroes 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:27.360
 even for the gods of congestion or 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.789
 munro and here are the companies of heather studios village 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.390
 thought about it and decided to give us 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.550
 such a game before she called and and smythe game 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.149
 was still announced far away in food 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:44.010
 the eleventh year on April 21 she survived 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.420
 all sorts of btbt and here in the yard 2014 and 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.050
 March 25 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.260
 the game came out immediately I want to notice 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.239
 that the graphics in the game are very beautiful all 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.059
 model character traced in 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.219
 the environment is also nice and not without reason 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.199
 the game is based on the unreal engine 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.120
 3 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.549
 well, in the meantime, we are slowly but 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.009
 confidently proceed to review gameplay 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.130
 but before we move on finally 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.060
 I would like to say a few words about the store 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.729
 here and 2 in 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.079
 Well, during the game you can blame yourself 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.869
 buy new gods 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:22.750
 there are enough beds and each in its own way 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.200
 unique for game currency or for 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.710
 real 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.950
 and inside the game you can 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.409
 sled buy or what the character needs 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.439
 all sorts of weapons there armor 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.450
 each item has three levels and with 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:40.899
 each one of them is getting better 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.360
 changes its characteristics effects meaning 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.929
 improvements in the recipe system dispute from 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.170
 dota 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:49.929
 However, this idea according to 1 studios 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.700
 is more friendly towards 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.549
 beginners for beginners 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.520
 still made auto purchase and also auto 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.319
 distribution with the philosopher so how on gran 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.110
 English is not everything from the first time 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:05.590
 will be able to understand that this or that skill and 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.959
 the subject does but the more often to play those 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.569
 faster you can remember and knowledge 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:13.209
 English is not required 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.360
 the game is not the only map where metopes 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:19.120
 here is also not a single mode for each 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.940
 cards and modes are different then it could be 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.910
 arena 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.430
 two 525 teams can knead each other 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.470
 in a small area up to 1 line with 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.240
 one tower where teams of three people 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.450
 then one by one 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.910
 as you can see the choice and here there is this choice 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.720
 opens as you progress in level 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.880
 crawfish f1m move on to the gameplay itself 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.700
 he is and how already 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.640
 it was said above you play for gods but 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.370
 further everything just looking what mode in 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.260
 one need to tear down the tower to a friend 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.990
 enemies and kill that is nothing but 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.910
 there is no such one except the view from 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:01.310
 third person and a variety of modes and 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.950
 it remains to add one if you are tired 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.680
 be the characters on top then swing the game 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.460
 smythe because she fritupley which means 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.860
 is free 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.470
 and now there is real money left 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.840
 think for yourself 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.970
 well, that's all with you was frost
