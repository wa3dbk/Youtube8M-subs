much<00:01:25.140> color<00:01:25.530> there's<00:01:25.950> print<00:01:27.200> saturation<00:01:28.759> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
much color there's print saturation the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.390 
much color there's print saturation the
difference<00:01:30.150> that's<00:01:30.780> hard<00:01:31.439> cuz<00:01:31.770> that's<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
difference that's hard cuz that's the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.030 
difference that's hard cuz that's the
saturation<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:35.509> how<00:01:36.650> clear<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.740> see<00:01:37.920> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
saturation is like how clear you see the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.640 
saturation is like how clear you see the
color<00:01:38.280> then<00:01:39.210> there's<00:01:39.570> gamma<00:01:39.869> which<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.380> I

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
color then there's gamma which is I

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.069 
color then there's gamma which is I
don't<00:01:41.159> know<00:01:41.340> what<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.720> makes<00:01:42.960> it

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
don't know what that it it just makes it

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.399 
don't know what that it it just makes it
like<00:01:43.290> more<00:01:43.470> foggy<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.509> if<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.350> you
