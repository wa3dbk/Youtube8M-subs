go see those and personally I think it's
a<00:01:20.040> little<00:01:20.430> bit<00:01:20.640> too<00:01:20.970> early<00:01:21.799> to<00:01:23.119> start<00:01:24.119> talking

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
a little bit too early to start talking

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.420 
a little bit too early to start talking
about<00:01:24.810> what's<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.350> happen<00:01:25.650> with<00:01:25.740> halo<00:01:26.070> 4

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
about what's going to happen with halo 4

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.370 
about what's going to happen with halo 4
in<00:01:26.729> terms<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.210> like<00:01:27.450> gameplay<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.110> stuff<00:01:28.259> like

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
in terms of like gameplay and stuff like

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.190 
in terms of like gameplay and stuff like
that<00:01:28.439> because<00:01:29.150> no<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.329> really<00:01:30.360> knows<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.810> lot

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
that because no one really knows a lot

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.749 
that because no one really knows a lot
of<00:01:31.320> information<00:01:31.860> about<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.250> aside<00:01:32.640> from

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
of information about it aside from

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.910 
of information about it aside from
anyone<00:01:33.119> working<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.600> working<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.710> game

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
anyone working in working on the game

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.539 
anyone working in working on the game
because<00:01:35.850> 343<00:01:36.450> hasn't<00:01:36.990> really<00:01:37.470> released<00:01:38.340> any

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
because 343 hasn't really released any

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.060 
because 343 hasn't really released any
information<00:01:38.759> about<00:01:39.210> halo<00:01:39.390> 4<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.829> just

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
information about halo 4 and so I just

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.480 
information about halo 4 and so I just
think<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.369> too<00:01:41.640> early<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:43.189> like<00:01:44.189> its

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
think it's too early in the like its

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.819 
think it's too early in the like its
life<00:01:44.820> cycle<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:46.170> can<00:01:46.350> call<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.680> life

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
life cycle if you can call it a life

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.859 
life cycle if you can call it a life
cycle<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.340> far<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:48.119> too<00:01:48.299> early<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.659> start

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
cycle so far it's too early to start

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.270 
cycle so far it's too early to start
talking<00:01:49.259> about<00:01:49.680> what's<00:01:50.610> going<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.820> happen<00:01:51.119> so

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
talking about what's going to happen so

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.090 
talking about what's going to happen so
what<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.310> want<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> discuss<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:55.049> debate<00:01:55.890> on

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
what I want to discuss is the debate on

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.490 
what I want to discuss is the debate on
whether<00:01:56.369> or<00:01:56.549> not<00:01:56.729> halo<00:01:57.149> 4<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.810> going<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.350> be<00:01:58.469> a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
whether or not halo 4 is going to be a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.130 
whether or not halo 4 is going to be a
good<00:01:58.860> game<00:01:59.189> or<00:01:59.430> not<00:01:59.549> more<00:02:00.420> importantly<00:02:00.869> is

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
good game or not more importantly is

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.830 
good game or not more importantly is
halo<00:02:01.860> 4<00:02:02.219> going<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:02.759> successful<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.750> have

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
halo 4 going to be successful and I have

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.590 
halo 4 going to be successful and I have
a<00:02:03.899> couple<00:02:04.259> reasons<00:02:04.439> why<00:02:04.829> i<00:02:05.219> believe<00:02:05.759> halo<00:02:06.240> 4

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
a couple reasons why i believe halo 4

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.609 
a couple reasons why i believe halo 4
will<00:02:07.439> actually<00:02:08.039> be<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> very<00:02:08.610> successful<00:02:08.940> game

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
will actually be a very successful game

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.520 
will actually be a very successful game
the<00:02:10.619> first<00:02:10.890> reason<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.459> like<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.330> said<00:02:12.569> 343<00:02:13.379> has

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
the first reason is like I said 343 has

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.860 
the first reason is like I said 343 has
been<00:02:13.680> we're

industries I know they're not bungee and

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.640 
industries I know they're not bungee and
a<00:02:18.280> lot<00:02:18.459> of<00:02:18.489> people<00:02:18.730> base<00:02:19.120> their<00:02:19.500> argument<00:02:20.500> on

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
a lot of people base their argument on

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.250 
a lot of people base their argument on

because they knew bungee was going to be

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.259 
because they knew bungee was going to be
cutting<00:03:56.889> it<00:03:57.040> off<00:03:57.190> and<00:03:57.430> giving<00:03:57.699> all<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.060> rights

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
cutting it off and giving all the rights

cutting it off and giving all the rights
to<00:03:58.389> Microsoft<00:03:58.900> so<00:04:00.060> there<00:04:01.060> are<00:04:01.090> some<00:04:01.690> former

have one bullet my sniper but that's the
only<00:04:07.329> am<00:04:07.629> I<00:04:07.810> have<00:04:08.019> and<00:04:08.379> you<00:04:08.590> know<00:04:08.620> just<00:04:08.949> gotta

only am I have and you know just gotta
deal<00:04:10.030> with<00:04:10.180> what<00:04:10.359> I<00:04:10.389> gotta<00:04:10.629> do<00:04:10.870> so<00:04:11.139> um<00:04:12.810> yeah

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.390 
deal with what I gotta do so um yeah
that's<00:04:14.019> my<00:04:14.230> reason<00:04:14.709> well<00:04:14.829> that's<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.040> very<00:04:15.069> long

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
that's my reason well that's a very long

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.490 
that's my reason well that's a very long
reason<00:04:15.819> why<00:04:15.970> I<00:04:16.030> think<00:04:16.269> halo<00:04:16.780> 4<00:04:17.049> is<00:04:17.199> going<00:04:17.349> to<00:04:17.410> be

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
reason why I think halo 4 is going to be

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.569 
reason why I think halo 4 is going to be
successful<00:04:18.039> um<00:04:18.639> in<00:04:19.449> short<00:04:20.019> it's<00:04:20.260> because<00:04:20.680> 343

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
successful um in short it's because 343

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.550 
successful um in short it's because 343
they<00:04:21.969> care<00:04:22.240> about<00:04:22.450> the<00:04:22.690> game<00:04:22.840> as<00:04:23.140> much<00:04:23.380> as<00:04:23.530> a

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
they care about the game as much as a

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.590 
they care about the game as much as a
complete<00:04:23.950> community

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
complete community

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.910 
complete community
and<00:04:25.010> my<00:04:26.010> second<00:04:26.490> reason<00:04:26.670> why<00:04:27.540> halo<00:04:27.930> 4<00:04:28.260> isn't<00:04:28.710> is

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
and my second reason why halo 4 isn't is

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.640 
and my second reason why halo 4 isn't is
going<00:04:29.190> to<00:04:29.250> be<00:04:29.370> successful<00:04:29.670> is<00:04:30.090> because<00:04:30.470> it's<00:04:31.470> a

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
going to be successful is because it's a

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.980 
going to be successful is because it's a
halo<00:04:32.070> game<00:04:32.310> it's<00:04:33.090> it's<00:04:33.510> a<00:04:33.660> first<00:04:33.900> person

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
halo game it's it's a first person

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.620 
halo game it's it's a first person
shooter<00:04:34.320> I<00:04:34.860> mean<00:04:35.190> okay<00:04:35.760> so<00:04:35.820> think<00:04:36.300> about<00:04:36.390> this

different grenade trajectories all that
different<00:04:56.640> stuff<00:04:57.320> the<00:04:58.320> hardcore<00:04:58.800> halo<00:04:59.010> 3

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
different stuff the hardcore halo 3

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.730 
different stuff the hardcore halo 3
players<00:04:59.610> didn't<00:05:00.330> really<00:05:00.570> enjoy<00:05:00.690> it<00:05:01.080> and<00:05:01.200> a<00:05:01.470> lot

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.020 
of all these changes but I think 343 is
gonna<00:05:09.720> give<00:05:10.020> Havel<00:05:10.530> for<00:05:10.800> more<00:05:11.160> of<00:05:11.280> a<00:05:11.370> halo<00:05:11.580> 3

gonna give Havel for more of a halo 3

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.780 
gonna give Havel for more of a halo 3

of all the changes reach had made and
this<00:05:24.600> is<00:05:24.870> I'm<00:05:25.050> about<00:05:25.290> to<00:05:25.440> drop<00:05:25.560> some<00:05:25.680> halo

this is I'm about to drop some halo

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.640 
this is I'm about to drop some halo
logic<00:05:26.460> or<00:05:26.670> halo<00:05:26.940> theory<00:05:27.600> on<00:05:27.720> you<00:05:27.900> if<00:05:28.080> if<00:05:28.440> you

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
logic or halo theory on you if if you

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.430 
haven't read the book the fall of reach
I<00:05:32.790> believe<00:05:33.000> was<00:05:33.120> the<00:05:33.150> halo<00:05:33.420> first<00:05:33.960> halo<00:05:34.260> book

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
I believe was the halo first halo book

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.710 
I believe was the halo first halo book
that<00:05:34.590> came<00:05:34.740> out<00:05:34.890> it<00:05:35.460> discusses<00:05:35.970> the<00:05:36.330> different

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
that came out it discusses the different

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.900 
that came out it discusses the different
classes<00:05:37.470> of<00:05:37.500> Spartans<00:05:38.070> and<00:05:38.370> you<00:05:38.700> probably

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
classes of Spartans and you probably

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.880 
classes of Spartans and you probably
know<00:05:39.090> this<00:05:39.240> vet<00:05:39.480> in<00:05:39.690> halo<00:05:40.320> reach<00:05:40.530> there<00:05:40.770> are

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
know this vet in halo reach there are

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.560 
know this vet in halo reach there are
spartan<00:05:41.310> threes<00:05:41.670> which<00:05:42.030> are<00:05:42.180> a<00:05:42.210> different

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
spartan threes which are a different

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.570 
spartan threes which are a different
spartan<00:05:43.230> class<00:05:43.440> then<00:05:43.770> master<00:05:44.100> chief<00:05:44.340> was

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
spartan class then master chief was

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.710 
spartan class then master chief was
master<00:05:45.330> chief<00:05:45.480> was<00:05:45.630> a<00:05:45.660> spartan<00:05:46.050> too<00:05:46.430> and<00:05:47.720> the

master chief was a spartan too and the

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.690 
master chief was a spartan too and the
reason<00:05:49.200> Halo<00:05:49.530> Reach<00:05:49.560> is<00:05:49.770> this<00:05:50.250> different

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
reason Halo Reach is this different

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.310 
reason Halo Reach is this different
fields<00:05:51.000> because<00:05:51.240> it's<00:05:51.390> a<00:05:51.450> different<00:05:51.840> Spartan

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
fields because it's a different Spartan

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.400 
fields because it's a different Spartan
model<00:05:52.350> and<00:05:52.950> when<00:05:53.880> halo<00:05:54.240> 4<00:05:54.540> comes<00:05:54.900> out<00:05:55.110> it's

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
model and when halo 4 comes out it's

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.070 
model and when halo 4 comes out it's
gonna<00:05:55.710> be<00:05:55.890> master<00:05:56.550> chief<00:05:56.790> story<00:05:57.150> again<00:05:57.480> so

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
gonna be master chief story again so

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.740 
gonna be master chief story again so
they're<00:05:58.230> going<00:05:58.380> to<00:05:58.440> have<00:05:58.590> Spartan<00:05:59.070> tues<00:05:59.310> again

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
they're going to have Spartan tues again

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.130 
they're going to have Spartan tues again
so<00:06:01.040> in<00:06:02.040> theory<00:06:02.610> it<00:06:02.940> should<00:06:02.970> bring<00:06:03.600> back<00:06:03.630> the

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
so in theory it should bring back the

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.500 
so in theory it should bring back the
halo<00:06:04.470> 3<00:06:04.770> feel<00:06:05.040> which<00:06:05.580> I<00:06:05.730> think<00:06:06.060> will<00:06:06.210> bring

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
halo 3 feel which I think will bring

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.700 
halo 3 feel which I think will bring
back<00:06:06.780> a<00:06:06.810> lot<00:06:07.260> of<00:06:07.620> the<00:06:08.100> halo<00:06:08.280> 3<00:06:08.730> community<00:06:09.710> you

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
back a lot of the halo 3 community you

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.940 
back a lot of the halo 3 community you
know<00:06:10.740> at<00:06:10.980> one<00:06:11.190> point<00:06:11.450> in<00:06:12.450> Halo<00:06:12.930> 3<00:06:12.960> s<00:06:13.290> life<00:06:13.530> cycle

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
know at one point in Halo 3 s life cycle

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.370 
know at one point in Halo 3 s life cycle
there<00:06:14.460> were<00:06:14.550> what<00:06:14.790> a<00:06:15.030> million<00:06:15.780> to<00:06:15.900> two<00:06:16.080> million

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
there were what a million to two million

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.520 
there were what a million to two million
people<00:06:16.680> on<00:06:17.070> in<00:06:17.370> any<00:06:18.120> given<00:06:18.360> 24<00:06:19.050> hours<00:06:19.110> fan

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
people on in any given 24 hours fan

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.650 
people on in any given 24 hours fan
period<00:06:20.040> and<00:06:20.220> in<00:06:20.670> halo<00:06:20.940> reach<00:06:21.150> the<00:06:21.330> most<00:06:21.510> i've

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
period and in halo reach the most i've

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.980 
period and in halo reach the most i've
ever<00:06:21.690> seen<00:06:22.110> is<00:06:22.290> probably<00:06:23.390> 400,000<00:06:24.390> which<00:06:24.840> is

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
ever seen is probably 400,000 which is

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.510 
ever seen is probably 400,000 which is
significantly<00:06:25.560> less<00:06:25.770> if<00:06:26.010> you<00:06:26.100> think<00:06:26.280> about<00:06:26.340> it

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
significantly less if you think about it

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.020 
significantly less if you think about it
so<00:06:26.940> I<00:06:27.180> think<00:06:28.130> 343<00:06:29.130> knows<00:06:29.550> the<00:06:29.790> pressure

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
so I think 343 knows the pressure

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.070 
so I think 343 knows the pressure
they're<00:06:30.270> under<00:06:30.300> and<00:06:30.660> I<00:06:30.690> think<00:06:30.900> they're<00:06:30.990> going

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
they're under and I think they're going

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.900 
they're under and I think they're going
to<00:06:31.140> try<00:06:31.350> to<00:06:31.380> revitalize<00:06:32.010> the<00:06:32.250> halo<00:06:32.490> community

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
to try to revitalize the halo community

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.570 
to try to revitalize the halo community
so<00:06:33.300> those<00:06:34.140> are<00:06:34.169> my<00:06:34.380> thoughts<00:06:34.620> i<00:06:34.979> hope<00:06:35.040> you<00:06:35.460> guys
