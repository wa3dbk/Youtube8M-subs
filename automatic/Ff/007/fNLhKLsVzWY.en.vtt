00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.789
 Hollywood blockbusters know that 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.429
 movies like the tribute of panem curse 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.320

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.119
 in the web series men at arms weapons 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.160
 film and video game after the clou for 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.500
 film and television builds the dull and 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.239
 However harmless props are 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.920
 sure which is forged in the show 

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:31.920
 fully functional 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.560
 incredibly beautiful and processed 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.570
 refined imitations of weapons like the 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.710
 hidden blade from assassin's creed 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.179
 the hammer of tor 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.179
 and the sounds of wolverine 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.170
 then there are extremely large 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.520
 repertoire of swords and the whole 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.500
 is that his work on the individual 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.420
 detailed documentation and by 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.280
 it will definitely be explained to him a lot 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.260
 very cool web show and worth a look 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.420
 If you want to know more, you will find it 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.790
 left in the video description in the 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.620
 save be created I show you as you do 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.940
 you could be creative yourself and you can 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.870
 actually not only on the computer 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.880
 be creative 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.740
 it also goes outside this time 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.210
 her nothing more than a pen and 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.820
 endanger neither write nor 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.470
 we will make music with it 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.700
 Camping call themselves the whole and is 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.500
 the art is nothing more than one to me 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.000
 pen and a hard pad to 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.260
 to serve a table, for example 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.209
 but pence used it 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.580
 different parts of the pen as well 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.530
 her hands around different noises too 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.570
 generate a bit of exercise and one 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:49.450
 good sense of rhythm and at some point can 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:51.070
 Maybe something and the whole cash 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.330
 then rap in addition as for example 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.560
 the rapper little god 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.560
 that sounds like that 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.760
 so save that for a change 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.670
 internet gets some pens and 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.750
 the table and made area in the 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.730
 Last years are body modification 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.130
 year come quite in fashion again 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.680
 So piercing tattoos and others 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.450
 relatively disturbed fucking it can mine 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.190
 opinion after looking very nice 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.160
 but it can be pretty good too 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.320
 go back behind world at was again 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.540

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.820
 Some are funny others 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.280
 pretty borderline but almost everyone 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.410
 you will ask yourself who indulges yourself 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.620
