a hundred million to start with you know
you<00:02:04.229> can't<00:02:04.469> do<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:04.740> with<00:02:04.979> about<00:02:05.219> 5<00:02:05.520> million

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
you can't do this with about 5 million

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.029

over a billion try you know driving

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.290 
over a billion try you know driving
flipping<00:02:10.560> third<00:02:11.099> age<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.910> it's<00:02:12.090> actually

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
flipping third age and it's actually

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.760 
flipping third age and it's actually
quite<00:02:12.390> profitable<00:02:12.599> once<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.080> get<00:02:13.230> into<00:02:13.379> it

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
quite profitable once you get into it

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.320

but<00:02:13.980> obviously<00:02:14.070> starting<00:02:14.640> off<00:02:14.760> can<00:02:15.000> be<00:02:15.090> quite

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
but obviously starting off can be quite

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.820 
but obviously starting off can be quite
tricky<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:16.230> we're<00:02:16.320> going<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.530> start<00:02:16.560> off<00:02:16.770> by

bottom<00:03:05.970> is<00:03:06.180> there<00:03:06.390> 2<00:03:06.480> 42's<00:03:06.990> I'm<00:03:07.640> personally

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
bottom is there 2 42's I'm personally

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.550 
bottom is there 2 42's I'm personally
going<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.850> put<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.120> at<00:03:09.240> about<00:03:09.270> 40<00:03:09.780> 1.6<00:03:10.350> million

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
going to put it at about 40 1.6 million

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.470 
going to put it at about 40 1.6 million
just<00:03:10.800> as<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:10.950> safety<00:03:11.220> net<00:03:11.460> and<00:03:11.940> if<00:03:12.210> you've<00:03:12.300> never

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
just as a safety net and if you've never

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.390 
just as a safety net and if you've never
done<00:03:12.600> third<00:03:12.930> age<00:03:13.080> before<00:03:13.290> have<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.040> decent

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
done third age before have a decent

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.480 
done third age before have a decent
safety<00:03:15.090> net<00:03:15.270> so<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.020> price<00:03:16.230> for<00:03:16.680> example<00:03:17.160> is

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
safety net so the price for example is

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.230 
safety net so the price for example is
42<00:03:18.180> million<00:03:18.600> steel<00:03:19.550> put<00:03:20.550> it<00:03:20.640> out<00:03:20.730> maybe<00:03:20.880> 40

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
42 million steel put it out maybe 40

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.940 
42 million steel put it out maybe 40
1,000,000<00:03:21.630> just<00:03:21.959> as<00:03:22.080> a<00:03:22.110> little<00:03:22.410> safety<00:03:22.620> net

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
1,000,000 just as a little safety net

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.650 
1,000,000 just as a little safety net
and<00:03:23.130> then<00:03:23.490> when<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.700> go<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.850> sell<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.240> slightly

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
and then when you go to sell it slightly

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.810 
and then when you go to sell it slightly
below<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.140> last<00:03:25.380> sale<00:03:25.650> price<00:03:25.890> recorded<00:03:26.610> and

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
below the last sale price recorded and

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.600 
below the last sale price recorded and
or<00:03:27.810> just<00:03:27.840> like<00:03:28.709> look<00:03:28.890> for<00:03:29.040> about<00:03:29.190> 2<00:03:29.400> million

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
or just like look for about 2 million

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.280 
or just like look for about 2 million
profit<00:03:29.880> which<00:03:30.209> is<00:03:30.360> usually<00:03:30.660> really<00:03:30.990> possible

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
profit which is usually really possible

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.550 
profit which is usually really possible
and<00:03:31.770> you<00:03:32.520> just<00:03:32.640> go<00:03:32.760> from<00:03:32.940> there<00:03:33.380> don't<00:03:34.380> forget

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
and you just go from there don't forget

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.630 
and you just go from there don't forget
also<00:03:34.740> that<00:03:34.890> if<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.250> feel<00:03:35.459> more<00:03:35.490> comfortable

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
also that if you feel more comfortable

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.550 
also that if you feel more comfortable
looking<00:03:36.209> for<00:03:36.360> more<00:03:36.510> profit<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.080> can<00:03:37.290> do<00:03:37.440> that

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
looking for more profit you can do that

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.620 
looking for more profit you can do that
but<00:03:37.770> of<00:03:37.890> course<00:03:38.300> sometimes<00:03:39.300> you<00:03:39.390> can<00:03:39.510> take

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
but of course sometimes you can take

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.090 
but of course sometimes you can take
slightly<00:03:39.959> longer<00:03:40.080> sometimes<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:40.980> can<00:03:41.070> be

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
slightly longer sometimes it can be

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.660 
slightly longer sometimes it can be
shorter<00:03:41.790> time<00:03:42.000> it<00:03:42.270> really<00:03:42.810> does<00:03:43.020> depend<00:03:43.670> now

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
shorter time it really does depend now

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.890 
shorter time it really does depend now

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.640 
can make so much money with them which
is<00:06:19.580> why<00:06:19.789> you<00:06:20.450> might<00:06:20.810> want<00:06:20.840> to<00:06:21.289> think<00:06:21.530> about

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
is why you might want to think about

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.680 
is why you might want to think about
doing<00:06:21.950> these<00:06:22.100> items<00:06:22.280> in<00:06:22.520> the<00:06:22.610> future<00:06:22.910> so<00:06:23.510> just

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
doing these items in the future so just

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.270 
doing these items in the future so just
having<00:06:23.840> these<00:06:23.960> items<00:06:24.169> in<00:06:24.470> mind<00:06:24.650> or<00:06:24.800> so<00:06:25.070> it<00:06:25.160> can

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
having these items in mind or so it can

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.760 
having these items in mind or so it can
be<00:06:25.400> quite<00:06:25.610> a<00:06:25.669> benefit<00:06:26.260> but<00:06:27.260> going<00:06:27.410> back<00:06:27.560> to<00:06:27.680> the

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
be quite a benefit but going back to the

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.230 
be quite a benefit but going back to the
topic<00:06:27.979> of<00:06:28.280> what<00:06:28.430> happens<00:06:28.700> if<00:06:28.789> it<00:06:28.880> doesn't<00:06:28.910> buy

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
topic of what happens if it doesn't buy

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.270 
topic of what happens if it doesn't buy
or<00:06:29.539> what<00:06:29.660> happens<00:06:29.870> if<00:06:29.960> it<00:06:30.050> doesn't<00:06:30.080> sell<00:06:30.470> for

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
or what happens if it doesn't sell for

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.820 
or what happens if it doesn't sell for
example<00:06:31.669> for<00:06:32.030> the<00:06:32.090> third<00:06:32.419> age<00:06:32.720> range<00:06:33.500> top

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
example for the third age range top

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.130 
example for the third age range top
which<00:06:34.159> was<00:06:34.340> a<00:06:34.370> 33<00:06:34.789> million<00:06:35.150> if<00:06:35.539> it<00:06:35.780> doesn't<00:06:36.020> buy

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:36.140 
which was a 33 million if it doesn't buy

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.260 
which was a 33 million if it doesn't buy
after<00:06:36.650> ages<00:06:37.099> you<00:06:37.310> might<00:06:37.520> want<00:06:37.700> to<00:06:37.789> raise<00:06:37.909> it<00:06:38.060> so

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
after ages you might want to raise it so

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.110 
after ages you might want to raise it so
33<00:06:38.870> and<00:06:39.080> a<00:06:39.140> half<00:06:39.380> minute<00:06:39.770> or<00:06:39.890> is<00:06:40.010> it<00:06:40.160> 500<00:06:40.700> k<00:06:40.850> or

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 
33 and a half minute or is it 500 k or

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.060 
33 and a half minute or is it 500 k or
for<00:06:41.960> the<00:06:42.050> Third<00:06:42.260> Age<00:06:42.380> platebody<00:06:42.680> if<00:06:42.980> it

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.070 
for the Third Age platebody if it

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.300 
for the Third Age platebody if it
doesn't<00:06:43.280> buy<00:06:43.430> for<00:06:43.670> 358<00:06:44.330> million<00:06:44.600> after<00:06:44.900> like

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
doesn't buy for 358 million after like

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.250 
doesn't buy for 358 million after like
12<00:06:46.310> hours<00:06:46.670> to<00:06:46.760> 24<00:06:46.850> hours<00:06:47.360> you<00:06:47.780> might<00:06:48.020> want<00:06:48.230> to

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:48.260 
12 hours to 24 hours you might want to

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.040 
12 hours to 24 hours you might want to
raise<00:06:48.440> it<00:06:48.620> to<00:06:49.060> 359<00:06:50.060> million<00:06:50.270> just<00:06:50.570> 1<00:06:50.750> million

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050 
raise it to 359 million just 1 million

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.470 
raise it to 359 million just 1 million
so<00:06:51.560> those<00:06:51.770> kind<00:06:51.980> of<00:06:52.010> jumps<00:06:52.370> are<00:06:52.550> quite<00:06:53.210> common

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:53.480 
so those kind of jumps are quite common

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.570 
so those kind of jumps are quite common
and<00:06:53.990> if<00:06:54.170> it<00:06:54.260> doesn't<00:06:54.530> sell<00:06:54.680> the<00:06:54.920> same<00:06:55.160> goes<00:06:55.370> for

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
and if it doesn't sell the same goes for

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.910 
and if it doesn't sell the same goes for
that<00:06:55.760> you<00:06:56.300> know<00:06:56.390> just<00:06:56.570> drop<00:06:56.780> it<00:06:56.990> maybe<00:06:57.260> every

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:57.920 
that you know just drop it maybe every

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.270 
that you know just drop it maybe every
12<00:06:58.190> hours<00:06:58.340> and<00:06:59.150> these<00:06:59.300> are<00:06:59.360> long-term<00:07:00.280> flips

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 
12 hours and these are long-term flips

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.770 
12 hours and these are long-term flips
by<00:07:01.430> the<00:07:01.490> way<00:07:01.700> these<00:07:01.820> aren't<00:07:02.120> flips<00:07:02.450> you<00:07:02.510> do<00:07:02.660> in

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:02.780 
by the way these aren't flips you do in

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.720 
by the way these aren't flips you do in
like<00:07:02.930> 10<00:07:03.170> minutes<00:07:03.410> these<00:07:04.040> are<00:07:04.190> items<00:07:04.310> that<00:07:04.550> are

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:04.730 
like 10 minutes these are items that are

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.310 
like 10 minutes these are items that are
so<00:07:04.910> uncommon<00:07:05.330> that<00:07:05.660> sometimes<00:07:06.080> you<00:07:06.170> can't

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:06.320 
so uncommon that sometimes you can't

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.920 
so uncommon that sometimes you can't
wait<00:07:06.470> 24<00:07:07.220> hours<00:07:07.280> to<00:07:07.550> sail<00:07:07.730> for<00:07:08.420> the<00:07:08.480> druidic

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:08.930 
wait 24 hours to sail for the druidic

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.500 
wait 24 hours to sail for the druidic
items<00:07:09.320> i<00:07:09.560> have<00:07:09.770> had<00:07:10.400> flips<00:07:10.730> that<00:07:10.850> take<00:07:11.000> 36

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:11.510 
items i have had flips that take 36

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.080 
items i have had flips that take 36
hours<00:07:11.840> but<00:07:12.440> I<00:07:12.710> was<00:07:13.010> getting<00:07:13.100> 10<00:07:13.430> million<00:07:13.790> flips

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:14.090 
hours but I was getting 10 million flips

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.180 
hours but I was getting 10 million flips
so<00:07:14.540> those<00:07:14.750> kind<00:07:14.990> of<00:07:15.050> things<00:07:15.440> are<00:07:15.830> what<00:07:16.100> you

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:16.190 
so those kind of things are what you

so those kind of things are what you
would<00:07:16.310> waiting<00:07:16.700> for<00:07:16.910> what<00:07:17.600> you<00:07:17.780> would<00:07:18.020> be
