in this one I figured I would just do a
good<00:00:22.439> old-fashioned<00:00:23.100> unboxing<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.210> show<00:00:24.359> you

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
good old-fashioned unboxing and show you

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.050 
good old-fashioned unboxing and show you

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
like normal and it's just kind of hard

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.209 
like normal and it's just kind of hard
plastic<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:58.170> not<00:01:58.350> quite<00:01:58.560> as<00:01:58.710> nice<00:01:58.890> as<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
plastic it's not quite as nice as the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.749 
plastic it's not quite as nice as the
other<00:02:00.140> you<00:02:01.140> know<00:02:01.229> Nokia<00:02:01.649> Lumia<00:02:01.799> devices<00:02:02.219> etc

other you know Nokia Lumia devices etc

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.630 
other you know Nokia Lumia devices etc
but<00:02:02.909> it's<00:02:03.240> similar<00:02:04.229> concept<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.460> does

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
but it's similar concept but it does

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.109 
but it's similar concept but it does
peel<00:02:06.210> off<00:02:06.740> like<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:08.940> how<00:02:09.060> you

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
peel off like this and this is how you

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.760 
peel off like this and this is how you
