hello gauche guys and gals today we're
going<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.060> talk<00:00:03.240> about<00:00:03.389> image<00:00:03.990> transfers<00:00:04.620> by

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
going to talk about image transfers by

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.249 
going to talk about image transfers by
way<00:00:05.310> of<00:00:05.580> creating<00:00:06.120> an<00:00:06.240> acrylic<00:00:06.509> skin<00:00:06.930> it's

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
way of creating an acrylic skin it's

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.500 
way of creating an acrylic skin it's
really<00:00:07.589> easy<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:07.919> do<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.400> very<00:00:08.510> effective

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
really easy to do and very effective

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.440 
really easy to do and very effective
when<00:00:09.719> done<00:00:09.750> right<00:00:10.080> so<00:00:10.530> let's<00:00:10.710> get<00:00:10.830> started

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
when done right so let's get started

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.879 
when done right so let's get started
start<00:00:12.450> by<00:00:12.690> gathering<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.290> image<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:13.799> you

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
start by gathering the image that you

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.099 
start by gathering the image that you
want<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.250> transfer<00:00:14.790> I've<00:00:15.389> decided<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.929> use

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
want to transfer I've decided to use

taken it down to my local copy store and

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.439 
taken it down to my local copy store and
made<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.890> couple<00:00:20.130> copies<00:00:20.550> one<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:20.939> color<00:00:21.150> and

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449

made a couple copies one in color and
one<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.750> black<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.080> white<00:00:22.279> you<00:00:23.279> will<00:00:23.460> want<00:00:23.730> to

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
one in black and white you will want to

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.609 
one in black and white you will want to
use<00:00:23.939> Xerox<00:00:24.539> copies<00:00:24.930> for<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.230> technique

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
use Xerox copies for this technique

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.960 
use Xerox copies for this technique
you're<00:00:25.830> going<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.039> get<00:00:26.189> better<00:00:26.340> results<00:00:26.849> in

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
you're going to get better results in

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.330 
you're going to get better results in
the<00:00:27.000> long<00:00:27.210> run<00:00:27.420> now<00:00:28.349> I'm<00:00:28.529> going<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.980> apply<00:00:29.250> some

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
the long run now I'm going to apply some

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.609 
the long run now I'm going to apply some
matte<00:00:29.849> medium<00:00:30.090> all<00:00:30.510> over<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> entire<00:00:30.929> image

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
matte medium all over the entire image

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.490 
matte medium all over the entire image
as<00:00:32.300> I'm<00:00:33.300> doing<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.750> you'll<00:00:33.960> notice<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.380> I'm

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
as I'm doing this you'll notice that I'm

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.130 
as I'm doing this you'll notice that I'm
using<00:00:34.530> only<00:00:35.130> vertical<00:00:35.790> brush<00:00:36.090> strokes<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.719> want

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
using only vertical brush strokes I want

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.840 
using only vertical brush strokes I want
to<00:00:37.230> try<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.440> keep<00:00:37.620> my<00:00:37.770> brush<00:00:38.129> strokes<00:00:38.219> going<00:00:38.730> in

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
to try to keep my brush strokes going in

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.310 
to try to keep my brush strokes going in
just<00:00:39.000> one<00:00:39.270> direction<00:00:39.450> for<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.050> first

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
just one direction for this first

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.310 
just one direction for this first
application<00:00:40.940> when<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.120> layer<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.660> medium<00:00:43.170> is

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
application when that layer of medium is

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.220 
application when that layer of medium is
completely<00:00:44.250> dry<00:00:44.550> I'm<00:00:44.969> going<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.570> add<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.719> second

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
completely dry I'm going to add a second

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.290 
completely dry I'm going to add a second
layer<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.460> time<00:00:47.730> my<00:00:47.969> brush<00:00:48.210> strokes

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
layer but this time my brush strokes

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.410 
layer but this time my brush strokes
will<00:00:48.719> go<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.140> horizontal<00:00:49.500> direction<00:00:50.420> what

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
will go in a horizontal direction what

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.639 
will go in a horizontal direction what
we're<00:00:51.539> doing<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.960> we're<00:00:52.110> trying<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.530> add

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
we're doing is we're trying to add

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.310 
we're doing is we're trying to add
strength<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.789> our<00:00:53.820> image<00:00:54.300> as<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.840> build<00:00:55.050> up<00:00:55.170> our

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
strength to our image as we build up our

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:04.399 
strength to our image as we build up our
layers<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.770> medium

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.960 

when<00:01:05.409> that<00:01:05.560> layer<00:01:05.860> is<00:01:05.979> dry<00:01:06.220> then<00:01:06.700> we're<00:01:06.850> going

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
when that layer is dry then we're going

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.149 
when that layer is dry then we're going
to<00:01:07.030> add<00:01:07.180> a<00:01:07.420> third<00:01:07.450> layer<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:08.409> this<00:01:08.650> time<00:01:08.920> we're

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
to add a third layer and this time we're

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.789 
to add a third layer and this time we're
going<00:01:09.310> to<00:01:09.400> go<00:01:09.640> back<00:01:09.820> to<00:01:10.090> our<00:01:10.119> original

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
going to go back to our original

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.859 
going to go back to our original
vertical<00:01:11.799> brushstrokes<00:01:12.630> with<00:01:13.630> each

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
vertical brushstrokes with each

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.690 
vertical brushstrokes with each
additional<00:01:14.350> layer<00:01:14.560> that<00:01:14.740> we<00:01:14.860> apply<00:01:15.340> we're

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
additional layer that we apply we're

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.760 
additional layer that we apply we're
going<00:01:15.909> to<00:01:16.060> want<00:01:16.240> to<00:01:16.299> alternate<00:01:16.840> our<00:01:17.259> brush

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
going to want to alternate our brush

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.370 
going to want to alternate our brush
strokes<00:01:18.040> vertical<00:01:18.549> and<00:01:18.729> horizontal<00:01:18.759> I<00:01:19.630> would

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
strokes vertical and horizontal I would

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.770 
strokes vertical and horizontal I would
say<00:01:20.619> that<00:01:20.920> you<00:01:21.040> should<00:01:21.280> shoot<00:01:21.460> for<00:01:21.780> somewhere

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
say that you should shoot for somewhere

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.830 
say that you should shoot for somewhere
between<00:01:22.930> 4<00:01:23.409> &amp;<00:01:23.649> 6<00:01:23.729> applications<00:01:24.729> of<00:01:24.970> medium

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
between 4 &amp; 6 applications of medium

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.899 
between 4 &amp; 6 applications of medium
when<00:01:26.530> you're<00:01:26.649> done<00:01:26.860> adding<00:01:27.340> all<00:01:27.549> of<00:01:27.759> your

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
when you're done adding all of your

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.670 
when you're done adding all of your
medium<00:01:28.270> and<00:01:28.420> you've<00:01:28.600> allowed<00:01:28.899> it<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.380> dry

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
medium and you've allowed it to dry

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.219 
medium and you've allowed it to dry
completely<00:01:30.310> overnight<00:01:31.060> is<00:01:31.360> perfect<00:01:31.930> for<00:01:32.110> this

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
completely overnight is perfect for this

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.080 
completely overnight is perfect for this
then<00:01:32.890> you're<00:01:33.100> going<00:01:33.220> to<00:01:33.310> want<00:01:33.460> to<00:01:33.550> soak<00:01:33.820> your

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
then you're going to want to soak your

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.749 
then you're going to want to soak your
image<00:01:34.360> in<00:01:34.570> a<00:01:34.630> water<00:01:34.840> bath<00:01:35.020> for<00:01:35.320> about<00:01:35.440> 10<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.610> 15

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.790 
image in a water bath for about 10 to 15
minutes<00:01:37.179> this<00:01:37.810> is<00:01:37.990> going<00:01:38.170> to<00:01:38.229> soften<00:01:38.470> the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
minutes this is going to soften the

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.889 
minutes this is going to soften the
fibers<00:01:38.979> of<00:01:39.220> your<00:01:39.399> paper<00:01:39.759> and<00:01:40.119> allow<00:01:40.720> you<00:01:40.780> to

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
fibers of your paper and allow you to

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:52.920 
fibers of your paper and allow you to
remove<00:01:41.229> it<00:01:41.530> a<00:01:41.590> little<00:01:41.979> bit<00:01:42.100> easier

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.210 

after<00:01:53.930> letting<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.320> soak<00:01:54.560> for<00:01:54.800> a<00:01:54.890> bit<00:01:55.040> you're

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
after letting it soak for a bit you're

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.800 
after letting it soak for a bit you're
going<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.790> pull<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:56.180> out<00:01:56.300> of<00:01:56.330> the<00:01:56.450> water<00:01:56.630> bath

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
going to pull it out of the water bath

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.480
