00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:12.500
 m4 a4 and m41 s are practically two 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.809
 identical weapons which differ 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.570
 let's just say so muffler but really 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.970
 practice practice this weapon uses in 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.769
 different situations and many users 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.019
 looking for information on the Internet about 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.269
 how are they different and what is better for me 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.240
 dress in inventory but really 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.369
 finds information because it exists 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.720
 Only the opinion of people is correct 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.640
 use these weapons in which 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.250
 situations and so we can only 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.800
 listen to the opinion of these people what is the best 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.730
 weapon pick up colt m4 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.540
 and one with a silencer or colt m4 a4 without 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.700
 muffler 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.910
 it's up to you, let's listen 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.980
 opinion of our analysts slime streamers 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.990
 and strike strike team 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.690
 continues to pursue the style of play quiet 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.390
 the killer everyone takes cards with M41 listeners 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.380
 place 441 player by the way does not play on m44 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.239
 razer saw prick and here na'vi has players 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.570
 who use exactly four but 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.240
 it is a matter of taste in my opinion you do well on 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.159
 Lady Joe they are equal but here get 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.579
 in terms of long distance rural 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.409
 easier than 4 acute broth g 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:22.009
 she has fewer rounds 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:25.640
 you make a choice went 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:28.219
 veterans flood then your choice m44 you 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.920
 exactly shoot you definitely need 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:32.689
 m41 with the note of the swedes for example such a tandem 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.719
 but who plays on was the same where 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.789
 drive often takes m44 all pinching 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.459
 players take four and 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.740
 lawsuits do not buy except foresta let's 

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:45.020
 let's talk about them in order 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.060
 if you touch the accuracy you can just 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.060
 look at the spray pattern 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.820
 If you look at the picture you can 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.369
 draw such a conclusion that 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.590
 m44 which we are holding now 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.570
 the spray goes a little higher that is 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.760
 and more ammo and naturally recoil 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.470
 goes more now let's look at 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.470
 tapping of these two weapons 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.470
 if you look at these two tepping 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.450
 weapons you can do this 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.340
 trapping is almost the same 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.920
 shooting accuracy is the same for these 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.659
 two weapons when firing one two 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.360
 spray cartridge to this a little bit 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:40.549
 applies since ammo at m44 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.489
 more so the spray drawing goes 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:46.040
 a little bit higher if you are a fan of 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.959
 little dots and you know what you 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.940
 stand still or anywhere on 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.879
 newbies you can take two by 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.819
 three people, then of course you better take 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.170
 colt m4 a4 because he has a trite 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.930
 just more ammo 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.720
 30 rounds of shot far more a 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.620
 more precisely 30 percent more than that 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.659
 cant m41 s in practice we know what 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.720
 if we occupy small points in 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:14.930
 stops then colt m4 1c can sometimes us 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.209
 let him down but he has a plus he has 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.489
 a silencer who silences him 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.530
 shots and in the meantime when you 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.870
 shoot at the enemy he doesn't know 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.549
 where you specifically shoot of course 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.560
 there is a way to laugh small points 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.280
 a little from afar to 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.959
 gain time for any recharge 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.579
 if you are a fan of keeping big points and 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.200
 you know that in between 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.150
 shooting you will have plenty of time 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.440
 to recharge better of course 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.450
 hold these points with ring m41 s here 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.250
 will be a big plus not only that you 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.650
 there is a silencer so still you will have time 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.090
 recharge and 20 rounds will not interfere 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.239
 to make a lot of cons 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.109
 what is the use of a muffler on this 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.329
 the ring 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.250
 if the opponent for example goes from pit to 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.859
 big point and he knows that there are many 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.810
 places where the enemy may be located 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:04.160
 Well, for example, we are the enemy 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.049
 settle down somewhere here 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.329
 if we kill pro if we kill 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.199
 opponent then he will not immediately understand where 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.569
 he was killed 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:14.000
 he will not be able to give the correct info 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.039
 teammates where the enemy is located on 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.010
 this point there is an advantage 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:21.349
 muffler on here is obvious but what 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.940
 do with twenty rounds to 20 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.970
 ammo the more you know what you have 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.460
 stock up 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.470
 40 and this is a little you have to choose 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.000
 tactically correct position in order 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.550
 so you have time 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.500
 recharge somewhere to hide and 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.300
 your opponent didnâ€™t kill you 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.610
 recharge because it's over no 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.040
 very interestingly says strike 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.300
 what if you're a fan of flooding 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.970
 and then you certainly fit more 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.920
 m44 you take somewhere in position 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.200
 coming out opponent you just start 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.750
 shoot your thirty patrons you 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.270
 make important -3 and your ally 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.430
 it is easier to knock out a point of everything 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.830
 only two opponents you push 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.380
 start button playing matchmaking on 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.950
 the game is located and you enter the series by 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.080
 ways 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.850
 warm up you understand that all opponents 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.860
 taken apart a certain point and you 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.860
 it remains to keep only point a 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.610
 but you have m4 a4 in your hand and you want 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.740
 change to colt m4 and one of silencer 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.960
 the one with the silencer and keep a big point 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.060
 it is with a silencer what to do is not 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.830
 the problem is you just go to the menu 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.960
 press escape button here 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.880
 inventory during the warm-up you can 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.940
 click inventory and right here for these 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.650
 warm up seconds change your colt to 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.110
 the one you need there in the same 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.060
 case you kept. do you want 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.100
 hold point b you just go in 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.240
 inventory and silencer rearranged to 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.400
 m44 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.840
 and the problem is solved well, and finally I will say 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:51.090
 that m44 and a one of this matter of taste 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.400
 how much do you like clamps how much 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.510
 you love the sound of shooting therefore 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.180
 choose a weapon 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.950
 put on large points of silencer on 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.950
 small points im fours and 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:05.419
 maybe it will be your further 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.419
 game tactics all good luck 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.810
 Well, will lead 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.850
 a great example of when did the sight and 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.610
 angle as call of duty 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:17.130
 it became much less to take because 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:20.190
 and the sound of shooting is different and the sight is different 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.860
 that is, the sound of shooting and the appearance of the weapon 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.560
 In principle, we are given some understanding of 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:29.190
 how to shoot from it and whether it is good 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.620
 shoots therefore appearance m44 she here 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:35.340
 so rough 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:37.830
 m41 s it is more elegant therefore it is possible 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:41.210
 and this parameter somehow affects some 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.210
 players on theirs shooting
