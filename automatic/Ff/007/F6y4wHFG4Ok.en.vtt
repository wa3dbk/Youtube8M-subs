or whatever our parent was set to or
make<00:01:49.400> it<00:01:49.490> auto<00:01:50.320> which<00:01:51.320> is<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.650> default<00:01:51.830> value

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
make it auto which is the default value

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.370 
make it auto which is the default value
we<00:01:53.360> can<00:01:53.390> do<00:01:53.660> crosshair<00:01:54.880> default<00:01:56.170> okay<00:01:57.170> and

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
we can do crosshair default okay and

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.250 
we can do crosshair default okay and
pointer<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:01.280> there<00:02:01.520> are<00:02:01.640> a<00:02:01.700> lot<00:02:01.940> more<00:02:01.990> which<00:02:02.990> I

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
pointer and there are a lot more which I

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.320 
pointer and there are a lot more which I
don't<00:02:03.410> usually<00:02:04.370> use<00:02:04.880> okay<00:02:07.179> what<00:02:08.179> I've<00:02:08.300> used

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
don't usually use okay what I've used

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.649 
don't usually use okay what I've used
the<00:02:08.869> most<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.640> changing<00:02:10.640> between<00:02:10.879> default<00:02:11.480> and

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:11.659 
the most is changing between default and

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.380 
the most is changing between default and
pointer<00:02:12.109> so<00:02:13.040> we<00:02:13.400> know<00:02:13.579> that<00:02:13.609> if<00:02:13.969> you<00:02:14.150> mouse

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
pointer so we know that if you mouse

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.290 
pointer so we know that if you mouse
over

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300
