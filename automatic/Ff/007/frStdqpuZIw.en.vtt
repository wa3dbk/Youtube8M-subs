00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.260
 hello and welcome to the next episode 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.900
 by juve keeper from rheinhessen today 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.090
 with a chili con carne from the dock 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.650
 and with horse meat is 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.449
 Maybe not everyone's thing though 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.860
 maybe you have the video of the 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.780
 I see horses before citizens 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.120
 get some horse meat some time 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.140
 myself wanted and of that I have now 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.059
 a bit more mince over 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.360
 We make chili con carne out of it today 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.590
 of course, with homemade chips 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.390
 and whatever else you need that 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.610
 I show you now here are now 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.489
 ingredients for the chili con carne need 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.040
 Let's start with three cans of kidney beans 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.280
 three cans tomato character a blackboard 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.570
 then chocolate a tube tomato mark 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.780
 I mean here of a certain one 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.190
 schuhbeck spice chili con carne vale 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.810
 second formula therefore something together 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.180
 then I mix here from my own 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.210
 harvest case latest news and see 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.590
 they have all these tears 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.290
 that means they are really mature 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.270
 then i have searchstorage here something 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.240
 also from own cultivation in each case three 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.770
 three chili probably like that 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.219
 take three to four of the titles 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.789
 a bit of salt olive oil and here 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:44.640

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:48.210
 Minced meat that is on the whole in the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.369

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.729
 place on 9 come down 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.929
 the rest comes up and that will 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.280
 certainly a delicious one 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.679
 now will go and start 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.600
 shake and then we keep it up 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.670
 the preparations are completed 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.759
 here are the scotiabank pepper 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.729
 then we have the paprika campaign here 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.649
 I simply have the goals in such a way 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.000
 cut strips and come now 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.900
 the coals under the dokter right 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.640

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.569
 to july wants to and then advise that 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.569
 That was a bit on 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:31.400
 so i am now under the village and the 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.400
 is now warming relatively quickly 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:38.610
 if I have a good one now 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.129
 Charge olive oil in the pot 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.299
 let the job now comes slowly 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:48.349
 on tours and I'm trying now 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.349
 first the whole paprika 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.980
 and that will be nice for now 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.380
 steamed so now where the peppers and 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.280
 felix a bit of a deal is coming too 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:21.560
 with departure a bit with 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:22.730
 steamed stewed that I want 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.090
 now only to order this 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:32.260
 meat can fry so the doctor 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.260
 and now here comes the meat 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:44.220
 that's going to be right around 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:45.870
 seared so plan is ready 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.810
 fried and now comes from here 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.320
 I take this spicy chili con carne 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.300
 now two whole tablespoons usually 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.720
 here is half a teaspoon per 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:01.080
 portion 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.780
 but that that would be a bit 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.740
 what if I come with the 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.740
 thank you 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.989
 one smells this spice from alfons 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.340
 Schuhbeck is very interest-bearing 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.340
 I'm curious how it will be at the end 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:35.100
 comes next now that this I 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.170
 had previously forgotten something she did 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:43.350
 now dry a good sip 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:48.300
 red wine with good glass maybe 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:52.710
 Also on file glasses and then come 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.150
 now the can tomatoes with it and 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:05:01.950
 then I have three dom the three here 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:05.550
 Canned kidney beans poured down the whole 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:09.200
 Now it was nice to stir 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.200
 on top of it a bit more tomatenmark 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:20.199
 would say so three tablespoons or 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.770
 the tour was started I am doing now 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.939
 something empty 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.110
 That's about three quarters 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:28.300
 tube tomatenmark it all that 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.379
 I mix one more now 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.400
 panel said polar winter off 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:35.710
 That may sound at first 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.069
 a bit strange at first but believes 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:47.740
 Her conclusion of the chocolate is complete 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:49.569
 beautiful it makes the need has 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:59.949
 from proper state collage 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:06:01.629
 convinced so now but cover it now 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:03.580
 Let's wait for an hour and then 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:11.620
 we'll see after the push or 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:16.800
 Chilli is now available as hours in the village 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.800
 the lid it loosens down 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:31.889
 and it 's not really that good but that 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:34.370
 As I see it, it would be a gardener 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.370
 tried 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:59.199
 so it is definitely known 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.580
 It is also supposed to be that way longer 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:03.520
 long that you are not in it 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.169
 it is eaten so they look fit in the 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.249
 to do a job is really total 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:07.810
 simple if that still with 

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:11.050
 horse meat is or with cattle be it 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:12.249
 times not care two are times 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.120
 I wish you much fun 

00:07:12.249 --> 00:07:16.770
 when copying 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.770
 until next time juba juba
