turn it on and off but if you turn it
too<00:01:18.270> far<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:19.110> would<00:01:19.229> open<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:19.799> you're<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.070> the

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
off but you can easily see how if you

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.449 
off but you can easily see how if you
had<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.540> near<00:02:29.690> your<00:02:29.870> hair<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.739> hair<00:02:30.950> can<00:02:31.160> go<00:02:31.310> in

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
and get wrapped around a propeller that

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.320 
and get wrapped around a propeller that
would<00:02:32.870> probably<00:02:33.080> be<00:02:33.349> painful<00:02:34.220> we<00:02:35.120> haven't

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
would probably be painful we haven't

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.490 
would probably be painful we haven't
quite<00:02:35.420> figured<00:02:35.660> out<00:02:35.810> how<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:35.930> open<00:02:36.049> it<00:02:36.260> yet<00:02:36.410> and

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
quite figured out how to open it yet and

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.640 
quite figured out how to open it yet and
then<00:02:36.590> show<00:02:36.799> that<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:38.410> skullcap<00:02:39.410> like

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
then show that the the skullcap like

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.650 
then show that the the skullcap like
Darth<00:02:39.890> Vader<00:02:39.950> had<00:02:40.519> it's<00:02:41.180> got<00:02:41.330> to<00:02:41.420> be<00:02:41.480> right

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
Darth Vader had it's got to be right

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.750 
Darth Vader had it's got to be right
there<00:02:41.870> sort<00:02:42.170> of<00:02:42.260> being<00:02:42.709> focus<00:02:43.069> together<00:02:43.340> okay

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
there sort of being focus together okay

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.670 
there sort of being focus together okay
if<00:02:44.360> you<00:02:44.450> remember<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:44.720> Darth<00:02:44.959> Vader<00:02:45.049> could<00:02:45.500> take

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
if you remember a Darth Vader could take

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.110 
if you remember a Darth Vader could take
the<00:02:45.799> helmet<00:02:46.099> off<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.280> there<00:02:46.549> was<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.760> brain

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
the helmet off and there was the brain

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.860 
the helmet off and there was the brain
inside<00:02:47.630> well<00:02:48.110> it's<00:02:48.349> kind<00:02:48.620> of<00:02:48.709> like<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:49.099> here

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
inside well it's kind of like that here

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.289 
inside well it's kind of like that here
um<00:02:51.280> we'll<00:02:52.280> figure<00:02:52.310> this<00:02:52.790> out<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.180> then

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
um we'll figure this out and then

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.160 
um we'll figure this out and then
explain<00:02:53.660> it<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.810> you

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
explain it to you

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.809 
explain it to you
turns<00:02:54.470> out<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.799> design<00:02:55.099> of<00:02:55.340> this<00:02:55.459> little

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
turns out the design of this little

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.400 
turns out the design of this little
fishies<00:02:56.209> is<00:02:56.390> a<00:02:56.420> little<00:02:56.750> different<00:02:57.110> instead<00:02:57.200> of

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
fishies is a little different instead of

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.110 
fishies is a little different instead of
simply<00:02:57.680> twisting<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.280> to<00:02:58.310> open<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:58.819> up<00:02:58.910> and

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
simply twisting it to open it up and

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.369 
simply twisting it to open it up and
access<00:02:59.569> where<00:02:59.810> you<00:02:59.930> can<00:03:00.079> put<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.319> the

access where you can put in the
batteries<00:03:00.709> this<00:03:00.860> one<00:03:01.129> you<00:03:01.340> actually<00:03:01.700> have<00:03:01.819> to

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
batteries this one you actually have to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.569 
batteries this one you actually have to
undo<00:03:02.269> a<00:03:02.299> couple<00:03:02.390> screws<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.200> take<00:03:03.379> that<00:03:03.620> Darth

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
undo a couple screws and take that Darth

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.119 
undo a couple screws and take that Darth
Vader<00:03:04.670> brain<00:03:05.390> off<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.410> then<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.739> battery<00:03:07.069> is

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
the battery will last a while too

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.900 
the battery will last a while too
because<00:05:17.720> the<00:05:17.960> the<00:05:18.320> motor<00:05:18.500> and<00:05:18.920> the<00:05:19.190> propeller

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
because the the motor and the propeller

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:20.800 
because the the motor and the propeller
don't<00:05:20.120> go<00:05:20.240> all<00:05:20.390> the<00:05:20.570> time

don't go all the time

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.080 
don't go all the time

mentioning<00:05:33.050> is<00:05:33.590> I<00:05:34.100> think<00:05:34.160> the<00:05:34.400> battery<00:05:34.730> will

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
mentioning is I think the battery will

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.910 
mentioning is I think the battery will
last<00:05:34.880> a<00:05:35.270> while<00:05:35.300> because<00:05:35.810> the<00:05:36.080> motors<00:05:36.740> not

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:36.920 
last a while because the motors not

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.550 
last a while because the motors not
going<00:05:37.190> continuously<00:05:37.790> however<00:05:38.420> I<00:05:38.780> think<00:05:39.290> it

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
going continuously however I think it

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.470 
going continuously however I think it
keeps<00:05:39.710> going<00:05:40.130> until<00:05:40.250> you<00:05:40.520> turn<00:05:40.700> it<00:05:40.850> off<00:05:41.000> or<00:05:41.270> the

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
keeps going until you turn it off or the

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.360 
keeps going until you turn it off or the
batteries<00:05:41.870> die<00:05:42.050> so<00:05:42.350> if<00:05:42.470> you<00:05:42.560> leave<00:05:42.830> it<00:05:43.040> out<00:05:43.160> in

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
batteries die so if you leave it out in

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.890 
batteries die so if you leave it out in
the<00:05:43.460> pool<00:05:43.640> it's<00:05:44.210> just<00:05:44.420> going<00:05:44.540> to<00:05:44.630> keep<00:05:44.750> going

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
the pool it's just going to keep going

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.480 
the pool it's just going to keep going
all<00:05:45.170> night<00:05:45.350> until<00:05:45.680> the<00:05:45.770> batteries<00:05:46.130> wear<00:05:46.310> out

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
all night until the batteries wear out

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.090 
all night until the batteries wear out
the<00:05:46.940> thing<00:05:47.240> with<00:05:47.390> the<00:05:47.570> Robo<00:05:48.350> fish<00:05:48.560> remember<00:05:48.980> is

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
the thing with the Robo fish remember is

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.860 
the thing with the Robo fish remember is
after<00:05:49.400> four<00:05:49.640> minutes<00:05:49.970> it<00:05:50.090> shuts<00:05:50.330> off<00:05:50.480> and<00:05:50.780> then

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
after four minutes it shuts off and then

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.230 
after four minutes it shuts off and then
you've<00:05:51.050> got<00:05:51.200> to<00:05:51.350> dry<00:05:52.100> it<00:05:52.160> off<00:05:52.400> a<00:05:52.430> little<00:05:52.700> put

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
you've got to dry it off a little put

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.610 
you've got to dry it off a little put
back<00:05:53.420> in<00:05:53.630> and<00:05:53.780> it<00:05:53.900> swims<00:05:54.110> around<00:05:54.410> for<00:05:54.560> another

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
back in and it swims around for another

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.020 
back in and it swims around for another
four<00:05:54.920> minutes<00:05:55.070> so<00:05:55.310> the<00:05:55.400> batteries<00:05:55.730> won't<00:05:55.940> go

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
four minutes so the batteries won't go

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.520 
four minutes so the batteries won't go
out<00:05:56.150> as<00:05:56.300> fast<00:05:56.450> on<00:05:56.750> that<00:05:56.900> what<00:05:57.140> did<00:05:57.230> you<00:05:57.290> want<00:05:57.470> to

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
water toy I have like ever seen it's

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.140 
water toy I have like ever seen it's

like the best toy of the rubber fish and

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.000 
like the best toy of the rubber fish and
little<00:06:05.390> fishies<00:06:05.900> in<00:06:06.170> your<00:06:06.470> that<00:06:06.590> impressed

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
little fishies in your that impressed

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.610 
little fishies in your that impressed
yeah<00:06:07.570> and<00:06:08.570> we<00:06:08.780> realize<00:06:09.140> you're<00:06:09.350> really<00:06:09.530> not

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
yeah and we realize you're really not

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.140 
yeah and we realize you're really not
getting<00:06:09.770> the<00:06:09.980> full<00:06:10.160> effect<00:06:10.340> of<00:06:10.730> it<00:06:10.850> here<00:06:11.060> in

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
getting the full effect of it here in

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.880 
getting the full effect of it here in
this<00:06:11.270> small<00:06:11.450> container<00:06:11.840> because<00:06:12.380> I<00:06:12.410> think<00:06:12.560> it

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
this small container because I think it

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.590 
this small container because I think it
would<00:06:13.010> drop<00:06:13.190> down<00:06:13.460> further<00:06:13.790> in<00:06:14.030> the<00:06:14.060> pool<00:06:14.300> it

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
would drop down further in the pool it

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.060 
would drop down further in the pool it
would<00:06:14.720> probably<00:06:14.840> go<00:06:15.050> down<00:06:15.200> further<00:06:15.560> and<00:06:15.890> it

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
would probably go down further and it

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.470 
would probably go down further and it
does<00:06:16.250> go<00:06:16.460> to<00:06:16.610> a<00:06:16.640> side<00:06:16.850> because<00:06:17.060> before<00:06:17.330> it

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
does go to a side because before it

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.820 
does go to a side because before it
started<00:06:17.720> to<00:06:17.810> feel<00:06:17.960> like<00:06:17.990> it<00:06:18.230> looked<00:06:18.530> like<00:06:18.680> it's

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
started to feel like it looked like it's

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.620 
started to feel like it looked like it's
lay<00:06:18.950> down<00:06:19.190> but<00:06:19.400> I<00:06:19.430> kept<00:06:19.640> trying<00:06:19.850> to<00:06:20.030> go<00:06:20.180> so<00:06:20.420> it's

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
lay down but I kept trying to go so it's

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.930 
lay down but I kept trying to go so it's
like<00:06:20.810> just<00:06:21.110> like<00:06:21.290> a<00:06:21.350> jellyfish<00:06:21.920> and<00:06:22.190> it<00:06:22.730> would

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
like just like a jellyfish and it would

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.610 
like just like a jellyfish and it would
move<00:06:23.090> around<00:06:23.360> the<00:06:23.570> pool<00:06:23.750> so<00:06:24.140> and<00:06:24.410> we'll<00:06:24.530> be

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
move around the pool so and we'll be

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.720 
move around the pool so and we'll be
trying<00:06:24.800> that<00:06:24.920> out<00:06:25.130> soon<00:06:25.430> enough

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730 
trying that out soon enough

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.330
