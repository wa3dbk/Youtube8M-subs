00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.420
 and kids, I bring you how to do 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.580
 the tractor's turret is worth a look 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.970
 look there in the small moment 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.340
 we take the ammunition and place it here 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.230
 what to build is worth and is that the tower 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.810
 it's pretty good arrives keeps saying 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.550
 how are you going to make it ok we have to catch 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.199
 the tractor that is usually in the area 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.760
 is here is the one of the mega farm is 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.109
 there from door palmero me 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.050
 He said 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.090
 I took the tractor and I took it to build 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.160
 although they are built and the 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.899
 tractor as to be able to place a 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.899
 store is not worth that then we have to 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.040
 put the r pk that is usually by the 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.290
 top part or thrown in those 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.059
 kids but we found it here at 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.190
 side of the box to take the 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:53.600
 rp dimension of this work of 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.320
 hip and build are what will 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.450
 creating 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.790
 and then the contraption would be done 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.130
 of this the item and here I think it has 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.670
 Eric caught the full and it took all 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.500
 I half trolley giving us 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.840
 yes I think he took it because he has the 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.400
 mannequin is worth to tell you the trick the 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.159
 bullfighter has to put one worth but 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.720
 then one has to carry the mannequin 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.450
 to activate the turret that is 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.159
 as to give him current and can 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.840
 kill the zombies either shoot the 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.909
 enemies now here makes like that point 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.859
 ok but you see that we put it wrong 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.569
 the tractor and you have to put it right 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:30.240
 look at me now, it's giving me the 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.729
 energy and he gets to shoot at the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.679
 zombies is worth what we left for 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.539
 try to kill a few 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.159
 we went round and 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.459
 we try to put one behind the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.990
 fan to see if it worked but 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:45.240
 you can see that you can not see what is in the USA 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.939
 more for a mannequin is a turret worth 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.530
 some guys this was the trick I hope that 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.509
 you liked it already you know that there 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.729
 enough and there are quite a few things that 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.200
 we are trying to discover good but 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.770
 they liked guys and see you in the 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.770
 next video
