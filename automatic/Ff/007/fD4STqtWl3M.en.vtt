00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
days and I'm just gonna lift up the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.100 
days and I'm just gonna lift up the
frame<00:01:09.630> slightly<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:11.159> very<00:01:11.670> lightly

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
frame slightly and just very lightly

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.560 
frame slightly and just very lightly
draw<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.290> line<00:01:13.530> using<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.310> frame<00:01:14.790> as<00:01:15.030> my<00:01:15.330> guide

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
draw a line using the frame as my guide

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.499 
draw a line using the frame as my guide
but<00:01:16.049> not<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.250> actual<00:01:17.729> bit<00:01:18.360> that

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
but not going in the actual bit that

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.359 
but not going in the actual bit that
you're<00:01:18.570> gonna<00:01:18.750> see<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.950> want<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.220> have<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
you're gonna see you want to have a

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.340 
you're gonna see you want to have a
little<00:01:20.520> bit<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.880> excess<00:01:21.330> because<00:01:21.840> we're<00:01:22.229> going

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
little bit of excess because we're going

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.039 
little bit of excess because we're going
to<00:01:22.439> glue<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.130> back<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.520> frame<00:01:23.759> so

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
to glue it to the back of the frame so

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.840 
to glue it to the back of the frame so
you<00:01:25.049> need<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> little<00:01:25.409> bit<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.159> then<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.640> one

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
you need a little bit and then this one

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.340 
you need a little bit and then this one
in<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.030> middle<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> trickiest<00:01:27.869> because

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
in the middle is the trickiest because

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.859 
in the middle is the trickiest because
look<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.100> tiniest<00:01:29.490> one<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.659> don't

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
look it's the tiniest one and you don't

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.910 
look it's the tiniest one and you don't
get<00:01:31.020> much<00:01:31.320> extra<00:01:32.659> leeway<00:01:33.659> with<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.200> we'll<00:01:34.799> do

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
get much extra leeway with it we'll do

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.719 
get much extra leeway with it we'll do
our<00:01:35.040> best<00:01:36.950> so<00:01:37.950> now<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.159> want<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.490> take<00:01:38.610> your

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
our best so now you want to take your

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:47.150 
our best so now you want to take your
scissors<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.150> cut

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.500 

it<00:01:48.160> doesn't<00:01:48.520> need<00:01:48.610> to<00:01:48.670> be<00:01:48.940> a<00:01:48.970> hundred<00:01:49.300> percent

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
it doesn't need to be a hundred percent

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.000 
it doesn't need to be a hundred percent
accurate<00:01:50.140> because<00:01:50.260> you're<00:01:50.590> going<00:01:50.740> to<00:01:50.800> glue<00:01:50.980> it

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
accurate because you're going to glue it

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.580 
accurate because you're going to glue it
and<00:01:51.280> hide<00:01:51.490> it<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:53.170> don't<00:01:53.350> worry<00:01:53.530> too<00:01:53.860> much<00:01:55.590> put

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
and hide it so don't worry too much put

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
near the centre because that is where

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.410 
near the centre because that is where
some<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.650> our<00:02:35.770> best<00:02:35.980> memories<00:02:36.370> have<00:02:36.580> been<00:02:36.790> and

some of our best memories have been and

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.210 
some of our best memories have been and
I'm<00:02:37.510> going<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.660> do<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.170> same<00:02:38.410> technique<00:02:38.770> again

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
I'm going to do the same technique again

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.030 
I'm going to do the same technique again
lifting<00:02:40.120> up<00:02:40.210> the<00:02:40.330> Mount<00:02:40.800> drawing<00:02:41.800> a<00:02:41.890> rough

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
lifting up the Mount drawing a rough

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.720 
lifting up the Mount drawing a rough
line<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:42.580> know<00:02:42.670> where<00:02:42.910> to<00:02:42.940> go<00:02:44.490> and<00:02:45.490> then

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
line so I know where to go and then

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.280 
line so I know where to go and then
popping<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.180> down<00:02:46.330> again

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:59.480 

and<00:02:52.290> then<00:02:52.410> it's<00:02:52.560> time<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.740> cut<00:02:53.010> again

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.370 

you<00:03:00.490> could<00:03:00.730> of<00:03:00.910> course<00:03:00.940> use<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.510> other<00:03:01.840> map<00:03:02.110> as

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
you could of course use the other map as

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.460 
you could of course use the other map as
a<00:03:02.410> template<00:03:02.890> if<00:03:03.160> all<00:03:03.370> your<00:03:03.900> mount<00:03:04.900> holes<00:03:05.230> are

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
a template if all your mount holes are

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.620 
a template if all your mount holes are
the<00:03:05.590> same<00:03:05.800> size<00:03:06.840> but<00:03:07.840> let's<00:03:08.020> just<00:03:08.260> check

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
the same size but let's just check

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.730 
the same size but let's just check
that's<00:03:10.630> fine<00:03:10.990> put<00:03:11.320> that<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.710> one<00:03:11.830> side<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:14.080> now

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
that's fine put that to one side and now

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:21.270 
that's fine put that to one side and now
we're<00:03:14.920> going<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.070> go<00:03:15.190> for<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.520> la<00:03:15.880> map<00:03:20.280> let's

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
we're going to go for the la map let's

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.020 
we're going to go for the la map let's
go<00:03:21.610> let's<00:03:21.970> put<00:03:22.240> Los<00:03:22.390> Angeles<00:03:22.840> in<00:03:23.020> the<00:03:23.140> middle

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.290 

so<00:03:28.030> same<00:03:28.480> technique<00:03:28.870> again

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:40.840 

and<00:03:34.500> cut

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.330 

this<00:03:41.660> is<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:41.960> perfect<00:03:42.440> sort<00:03:42.680> of<00:03:42.770> gift<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.190> give

person as well it's nice okay so that is

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.650 
person as well it's nice okay so that is
all<00:04:04.160> our<00:04:04.340> Maps<00:04:04.580> turn<00:04:04.850> and<00:04:05.120> you<00:04:05.240> just<00:04:05.450> want<00:04:05.600> to

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
all our Maps turn and you just want to

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.510 
all our Maps turn and you just want to
decide<00:04:06.020> which<00:04:06.080> order<00:04:06.620> you<00:04:06.890> want<00:04:06.980> them<00:04:07.100> in<00:04:07.310> and

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
decide which order you want them in and

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.770 
decide which order you want them in and
I<00:04:07.940> think<00:04:08.300> that<00:04:08.510> I<00:04:08.630> would<00:04:09.080> like<00:04:09.320> to<00:04:09.920> have

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
I think that I would like to have

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.970 
I think that I would like to have
Orlando<00:04:11.780> in<00:04:11.870> the<00:04:11.960> middle<00:04:12.200> because<00:04:12.380> that<00:04:12.680> looks

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
Orlando in the middle because that looks

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.040 
Orlando in the middle because that looks
like<00:04:13.550> the<00:04:13.700> most<00:04:13.850> green<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.420> then<00:04:14.540> these<00:04:14.720> look

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
like the most green and then these look

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.340 
like the most green and then these look
a<00:04:15.080> bit<00:04:15.290> more<00:04:15.790> limey<00:04:16.790> you<00:04:17.630> know<00:04:17.750> of<00:04:17.870> roads<00:04:18.110> and

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
a bit more limey you know of roads and

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.770 
a bit more limey you know of roads and
things<00:04:18.620> I<00:04:18.950> think<00:04:19.100> that<00:04:19.310> makes<00:04:19.820> for<00:04:20.180> a<00:04:20.570> nice

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
things I think that makes for a nice

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.760 
things I think that makes for a nice
display<00:04:21.620> you<00:04:22.520> want<00:04:22.640> to<00:04:22.850> take<00:04:23.090> your<00:04:23.600> mount<00:04:24.320> turn

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
display you want to take your mount turn

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.150 
display you want to take your mount turn
it<00:04:24.890> upside<00:04:25.550> down<00:04:25.580> so<00:04:26.210> now<00:04:26.360> you're<00:04:26.570> working

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
it upside down so now you're working

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.110 
it upside down so now you're working
backwards<00:04:28.160> bear<00:04:28.370> that<00:04:28.520> in<00:04:28.610> mind<00:04:28.640> if<00:04:28.970> you've

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
backwards bear that in mind if you've

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.640 
backwards bear that in mind if you've
got<00:04:29.300> like<00:04:29.390> a<00:04:29.450> particular<00:04:29.990> order<00:04:30.320> for<00:04:30.500> things

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
got like a particular order for things

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.530 
got like a particular order for things
to<00:04:30.710> go<00:04:30.890> in<00:04:32.050> place<00:04:33.050> everything<00:04:33.680> on<00:04:34.330> just<00:04:35.330> to<00:04:35.420> get

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
to go in place everything on just to get

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.450 
to go in place everything on just to get
a<00:04:35.570> feel<00:04:35.840> for<00:04:35.870> it<00:04:38.110> okay<00:04:39.110> that<00:04:39.770> will<00:04:39.920> all<00:04:40.010> fit<00:04:40.280> and

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
a feel for it okay that will all fit and

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.110 
a feel for it okay that will all fit and
now<00:04:40.880> it's<00:04:41.060> time<00:04:41.240> to<00:04:41.420> stick<00:04:42.400> if<00:04:43.400> you<00:04:43.640> don't<00:04:43.850> have

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
now it's time to stick if you don't have

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.090 
now it's time to stick if you don't have
a<00:04:44.150> little<00:04:44.420> tray<00:04:44.840> to<00:04:44.900> hand<00:04:45.350> to<00:04:45.680> squeeze<00:04:45.950> your

a little tray to hand to squeeze your
glue<00:04:46.310> onto<00:04:46.520> isn't<00:04:47.510> just<00:04:47.690> use<00:04:47.870> a<00:04:47.900> little<00:04:48.350> bit<00:04:48.800> of

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
glue onto isn't just use a little bit of

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:55.150 
glue onto isn't just use a little bit of
the<00:04:49.190> old<00:04:49.370> map<00:04:50.980> genius<00:04:51.980> squeeze<00:04:52.880> that<00:04:53.090> out<00:04:54.160> take

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
the old map genius squeeze that out take

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.980 
the old map genius squeeze that out take
your<00:04:55.430> brush<00:04:55.730> while<00:04:56.480> the<00:04:56.600> glue<00:04:56.810> gets<00:04:57.050> NT<00:04:57.440> on<00:04:57.820> and

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
your brush while the glue gets NT on and

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.530 
your brush while the glue gets NT on and
then<00:04:59.990> just<00:05:00.320> quite<00:05:01.040> liberally<00:05:01.460> wipe<00:05:02.150> it<00:05:02.330> round

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
then just quite liberally wipe it round

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.190 
then just quite liberally wipe it round
the<00:05:02.840> back<00:05:03.050> of<00:05:03.260> the<00:05:03.530> mount<00:05:04.540> you<00:05:05.540> want<00:05:05.780> to<00:05:05.930> choose

the back of the mount you want to choose

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.260 
the back of the mount you want to choose
a<00:05:06.260> frame<00:05:06.710> that's<00:05:06.950> got<00:05:07.130> quite<00:05:07.310> stiff<00:05:07.970> card

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
a frame that's got quite stiff card

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.790 
a frame that's got quite stiff card
otherwise<00:05:08.750> this<00:05:08.990> could<00:05:09.230> make<00:05:09.410> it<00:05:09.560> go<00:05:09.650> a<00:05:09.680> bit

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
otherwise this could make it go a bit

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.870 
otherwise this could make it go a bit
wet<00:05:10.010> and<00:05:10.040> bendy

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
wet and bendy

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.260

which<00:05:11.420> is<00:05:11.750> not<00:05:11.900> really<00:05:12.170> what<00:05:12.320> you<00:05:12.440> want<00:05:13.270> don't

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
which is not really what you want don't

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.710 
which is not really what you want don't
worry<00:05:14.540> about<00:05:14.630> getting<00:05:14.930> on<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:15.080> table<00:05:16.630> just<00:05:17.630> be

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
worry about getting on the table just be

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.070 
worry about getting on the table just be
quite<00:05:17.930> liberal<00:05:18.140> with<00:05:18.410> it<00:05:18.560> and<00:05:19.930> obviously<00:05:20.930> you

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
quite liberal with it and obviously you

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.050 
quite liberal with it and obviously you
want<00:05:21.230> to<00:05:21.260> go<00:05:21.380> quite<00:05:21.740> quickly<00:05:21.770> because<00:05:22.700> it<00:05:22.910> will

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
want to go quite quickly because it will

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.150 
want to go quite quickly because it will
dry<00:05:25.240> and<00:05:26.240> then<00:05:26.450> take<00:05:26.990> your<00:05:27.230> map<00:05:27.530> make<00:05:27.920> sure<00:05:28.070> you

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
dry and then take your map make sure you

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.570 
dry and then take your map make sure you
put<00:05:28.310> it<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.460> right<00:05:28.610> way<00:05:28.760> up<00:05:28.970> and<00:05:30.280> stick<00:05:31.280> and

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
put it the right way up and stick and

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.300 
put it the right way up and stick and
try<00:05:31.850> and<00:05:32.000> make<00:05:32.150> it<00:05:32.180> as<00:05:32.360> taut<00:05:32.690> as<00:05:32.960> possible<00:05:33.470> so

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
try and make it as taut as possible so

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.710 
try and make it as taut as possible so
that<00:05:34.460> you<00:05:34.580> don't<00:05:34.790> have<00:05:34.970> like<00:05:35.180> wibbly-wobbly

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
that you don't have like wibbly-wobbly

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.100 
that you don't have like wibbly-wobbly
paper<00:05:36.110> in<00:05:36.410> the<00:05:36.530> frame<00:05:37.120> okay<00:05:38.120> how's<00:05:38.900> that

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
paper in the frame okay how's that

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.970 
paper in the frame okay how's that
looking<00:05:39.550> good<00:05:40.550> I<00:05:40.610> think<00:05:41.380> be<00:05:42.380> careful<00:05:42.770> not<00:05:42.830> to

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
looking good I think be careful not to

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.060 
looking good I think be careful not to
get<00:05:43.070> too<00:05:43.370> much<00:05:43.400> glue<00:05:43.880> everywhere<00:05:44.800> it's<00:05:45.800> very

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
get too much glue everywhere it's very

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.380 
get too much glue everywhere it's very
tricky

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
tricky

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.750 
tricky
all<00:05:47.870> righty<00:05:48.140> now<00:05:48.560> I'm<00:05:48.800> going<00:05:49.010> to<00:05:49.130> go<00:05:49.280> for<00:05:49.640> my

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
all righty now I'm going to go for my

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.990 
all righty now I'm going to go for my
map<00:05:49.970> of<00:05:50.120> London<00:05:51.280> same<00:05:52.280> technique<00:05:52.670> with<00:05:52.850> the

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
map of London same technique with the

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:01.000 
map of London same technique with the
glue<00:05:58.750> now<00:05:59.750> you're<00:05:59.960> having<00:06:00.110> to<00:06:00.350> go<00:06:00.500> over<00:06:00.890> the

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
glue now you're having to go over the

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.350 
glue now you're having to go over the
old<00:06:01.160> map<00:06:01.460> a<00:06:01.490> little<00:06:01.820> bit<00:06:01.970> because<00:06:02.090> there'll<00:06:02.330> be

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
old map a little bit because there'll be

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.730 
old map a little bit because there'll be
a<00:06:02.450> bit<00:06:02.630> of<00:06:02.780> overlap<00:06:03.170> but<00:06:03.350> that's<00:06:03.530> not<00:06:03.710> a

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
a bit of overlap but that's not a

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.960 
a bit of overlap but that's not a
problem<00:06:05.560> okay<00:06:06.560> and<00:06:07.130> then<00:06:07.280> making<00:06:07.610> sure<00:06:07.790> you

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
problem okay and then making sure you

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:15.760 
problem okay and then making sure you
are<00:06:08.000> the<00:06:08.210> right<00:06:08.420> way<00:06:08.570> up<00:06:09.640> yep<00:06:14.380> place<00:06:15.380> it<00:06:15.590> on

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
are the right way up yep place it on

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.520 
are the right way up yep place it on
making<00:06:16.550> sure<00:06:16.730> every<00:06:17.390> side<00:06:17.660> is<00:06:17.990> touching<00:06:18.410> the

making sure every side is touching the

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:30.290 
making sure every side is touching the
mount<00:06:18.740> so<00:06:18.980> that<00:06:19.010> you<00:06:19.190> don't<00:06:19.400> have<00:06:19.610> any<00:06:19.790> gaps

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.969 

always<00:06:31.080> checking<00:06:31.379> you've<00:06:31.560> got<00:06:31.680> at<00:06:31.740> the<00:06:31.830> right

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 
always checking you've got at the right

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:43.369 
always checking you've got at the right
way<00:06:32.159> up<00:06:35.150> place<00:06:36.150> it<00:06:36.330> all<00:06:36.509> down<00:06:42.050> now<00:06:43.050> you<00:06:43.110> just

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:43.379 
way up place it all down now you just

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:52.090 
way up place it all down now you just
want<00:06:43.530> to<00:06:43.560> pop<00:06:43.770> that<00:06:44.009> back<00:06:44.220> in<00:06:44.430> your<00:06:44.460> frame

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.550 

now<00:06:53.100> you<00:06:53.520> can<00:06:53.790> wait<00:06:54.000> for<00:06:54.150> it<00:06:54.210> to<00:06:54.360> dry<00:06:54.480> but<00:06:55.110> since

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 
now you can wait for it to dry but since

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.470 
now you can wait for it to dry but since
I'm<00:06:55.710> only<00:06:55.860> using<00:06:56.160> this<00:06:56.430> frame<00:06:56.640> for<00:06:57.030> this<00:06:57.210> it
