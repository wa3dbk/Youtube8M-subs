00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
the actual prop start itself how I open

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:33.540 
the actual prop start itself how I open
this<00:01:19.090> this<00:01:20.090> way

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550

gonna take a look at the actual graphics
card<00:01:50.600> itself<00:01:51.050> oh<00:01:51.350> just<00:01:52.310> pulling<00:01:52.580> on<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.790> box

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
card itself oh just pulling on the box

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.270 
card itself oh just pulling on the box
here<00:01:53.270> it<00:01:53.810> does<00:01:53.960> have<00:01:54.140> a<00:01:54.170> little<00:01:54.410> good<00:01:55.070> amount

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
here it does have a little good amount

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.280 
here it does have a little good amount
of<00:01:55.310> weight<00:01:55.430> to<00:01:55.610> it<00:01:55.730> EVGA<00:01:56.480> has<00:01:56.750> that<00:01:56.930> nice<00:01:57.110> job

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
of weight to it EVGA has that nice job

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.870 
of weight to it EVGA has that nice job
it<00:01:57.440> does<00:01:57.560> look<00:01:57.710> very<00:01:57.740> nice<00:01:58.040> and<00:01:58.310> kind<00:01:58.820> of

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
it does look very nice and kind of

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.180 
it does look very nice and kind of
futuristic<00:01:59.180> the<00:02:00.170> fan<00:02:00.380> is<00:02:00.560> a<00:02:00.590> cool<00:02:00.830> turbine

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
futuristic the fan is a cool turbine

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.180 
futuristic the fan is a cool turbine
look<00:02:01.370> to<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:01.610> see<00:02:02.150> it<00:02:02.270> spins<00:02:02.840> there<00:02:03.080> and<00:02:03.290> that

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
look to it see it spins there and that

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.710 
look to it see it spins there and that
heat<00:02:04.340> sink<00:02:04.610> actually<00:02:05.150> has<00:02:05.240> a<00:02:05.270> nice<00:02:05.420> finish<00:02:05.690> to

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
heat sink actually has a nice finish to

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.930 
heat sink actually has a nice finish to
it<00:02:05.869> as<00:02:05.990> well<00:02:06.070> over<00:02:07.070> here<00:02:07.250> you'll<00:02:07.400> notice<00:02:07.520> there

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
it as well over here you'll notice there

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.120 
it as well over here you'll notice there
are<00:02:08.060> some<00:02:08.330> tubes<00:02:09.200> that<00:02:09.470> will<00:02:09.679> transfer<00:02:10.010> heat

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
are some tubes that will transfer heat

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.449 
are some tubes that will transfer heat
from<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.870> PCB<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.740> heatsink<00:02:13.100> so<00:02:13.220> it<00:02:13.340> can

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
from the PCB to the heatsink so it can

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.610 
from the PCB to the heatsink so it can
cool<00:02:13.550> off<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.760> little<00:02:13.880> more<00:02:14.030> efficiently<00:02:14.870> we'll

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
cool off a little more efficiently we'll

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.810 
cool off a little more efficiently we'll
take<00:02:15.740> a<00:02:15.800> look<00:02:15.890> at<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.100> ports<00:02:16.370> now<00:02:16.520> on<00:02:16.670> this

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
take a look at the ports now on this

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.990 
take a look at the ports now on this
side<00:02:17.030> we<00:02:17.300> also<00:02:18.050> have<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.320> fan<00:02:18.800> right<00:02:18.950> there<00:02:19.040> mini

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
side we also have a fan right there mini

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.580 
side we also have a fan right there mini
HDMI<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:21.020> does<00:02:21.170> come<00:02:21.320> with<00:02:21.350> an<00:02:21.530> hdmi

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
HDMI and it does come with an hdmi

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.260 
HDMI and it does come with an hdmi
adapter<00:02:22.490> so<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:22.670> can<00:02:22.850> play<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.060> regular

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
adapter so you can play a regular

and does come with a DVI to vga adapter

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.530 
and does come with a DVI to vga adapter
I'll<00:02:30.170> just<00:02:30.350> swing<00:02:30.530> it<00:02:30.560> around<00:02:31.090> not<00:02:32.090> much<00:02:32.330> of

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
I'll just swing it around not much of

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.340 
I'll just swing it around not much of
interest<00:02:32.690> there<00:02:34.030> take<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.060> look<00:02:35.209> at<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.510> we

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
interest there take a look at that we

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.710
