00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.190
 Humic substances are molecules that originate from the degradation of 

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:06.640
 organic material 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.720
 they serve as 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.980
 the natural fertilizer 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.399
 and recycle materials 

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:14.539
 leaving the room more conducive to the growth of new plantations 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.070
 currently 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.400
 embrapa temperate climate and conducts research on waste management 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.670
 produced by crops such as wheat, with increasing matter 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.550
 soil organic 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.800
 the harvesting process already affected 1 billion in the return to get the selection 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.990
 after harvest wheat straw remains quite extensive 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.370
 contribute to the share of organic matter including 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.210
 humic 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.860
 press the machine 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.720
 she wants it to do in case the wheat commercial product are in the grains of the 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.340
 triple what it is capable of it being for the grains 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.510
 We take off, we wait. 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.270
 that is, we are removing these grains from the crop and 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.170
 export of lawns use this term 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.820
 here at the same time I have already reported the residue or it leaves straw 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.150
 this afternoon 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.670
 has to have its function in the system 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.480
 is for her will serve 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.780
 of food twist to part 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.399
 of the soil 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.390
 and over time it will provide 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.160
 nutrients in their decomposition 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.539
 and grow 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:24.530
 It worked 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.540
 among other things with public substances for example this experiment 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.369
 specific 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.120
 he leaves the visit 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.289
 we have others 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.820
 we have done things we have another area 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.780
 which leaves no residue 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.400
 what we call the conventional system 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.570
 this residue is incorporated into the soil 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.640
 this incorporation into the soil causes me to undergo very rapid degradation 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.000
 of this material 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.240
 what not 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.520
 which will not do well 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.200
 is compared to the local 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.980
 no-tillage with 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.720
 with a permanent dress in the paulo will not contribute to increase the content of 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.380
 organic matter 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.060
 in one of the experiments 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.670
 a legume was incorporated in areas of wheat planting 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.809
 and it was noted the importance of the use of 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:18.449
 enrichment of the soil despair of another logic only change hands 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:21.479
 the crops involved in the year the principle 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.529
 basically the same also of fertilization 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:28.049
 what we have now - we have this parcel 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.889
 from the point of view of virtually lost wheat 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.269
 because here I am observing that the clover 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.269
 live his ps won the competition 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.760
 in the case with the plug we understand this as important information 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.790
 because if we observe it is a legume adapted to s the areas of d 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.289
 d lowland 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:54.389
 because this is an important point 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.649
 incorporates soil organic matter 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:59.539
 represents outside the biomass 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:02.679
 even though the korando made another decision on this organic matter in the 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:06.919
 only when you can produce a legume system from her 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:12.669
 along with the goal with the bodies soon the batteries she thinks the job searched 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:17.679
 its kind an industry producing nitrogen transforming nitrogen 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:20.679
 gas 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:25.459
 this week he will stand in the chamber decided the eighth to find 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.529
 humic substances mayor discussed this and other subjects 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.750
 the use of these substances to enhance agriculture 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:36.309
 to minimize the effects of global warming 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.789
 agriculture has reported very imprecisely 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.699
 in mitigating the effects of global warming 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.839
 there are several techniques that can be used 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:51.309
 what irritated the side remedeiem less expense certainly is a positive factor 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.089
 the lower gas emission 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:57.509
 the deputy has another aspect in the second second benefit 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:00.649
 because in addition to issuing fewer withdrawals by 1-0 

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:04.919
 if we only emit less gas it did not solve a problem because in this case 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.319
 to continue 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.319
 because of the greenhouse effect palermo own capacity 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:13.439
 the potential to withdraw the part of these expenses with this we give the name of 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.109
 carbon sequestration 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.359
 two techniques that can be used in agriculture and helps to reduce 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.900
 greenhouse effect 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.780
 are the use of no-tillage rather than conventional and 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.770
 of energy through biofuels is another alternative that is in 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.040
 progress said is the use of a beautiful says solange found in tignes 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.680
 pre-Columbian tribes prior to the arrival of the 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.590
 colonizers they had a very interesting technique of soil use 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.870
 and not only increase the soil fertility of the amazon 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.189
 they are not very fertile, right? 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:49.469
 if it won 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:54.369
 but I also doubt that it is a great experience to face 

00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:55.120
 So 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.250
 is to use only they are extremely fertile and that they resist to the agricultural light even its 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.980
 Beautiful dissent pass fertility Everything is studying this modern that he did 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.339
 these communities that form their voice no longer exist. 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:11.339
 but is doing studies with 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.389
 is the Argentine who obtain the proposal tries to recover this knowledge and 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.099
 apply today 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.760
 it seemed that the central idea of ​​agricultural work 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.999
 humanity has basic services. 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:28.360
 food production 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.589
 power 

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:35.439
 and the withdrawal and tell the pollutants of the atmosphere is a challenge in science 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:37.710
 rearguard user action 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.469
 we have to go 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:42.469
 newspaper the soil more and more 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.150
 with the highest content of organic matter 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.659
 stable and dorival 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:52.979
 not that disappeared in a farce we have today a large set of actions 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.839
 research Center 

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:55.919
 and this 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:00.189
 we have learned in research projects transversally in all our 

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:01.789
 fronts of action 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:05.099
 which addresses the issue, for example, of monitoring 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:07.259
 environmental Quality 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:11.099
 where soil organic matter for example is one of the advanced indicators 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:12.249
 processes 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:15.519
 It is also an indicator that defines the sustainability of 

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:16.830
 of handling 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.930
 they are important to go to the street 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.919
 the assembly of the protection system with which we work
