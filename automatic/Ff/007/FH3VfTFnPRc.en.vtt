runcam Phoebe from run cam contacted me
a<00:00:16.949> few<00:00:17.100> weeks<00:00:17.789> ago<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.480> asked<00:00:19.050> if<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.230> would<00:00:19.260> do

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
a few weeks ago and asked if I would do

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.840 
a few weeks ago and asked if I would do
a<00:00:19.529> review<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.920> have<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> look<00:00:20.430> at<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.670> camera

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
a review and have a look at that camera

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.000 
a review and have a look at that camera
and<00:00:21.029> give<00:00:21.180> him<00:00:21.270> some<00:00:21.449> feedback<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:22.500> hence<00:00:22.769> they

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
and give him some feedback so hence they

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.279 
and give him some feedback so hence they
sent<00:00:23.250> me<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.430> camera<00:00:23.820> out<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.330> it's<00:00:24.840> called

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
sent me this camera out and it's called

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.109 
sent me this camera out and it's called
the<00:00:25.740> sky<00:00:26.099> now<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:26.910> think<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.269> costs<00:00:27.900> around

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
the sky now I think it costs around

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.310 
the sky now I think it costs around
$39.99<00:00:30.119> it--for<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.720> will<00:00:30.929> have<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> link

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
$39.99 it--for that I will have a link

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.729 
$39.99 it--for that I will have a link
in<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.560> description<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.180> 650<00:00:34.170> TVL

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
in the description and it's a 650 TVL

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.490 
in the description and it's a 650 TVL
middle<00:00:35.340> case<00:00:35.640> camera<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.989> as<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.290> can<00:00:37.440> see

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
middle case camera so as you can see

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.020 
middle case camera so as you can see
it's<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.570> 3/4<00:00:39.570> inch<00:00:39.620> Sony<00:00:40.620> superhead<00:00:41.460> CCD

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
it's a 3/4 inch Sony superhead CCD

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.569 
it's a 3/4 inch Sony superhead CCD
camera<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.469> quality<00:00:43.770> I'm<00:00:44.040> expecting<00:00:44.489> is

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
camera so the quality I'm expecting is

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.799 
camera so the quality I'm expecting is
going<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.789> be<00:00:44.850> quite<00:00:45.059> reasonable<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.690> it's

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
going to be quite reasonable and it's

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.100 
going to be quite reasonable and it's
also<00:00:46.050> running<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.940> 2.8<00:00:47.940> millimeter<00:00:48.510> wide

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
also running the 2.8 millimeter wide

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.420 
also running the 2.8 millimeter wide
angle<00:00:49.440> lens<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:49.860> means<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.250> don't<00:00:50.340> have

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
angle lens so that means you don't have

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.160 
angle lens so that means you don't have
to<00:00:50.610> spend<00:00:51.030> money<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.300> an<00:00:51.750> additional

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
to spend money on an additional

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.709 
to spend money on an additional
wide-angle<00:00:52.739> lens<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.670> runs<00:00:53.850> off<00:00:54.000> 12<00:00:54.420> volts

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
wide-angle lens and it runs off 12 volts

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
wide-angle lens and it runs off 12 volts
there<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.899> reason<00:00:55.170> why<00:00:55.230> I'm<00:00:55.320> showing<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
there the reason why I'm showing you the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.139 
there the reason why I'm showing you the
box<00:00:55.920> because<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.489> box<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:56.910> thing<00:00:57.059> is

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
box because the box on this thing is

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.049 
box because the box on this thing is
pretty<00:00:57.449> impressive<00:00:58.309> so<00:00:59.309> let<00:00:59.789> me<00:00:59.850> show<00:01:00.000> you

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
pretty impressive so let me show you

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.500 
pretty impressive so let me show you
what<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.270> get<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:01.879> so<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
what you get with it so this is the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.550 
what you get with it so this is the
actual<00:01:03.840> camera<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:05.129> see<00:01:05.250> how<00:01:05.309> they<00:01:05.369> show<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.760> in

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
actual camera to see how they show it in

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.170 
actual camera to see how they show it in
so<00:01:07.560> that's<00:01:08.159> what<00:01:08.369> basically<00:01:08.939> looks<00:01:09.090> like

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
so that's what basically looks like

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.789 
so that's what basically looks like
you've<00:01:09.780> got<00:01:09.930> two<00:01:10.140> connectors<00:01:10.530> there<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
you've got two connectors there the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.859 
you've got two connectors there the
first<00:01:11.040> one<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.909> side<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.360> actually<00:01:12.540> for

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
first one on this side is actually for

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.560 
first one on this side is actually for
your<00:01:12.990> power<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.500> your<00:01:13.530> video<00:01:13.920> out<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
your power in your video out and the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.120 
your power in your video out and the
second<00:01:15.930> one<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.229> basically<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.860> control

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
second one is basically the control

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.260 
second one is basically the control
interface<00:01:17.369> that's<00:01:17.790> got<00:01:17.970> like<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> little

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
interface that's got like a little

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.240 
interface that's got like a little
joystick<00:01:18.720> II<00:01:19.049> type<00:01:19.259> thing<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.530> controls<00:01:20.009> it

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
joystick II type thing that controls it

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.280 
joystick II type thing that controls it
and<00:01:20.700> as<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.659> got<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:21.990> mount

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
and as you can see it's got this mount

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.920 
and as you can see it's got this mount
here<00:01:22.939> with<00:01:23.939> two<00:01:24.180> screws<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.479> hold<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.840> in

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
here with two screws that hold it in

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.240 
here with two screws that hold it in
place<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.470> obviously<00:01:25.560> be<00:01:25.830> screwed<00:01:26.100> into

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
place this can obviously be screwed into

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.190 
place this can obviously be screwed into
your<00:01:26.520> multi<00:01:27.390> right<00:01:27.540> or<00:01:27.689> whatever<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.140> that

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
your multi right or whatever it is that

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.460 
your multi right or whatever it is that
using<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:29.009> on<00:01:29.390> these<00:01:30.390> footprint<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.320> this

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
using it on these footprint of this

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.230 
using it on these footprint of this
thing<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.740> pretty<00:01:32.040> tiny<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.060> pretty

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
thing is pretty tiny so it's a pretty

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.719 
thing is pretty tiny so it's a pretty
impressive<00:01:33.570> looking<00:01:34.250> camera<00:01:35.250> that's<00:01:35.579> for

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
impressive looking camera that's for

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.700 
impressive looking camera that's for
sure<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.630> we'll<00:01:36.780> see<00:01:36.930> how<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.170> look<00:01:37.439> but<00:01:37.619> I'll

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
sure so we'll see how that look but I'll

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.960 
sure so we'll see how that look but I'll
show<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.890> what<00:01:38.009> else<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.340> get<00:01:38.460> with<00:01:38.640> it

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
show you what else you get with it

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.510 
show you what else you get with it
so<00:01:39.540> besides<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.229> actual<00:01:40.350> camera<00:01:40.860> itself<00:01:40.890> what

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
so besides the actual camera itself what

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.670 
so besides the actual camera itself what
you<00:01:41.640> also<00:01:41.850> get<00:01:42.119> with<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.200> servo

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
you also get with this is a servo

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.370 
you also get with this is a servo
connector<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.610> really<00:01:44.970> handy<00:01:45.380> so

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
connector and this is really handy so

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.899 
connector and this is really handy so
one<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.950> allows<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.250> basically<00:01:47.399> power

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
one that allows you to basically power

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.420 
one that allows you to basically power
the<00:01:48.119> unit<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.570> um<00:01:48.930> get<00:01:49.770> video<00:01:49.979> back<00:01:50.159> from<00:01:50.340> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the unit and um get video back from the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.670 
the unit and um get video back from the
camera<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.540> like<00:01:51.869> your<00:01:52.140> joystick

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
camera this is like your joystick

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.840 
camera this is like your joystick
interface<00:01:53.220> for<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:55.399> so<00:01:56.399> I'm<00:01:56.460> not<00:01:56.579> sure<00:01:56.729> how

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
interface for it so I'm not sure how

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.240 
interface for it so I'm not sure how
well<00:01:57.000> you're<00:01:57.149> gonna<00:01:57.240> say<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:58.100> if<00:01:59.100> it's

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
well you're gonna say that but if it's

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.240 
well you're gonna say that but if it's
the<00:01:59.369> right<00:01:59.520> way<00:01:59.640> around<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.860> you've<00:02:01.950> got<00:02:02.130> your

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
the right way around so you've got your

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.730 
the right way around so you've got your
up<00:02:02.490> down<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.390> you've<00:02:03.899> got<00:02:04.110> your<00:02:04.259> left<00:02:04.590> and

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
up down and you've got your left and

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.530 
up down and you've got your left and
right<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.219> obviously<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.759> press<00:02:06.060> it's

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
right and obviously you can press it's

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.359 
right and obviously you can press it's
like<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> little<00:02:06.869> joystick<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.469> thing<00:02:07.680> that

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
like a little joystick this thing that

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.190 
like a little joystick this thing that
moves<00:02:08.640> around<00:02:08.789> lazy<00:02:09.330> navigate<00:02:09.869> through<00:02:10.080> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
moves around lazy navigate through the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.490 
moves around lazy navigate through the
menu<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:11.220> not<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.819> bad<00:02:12.000> little<00:02:12.150> interface<00:02:12.569> and

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
menu so not a bad little interface and

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.380 
menu so not a bad little interface and
obviously<00:02:13.830> your<00:02:14.100> standard<00:02:14.790> video<00:02:15.000> cable

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
obviously your standard video cable

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.360 
obviously your standard video cable
which<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:16.410> won't<00:02:16.620> be<00:02:16.680> using<00:02:16.710> so<00:02:17.100> generally

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
which we won't be using so generally

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.800 
which we won't be using so generally
speaking<00:02:17.400> for<00:02:17.700> fpv<00:02:18.180> you're<00:02:18.360> gonna<00:02:18.450> use<00:02:18.660> this

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
speaking for fpv you're gonna use this

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.840 
speaking for fpv you're gonna use this
cable<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.290> set<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.560> up<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.950> you're<00:02:20.760> gonna

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
cable to set it up and you're gonna

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.870 
cable to set it up and you're gonna
basically<00:02:21.090> plug<00:02:21.570> this<00:02:21.750> guy<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:22.170> like<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:22.880> so

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
basically plug this guy in like so so

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.430 
basically plug this guy in like so so
there<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.180> go<00:02:24.360> it's<00:02:24.600> actually<00:02:24.870> plugged<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:25.260> so

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
there you go it's actually plugged in so

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.930 
there you go it's actually plugged in so
that's<00:02:25.620> basically<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.100> weight<00:02:26.250> plugs<00:02:26.520> in<00:02:26.700> and

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
that's basically the weight plugs in and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.140 
that's basically the weight plugs in and
that's<00:02:27.390> pretty<00:02:27.750> much<00:02:27.900> ready<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.530> go

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
that's pretty much ready to go

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.640 
that's pretty much ready to go
so<00:02:30.150> while<00:02:30.390> what<00:02:30.540> we'll<00:02:30.660> do<00:02:30.840> now<00:02:31.020> is<00:02:31.080> basically

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
so while what we'll do now is basically

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.920 
so while what we'll do now is basically
cut<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.520> video<00:02:32.670> footage<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.630> can<00:02:33.780> see

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
cut to the video footage and you can see

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.890 
cut to the video footage and you can see
what<00:02:34.080> it's<00:02:34.200> actually<00:02:34.260> like<00:02:34.640> so<00:02:35.690> on<00:02:36.690> this

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
what it's actually like so on this

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.600 
what it's actually like so on this
particular<00:02:37.080> day<00:02:37.230> it's<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:38.070> sort<00:02:38.459> of<00:02:38.490> an

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
particular day it's a sort of an

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.400 
particular day it's a sort of an
overcast<00:02:39.000> day<00:02:39.209> very<00:02:39.630> very<00:02:39.690> light<00:02:39.990> cloud<00:02:40.380> cover

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
overcast day very very light cloud cover

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.880 
overcast day very very light cloud cover
almost<00:02:41.010> like<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.250> misty<00:02:41.670> top<00:02:41.880> cover<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:43.590> the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
almost like a misty top cover and the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.740 
almost like a misty top cover and the
camera<00:02:44.220> seems<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.610> be<00:02:44.700> handling<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.209> contrast

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
camera seems to be handling the contrast

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.930 
camera seems to be handling the contrast
quite<00:02:46.140> well<00:02:46.380> if<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.340> sort<00:02:47.520> of<00:02:47.610> look<00:02:47.670> up

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
quite well if you sort of look up

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.000 
quite well if you sort of look up
towards<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.480> top<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.810> screen<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.980> can

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
towards the top of the screen you can

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.890 
towards the top of the screen you can
see<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.580> comp<00:02:51.390> trail<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:53.120> that<00:02:54.120> calm<00:02:54.420> trial<00:02:54.720> was

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
see a comp trail and that calm trial was

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.630 
see a comp trail and that calm trial was
barely<00:02:55.170> visible<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.860> was<00:02:56.010> surprised<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.370> was

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
barely visible I was surprised it was

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.770 
barely visible I was surprised it was
actually<00:02:56.970> there

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
actually there

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.350 
actually there
it<00:02:58.350> wasn't<00:02:58.890> very<00:02:58.920> very<00:02:59.310> apparent<00:02:59.610> so<00:03:00.239> the

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
it wasn't very very apparent so the

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.050 
it wasn't very very apparent so the
camera<00:03:00.630> was<00:03:00.780> able<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.380> take<00:03:01.820> produce<00:03:02.820> that

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
camera was able to take produce that

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.660 
camera was able to take produce that
light<00:03:03.480> contrast<00:03:04.110> change<00:03:04.560> between<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.459> cloud

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
light contrast change between the cloud

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.940 
light contrast change between the cloud
cover<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.209> light<00:03:06.450> comp<00:03:07.050> trail<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.709> said

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
cover and the light comp trail it said

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.110 
cover and the light comp trail it said
to<00:03:08.040> handle<00:03:08.370> that<00:03:08.459> quite<00:03:08.730> well<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.000> that's

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
to handle that quite well so that's

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.510 
to handle that quite well so that's
probably<00:03:09.300> one<00:03:09.480> big<00:03:09.660> plus<00:03:09.930> for<00:03:09.959> this<00:03:10.260> camera<00:03:10.590> as

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
probably one big plus for this camera as

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.699 
probably one big plus for this camera as
far<00:03:11.760> as<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.030> manages<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.989> light<00:03:13.200> in<00:03:13.500> that

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
far as it manages the the light in that

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.729 
far as it manages the the light in that
way<00:03:13.890> now<00:03:14.820> as<00:03:15.510> far<00:03:15.720> as<00:03:15.780> sharpness<00:03:16.290> cards<00:03:16.590> look

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
way now as far as sharpness cards look

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.170 
way now as far as sharpness cards look
like<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:16.980> don't<00:03:17.040> think<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.459> was<00:03:17.580> as<00:03:17.730> sharp<00:03:17.970> as

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
like I don't think it was as sharp as

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.640 
like I don't think it was as sharp as
the<00:03:18.299> last<00:03:18.480> few<00:03:18.660> cameras<00:03:18.989> off<00:03:19.140> I've<00:03:19.260> tried

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
the last few cameras off I've tried

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.370 
the last few cameras off I've tried
philosophy<00:03:20.549> fpv<00:03:20.940> cameras<00:03:21.330> having<00:03:22.110> said<00:03:22.350> that

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
philosophy fpv cameras having said that

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.890 
philosophy fpv cameras having said that
the<00:03:22.650> last<00:03:22.830> fpv<00:03:23.400> camera<00:03:23.580> I<00:03:23.820> tried<00:03:24.209> out<00:03:24.239> I<00:03:24.450> did<00:03:24.870> a

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
the last fpv camera I tried out I did a

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.590 
the last fpv camera I tried out I did a
review<00:03:25.200> on<00:03:25.260> was<00:03:25.709> an<00:03:25.799> 800<00:03:26.310> TV<00:03:26.670> l<00:03:26.790> now<00:03:27.239> this<00:03:27.390> one's

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
review on was an 800 TV l now this one's

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.370 
review on was an 800 TV l now this one's
a<00:03:28.010> 650<00:03:29.010> TV<00:03:29.220> L<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:29.580> that<00:03:29.610> could<00:03:29.880> be<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.090> reason

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
a 650 TV L so that could be the reason

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.449 
a 650 TV L so that could be the reason
but<00:03:31.380> having<00:03:31.709> said<00:03:31.890> that<00:03:31.950> look<00:03:32.220> at<00:03:32.340> is

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
but having said that look at is

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.460 
but having said that look at is
performing<00:03:33.030> quite<00:03:33.239> well<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.750> footprint<00:03:34.230> size

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
performing quite well the footprint size

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.420 
performing quite well the footprint size
of<00:03:34.680> this<00:03:34.799> camera<00:03:35.130> is<00:03:35.400> quite<00:03:35.880> small<00:03:36.440> so<00:03:37.440> it's

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
of this camera is quite small so it's

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.120 
of this camera is quite small so it's
doing<00:03:38.670> quite<00:03:38.700> well<00:03:38.940> now<00:03:39.299> I'm<00:03:39.570> also

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
doing quite well now I'm also

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
doing quite well now I'm also
transmitting<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.280> video<00:03:41.519> signal<00:03:41.760> so<00:03:42.000> it's

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
transmitting the video signal so it's

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.110 
transmitting the video signal so it's
going<00:03:42.269> via<00:03:42.540> milliwatt<00:03:43.200> transmitter<00:03:43.799> so<00:03:44.730> this

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
going via milliwatt transmitter so this

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.310 
going via milliwatt transmitter so this
is<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.360> sort<00:03:45.540> of<00:03:45.570> thing<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:45.810> would<00:03:45.930> expect<00:03:46.290> to

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
is the sort of thing you would expect to

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.960 
is the sort of thing you would expect to
see<00:03:46.410> when<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:46.950> were<00:03:47.040> if<00:03:47.190> you<00:03:47.280> ever<00:03:47.610> been<00:03:47.760> with

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
see when you were if you ever been with

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.600 
see when you were if you ever been with
it<00:03:48.150> now<00:03:48.959> up<00:03:49.140> here<00:03:49.320> as<00:03:49.440> I'll<00:03:49.620> point<00:03:49.860> up<00:03:50.100> I<00:03:50.280> am

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
it now up here as I'll point up I am

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.759 
it now up here as I'll point up I am
pointing<00:03:50.970> directly<00:03:51.299> into<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.079> Sun<00:03:52.320> and<00:03:52.650> it's

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
pointing directly into the Sun and it's

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.550 
pointing directly into the Sun and it's
really<00:03:53.489> quite<00:03:53.730> bright<00:03:54.150> there<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.660> it<00:03:55.230> seems

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
really quite bright there and it seems

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.670 
really quite bright there and it seems
to<00:03:55.680> be<00:03:55.769> handling<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:56.519> quite<00:03:57.090> well<00:03:57.410> so<00:03:58.410> what

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
to be handling this quite well so what

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.770 
to be handling this quite well so what
you<00:03:58.769> may<00:03:58.920> want<00:03:58.950> to<00:03:59.250> do<00:03:59.400> is<00:03:59.700> I<00:03:59.730> compared<00:04:00.660> the

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
you may want to do is I compared the

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.259 
you may want to do is I compared the
footage<00:04:01.079> from<00:04:01.500> this<00:04:01.739> camera<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.400> some<00:04:03.090> of<00:04:03.180> the

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
footage from this camera to some of the

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.390 
footage from this camera to some of the
other<00:04:03.420> cameras<00:04:04.230> that<00:04:04.320> I've<00:04:04.440> used<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.920> have<00:04:05.370> a

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
other cameras that I've used and have a

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.220 
other cameras that I've used and have a
look<00:04:05.640> at<00:04:05.730> them<00:04:05.820> side-by-side<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:06.959> and

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
look at them side-by-side and and and

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.410 
look at them side-by-side and and and
make<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:07.620> decision<00:04:08.130> but<00:04:08.640> as<00:04:08.790> far<00:04:08.970> as<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.180> build

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
make a decision but as far as the build

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.970 
make a decision but as far as the build
quality<00:04:09.600> look<00:04:09.989> it<00:04:10.079> looks<00:04:10.230> quite<00:04:10.470> good<00:04:10.500> I

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
quality look it looks quite good I

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.520 
quality look it looks quite good I
haven't<00:04:11.459> tried<00:04:11.640> it<00:04:11.850> on<00:04:12.299> an<00:04:12.780> aircraft<00:04:12.930> as<00:04:13.350> yet

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
haven't tried it on an aircraft as yet

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.660 
haven't tried it on an aircraft as yet
but<00:04:13.650> I<00:04:13.739> will<00:04:13.799> actually<00:04:14.070> try<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.400> an<00:04:14.549> aircraft

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
but I will actually try to an aircraft

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.539 
but I will actually try to an aircraft
and<00:04:15.060> see<00:04:15.239> how<00:04:15.360> it<00:04:15.510> actually<00:04:15.780> goes<00:04:16.010> it<00:04:17.010> seems<00:04:17.370> to

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
and see how it actually goes it seems to

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.789 
and see how it actually goes it seems to
handle<00:04:17.729> low<00:04:18.030> light<00:04:18.329> and<00:04:18.630> bright<00:04:19.079> sunlight<00:04:19.560> and

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
handle low light and bright sunlight and

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.270 
handle low light and bright sunlight and
different<00:04:20.790> contrast<00:04:21.299> situations<00:04:21.510> quite<00:04:22.200> well

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
different contrast situations quite well

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.830 
different contrast situations quite well
probably<00:04:24.000> anything<00:04:24.270> I'm<00:04:24.360> not<00:04:24.390> too<00:04:24.599> sure<00:04:24.810> about

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
probably anything I'm not too sure about

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.780 
probably anything I'm not too sure about
at<00:04:25.140> the<00:04:25.200> moment<00:04:25.349> is<00:04:25.530> this

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
at the moment is this

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.160 
at the moment is this
sharpness<00:04:26.180> of<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.360> picture<00:04:26.660> whether<00:04:26.870> it's<00:04:27.050> as

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
sharpness of the picture whether it's as

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.430 
sharpness of the picture whether it's as
sharp<00:04:27.710> as<00:04:27.890> are<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.700> 800<00:04:29.180> TVL<00:04:29.540> cameras<00:04:30.290> off

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
sharp as are the 800 TVL cameras off

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.030 
sharp as are the 800 TVL cameras off
hideout

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040

details for this camera in the

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.410 
details for this camera in the
description<00:04:36.920> and<00:04:37.070> I<00:04:37.520> will<00:04:37.760> do<00:04:38.000> some<00:04:38.210> further
