this<00:00:46.020> project<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.829> quite<00:00:47.100> unique<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.640> felt

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
this project this is quite unique I felt

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.760 
this project this is quite unique I felt
at<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.360> time<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.960> if<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.379> don't<00:00:49.440> want<00:00:49.620> with<00:00:49.739> a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
at that time that if I don't want with a

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.830 
at that time that if I don't want with a
standard<00:00:50.219> layout<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.910> wouldn't<00:00:51.390> really<00:00:51.449> fly

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
standard layout it wouldn't really fly

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.380 
standard layout it wouldn't really fly
that<00:00:52.079> well<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.800> we<00:00:53.010> ended<00:00:53.340> up<00:00:53.430> opening<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:54.239> up

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
that well so we ended up opening it up

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.229 
that well so we ended up opening it up
to<00:00:54.449> help<00:00:55.079> customize<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.789> think<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.090> worked

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
to help customize and I think it worked

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.099 
to help customize and I think it worked
out<00:00:57.360> great<00:00:59.300> these<00:01:00.300> tables<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:00.960> have

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
out great these tables that we have

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.170 
out great these tables that we have
right<00:01:01.199> now<00:01:01.260> they're<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.070> hexagon<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:03.000> such

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
right now they're in a hexagon for such

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.539 
right now they're in a hexagon for such
people<00:01:03.660> at<00:01:03.899> an<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.199> table<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.189> take<00:01:05.400> them

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
people at an on table and you take them

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.370 
people at an on table and you take them
apart<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.090> they<00:01:06.210> converted<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> long<00:01:07.020> rows

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
apart and they converted the long rows

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.070 
apart and they converted the long rows
we<00:01:08.340> have<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> lot<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.760> ideas<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.479> what<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.750> do<00:01:09.960> in

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
we have a lot of ideas on what to do in

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.660 
we have a lot of ideas on what to do in
this<00:01:10.200> space<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:11.189> didn't<00:01:11.400> want<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.610> be

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
this space and we didn't want to be

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.000 
this space and we didn't want to be
limited<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.090> what<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:12.720> had<00:01:12.930> by<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.439> furniture

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
limited to what we had by the furniture

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.100 
limited to what we had by the furniture
so<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.340> furniture<00:01:14.729> itself<00:01:15.000> helps<00:01:15.270> redefine

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
so the furniture itself helps redefine

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.280 
so the furniture itself helps redefine
that<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.530> space<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.130> we<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.509> wanted

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
that the space is that we have I wanted

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.810 
that the space is that we have I wanted
to<00:01:19.350> take<00:01:19.500> dis<00:01:19.920> imagine<00:01:20.310> most<00:01:20.430> i<00:01:20.580> could<00:01:20.640> have

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
to take dis imagine most i could have

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.609 
to take dis imagine most i could have
the<00:01:20.939> natural<00:01:21.330> light<00:01:21.689> coming<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:22.229> through<00:01:22.380> the

windows like this i wanted to make sure

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.109 
windows like this i wanted to make sure
i<00:01:24.689> didn't<00:01:24.930> have<00:01:25.080> any<00:01:25.229> bookcases<00:01:25.680> or<00:01:26.280> larger
