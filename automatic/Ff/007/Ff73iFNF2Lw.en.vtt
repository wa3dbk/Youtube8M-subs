00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.080
 Ahoy 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.380
 It turns out that the rate of fire of a single-tube weapon has a limit. 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.700
 The good news is that you can always add more barrels. 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.460
 Mini gun machine gun 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.840
 a miniature version of the rotating machine gun with horror output 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.660
 So what are the advantages of its multi-barrel design? 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.900
 How does the mini-gun gun become an important part of the FPS game? 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.340
 Is it really able to run like this? 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.000
 Multi-tube firearms have long been a solution to increase the rate of fire 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.040
 The early volley gun pierced the battlefield with its multi-tube volley 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.720
 But every barrel needs to be refilled separately. 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.560
 Green machine gun in the name of the inventor, using a rotating barrel array 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.420
 And automate the process of launching and reloading through mechanical devices 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.980
 Provides unprecedented sustained firepower by turning the crank 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.620
 And in the hands of the coalition camp during the American Civil War 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.320
 Such designs usually have high dumb fire resistance 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.500
 Because any bullet that cannot be shot can be easily removed. 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.680
 This is one of the benefits of not relying on ammunition reaction 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:34.760
 By the beginning of the 20th century, the single-tube machine gun with mature technology became the main solution for continuous fire suppression. 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:42.360
 But the principle of Green's rotating machine gun has become the basis of a new generation of post-war design. 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.040
 (General Electric Company) The company developed the M61 Vulcan cannon in 1959. 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.520
 As a more powerful jet fighter weapon 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.060
 During the Vietnam War, helicopters encountered similar problems in armed forces. 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.640
 Because the conventional machine gun M60 is not ideal in the air. 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.360
 The original 20mm cannon design was reduced to a rifle bullet 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.460
 And this reduced version of the design is called "M134 Mini Cannon" 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.940
 Like its big brother, it also has six barrels that rotate during the fire. 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:29.060
 This will help the air to cool, and can perform the action of lifting, firing, and untwisting on different barrels at the same time. 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.400
 How is the result? 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.780
 M134 can shoot at a rate of 2,000 to 6,000 per minute 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.680
 Without breaking the fire 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.100
 This is a rate of 100 shots per second. 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.300
 It will cover the target area at incredible speed 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.740
 Even if it is firing on a fast moving platform 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.900
 This is a weapon designed for the vehicle. It is usually tied to the helicopter or squatting in the game. 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.200
 Just as it is in reality 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.249
 It is often used in chapters that use turrets, so it is often seen in modern FPS games. 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:09.489
 The ammunition pours out and the enemy succumbs to your endless sweep. 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.729
 Although it will be tied to a fixed route, at least the process is very cool. 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:15.340
 These situations are usually the culmination of the plot 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.940
 Or use a crazy action play to pass the key points of the plot. 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.020
 It also often appears in the final chapter of the story. 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.140
 In the face of overwhelming strong enemies, uninterrupted scanning is your only way to survive 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.940
 Hold the board and try your best 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.500
 However, it is too wasteful to tie such awesome weapon to a fixed point. 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.920
 So although it is unrealistic, it is often used as a hand-held weapon. 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.060
 In this regard, the 1987 film "The Ultimate Warrior" has a great responsibility. 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.400
 Mini gun machine guns play a very important role in the play 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.700
 Torn jungle escape in the face of some potential threats 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.960
 Similar usage can be seen in Devil Terminator 2 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.500
 Although it is used by future robots, it is slightly more believable 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.940
 So, is it not feasible to hold a mini-gun gun? 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:11.249
 A mini gun gun that can provide this level of fire output is a very difficult weapon to master. 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.380
 Its total length is only 80 centimeters, which is shorter than most rifles. 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.100
 Still, it is not so easy to carry. 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.560
 It weighs up to 40 kg and does not contain ammunition. 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.640
 At the same time, its high-frequency shooting and its full-power bullets will make its recoil force extremely large. 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.880
 In addition, the most important thing is that this weapon needs to be connected to an external power supply. 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.240
 Therefore, any practical portability is not feasible. 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.120
 Of course, the virtual things depicted in the game are not bound by reality. 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.460
 So it’s no surprise that early FPS games were influenced by this unforgettable weapon. 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.870
 The chain guns in "German Headquarters" and "Destroyer" set the foundation for later games. 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.940
 Ensuring that there will be a multi-tube weapon for any player to produce in a replica that will be produced later. 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.400
 Technically, this title in the game is wrong. 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.740
 "chain gun" is also a weapon that requires extra power. 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.180
 But it only has one barrel, not as much as a mini gun 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.920
 However, these Green Machine Gun style weapons still set a strong pioneer in early classics. 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.440
 Being able to control this overbearing weapon shows a gesture that is beyond the ordinary or heroic 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.920
 This is an extraordinary feat for any ordinary person. 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.860
 It is also the exclusive weapon of "Reloading Force" 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.020
 No weapon can kill more than the damage caused by the mini gun gun. 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.160
 It has endless ammunition, super high rate of fire and no need to worry about accuracy 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.020
 You can kill all the enemies and don't have to change them in the middle. 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.120
 Similarly, the heavy armor in Jedi Fortress 2 is also born for this purpose. 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.720
 Shooting a lot of bullets is the reason for its existence 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.300
 Some weapons require additional reinforcement to use. 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.320
 Like XMG in "Decisive moment: Advanced Warfare" 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.860
 Can shoot with the help of exoskeleton armor 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.539
 It is not a standard weapon 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.400
 Sometimes kept as a reward 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.620
 Can be used after continuous killing, with lethality beyond conventional weapons 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.820
 At this point it will show its power 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.199
 Although it often shows some shortcomings 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.779
 Heavy weapons can make you less flexible 

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:31.439
 When equipped with a mini gun gun, it usually forces the movement to slow down. 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.200
 Make it easier for you to be retaliated by the enemy 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.160
 Many times, you have to let the barrel start to turn before you can shoot 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.620
 This pause will cause the reactivity to deteriorate and will also imply the enemy your presence. 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.600
 Whistling sound from electric motor 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.640
 Is a prelude to the exclamation of the Holocaust 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.500
 (Snapped) 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.579
 Chaos packed in precision packages 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.360
 Excellent definition of the chain 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.860
 From classic FPS to modern military shooting games 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.320
 No weapon is more ferocious than it 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.400
 On the exact opposite 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.680
 Killing enemies with heavy weapons 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.860
 It’s totally unrealistic to fight with him. 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.820
 But its performance in the virtual world is really great. 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.100
 Mini gun machine gun 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.300
 Six tubes 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.800
 Endless shooting 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.380
 Revenge moment 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.640
 Thank you for watching, until next time, will 

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.040
 (thanks for watching)
