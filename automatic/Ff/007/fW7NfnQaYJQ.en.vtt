00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:07.290
 let's learn how to make a cord 

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:07.290
 for this we take the thread 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.200
 and we leave quite out 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.650
 half of us are going to use these three 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.130
 fingers 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.440
 then to begin we make a loop 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.630
 with a point he would run 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:30.130
 and see 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:33.040
 what is the cape of the sliding knot and 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.660
 let's take the index finger through 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.900
 the thrown 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.900
 and with the other two fingers here 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.129
 OK 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.129
 so 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.650
 to get started 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.150
 we do this or change or change 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.579
 finger 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.390
 and we take through the loop 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.160
 the other end 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.440
 we change our fingers 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.440
 to take the knot and here we throw 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.630
 we throw the macronudo 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.130
 through the loop we put the finger 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.310
 index 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.860
 we take the thread 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.640
 we change our fingers here to 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.640
 catch her voice 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.670
 and with this we throw 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.670
 again through the loop the finger 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.460
 index 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.460
 we take here we change the hand to 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.790
 take the knot and throw until it 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.430
 go tightening the loop down 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.740
 and thus it is forming a thin cord another 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.300
 once through the thrown I put the 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.700
 index I take the thread 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.700
 change the subject hand and throw 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:04.200
 through the thrown I take the strand 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.200
 change hands and pull 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.259
 thrown 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.519
 I take the thread 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.519
 change mannequin 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.130
 I pick up the thread change mannitol 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.620
 and this is the cord that we have not 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.620
 coming out
