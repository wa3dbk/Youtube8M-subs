00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.450
 Now we go to the choice of how 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.490
 above 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.300
 Muromi we already understood coil 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.140
 As far as I understand it is chosen as a class 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.780
 rod 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.260
 which is not lining all this should be 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:35.650
 capacity before and here of course immediately 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.980
 need to stop here on such a story 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.530
 I want to show that it was immediately visible 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.380
 very clearly here is the capacity of this 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.080
 the coils here you can see that it is very 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.080
 low here it is so called methane 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.760
 this is your already high-grade 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:58.000
 what that is his coils are straightened 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.950
 let's say this is one important difference and 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.840
 the second 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:06.840
 graphite on or metal well there is 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.290
 more options metal case and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.380
 graphite spool 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.110
 I think that this is due to the price to 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.090
 make everything as cheap as possible like us 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.369
 the mechanism itself is aluminum 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.050
 the spool case is made of graphite and the whole 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:25.690
 respectively reached signature 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.170
 coils of course now for you probably 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.270
 potatoes will serve only 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.009
 storage place on principle yes to no one 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.899
 there is the only thing that's probably 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.520
 choose yourself 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:41.729
 price range if you donâ€™t 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.560
 as they say do not covet the metal 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.920
 you can get some kind of coil out 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.950
 graphite by the way it is enough 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.969
 decent companies in directories stands in 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.990
 discharge coil 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:57.289
 during the winter season it does not freeze 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.000
 from frost bagel roads leaves there 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.229
 all such things she is 0 less than 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.799
 metal as it were 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.390
 the number for it just means 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.569
 of course they are kind 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.140
 in size completely different of these 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.780
 coils 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:18.650
 it also says that to the cord 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.810
 will surely be fastened down so 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.180
 this is the cord extension 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.660
 but the lining is so called under it 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.690
 which is obliged not to release too 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.269
 glen there 50 meters 100 meters two hundred 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.290
 who needs where if it's sea fishing 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:40.640
 there and 300 put on seals put it but 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.470
 for a lot of fishing for us enough 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.480
 meter fifty come up enough 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.250
 always on coils also indicated there 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.260
 their capacity or what class are they 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.109
 let's say the coil name is written because 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.900
 title immediately says 4 5 it means 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:00.989
 that we can put a cord here 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.269
 fourth and fifth grade but since 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.329
 it is clear what could this weight 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.620
 so we said that the cord is weight 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:13.250
 then head 5 cord from of course will 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.780
 occupy more space than head 4 what 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.370
 accordingly if we are north there 4 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.090
 mean betting we can put 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.549
 more 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.880
 And if we wind 5 here with this goblin 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.630
 marked and and after complete 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.680
 this is clear what it means exactly the same 45 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.510
 almost everywhere 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.940
 if for example the coil is considered 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.160
 910 here the story will be exactly that 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.440
 Nine reeling mono this potatoes 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.500
 allow more be king a dozen 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.570
 accordingly less be well there already 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.610
 will come into force balance who loves 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.420
 balance on know our grandmother 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:51.410
 payments we have time taylor back 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:54.320
 it's like who says like it here 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.480
 i showed it looks here on reels 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.660
 wound cord here below we see 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.750
 orange is our backing someone who 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:06.910
 this is so called in shorts but he 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.200
 took place further wound the cord here it is 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.560
 specially took and two-color that here it is 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.660
 light green color this cord is also a cord 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.910
 his head is like on black on 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.570
 just tonus and here it is already wound 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.780
 suspensions 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.300
 That looks like this already 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.110
 wound coil but there still is 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.900
 place 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.120
 that is, you could wind more here 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.270
 this but then the story is different 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.270
 when you fish out and you can't 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.090
 distribute the cord with your finger for such 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.030
 even laying the cord knits the so-called 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.310
 gorochka and this crust rests here 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.030
 and you will not have to wind the cord 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.650
 coming up with something so having a coil 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.960
 not such a package 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.300
 although it is not a problem here 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.940
 different amount you can wind it 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.190
 a little bit like retro 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.599
 such a clear gap is seen here 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.910
 he is not a very big one 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:03.710
 distributed to the sides so here if 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.630
 sides you finger while fishing you 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.710
 you can't do it 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.680
 rests here this 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.349
 foot but in the mount here this foot and he 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.910
 and there will give a coil spinning because 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:16.639
 you can't spread it with your finger 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.530
 in time vyvazhivaniya especially large because 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.569
 that the clutch will work and you will 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.660
 ass is not just this here 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:26.389
 distribution here is the main made in 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.820
 the width is therefore very necessary to follow 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:33.710
 the amount of cord that is here by this 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:37.070
 clearly distributed around the edges and a bit 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.889
 so let's say so if this coil is 79 then 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.870
 Almost 9 cord here will be very 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:45.289
 short floor on grade 9 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:48.919
 yes that is, it includes the possibility 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:50.599
 from 7 to 9 then 7 8 9 respectively 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.699
 since we had 56 there 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:56.930
 from 3 cords that is 7 8 and 9 classes 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:06:00.050
 accordingly also decrease 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:04.490
 increase the capacity of this b-king 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:08.270
 understand that is the volume of this coil he 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:14.000
 noticeably smaller but this coil is also 9 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:16.130
 class and this 9 is 9 10 and this is 7 8 9 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.030
 that is, if you look accordingly 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.250
 on their capacity 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.750
 itâ€™s very clear here that I can 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.419
 it will be difficult to introduce 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:26.780
 and here if I wear as much as possible 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:29.120
 allowable 09 means here viking 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.729
 almost did not get at all 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.919
 slightly understandable that is, we change 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:37.070
 the volume that is the coil we will have less 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:40.130
 for our aesthetics for just under 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:42.480
 but we will lose this way 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.370
 coil 5 class and here for example 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.560
 also ready class here is clearly seen that 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.870
 damn here I can belkin belkin not 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.520
 so much that will be healthy for example 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.190
 compared to this potato that is 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.720
 everything is clear, I think in our work 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.940
 talking is no longer worth it because 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.190
 everything else is superfluous, he also happens 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.050
 different to break it is just as connected 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:04.190
 mask fishing salmon driven 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.660
 something we have breaks them decently it 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:09.330
 29 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:12.930
 by plane yes it allows aside 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:15.390
 stock so do not all matches everywhere 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:18.210
 this clearly means we consider everything 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:19.710
 choose coils coil with one and 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.290
 last instance not of course 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:25.170
 any reel divided by money 

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:28.710
 graphite it will certainly be cheaper 

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.550
 any coil which is made by method 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.070
 press 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.200
 she too will be cheaper reel 

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:36.830
 carved from a single piece of boost 

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.830
 certainly more expensive
