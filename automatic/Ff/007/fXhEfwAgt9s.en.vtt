00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:16.270 
what is not hopefully you'll be able to
tell<00:03:12.080> this<00:03:13.080> shoe<00:03:13.380> is<00:03:13.880> not<00:03:14.880> properly<00:03:15.450> late<00:03:15.750> as

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
you can see the laces have been

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.680 
you can see the laces have been
tightened<00:03:22.440> all<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.950> way<00:03:23.450> usually<00:03:24.450> when<00:03:24.600> you

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
tightened all the way usually when you

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.229 
tightened all the way usually when you
tie<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.900> shoe<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:26.310> tight<00:03:26.549> and<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:26.910> pull<00:03:27.120> it

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
tie a shoe you tight and you pull it

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.569 
tie a shoe you tight and you pull it
through<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:28.890> want<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.190> make<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.430> as<00:03:29.549> tight

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
through and you want to make it as tight

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.470 
through and you want to make it as tight
as<00:03:29.910> you<00:03:30.000> can<00:03:30.650> so<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:31.680> all<00:03:31.859> matches<00:03:32.480> however

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
as you can so it all matches however

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.780 
as you can so it all matches however
with<00:03:33.630> this<00:03:33.780> shoe<00:03:35.329> you've<00:03:36.329> now<00:03:36.630> closed<00:03:37.790> the

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
upper here so it's super tight and it's

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.349 
upper here so it's super tight and it's
going<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.120> really<00:03:42.690> be<00:03:43.430> snug<00:03:44.430> on<00:03:44.579> your<00:03:44.639> foot<00:03:44.910> so

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
properly installed is something that

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.849 
properly installed is something that
looks<00:04:01.470> like<00:04:01.530> this<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.970> looks<00:04:03.239> almost<00:04:03.709> if<00:04:04.709> you

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
looks like this it looks almost if you

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:12.830 
looks like this it looks almost if you
can<00:04:05.069> kind<00:04:05.430> of<00:04:05.519> tell<00:04:07.700> loose<00:04:11.389> through<00:04:12.389> this<00:04:12.510> part

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
can kind of tell loose through this part

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.629 
can kind of tell loose through this part
and<00:04:14.600> that's<00:04:15.600> because<00:04:15.840> I<00:04:16.289> put<00:04:16.889> these<00:04:17.039> in<00:04:17.310> when<00:04:17.609> I

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
and that's because I put these in when I

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.180 
and that's because I put these in when I
had<00:04:17.820> my<00:04:17.850> foot<00:04:18.299> in<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.720> shoe<00:04:18.750> so<00:04:19.739> these<00:04:19.859> laces

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
had my foot in the shoe so these laces

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.719 
had my foot in the shoe so these laces
actually<00:04:21.289> fit<00:04:22.289> perfectly<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.919> my<00:04:23.039> foot<00:04:23.370> so<00:04:23.700> I

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
actually fit perfectly to my foot so I

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.159 
actually fit perfectly to my foot so I
have<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.419> know<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.630> proper<00:04:24.930> amount<00:04:24.990> of

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
have you know the proper amount of

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.649 
have you know the proper amount of
pressure<00:04:25.440> being<00:04:25.770> applied<00:04:25.890> to<00:04:26.099> my<00:04:26.310> foot<00:04:26.659> the

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:27.659 
pressure being applied to my foot the

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.140 
pressure being applied to my foot the
whole<00:04:27.810> way<00:04:27.960> through<00:04:28.349> and<00:04:28.620> I<00:04:29.310> never<00:04:29.700> have<00:04:29.970> to

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
whole way through and I never have to

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.210 
whole way through and I never have to
actually<00:04:30.270> lace<00:04:30.599> these<00:04:30.840> laces<00:04:31.110> up<00:04:31.380> again<00:04:31.950> after

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
actually lace these laces up again after

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.899 
actually lace these laces up again after
that<00:04:32.820> first<00:04:33.090> time<00:04:33.979> you<00:04:34.979> know<00:04:35.099> all<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:35.370> had<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:35.640> do

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:35.909 
that first time you know all I had to do

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:39.730 
that first time you know all I had to do
was<00:04:36.440> loop<00:04:37.440> him<00:04:37.620> through<00:04:37.979> with<00:04:38.400> my<00:04:38.640> foot<00:04:38.909> in<00:04:39.120> and

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
was loop him through with my foot in and

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.640 
was loop him through with my foot in and
I<00:04:40.740> was<00:04:40.919> left<00:04:41.159> with<00:04:41.340> about<00:04:41.580> four<00:04:42.180> or<00:04:42.210> five

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
I was left with about four or five

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.610 
I was left with about four or five
little<00:04:43.650> knobs<00:04:43.979> here<00:04:44.430> on<00:04:44.610> each<00:04:44.760> side<00:04:45.090> and<00:04:45.479> I<00:04:46.409> can

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
little knobs here on each side and I can

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.980 
little knobs here on each side and I can
pretty<00:04:46.740> much<00:04:46.890> just<00:04:47.159> leave<00:04:47.460> them<00:04:47.729> in<00:04:47.970> when<00:04:48.930> i

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
pretty much just leave them in when i

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:38.690 
opposed to the stretch I know oval so
that's<00:05:33.120> how<00:05:33.330> they<00:05:33.599> should<00:05:33.659> look<00:05:34.050> and<00:05:35.510> if<00:05:37.700> they

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
that's how they should look and if they

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.969 
that's how they should look and if they
don't<00:05:38.880> then<00:05:39.690> you<00:05:40.169> probably<00:05:40.469> put<00:05:40.710> your<00:05:40.770> foot
