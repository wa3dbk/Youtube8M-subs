 Hello everyone, Igor is with you again and today 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.940
 we will finish building 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:12.480
 medieval house that is the second part 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:16.850
 so let's start let's take an oak tree 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:21.830
 and made just like 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:26.640
 in the lower case, that is, set 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:28.820
 so bulging 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.480
 playing logs 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.480
 fine 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.920
 and so we spend around the perimeter 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.469
 fine here 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.820
