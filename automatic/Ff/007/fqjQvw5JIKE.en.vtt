00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 all youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.540
 new technique sloth video at this time 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.690
 Let's compare the new Nexus 7 tablet 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.550
 with the apple ipad mini back only once 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.559
 only from outside perform detailed 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.599
 I have the new nexus unfortunately 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.180
 not yet, but do not worry 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.580
 something else at first glance directly 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.430
 it is noticeable that the net is so 7 a 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.470
 whole corner is slimmer than the ipad 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.650
 mini that's because google 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.320
 or asus in open 16 too 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.600
 ten form factor sets in the display 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.780
 while apple again traditionally on 4 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.790
 to 3 sets so what times 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.190
 next to each other and look at where 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.969
 they are similar and that is the length 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.500
 both 20 inches long in width 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.260
 we had already I put that 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.469
 nexus anyway on the ipad mini with it 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.370
 we see or how much it really is 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:00.149
 wider is so pi times thumb flush 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.789
 created and therefore was still here 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.890
 a whole corner more out there you can 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.350
 Now work again on what for what 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.420
 what I read is five ideal is where 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.250
 one also sees me from websites or 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.400
 What is better then again for 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.900
 watching movies and and and still remains 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.630
 one direction and that is the thick one or the other 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.740
 device class he was the thin one 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.610
 next to each other , we already recognize that 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.320
 the silver ipad mini corners is younger 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.450
 and if you have the devices 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.030
 turn back when we have the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.170
 put devices side by side and then 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.270
 then go over with your finger then 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.850
 I notice that goes down that's how it is 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.630
 one and a half millimeters the ipad 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.210
 mini is still narrower then of the 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.560
 front let's have a look we have 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.259
 here neither a homebutton at the ipad 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.920
 mini zum rheinbrÃ¼cken really something to do 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.110
 tap 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.439
 while so to impress while we 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.990
 here only on screen the three buttons have 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:00.360
 then our front camera at the iPad with 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.750
 I at the nexus 7 easily to the right 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.729
 Side inclined the nexus 7 offers here 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.560
 below a notification led 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.770
 which you then flash funny when you new 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.920
 news have 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.000
 worry about the devices pages on the 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.800
 right side 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.650
 nothing to see in both devices 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:25.480
 the top of both devices there 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.580
 or here the headphones 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.380
 input microphone 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.540
 I do not see a microphone here now 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.820
 at the nexus 7 and we have here 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.710
 off switch on the ipad mini right side 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.050
 That's where we come to on the off 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.730
 switch at the fruit you can see that there 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.310
 everything on and off the nexus 4 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.900
 and the volume keys 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.730
 volume-keys we have the ipad 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.580
 mini also on the side and then the 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.090
 rotation lok or minutes depending on how 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:58.300
 to program the lock and 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.330
 here is the name sim card slot at 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.860
 ipad mini the nexus 7 has no sim 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.580
 card slot that's only the first 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.280
 Wlan version is the older version 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.830
 will be handed over sometime the weeks 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:16.120
 bottom at the ipad our lightning 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:20.410
 connection and two speakers and at 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.770
 nexus our micro usb port also hdmi 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.530
 out supported and micro I see there 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.150
 down right now it does not have it though 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.060
 right here we had a micro at 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.280
 at the next seven and second find 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.110
 I just do not know what the nexus 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.360
 but that has been on the side of the 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.480
 back also clearly here we have 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.440
 a speaker for opening was here 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.300
 we have another one 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.030
 that means real left and right 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.220
 speakers, of course, the two 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.090
 shine backwards or to the side 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.340
 promises nexus and google great 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.920
 surround simulated sound on everyone 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.590
 case stereo well then how it really 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.360
 sounds like the test was on another time 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.340
 each case here laterally separated the 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.760
 speakers while both at the 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.989
 ipad mini come from one side 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.330
 back of our shining silver 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.750
 apple that likes to scratch and ours 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.600
 Antennas and 5 megapixel camera at 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.590
 ipad mini antique inlaid look 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.739
 protected 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.840
 and our rubberized back at the nexus 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.550
 7 while apple keeps on being 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.500
 this is not aluminum 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.320
 ruined but polycarbonate what I like 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.120
 rubbery feels like our 5 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.740
 megapixel camera is also such a 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.840
 millimeter and then 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.270
 each not on the smooth 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.960
 tables under the floor or so lying around 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.240
 so but what did we forget exactly 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.090
 the weight and that's what we get now 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.729
 Both devices are really lightweight 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.139
 equipment 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:53.020
 I looked at the old nexus seven long 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:56.830
 or since the state uses too 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.360
 ipad mini since the state used and until 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.550
 In two months was always that 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.190
 ipad mini my favorite by it alone 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.440
 that it was so thin and light 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:09.190
 we have the wlan version here 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:12.490
 has 308 grams the lte version at the 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:15.220
 ipad mini then 3 112 grams and that was 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.380
 So far always the easiest thing I have 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.699
 I could somehow imagine that 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.700
 You could be comfortable with three 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:23.110
 fingering just so keep it up 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.000
 lay in bed and I could with it 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.250
 for hours read who knows maybe 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.669
 300 ramp one or the other too 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.070
 a lot of 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:34.180
 he wishes 100 150 grams so kindel 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:36.340
 weight but I can thus totally clear 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.039
 and now here comes nexus with the 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.979
 second generation and is at 290 grams 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:45.630
 in the wlan version so again almost 20 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:47.380
 gram lighter ipad mini and 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.729
 I notice the difference 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:53.889
 I have to say no, quite honestly these 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:55.840
 20 grams because I'm too much trampling 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:59.020
 For this I do not notice a difference 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:03.130
 but I definitely realize that is 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.840
 difference in thickness and there win 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.060
 the ipad of course i still have here 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.490
 the feeling my fingers are still animals 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.289
 closer together this is even thinner 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.229
 and somehow then it has to be yes 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:15.669
 even easier 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:16.840
 Well, this association goes through one 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:19.270
 the head and then back to the 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.620
 ipad mini may seem easier 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.930
 but be that by it one 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.910
 ticking feels thicker you think 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:29.770
 somehow directly it also has to be heavier 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:31.539
 But both devices are super great 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.240
 to keep in a photo and with it 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:36.849
 to read for hours that in any case 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.590
 the form factor in use is one 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:39.460
 not so much from the outside what 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.180
 noticed 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:46.060
 I have to say so far was the ipad mini 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.520
 clear design winners here with the 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:51.099
 but I'm sending silver 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:54.760
 Must say this smooth polycarbonate 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:58.930
 gummed by the nexus 7 is also very effective 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:00.490
 very chic so I have to say nexus 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.830
 seven new generation also visually 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.570
 really a big leap forward 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.030
 if you compare it with the ipad mini 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:09.310
 and the big weight difference it 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.840
 finally extended to the inner 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.340
 worth and the fantastic display the 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.130
 not for me now is the video 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:17.200
 For too long, thank you for watching 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.270
 Oh, what could have been forgotten? 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.800
 somehow also to the train externality 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.140
 We also have of course an even 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:27.310
 fc-fan is building on the back and this 

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:29.979
 ski wireless wireless charging what that 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:32.200
 ipad mini of course does not offer 

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:33.940
 at least not in the first generation 

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.950
 but wait for the next weeks 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.140
 because the successor or perhaps 

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.360
 months for the successor of the ipad mini 

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:43.330
 he must come soon and nexus has 

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.740
 really well presented here so that's it 

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:48.330
 Thanks for watching it makes it good 

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.330
 and bye video bye
