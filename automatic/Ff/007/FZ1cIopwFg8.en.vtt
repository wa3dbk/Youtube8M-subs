00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:31.320
So, the Story mode itself will be about 10hrs or something, just like Storm 3.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:42.500
Though of course, there's not just the single player campaign,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:54.980
there are some other modes and features in the game that we currently can't tell you about.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:10.540
Ok, so first thing is, no need to rush, hold on a little more because as you saw the new trailer, you saw a piece of the Kaguya in there.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.300
You know, we aren't yet sure how much content will be in the Story for this game yet.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:26.780
Also, this game is based on Naruto Shippuden,  "The Last Naruto the Movie", and also "Boruto the Movie", are not part of the Shippuden Storyline.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.280
It is quite complicated, but please understand this is kind of special that we were able to succeed in including "The Last" characters, for example: Sasuke &amp; Sakura.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.660
And also we succeeded in bringing Boruto and Sarada - those two are exclusive playable characters, for pre-order only.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.020
We are lucky, fortunate that our licencors allowed us to bring them into the game, so it's kind of special - but we can't say much yet about the details.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.200
So, the TAG system is going to be available on both Story and online and free battles.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:06.760
Regarding the Story mode, because in some situations, you know you only control one character in the team,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.760
so it depends on the Story situation in the battles - but it is going to be available.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.380
So, Storm 4's Story is going to be a continuation from the end of Storm 3.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:35.380
But, at the same time, we are considering how to recap any past story before Storm 3 of course, so we are trying to find out how we can do it -

00:02:35.585 --> 00:02:49.065
fast track the story for Storm 4, so that the people who play the Story mode can say "oh ok, I remember this happening before"

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:58.240
that kind of stuff we are still considering right now, but we are not fixed in how we can express that yet.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:13.760
So, because we are still developing the main game right now, we're not really considering what kind of things we can do in the post launch,

00:03:14.184 --> 00:03:19.524
But the one thing we can say is that previously we did a lot of costumes/outfits,

00:03:19.524 --> 00:03:33.044
if we are going to do something with the post launch DLCs, we are not going to think about it in the same kind of costume DLC like we did in Storm 3,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.520
maybe we have to think of something different.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.840
So regarding the awakening and secret technique, because the game is including leader change,

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.700
you can switch the character to have your support as the leader, which means your support character can use the awakening and secret technique, too -

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.560
it means in Storm 4 all the characters can use Awakening and secret technique.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.020
Also, under certain conditions - 3 of your characters in the team can use awakening at the same time - it's a "link awakening".

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.640
And also, certain team members can make their combinations secret jutsu which means the special secret technique can be unleashed within the team.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.820
so all of this is going to be available in Storm 4.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:19.040
And also, regarding the wall battles, we are still considering how we can express them in this game, but yes, we are trying to express this wall battle system in the Story mode.

00:04:24.458 --> 00:04:26.458
I let Bandai Namco Entertainment answer this.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:43.080
So, regarding pre-order contents, for example "the Last" characters: Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura these are only access characters -

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:51.220
which means people who pre-order the game, they can unlock those characters from day 1.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:58.140
But, it means if they play the game, of course they can unlock those characters.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:13.280
But, also regarding Boruto &amp; Sarada and also the Kikashi sixth hokage costume, all 3 are going to be  totally exclusive to pre-orders,

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:25.860
this is going to be a very special thing - as we explained before, especially for characters such as Boruto &amp; Sarada.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:39.460
We are fortunate that we can bring these into the game.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:54.180
Regarding those characters, from the movie "The Last" they are not given much time to perform any movement or actions,

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:04.100
so right now we are not considering to add them as playable characters as well as their skin or costumes too.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.520
So, we are not considering anything about the future for after Storm 4.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:19.060
Because even though the Naruto manga has been done, but right now, Kishimoto Sensei is writing new Naruto stories in Weekly Jump,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.000
based on Boruto, and also new movies regarding Boruto is coming up soon, in Summer.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.740
In Japan, we call it a "new generation project for Naruto".

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.640
The Naruto manga is done, but however, the Naruto franchise itself is still expanding within the project, so, also with Storm 4,

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.500
this is part of the project, of course, and we are really happy that we are contributing towards expanding the Naruto franchise worldwide within the project.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.940
Also, at the same time  we are trying to put as much elements as we can from the new generation project into this game.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.740
So, as a total wise, we are trying to expand the Naruto franchise, and also try to bring some excitement to those waiting fans.
