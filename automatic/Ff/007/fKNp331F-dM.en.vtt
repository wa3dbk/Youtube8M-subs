savita<00:00:10.250> by<00:00:10.400> rich<00:00:10.610> Pinta<00:00:11.030> I<00:00:11.060> got<00:00:11.270> this<00:00:11.420> request

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
savita by rich Pinta I got this request

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.110 
savita by rich Pinta I got this request
the<00:00:12.200> other<00:00:12.350> day<00:00:12.590> the<00:00:13.130> person<00:00:13.340> wanted<00:00:13.820> to<00:00:13.850> know

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
the other day the person wanted to know

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.460 
the other day the person wanted to know
how<00:00:14.870> do<00:00:14.930> you<00:00:15.110> drive<00:00:15.980> up<00:00:16.280> on<00:00:16.610> rims<00:00:17.029> I<00:00:17.470> guess

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
how do you drive up on rims I guess

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.400 
how do you drive up on rims I guess
they're<00:00:19.070> finding<00:00:19.430> it<00:00:19.670> a<00:00:19.880> real<00:00:20.720> troublesome

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
they're finding it a real troublesome

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.760 
they're finding it a real troublesome
situation<00:00:22.630> now<00:00:23.630> the<00:00:23.689> only<00:00:23.960> difference<00:00:24.410> that<00:00:24.500> I

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
situation now the only difference that I

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.820 
situation now the only difference that I
have<00:00:25.580> here<00:00:25.880> that<00:00:26.170> conventional<00:00:27.170> ramps<00:00:27.440> don't

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
have here that conventional ramps don't

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.460 
have here that conventional ramps don't
is<00:00:28.070> I<00:00:28.400> have<00:00:28.700> an<00:00:28.820> extension<00:00:29.300> over<00:00:29.600> it<00:00:29.870> the

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
is I have an extension over it the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.790 
is I have an extension over it the
reason<00:00:30.770> being<00:00:30.980> is<00:00:31.250> these<00:00:32.119> metal<00:00:32.540> ramps<00:00:33.050> like

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
reason being is these metal ramps like

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.200 
reason being is these metal ramps like
to<00:00:34.040> push<00:00:34.390> on<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:35.720> cement<00:00:36.050> floor<00:00:37.000> so<00:00:38.000> what<00:00:38.150> I

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
to push on the cement floor so what I

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.280 
to push on the cement floor so what I
did<00:00:38.540> is<00:00:38.750> I<00:00:39.650> took<00:00:39.860> these<00:00:40.010> pieces<00:00:40.370> of<00:00:40.580> 2x4

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.979 

there's<00:00:45.290> a<00:00:45.409> bolt<00:00:45.739> through<00:00:46.010> here<00:00:46.370> and<00:00:46.989> there's

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
there's a bolt through here and there's

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.229 
there's a bolt through here and there's
a<00:00:48.080> hole<00:00:48.320> in<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.620> ramps<00:00:49.040> I<00:00:49.280> didn't<00:00:49.850> want<00:00:50.000> to<00:00:50.089> do

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
a hole in the ramps I didn't want to do

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:51.490 
a hole in the ramps I didn't want to do
it<00:00:50.360> because<00:00:50.479> you<00:00:50.809> don't<00:00:50.930> really<00:00:51.140> want<00:00:51.409> to

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
it because you don't really want to

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.649 
it because you don't really want to
weaken<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:51.949> ramps<00:00:52.280> but<00:00:52.460> it's<00:00:53.089> worked<00:00:53.420> out

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
weaken the ramps but it's worked out

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.680 
weaken the ramps but it's worked out
quite<00:00:53.930> well<00:00:54.050> hasn't<00:00:54.710> had<00:00:55.190> any<00:00:55.400> issues<00:00:56.210> with

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
quite well hasn't had any issues with

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:05.760 
quite well hasn't had any issues with
that<00:00:57.760> and<00:00:59.260> so<00:01:00.260> what<00:01:00.409> happens<00:01:00.890> is<00:01:04.420> when<00:01:05.420> the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
that and so what happens is when the

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.219 
that and so what happens is when the
vehicle<00:01:06.770> rolls<00:01:07.130> up<00:01:07.460> on<00:01:07.640> this<00:01:08.420> wooden<00:01:08.930> piece

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
vehicle rolls up on this wooden piece

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.639 
vehicle rolls up on this wooden piece
right<00:01:09.500> here<00:01:09.560> it<00:01:10.210> clamps<00:01:11.210> down<00:01:11.270> on<00:01:12.020> it<00:01:12.619> the

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
right here it clamps down on it the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.789 
right here it clamps down on it the
force<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:13.789> weight<00:01:14.030> of<00:01:14.299> the<00:01:14.509> vehicle<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.619> that

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
force the weight of the vehicle so that

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.580 
force the weight of the vehicle so that
pushes<00:01:16.280> down<00:01:16.520> on<00:01:16.759> the<00:01:17.030> ribs<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:17.539> prevents<00:01:18.469> it

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
pushes down on the ribs and prevents it

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.359 
pushes down on the ribs and prevents it
from<00:01:18.680> sliding<00:01:19.219> along<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.329> floor<00:01:20.920> plus<00:01:21.920> it's<00:01:22.219> a

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
from sliding along the floor plus it's a

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.969 
from sliding along the floor plus it's a
more<00:01:23.329> gradual<00:01:24.219> incline<00:01:25.219> up<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.729> ribs<00:01:26.979> so

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
more gradual incline up the ribs so

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.499 
more gradual incline up the ribs so
let's<00:01:28.219> get<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.490> car<00:01:28.700> in<00:01:28.939> here<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:29.240> show<00:01:29.450> you

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
let's get the car in here and show you

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.020 
let's get the car in here and show you
how<00:01:29.840> I<00:01:30.140> Drive<00:01:31.039> up<00:01:31.969> on<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.390> ribs<00:01:32.600> now<00:01:34.030> the

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
how I Drive up on the ribs now the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.149 
how I Drive up on the ribs now the
technique<00:01:35.479> that<00:01:35.539> I<00:01:35.780> use<00:01:36.140> to<00:01:36.469> get<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:36.799> vehicle

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
technique that I use to get the vehicle

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.700 
technique that I use to get the vehicle
up<00:01:37.250> on<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.490> ramps<00:01:37.850> is<00:01:37.969> I<00:01:38.420> make<00:01:39.289> sure<00:01:39.320> the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
up on the ramps is I make sure the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.069 
up on the ramps is I make sure the
window<00:01:40.369> on<00:01:40.789> the<00:01:40.909> driver's<00:01:41.210> side<00:01:41.240> is<00:01:41.539> down<00:01:41.750> and

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
window on the driver's side is down and

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.069 
window on the driver's side is down and
then<00:01:42.979> I<00:01:43.130> open<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.759> door<00:01:43.969> up<00:01:44.299> and<00:01:44.570> look<00:01:44.810> through

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
then I open the door up and look through

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.469 
then I open the door up and look through
the<00:01:45.170> window<00:01:45.320> that<00:01:45.920> way<00:01:46.130> I<00:01:46.159> can<00:01:46.549> see<00:01:46.909> where<00:01:47.299> the

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
the window that way I can see where the

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.310 
the window that way I can see where the
front<00:01:47.689> tire<00:01:47.929> is<00:01:48.729> so<00:01:49.729> when<00:01:50.090> I<00:01:50.119> Drive<00:01:51.049> up<00:01:51.200> the

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
front tire is so when I Drive up the

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.489 
front tire is so when I Drive up the
ramps<00:01:51.740> I<00:01:51.829> know<00:01:51.890> exactly<00:01:52.719> when<00:01:53.719> to<00:01:53.749> stop<00:01:54.170> all

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:54.499 
ramps I know exactly when to stop all

00:01:54.499 --> 00:02:24.060 
ramps I know exactly when to stop all
right<00:01:54.710> let<00:01:55.310> me<00:01:55.340> demonstrate

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.430 

every<00:02:25.070> time<00:02:26.140> no<00:02:27.140> problem<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:29.840> have<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.320> be

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
every time no problem you have to be

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.170 
every time no problem you have to be
able<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.710> know<00:02:30.890> where<00:02:31.160> that<00:02:31.370> front<00:02:31.610> wheel<00:02:31.910> is

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
able to know where that front wheel is

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.810 
able to know where that front wheel is
otherwise<00:02:32.630> you're<00:02:33.470> going<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.680> be<00:02:33.950> short<00:02:34.340> or<00:02:34.610> go

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
otherwise you're going to be short or go

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.440 
otherwise you're going to be short or go
over<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:36.320> far<00:02:37.130> end<00:02:39.460> so<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:40.670> key<00:02:40.910> is<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.420> be

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
over the far end so the key is to be

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.810 
over the far end so the key is to be
able<00:02:41.570> to<00:02:42.020> see<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.100> front<00:02:43.370> tire<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:46.610> that's

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
able to see that front tire so that's

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.850 
able to see that front tire so that's
all<00:02:47.060> there<00:02:47.210> is<00:02:47.300> to<00:02:47.570> driving<00:02:47.900> your<00:02:48.170> vehicle<00:02:48.620> up

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
all there is to driving your vehicle up

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.850 
all there is to driving your vehicle up
on<00:02:49.100> car<00:02:49.460> ramps
