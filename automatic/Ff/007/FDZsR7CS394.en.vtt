the<00:02:31.290> reason<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:31.829> did<00:02:32.070> is<00:02:32.400> because<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.880> made<00:02:33.450> my

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
the reason I did is because I made my

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.640 
the reason I did is because I made my

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
own broth and it had no salt in it so if

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.750 
own broth and it had no salt in it so if
you're<00:02:37.890> using<00:02:38.160> store-bought<00:02:39.769> broth<00:02:40.769> chicken
