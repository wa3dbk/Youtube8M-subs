pretty good movie actually but I meant
just<00:01:05.159> at<00:01:05.400> first<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.790> thought<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> trailer<00:01:06.479> once

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720

just at first I thought the trailer once
it<00:01:06.869> says<00:01:07.049> good<00:01:07.340> movie<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:09.119> know<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:10.040> movie<00:01:11.040> was

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
the movie was better than the trailer

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.700 
the movie was better than the trailer
but<00:01:54.990> anyway
