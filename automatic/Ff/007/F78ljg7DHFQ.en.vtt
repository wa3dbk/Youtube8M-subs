00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.730
 then here we are faced with a sangiovese plant 

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:15.569
 details 10 12 years as you can see the presentation of 2009 was a lot 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:19.119
 balanced you vote from the size of the kicks 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.159
 which practically uniform regardless of where 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:25.269
 inserted on the cel 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.859
 this is a first born 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.759
 that allows us precisely d 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.760
 defining this plant now in full equilibrium wins everything 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.600
 greenhouse and plan production for 2010 at this point in this phase 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.690
 we have to 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.490
 will provide for seca pruning which consists precisely in removing 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.420
 all the kicks that developed last year they produced 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.990
 worrying about leaving pearls. productive 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.340
 I was the black corsair 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.890
 from which you can grow 2 branches again 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.950
 that will allow us 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.950
 to produce the grapes also in 2010 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.200
 so these we must 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.690
 exam in this world 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.420
 cart spur we must always choose the football we say it remains 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.920
 lower down is along the line with respect to the row of the row 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.440
 because this is much easier outside in the summer 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.820
 for the management of the part of the canopy from the plant 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.360
 and we must ensure that we have these production points well spaced between 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.910
 of them 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.980
 parquet this allows us to avoid 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.770
 don giosy dangerous bundling of the bunches 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.220
 cards will finish within then even a rapid deterioration of the long with them 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.220
 there was a closed fist the first down payment 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.580
 We can 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.800
 continuous 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.800
 our work of the future 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.110
 pairs the important spurs are left very short 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:15.689
 because it was a shot in the longest it would inevitably mean 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.429
 beautiful growth from the plant 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:22.309
 the most love quote starts from the more cd side 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:26.459
 petioles surround the leaf surface 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:29.479
 who has to work. 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:34.469
 fruit ripening then to keep the plants in place 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.469
 It is important to work a lot on the long disk 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.269
 I have to leave shorts and therefore we must make sure to always stimulate 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.369
 there 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:47.139
 the budding of the gems so called of the crown are legend that 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:51.369
 depart at the point of insertion of the spur on a double trunk
