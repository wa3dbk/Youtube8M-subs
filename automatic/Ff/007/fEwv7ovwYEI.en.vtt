the females that do well in women's
boxing<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.200> think<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:25.649> pushed<00:01:26.220> on

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
boxing and I think it's pushed on

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.130

memberships<00:01:27.090> up<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.390> down<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.659> country<00:01:27.810> we

the<00:01:44.160> publicity<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.479> kind<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.929> and<00:01:46.349> I

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the publicity it just kind of and I

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.949 
the publicity it just kind of and I
think<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.399> encaptured<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.270> as<00:01:48.390> an<00:01:48.539> it<00:01:48.660> for<00:01:48.869> us

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
think it's encaptured it as an it for us

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.830 
think it's encaptured it as an it for us
and<00:01:49.200> aim<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:50.399> see<00:01:50.580> that<00:01:50.819> ol<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.420> know<00:01:51.539> it's<00:01:51.720> not

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and aim to see that ol you know it's not

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.499 
and aim to see that ol you know it's not
just<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.140> male-dominated<00:01:52.500> sport<00:01:53.250> now<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.759> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
just a male-dominated sport now and the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.749 
just a male-dominated sport now and the
standard<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.289> female<00:01:55.860> boxing<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.429> think<00:01:56.459> it's

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
standard of female boxing I think it's

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.479 
standard of female boxing I think it's
just<00:01:57.000> me<00:01:57.899> people<00:01:58.259> think<00:01:58.500> all<00:01:58.739> I<00:01:58.800> can<00:01:59.220> do<00:01:59.340> that

00:01:59.479 --> 00:01:59.489 
just me people think all I can do that

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:01.729 
just me people think all I can do that
as<00:01:59.640> well<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.179> I<00:02:00.450> think<00:02:00.720> sometimes<00:02:01.410> it's<00:02:01.590> you

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:01.739 
as well so I think sometimes it's you

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:04.100 
as well so I think sometimes it's you
stories<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.550> we<00:02:02.700> tell<00:02:02.729> where<00:02:03.569> we've<00:02:03.810> come

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
stories that we tell where we've come

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.080 
stories that we tell where we've come
from<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:05.220> makes<00:02:05.429> young<00:02:05.610> people<00:02:05.940> think

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
from and it makes young people think

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.240 
from and it makes young people think
well<00:02:06.300> I<00:02:06.479> can<00:02:06.810> do<00:02:06.929> as<00:02:07.080> well<00:02:07.289> what<00:02:07.800> people<00:02:08.160> are

become the number one nation in in
women's<00:02:42.030> boxing<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.600> think<00:02:43.590> it's<00:02:43.770> very

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
women's boxing I think it's very

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.430 
women's boxing I think it's very
difficult<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.760> think<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.750> competition's

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
difficult I think that the competition's

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.710 
difficult I think that the competition's
fierce<00:02:46.710> in<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.190> world<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.790> men's<00:02:48.000> boxing

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
fierce in the world in the men's boxing

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.290 
fierce in the world in the men's boxing
and<00:02:49.170> now<00:02:49.350> equally<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.010> in<00:02:50.190> women's<00:02:50.760> boxing<00:02:51.000> I

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
and now equally so in women's boxing I

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.840 
and now equally so in women's boxing I
think<00:02:51.330> other<00:02:51.720> nations<00:02:52.320> have<00:02:52.950> invested<00:02:53.550> in<00:02:53.700> it

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
think other nations have invested in it

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.120 
think other nations have invested in it
I<00:02:54.000> think<00:02:54.090> they<00:02:54.600> have<00:02:54.720> full-time<00:02:55.170> athletes

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
I think they have full-time athletes

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.310 
I think they have full-time athletes
they<00:02:56.430> have<00:02:56.550> facilities<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:58.200> know

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
they have facilities that you know

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.350 
they have facilities that you know
tremendous<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.040> huge<00:02:59.280> support<00:02:59.760> teams<00:03:00.030> around

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
tremendous and huge support teams around

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.080 
tremendous and huge support teams around
these<00:03:00.600> boxes<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.260> female<00:03:02.220> boxing<00:03:02.640> flourished

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
these boxes and female boxing flourished

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.390 
these boxes and female boxing flourished
because<00:03:03.300> of<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.930> think<00:03:04.740> the<00:03:04.830> competition's

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
because of it I think the competition's

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.770 
because of it I think the competition's
fierce<00:03:05.580> which<00:03:05.850> you<00:03:05.970> can<00:03:06.180> only<00:03:06.240> be<00:03:06.450> good<00:03:06.570> for

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.060 
see why not
I<00:03:59.790> think<00:04:00.180> people<00:04:00.450> see<00:04:00.660> GB<00:04:01.350> is<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.470> threat<00:04:01.830> don't

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
I think people see GB is a threat don't

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.040 
I think people see GB is a threat don't
let<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.280> tournament<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.180> probably<00:04:03.750> don't<00:04:03.900> want

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
let a tournament and probably don't want

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.050 
let a tournament and probably don't want
to<00:04:04.200> draw<00:04:04.440> us<00:04:04.470> within<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.190> tournament<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:05.820> I

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
to draw us within the tournament and I

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.130 
to draw us within the tournament and I
think<00:04:06.420> we've<00:04:06.540> got<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:06.720> say<00:04:06.840> that<00:04:06.989> as<00:04:07.080> a

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
think we've got to say that as a

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.050 
think we've got to say that as a
positive<00:04:07.320> because<00:04:07.700> sometimes<00:04:08.700> you<00:04:08.880> know<00:04:09.000> you

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
positive because sometimes you know you

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.820 
positive because sometimes you know you
can<00:04:09.330> think<00:04:09.570> it<00:04:09.630> all<00:04:09.750> out<00:04:09.930> what<00:04:10.200> what<00:04:10.380> if<00:04:10.470> I<00:04:10.620> get

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
can think it all out what what if I get

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.710 
can think it all out what what if I get
that<00:04:10.920> opponent<00:04:11.400> but<00:04:11.520> really<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:12.120> think<00:04:12.570> if

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
that opponent but really I think if

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.630 
that opponent but really I think if

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.270 
the moment I think the training camps
are<00:05:21.940> massively<00:05:22.330> important<00:05:22.960> and<00:05:23.170> because<00:05:24.100> the

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
are massively important and because the

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.460 
are massively important and because the
the<00:05:24.310> court<00:05:25.150> it's<00:05:25.300> difficult<00:05:25.780> to<00:05:25.900> explain<00:05:26.170> how

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
the court it's difficult to explain how

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.080 
the court it's difficult to explain how
