we're<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.900> full<00:02:54.140> sensitivity<00:02:54.940> we're<00:02:55.940> gonna

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
we're a full sensitivity we're gonna

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.680 
we're a full sensitivity we're gonna
ground<00:02:56.360> balance<00:02:57.880> okay<00:02:58.880> well<00:02:59.090> ground<00:02:59.330> balance

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
ground balance okay well ground balance

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:10.090 
ground balance okay well ground balance
now<00:02:59.840> at<00:02:59.959> all<00:03:00.050> metal<00:03:08.110> very<00:03:09.110> nice<00:03:09.350> strong<00:03:09.650> signal

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
now at all metal very nice strong signal

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.530 
now at all metal very nice strong signal
you<00:03:10.370> can<00:03:10.519> see<00:03:10.670> here<00:03:10.880> we're<00:03:10.970> just<00:03:11.000> knocking<00:03:11.269> out

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
you can see here we're just knocking out

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.979 
you can see here we're just knocking out
nails<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:12.050> that's<00:03:12.170> it

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
nails and that's it

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.090 
nails and that's it
that's<00:03:14.989> when<00:03:15.200> we're<00:03:15.320> in<00:03:15.410> discriminate<00:03:15.920> right

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
that's when we're in discriminate right

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.229 
that's when we're in discriminate right
now<00:03:16.250> we're<00:03:16.459> in<00:03:16.519> all<00:03:16.610> metal<00:03:16.910> so<00:03:17.000> we're<00:03:17.150> gonna

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
now we're in all metal so we're gonna

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.080 
now we're in all metal so we're gonna
hear<00:03:17.450> everything<00:03:18.700> this<00:03:19.700> is<00:03:19.760> where<00:03:19.880> it<00:03:19.940> gets

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
hear everything this is where it gets

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.910 
hear everything this is where it gets
interesting<00:03:20.330> nice<00:03:20.720> loud<00:03:20.959> signal<00:03:21.410> all<00:03:21.560> metal

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
interesting nice loud signal all metal

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.430 
interesting nice loud signal all metal
when<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:22.250> go<00:03:22.519> in<00:03:22.700> to<00:03:22.840> discriminate<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:24.260> here's

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
when I go in to discriminate and here's

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.050 
when I go in to discriminate and here's
the<00:03:24.650> discriminate<00:03:25.220> just<00:03:25.459> set<00:03:25.610> to<00:03:25.730> knock<00:03:25.910> out

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
the discriminate just set to knock out

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.390 
the discriminate just set to knock out
nails<00:03:26.330> this<00:03:27.080> is<00:03:27.140> what<00:03:27.380> we<00:03:27.470> get<00:03:30.070> this<00:03:31.070> dirt

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
nails this is what we get this dirt

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:39.210 
nails this is what we get this dirt
causes<00:03:31.880> that<00:03:32.000> button<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.540> read<00:03:32.720> like<00:03:32.900> iron<00:03:33.230> and

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.470 

again<00:03:40.220> I'll<00:03:40.340> show<00:03:40.549> us<00:03:40.670> when<00:03:40.820> we<00:03:40.910> take<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.239> box

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
again I'll show us when we take the box

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.890 
again I'll show us when we take the box
away<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:41.959> difference<00:03:42.320> but<00:03:43.450> it's<00:03:44.450> only<00:03:44.600> six

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
away the difference but it's only six

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.150 
away the difference but it's only six
inches<00:03:45.200> very<00:03:45.530> very<00:03:45.799> difficult<00:03:46.040> this<00:03:46.489> dirt

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:02.250 

to<00:03:54.910> discriminate<00:03:58.800> it's<00:03:59.800> all<00:04:00.040> iron<00:04:00.480> okay<00:04:01.480> next

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
to discriminate it's all iron okay next

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.620 
to discriminate it's all iron okay next
one<00:04:02.410> we're<00:04:02.530> gonna<00:04:02.620> try<00:04:02.920> out<00:04:03.070> is<00:04:03.520> the<00:04:04.300> Fisher

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
one we're gonna try out is the Fisher

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:11.030 
one we're gonna try out is the Fisher
gold-bug<00:04:05.020> -<00:04:09.510> okay

we're all ready ground balanced to this
as<00:04:20.080> you<00:04:20.290> can<00:04:20.440> hear<00:04:21.270> it's<00:04:22.270> ground<00:04:22.540> balanced

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
as you can hear it's ground balanced

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:30.570 
as you can hear it's ground balanced
very<00:04:22.930> well<00:04:28.500> you<00:04:29.500> can<00:04:29.560> certainly<00:04:29.800> hear<00:04:30.190> it<00:04:30.370> it's

very well you can certainly hear it it's

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.000 
very well you can certainly hear it it's
actually<00:04:30.760> stronger<00:04:31.240> on<00:04:31.600> the<00:04:31.630> 80<00:04:32.230> Gold<00:04:32.650> than<00:04:32.890> it

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
actually stronger on the 80 Gold than it

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.190 
actually stronger on the 80 Gold than it
is<00:04:33.100> on<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.400> Gold<00:04:34.120> Bug<00:04:34.330> we're<00:04:34.900> a<00:04:34.930> full

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
is on the Gold Bug we're a full

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.980 
is on the Gold Bug we're a full
sensitivity<00:04:36.180> I'm<00:04:37.180> Meryl<00:04:37.480> is<00:04:37.510> a<00:04:37.690> ssin<00:04:37.840> and

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
sensitivity I'm Meryl is a ssin and

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:45.720 
sensitivity I'm Meryl is a ssin and
ground<00:04:38.170> balanced<00:04:43.740> we<00:04:44.740> get<00:04:44.980> it<00:04:45.130> again<00:04:45.490> not

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
ground balanced we get it again not

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.700 
ground balanced we get it again not
quite<00:04:45.880> as<00:04:46.060> strong<00:04:46.300> I'm<00:04:46.810> turning<00:04:47.230> to<00:04:47.320> set<00:04:47.530> the

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
quite as strong I'm turning to set the

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.950 
quite as strong I'm turning to set the
threshold<00:04:48.130> all<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.360> way<00:04:49.450> down<00:04:49.630> to<00:04:49.780> where<00:04:49.840> we

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
threshold all the way down to where we

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:57.300 
threshold all the way down to where we
barely<00:04:50.260> could<00:04:50.530> hear<00:04:50.710> it<00:04:55.680> yeah<00:04:56.680> with<00:04:56.860> the<00:04:56.950> spare

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
barely could hear it yeah with the spare

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.420 
barely could hear it yeah with the spare
headphones<00:04:57.670> you<00:04:57.790> hear<00:04:57.970> that<00:04:59.100> this<00:05:00.100> little

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
headphones you hear that this little

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.130 
headphones you hear that this little
Eagle<00:05:00.700> cuff<00:05:00.880> buttons<00:05:01.180> got<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:01.510> conductivity

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
Eagle cuff buttons got the conductivity

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:08.010 
Eagle cuff buttons got the conductivity
of<00:05:02.380> a<00:05:02.620> small<00:05:03.100> piece<00:05:03.280> of<00:05:03.430> gold<00:05:03.610> very<00:05:03.940> low<00:05:06.840> we<00:05:07.840> do

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
of a small piece of gold very low we do

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.360 
of a small piece of gold very low we do
hear<00:05:08.230> it<00:05:08.350> but<00:05:09.340> now<00:05:09.490> we<00:05:09.550> go<00:05:09.880> to<00:05:09.910> discriminate

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
hear it but now we go to discriminate

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.590 
hear it but now we go to discriminate
iron<00:05:12.370> discriminate<00:05:13.680> not<00:05:14.680> a<00:05:14.710> thing<00:05:14.980> but<00:05:15.600> again

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
iron discriminate not a thing but again

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.840 
iron discriminate not a thing but again
without<00:05:16.720> this<00:05:17.020> red<00:05:17.230> dirt<00:05:17.500> it<00:05:18.250> will<00:05:18.430> be<00:05:18.550> able<00:05:18.700> to

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
without this red dirt it will be able to

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:26.510 
without this red dirt it will be able to
hit<00:05:19.000> this<00:05:19.120> button<00:05:19.330> at<00:05:19.690> six<00:05:19.900> inches<00:05:21.510> okay

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:37.370 

now<00:05:27.150> let's<00:05:27.630> take<00:05:27.900> the<00:05:28.190> dirt<00:05:29.190> away<00:05:34.610> okay<00:05:36.380> just

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
now let's take the dirt away okay just

can't get it and I'll show the same

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:01.520 
can't get it and I'll show the same
thing<00:05:54.090> again<00:05:54.569> with<00:05:54.660> the<00:05:54.780> Gary<00:06:00.319> okay<00:06:01.319> we're<00:06:01.500> in

that dirt it sounded like iron and with
the<00:06:24.120> CTX<00:06:26.780> they'll<00:06:27.780> be<00:06:27.870> the<00:06:27.990> same<00:06:28.020> thing

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650

we couldn't get and discriminate before
I'm<00:06:31.560> sure<00:06:31.770> we'll<00:06:31.889> get<00:06:31.979> a<00:06:32.039> loud<00:06:32.310> and<00:06:32.340> clear<00:06:32.520> now
