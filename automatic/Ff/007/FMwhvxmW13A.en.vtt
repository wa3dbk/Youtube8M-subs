in<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.109> Bible<00:03:07.440> john<00:03:07.739> three<00:03:07.920> sixteen<00:03:08.069> and<00:03:08.510> that

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
in the Bible john three sixteen and that

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.960 
in the Bible john three sixteen and that
trumps<00:03:09.810> everything<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:11.370> know<00:03:11.459> this<00:03:11.609> is<00:03:11.670> not

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
trumps everything you know this is not

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.610 
trumps everything you know this is not
to<00:03:12.120> say<00:03:12.329> that<00:03:12.359> there's<00:03:12.780> not<00:03:12.900> good<00:03:13.109> answers<00:03:13.470> to

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
to say that there's not good answers to

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.580 
to say that there's not good answers to
these<00:03:13.739> hard<00:03:14.299> Bible<00:03:15.299> questions<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:16.230> think

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
these hard Bible questions and I think

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.069 
these hard Bible questions and I think
if<00:03:16.769> you<00:03:16.889> dig<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:17.669> might<00:03:17.910> actually<00:03:18.180> find<00:03:18.690> some

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
if you dig you might actually find some

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.659 
if you dig you might actually find some
but<00:03:20.010> just<00:03:20.639> blithely<00:03:21.030> ignoring<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.109> is<00:03:22.290> just

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
but just blithely ignoring it is just

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.129 
but just blithely ignoring it is just
yeah<00:03:23.669> it's<00:03:23.879> not<00:03:24.060> going<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.299> wash<00:03:24.480> all<00:03:24.959> right

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
yeah it's not going to wash all right

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.009 
yeah it's not going to wash all right
and<00:03:25.379> what's<00:03:26.010> more<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.549> think<00:03:26.970> that<00:03:27.299> you<00:03:27.989> should

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
and what's more I think that you should

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.199 
and what's more I think that you should
look<00:03:28.349> at<00:03:28.530> another<00:03:28.769> part<00:03:29.190> of<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.370> Gospels<00:03:29.910> here

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
look at another part of the Gospels here

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.270 
look at another part of the Gospels here
and<00:03:30.720> where<00:03:31.230> Jesus<00:03:31.620> talking<00:03:31.859> about<00:03:32.069> you<00:03:32.160> know

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.309 
and where Jesus talking about you know
removing<00:03:32.849> the<00:03:32.970> beam<00:03:33.150> from<00:03:33.419> your<00:03:33.599> own<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:33.870> before

removing the beam from your own I before

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:35.930 
removing the beam from your own I before
