00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
now so what I'm going to be using is the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.200 
now so what I'm going to be using is the
photo<00:01:06.780> ready<00:01:08.720> Revlon<00:01:09.720> Photoready<00:01:10.159> and<00:01:11.210> let's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
photo ready Revlon Photoready and let's

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.130 
photo ready Revlon Photoready and let's
see<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.659> color<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.260> 0<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:13.920> 0<00:01:14.520> 6<00:01:15.150> medium<00:01:15.840> beige

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
see the color is 0 so 0 6 medium beige

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.190 
see the color is 0 so 0 6 medium beige
and<00:01:17.000> I<00:01:18.000> don't<00:01:18.240> know<00:01:18.330> why<00:01:18.540> would<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.840> find<00:01:19.049> myself

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
and I don't know why would I find myself

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.609 
and I don't know why would I find myself
using<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.070> lot<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.640> my<00:01:20.700> days<00:01:21.150> off<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:22.140> think

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
using this a lot on my days off I think

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.289 
using this a lot on my days off I think
it's<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.979> really<00:01:23.159> good<00:01:23.280> coverage<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.000> think<00:01:24.180> it's

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
it's a really good coverage I think it's

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.770 
it's a really good coverage I think it's
pretty<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:26.670> know<00:01:26.790> out<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> Sun<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
pretty like you know out in the Sun and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.240 
pretty like you know out in the Sun and
stuff<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.560> because<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.040> got<00:01:29.189> a

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
stuff like that because it's got a

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.160 
stuff like that because it's got a
little<00:01:29.430> bit<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.759> reflective<00:01:30.420> properties<00:01:30.960> to

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
little bit of reflective properties to

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.390 
little bit of reflective properties to
it<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:32.210> I<00:01:33.210> don't<00:01:34.110> really<00:01:34.350> like<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.740> plus<00:01:35.189> I

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
it and I don't really like it plus I

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.740 
it and I don't really like it plus I
have<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.790> many<00:01:35.939> foundations<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:38.750> hate

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
have so many foundations that I hate

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.510 
have so many foundations that I hate
that<00:01:40.020> they<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.680> kind<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:40.979> sit<00:01:41.220> there<00:01:41.430> and

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
that they just kind of sit there and

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.190 
that they just kind of sit there and
don't<00:01:41.640> get<00:01:41.820> used<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.869> one<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.049> them

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
don't get used and this is one of them

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.560 
don't get used and this is one of them
that<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.409> do<00:01:43.500> like<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.000> alternate

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
that I do like so I like to alternate

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.139 
that I do like so I like to alternate
between<00:01:45.770> foundations<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.130> for<00:01:47.909> some<00:01:48.119> reason

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
between foundations so for some reason

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.749 
between foundations so for some reason
all<00:01:48.659> my<00:01:48.810> days<00:01:48.990> off<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.380> use<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.860> one<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> lot<00:01:50.280> and

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759
