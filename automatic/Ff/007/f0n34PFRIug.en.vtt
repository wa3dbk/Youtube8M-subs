00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.980
 you are tired of always wearing your hair 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.869
 same always with waves like that with enough 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.760
 volume or both the flattering and me 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.270
 he liked it very much but it is true that he arrives 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.550
 a point that I'm tired of always 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.009
 carry this kind of waves always carry 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.329
 this type of hair and then he looked for 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:33.820
 options as a different tad worth 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:36.610
 then I will show you an option 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.739
 to be fast it 's very simple easy what 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.230
 only you're going to have to like them 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.600
 what you really need is a headband 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.760
 of this elastic and good because the part 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.010
 Elastic front guarantor in concrete 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.410
 but good for the back and it was 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.969
 in primark at first it has a lot 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.640
 then they have these also that are 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.679
 totally the girls and well this in 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.230
 concrete in liza there are in black 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.879
 they are also sold in a pack I think 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.519
 that comes in four or five and costs a 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.740
 euro fifty and these I think they cost 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.500
 one euro or 50 each or two euros for 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.750
 each one is worth 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.670
 then what I use with this that 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.430
 It is more colorful and the only thing we have 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.280
 what to do when we have hair 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.800
 arranged it's worth what we do is with the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.530
 headband we do not put it more or less by 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.430
 here as if it were a crowned crown 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.430
 from the back 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.650
 we leave it more or less here type like this 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.740
 like hippie hippie roll travel 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.440
 from here from what the bangs 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.760
 let's start to twist it towards 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.910
 I explain you better 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.620
 so we take the lock and put in 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.180
 inside 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:53.480
 we take the lock and put inside 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:57.610
 is that it is difficult explaining explained 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.610
 but then looking at it is much easier 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.420
 that is a little thing as well as in return 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.330
 backwards and the other side we do 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.409
 exactly the same we take the lock what 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.409
 we put in 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.880
 the lock and what we are going to get is 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.940
 that part of the headband does not look 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.110
 give it with what we also look for the 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:26.680
 inward theme 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.680
 a lock and we put it in 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.900
 as you can see, there is something left 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.620
 because in the bottom part we are 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.020
 see the waves and also if you catch and 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.210
 you have a little bit to the best hair more 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.620
 the or whatever you put a little 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.250
 more wave with the plates or the 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.290
 tongs but then you give volume 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.770
 so that more is left down 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.069
 and in the front, it stays 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.530
 A) Yes 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.269
 pretty picked up the headband in this 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.159
 case was mine the most seen appointment of 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.870
 this one I had but you can well look 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.659
 any other that you have at home or 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.579
 they bought and left for my taste is 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:12.989
 pretty pretty flattering 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:15.180
 pretty rage to do and well then I 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.280
 I think we can use it almost for 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.870
 any event not of course also 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.400
 that the diadem although in the part of 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.049
 up is different but in the part of 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.659
 down on the elastic that I have taught 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.569
 before it is the closest thing to your 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.669
 skin color of skin if your color 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.069
 of hair is worth it because if you are not going to notice 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:34.139
 I'm going to death I'll see her and 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.549
 to me if you notice me but it is true that 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.909
 we can solve it I will explain 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:41.040
 As you can see here, you can see the black rubber band 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:44.180
 but what I have here next I'm going to 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.180
 twist it in 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.350
 and as you can see it is in the form of 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.740
 waterfall and it looks pretty nice 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.720
 note what the elastic is not already 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.090
 me particularly well many many 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.739
 if you liked the video put handy 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.450
 up and well, see you in the 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.450
 next video started until later
