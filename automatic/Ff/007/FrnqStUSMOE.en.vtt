00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.730
 we approach holy christmas at christmas 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.719
 that is why it is precisely this 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:51.350
 today we want to talk about what you do 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:57.449
 you are at home for the Christmas tree 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:59.510
 or the crib and then I see that 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.770
 she is already quite supplied 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:07.710
 compliments a nice crib this too 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.630
 if you very well what you do 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.200
 what do you prefer to do the tree of 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:19.950
 Christmas or the crib both in fact 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.750
 the mother of Christmas and now we remember 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.229
 some staff heard of it 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.560
 lately on the pope's book that a 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.290
 apparently they were not present nor in the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.659
 cradle in the crib in the cave is not 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:42.329
 the ox and the donkey according to it has been said 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:45.899
 which was how they put it like never before 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.150
 but according to her to the confusion they have 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.770
 Forgot 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:56.190
 forgotten and the ox the donkey hee oh no 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.420
 she is therefore both for the crib and for 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.160
 the christmas tree I want very well 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:08.460

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:12.980

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.520

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.650
