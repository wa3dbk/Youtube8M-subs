the<00:00:03.600> rx100<00:00:04.140> really<00:00:04.859> likes<00:00:05.040> being<00:00:05.279> sailed<00:00:05.549> flat

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
the rx100 really likes being sailed flat

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.820 
the rx100 really likes being sailed flat
upwind<00:00:06.150> kicker<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:07.200> Cunningham<00:00:07.529> should<00:00:07.740> be

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
upwind kicker and Cunningham should be

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.620 
upwind kicker and Cunningham should be
hard<00:00:08.040> enough<00:00:08.280> so<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.550> boom<00:00:08.730> is<00:00:08.940> never<00:00:09.240> outside

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
hard enough so the boom is never outside

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.169 
hard enough so the boom is never outside
the<00:00:09.809> quarter<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:11.099> can<00:00:11.280> bounce<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.730> boat<00:00:11.880> flat

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
the quarter you can bounce the boat flat

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.180 
the quarter you can bounce the boat flat
through<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.570> small<00:00:12.780> puffs<00:00:13.080> if<00:00:13.830> that's<00:00:14.070> not

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
through the small puffs if that's not

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.950 
through the small puffs if that's not
enough<00:00:14.340> he's<00:00:14.700> an<00:00:14.940> armful<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.330> mainsheet<00:00:15.570> to

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
enough he's an armful of mainsheet to

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.070 
enough he's an armful of mainsheet to
keep<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.289> driving<00:00:16.560> fast<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.220> upright<00:00:18.080> now

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
keep it driving fast and upright now

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.570 
keep it driving fast and upright now
let's<00:00:19.320> look<00:00:19.470> at<00:00:19.619> mark<00:00:19.800> plows<00:00:20.070> technique

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
let's look at mark plows technique

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:46.670 
let's look at mark plows technique
through<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.939> guts<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.240> waves<00:00:45.620> sort<00:00:46.620> of

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
through the guts and waves sort of

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.720 
through the guts and waves sort of
trying<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.920> give<00:00:47.100> them<00:00:47.219> give<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> boat<00:00:47.700> a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
trying to give them give the boat a

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.790 
trying to give them give the boat a
little<00:00:47.789> push<00:00:48.180> as<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.629> goes<00:00:48.780> through<00:00:49.079> yeah

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
little push as it goes through yeah

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.170 
little push as it goes through yeah
mostly<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.370> top<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.700> wave<00:00:50.850> if<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.059> get

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
mostly on the top of the wave if you get

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:02.150 
mostly on the top of the wave if you get
a<00:00:51.210> bit<00:00:51.360> nobody<00:00:51.600> wins<00:00:51.870> yeah<00:00:53.000> keep<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.120> right<00:01:01.160> on

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
a bit nobody wins yeah keep it right on

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.040 
a bit nobody wins yeah keep it right on
to<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.399> back<00:01:02.579> leg<00:01:02.820> and

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.160 

works<00:01:09.050> the<00:01:09.490> keeps<00:01:10.490> it<00:01:10.610> down<00:01:10.820> and<00:01:11.270> gives<00:01:12.080> a

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
works the keeps it down and gives a

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:27.970 
works the keeps it down and gives a
healthy<00:01:12.710> fairway<00:01:13.070> right<00:01:26.410> watch<00:01:27.410> this<00:01:27.650> clip<00:01:27.830> as

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
healthy fairway right watch this clip as

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.310 
healthy fairway right watch this clip as
many<00:01:28.190> times<00:01:28.460> as<00:01:28.610> you<00:01:28.730> like<00:01:28.760> to<00:01:29.600> get<00:01:29.750> an<00:01:29.870> idea<00:01:29.990> of

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
many times as you like to get an idea of

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
many times as you like to get an idea of
marks<00:01:30.740> technique<00:01:32.920> weight<00:01:33.920> is<00:01:34.070> on<00:01:34.190> the<00:01:34.250> front

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
marks technique weight is on the front

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.150 
marks technique weight is on the front
leg<00:01:34.760> on<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.030> way<00:01:35.060> at<00:01:35.300> the<00:01:35.420> wave<00:01:35.600> at<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.890> top

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
leg on the way at the wave at the top

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.310 
leg on the way at the wave at the top
high<00:01:37.760> card<00:01:38.090> and<00:01:38.360> he's<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.630> main<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:38.990> keep<00:01:39.200> the

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
high card and he's the main to keep the

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.430 
high card and he's the main to keep the

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
boat dead flat rock aft and keep hiking

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.230 
boat dead flat rock aft and keep hiking
to<00:01:42.590> help<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.890> boat<00:01:43.070> bear<00:01:43.340> away<00:01:43.610> down<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.000> wave

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
confused bits if you look at the horizon

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.800 
confused bits if you look at the horizon
you'll<00:02:01.040> see<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.340> boat<00:02:01.520> is<00:02:01.670> always<00:02:02.119> flat<00:02:02.540> or

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
you'll see the boat is always flat or

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.470 
you'll see the boat is always flat or
over<00:02:03.140> upright
