00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.169
 except jackpot 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:39.190
 did not answer that it's 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:41.050
 overpowered it was said the power did 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.500
 not said he had the sense of the tornado bill 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:01:10.869
 orange france i do not know if it's because 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:01:13.260
 that I 'm already older it's still 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.850
 important for players to lie to each other 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.610
 to support the fans in addition to that 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.510
 we have a real audience what 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.890
 often the national team it's not 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.590
 easy to have an audience like ours 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.650
 and we make results thanks 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.799
 also to this magnificent public image 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.530
 looks like because in bush it's 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.270
 still short an encouragement 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.979
 so it makes me feel good 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.049
 No, but it's good because I think 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.049
 that we all play for that to see 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.479
 as many fans and enthusiasm and 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.560
 that's it already when I play with the 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.549
 belgium there are many more 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.700
 supporters like monaco 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:52.170
 so that gives another and nadine in 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.170
 more and it motivates us even more 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.980
 for sure the national team I 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.500
 have known players for many 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.269
 years we've been around since 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.680
 long time in the national youth team 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.300
 we did a lot of categories 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.310
 together the hopes they lead in 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.810
 the team has so here we managed to 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.209
 live a big tournament like the cup of 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.700
 world together it's extraordinary 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.319
 is a generation that 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.879
 we have more or less almost all the same 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:35.670
 age almost all my few exceptions 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.810
 but otherwise it's true that it's a bit 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.340
 like a family because we know each other 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.230
 we all know the whole family 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.590
 of each and that's why it's 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.590
 really the difference 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.680
 how is death
