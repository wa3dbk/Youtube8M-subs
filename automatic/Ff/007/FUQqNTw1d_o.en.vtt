00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 old vasp hangar in congonhas has 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.480
 contaminated with fuels and 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.700
 heavy metals 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.469
 the area that will be used for 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.630
 airport and should house a 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.860
 aircraft parking will have to 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.260
 undergo a process of 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.279
 decontamination before the start of 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.710
 construction 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.230
 the area of ​​about 170 thousand meters 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.810
 the old vasp 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.880
 is now under the care of the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.840
 which manages the airports of the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.490
 parents 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.410
 it is next to the airport 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.809
 congonhas in one of the most 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.829
 from sao paulo to washington 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.559
 Luís 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.270
 many pieces have already been removed 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.329
 above it is still possible to see some 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.210
 scrap of airplanes and several hangars and 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.730
 abandoned buildings some tanks with 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.980
 chemicals also continue to 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.510
 exposure to contamination has 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.910
 confirmed by the company cetesb 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.879
 of the state of são paulo that 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.489
 concluded that at least 89,000 meters 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.210
 squares are compromised are about 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.030
 of 69 tonnes of toxic waste as 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.720
 solvent fuels and also metals 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.000
 that were used by 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.460
 a more detailed investigation of 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.430
 environmental liability has also been requested 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.950
 by cetesb to see if other parts 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.930
 of the land were also contaminated and 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.490
 what steps will be taken to 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.220
 site recovery 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.650
 the infraero will assume the cost of 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.930
 decontamination and has already issued a 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.510
 contracting a company that will make the 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.520
 studies and soil analyzes 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.560
 this chemical engineer explains that the 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.440
 recovery process is 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.660
 possible but time consuming has two 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.580
 basic alternatives to recover a 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.990
 remove contaminated soil 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.330
 while you start the whole 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.100
 Another bioremediation 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.950
 through bacteria that degrade this 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.900
 organic matter that gasoline kerosene 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.330
 only that the mediation band is more 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.650
 be delayed if there is an urgent 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.570
 likely to remove 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.660
 Properly destined 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.880
 in 2005 Vasp tried to implement a plan 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.959
 judicial recovery but not 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.510
 managed entering bankruptcy in 2008 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.730
 bankruptcy court judge and 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.130
 judicial recoveries explains that the 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.400
 process for the removal of scrap 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.370
 parts is nearing completion and that the 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.890
 area must be released by the end of the year 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.870
 it is reasonable that area of a now a 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.940
 airport one of the busiest 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.680
 Brazil is occupied by a 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.790
 graveyard of aircraft in a graveyard 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.680
 of parts 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.290
 We want to solve this fastest. 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.170
 possible with judicial release and 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.570
 decontamination of the land the intention of 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.820
 infrastructure is to expand the airport 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.160
 faces lack of space 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.440
 Congonhas is considered small 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.400
 terminal has only 51 thousand meters 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.010
 square combat aircraft in 77 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.160
 thousand square meters and only 23 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.620
 parking positions of airplanes 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.090
 for professor jorge leal medeiros 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.459
 specialist in planning 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.209
 airports and air transport to 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.130
 expansion of congonhas is a 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.410
 You can even think about even doing 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.760
 in that farther away region 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.190
 terminal for service of a 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.810
 legislation is bridge aviation 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.630
 rio-são paulo things that val 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.920
 but it may slightly vent the 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.920
 from london airport
