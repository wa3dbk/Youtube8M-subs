00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:18.640
 we at cmft have a challenging and highly responsible task 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.749
 we give shape to the matter 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:26.739
 we model it the miami atlas mobilize it extracting from the ingots 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.550
 grizli the soul of metal that becomes a perfect artifact 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.590
 trees 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.520
 Coming soon 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.490
 and still test wheels 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.440
 dl for marine engines 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.080
 hydraulic blades for such a French enclose their harmonic lines 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.110
 in their sinuous forms and mirrors the perfection of our work 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.740
 wood 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.740
 does 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.330
 but our factories are a special transformation 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.079
 the energy 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:13.680
 is converted into matter 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.890
 here the heart is the forge 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.120
 from which the first processing phase is obtained 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.930
 the matter properly heated 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.930
 assumes its first important transformation 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.790
 it works at temperatures between 200 and 1200 degrees 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.210
 so the metal changes in shape but also in substance 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.910
 given the large production capacity of 7 cm 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.720
 two ports are used 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.450
 we like to think two hearts are enough in our factory too 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.920
 1 of 900 tons and one of 1500 tons 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.030
 but we know why the true heart 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.800
 is that of our employees 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.120
 that every day 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.020
 compassion 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.020
 and make your artifacts 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.449
 the special alloys to the glaciers we produce 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:16.799
 they always comply with European standards 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.629
 the semi-finished product after having undergone the reduction process obtained with the 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:21.379
 presses 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.489
 the preparation is cut for the subsequent phases of mechanical processing 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.489
 and for the glue specimens 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.079
 here is our naval propulsion tree 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.679
 cut shapers 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.029
 that continues its path in the ovens 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:40.029
 for the annealing and normalization phases 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:45.299
 also the other solubilization and carburizing remediation treatments 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.299
 they are made internally 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:57.739
 the process is completed with precision processing 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.969
 the piece is sent to the mechanical workshop that will finish the 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:02.749
 shop assistant 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.759
 whether it is a simple roughing sentence 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:08.759
 whether it ends with a finished piece 

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:13.119
 finally the word passes our office experts with the u 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.900
 kemer compliance with current regulations will carry out all the tests of 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.599
 laboratory necessary to guarantee the absolute conformity of the piece 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:25.280
 the daily equipment 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.280
 it is very varied specific to address the different testing characteristics 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.449
 certification requests 5 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:36.189
 therefore with prefectural stage for ultrasonic control 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:41.579
 penetrating liquids tensile tests resilience and hardness ultrasound examinations 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.579
 chemical analysis and dimensional checks 

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:59.769
 cormons is an ancient land 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.839
 cradle of neck vines 

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:05.229
 which have been producing fine wines for centuries 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:10.479
 and this is where we work in our three establishments surrounded by loss 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:13.059
 an eye from the precious vt 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:18.629
 from us having the maximum respect for the environment is a moral principle not 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:20.539
 a simple one around 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.720
 why we adopt the most respected environmental protection policies 

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:24.629
 in china 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:29.829
 and we are pleased to have the ISO 14001 certification for the environment 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.660
 we improve continuously but already today 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.170
 our factory 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.220
 auto produces the electricity needs of offices thanks to the garden 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.440
 70 kilowatt photovoltaic system published on the roof 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:44.650
 but not enough 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.690
 we have also cut gas consumption of our ovens by 30% by adopting 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.570
 cutting-edge technology that recovers the warmest air of the 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.009
 same heating process 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:00.339
 and where we are working on new challenges projected towards tomorrow
