this particular body butter is it so

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.430 
this particular body butter is it so
light<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.770> go<00:00:43.950> at<00:00:44.100> any<00:00:44.250> very<00:00:44.520> light<00:00:44.850> yeah<00:00:47.030> it

light and go at any very light yeah it

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.740 
light and go at any very light yeah it
hydrates<00:00:49.440> very<00:00:49.739> well<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.420> melts<00:00:51.420> into<00:00:51.600> your

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
hydrates very well it melts into your

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.350 
hydrates very well it melts into your
skin<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.739> feels<00:00:52.770> like<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.399> cross<00:00:53.850> between<00:00:54.120> a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
skin it feels like a cross between a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.010 
skin it feels like a cross between a
lotion<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.199> butter<00:00:55.460> so<00:00:56.460> yeah<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.480> agree<00:00:57.840> with

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
lotion and a butter so yeah I agree with

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.930 
lotion and a butter so yeah I agree with
you<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:58.440> kind<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.010> cross<00:00:59.219> because<00:00:59.550> very

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
you it's kind of a cross because very

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.569 
you it's kind of a cross because very
very<00:01:00.030> creamy<00:01:00.600> its<00:01:01.140> rich<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:02.039> infused<00:01:02.399> with

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
very creamy its rich it's infused with

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.929 
very creamy its rich it's infused with
the<00:01:02.730> argan<00:01:03.059> oil<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.510> that's<00:01:03.660> probably<00:01:03.899> why<00:01:04.939> and

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
the argan oil so that's probably why and

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.850 
the argan oil so that's probably why and
it<00:01:06.299> does<00:01:06.510> hydrate<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.260> very<00:01:07.560> very

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
it does hydrate and it's very very

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.980 
it does hydrate and it's very very
long-lasting<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.330> has<00:01:09.360> like<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.659> light

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
long-lasting so and it has like a light

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.960 
long-lasting so and it has like a light
citrus<00:01:10.290> scent<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.010> like<00:01:11.189> overwhelming<00:01:11.850> I

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
and that's what I would recommend just

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.420

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.850 
take a little wooden spoon if you have
one<00:04:55.730> just<00:04:56.450> take<00:04:56.630> it<00:04:56.750> out<00:04:56.870> with<00:04:57.020> that<00:04:57.170> and
