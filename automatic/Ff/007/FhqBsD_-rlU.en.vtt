 What kind of key do you use all of you today? Here is an introduction of the key 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:20.800
 I would like to introduce the u-shaped lock type key 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:21.700
 Well, it's more than a road bike, but I feel that it is often used by pists 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.700
 Though 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:31.600
 Because there was a key of u letter lock, I would like to introduce a little here 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.579
 It is a amazon It seems to be quite popular say white 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.660
 Yes here 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:39.620
 It is called parmy 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.990
 It is said that that aluminum shackle lock 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.120
 It has become in such a form 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.510
 It's almost a specification but here 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.900
 The width is 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:56.860
 The shield measures 130 mm and the side measures 75 mm 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.920
 This weight is 15 I'm worried 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.480
 They will come black 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:07.460
 This material is also 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.190
 Than that are made of aluminum is relatively light 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.330
 a 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:15.300
 The weight of the catalog is about 350 g 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.060
 Yes it is 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.140
 It's over time 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:25.430
 The shadow is tight and I have three spares as spares 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.670
 Such a key is included Lock with such a key 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:33.480
 It is Otsuchi you are generally passing 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:36.540
 I can say 1705 I can easily carry it 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.800
 Well I get into the back pocket or something 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.840
 It is the size 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.730
 is 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.540
 Well that's right 300 I do n't cry because I have so much 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.409
 Well get it heavy 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.630
 I think that your fish 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.130
 This is the first point, though 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.250
 Here is 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.030
 This is 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.960
 Say elastomer Ju-hee 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.320
 Something like rubber is noticed here 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.750
 In the frame of your car 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:13.540
 Well , this is where I say that the process is hard to get scratched . 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:19.060
 Well what is the best point 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.790
 I think about the case car riders properly to be careful not to hurt my car 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.080
 I thought it was very good 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:30.900
 It has become the emphasis of something like 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:37.560
 Do you cat the size of Nde Earth lock to is I think that if it can not Do they 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:38.730
 Measures such as hard to do as well Well, really we're not even not be able to lock quick guide to the top hotels, or eat Ricoh 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.940
 I think 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.069
 The Well frame and Phil because 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.730
 Well I think it is just the right size when you lock 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.860
 Well, I think you're using that way 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:55.190
 Birth 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:58.040
 So Well, the little low credibility as a lock of Kore one just for it is the bicycle 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:03.290
 I think the kana and personal 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.430
 So maybe just a little bit when it's time to park etc. 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.850
 Though 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:13.280
 Earth lock key lock can be combined with the second 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.480
 I think that it is good to use this as t lock 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.870
 think 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:23.680
 Here's a parmy 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:25.290
 Aluminum Shackle Lock Small and lightweight, with a scratch on the frame and cut to 9th place 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:31.680
 This is it 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:32.280
 I think it's very important that you go through Air Stomer supplies school 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.430
 so 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:41.250
 It is a key lock of such a form 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:45.090
 I thought that it would be relatively good if I used it as the second key and introduced it 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.890
 By the way lock is here 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.910
 In got a keyhole in place 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.910
 Ashton Day 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.600
 20 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:06.230
 When turned 90 degrees 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:07.250
 It will come off like this as a lock or not 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.270

 This is another thing because I can do it in many places 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.580
 I think it is easy to use 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.720
 I am 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.720
