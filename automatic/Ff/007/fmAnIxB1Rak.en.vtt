00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
how to how they interact with the iTunes

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.480 
how to how they interact with the iTunes
software<00:00:24.050> so<00:00:25.050> today<00:00:25.980> I'm<00:00:26.070> going<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.279> show<00:00:26.430> you

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
software so today I'm going to show you

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.320 
software so today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:27.510> interacts<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.980> also<00:00:29.550> how<00:00:29.880> exactly

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
how it interacts and also how exactly

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.470 
how it interacts and also how exactly
you<00:00:30.570> acquire<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:32.390> essentially<00:00:33.390> it's

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
you acquire it so essentially it's

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.910 
you acquire it so essentially it's
become<00:00:33.719> easier<00:00:34.050> than<00:00:34.290> when<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.559> first<00:00:34.590> came

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920

and<00:01:18.299> plugs<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:22.100> so<00:01:23.100> all<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.180> do

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
and plugs you in so all you have to do

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.399 
and plugs you in so all you have to do
is<00:01:24.659> tell<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.820> sync<00:01:26.820> your<00:01:26.880> music<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.630> then

is tell it to sync your music and then

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.390 
is tell it to sync your music and then
you<00:01:28.619> can<00:01:28.860> say<00:01:29.780> select<00:01:30.780> all<00:01:31.200> music<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.799> then

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
you can say select all music and then

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.630 
you can say select all music and then
you<00:01:32.430> can<00:01:32.700> say<00:01:32.880> sync

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.320 

so

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
so

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.900 
so
now<00:01:40.900> what<00:01:41.140> it'll<00:01:41.320> do<00:01:41.530> is<00:01:41.710> as<00:01:42.280> you<00:01:42.400> can<00:01:42.430> see<00:01:42.730> the

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
now what it'll do is as you can see the

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.740 
now what it'll do is as you can see the
iTunes<00:01:44.130> music<00:01:45.130> store<00:01:45.160> is<00:01:45.580> bumping<00:01:46.480> up<00:01:46.600> and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
iTunes music store is bumping up and

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.260 
iTunes music store is bumping up and
down<00:01:46.900> so<00:01:47.710> here<00:01:48.220> in<00:01:48.310> just<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.670> moment<00:01:48.970> it<00:01:49.060> should

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
down so here in just a moment it should

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:57.600 
down so here in just a moment it should
pop<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:52.540> did

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.910 

and<00:01:58.540> then<00:01:58.690> ask<00:01:58.990> for<00:01:59.320> account<00:01:59.680> name<00:01:59.890> and

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
and then ask for account name and

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:14.720 
and then ask for account name and
password

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.910 

and<00:02:15.270> once<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.660> plug<00:02:15.930> in<00:02:16.050> your<00:02:16.170> account<00:02:16.560> name<00:02:16.890> I

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
and once you plug in your account name I

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:37.559 
and once you plug in your account name I
believe<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.270> it

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.110 

yeah<00:02:38.469> so<00:02:38.980> once<00:02:39.129> you<00:02:39.219> do<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:40.079> your<00:02:42.120> iTunes

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
yeah so once you do that your iTunes

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.830 
yeah so once you do that your iTunes
will<00:02:43.390> then<00:02:43.629> start<00:02:44.019> filling<00:02:44.799> its<00:02:45.129> library<00:02:45.840> into

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
will then start filling its library into

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.809 
will then start filling its library into
the<00:02:46.989> device<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:48.040> actually<00:02:48.189> gives<00:02:48.579> us<00:02:48.760> a

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
the device and it actually gives us a

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.240 
the device and it actually gives us a
