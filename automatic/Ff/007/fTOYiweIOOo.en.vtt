00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
you how to make the fastest paper

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.809 
you how to make the fastest paper
airplane<00:00:03.870> in<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.020> world<00:00:04.190> the<00:00:05.190> first<00:00:05.490> foal

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
airplane in the world the first foal

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.860 
airplane in the world the first foal
detail<00:00:06.379> do<00:00:07.379> it<00:00:07.560> back<00:00:07.799> noise<00:00:08.630> sort<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.750> like

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
detail do it back noise sort of like

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.089 
detail do it back noise sort of like
you're<00:00:10.050> getting<00:00:10.230> ready<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.650> make<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.800> lopsided

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
you're getting ready to make a lopsided

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.250 
you're getting ready to make a lopsided
airplane<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:13.670> try<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.730> do<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.030> sharp<00:00:15.509> point<00:00:15.870> at

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
airplane and try to do a sharp point at

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.840 
airplane and try to do a sharp point at
the<00:00:16.379> tip<00:00:16.560> over<00:00:16.920> here<00:00:17.930> and<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.199> next<00:00:19.350> told<00:00:19.850> you

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
the tip over here and the next told you

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.480 
the tip over here and the next told you
fold<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.449> over<00:00:21.720> like<00:00:22.230> you're<00:00:22.710> making<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.130> paper

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
fold it over like you're making a paper

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.210 
fold it over like you're making a paper
airplane<00:00:24.199> now<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.380> really<00:00:25.619> looks<00:00:25.890> like<00:00:25.980> it's

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
airplane now it really looks like it's

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.140 
airplane now it really looks like it's
going<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.519> make<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.640> lopsided<00:00:26.910> airplane<00:00:27.779> and

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
going to make a lopsided airplane and

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.790 
going to make a lopsided airplane and
then<00:00:30.150> after<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.679> and<00:00:31.679> fold<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.189> half

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
then after that and fold it in half

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.260 
then after that and fold it in half
starting<00:00:34.800> from<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.070> point<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.790> going<00:00:36.030> back

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
starting from the point and going back

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.150 
starting from the point and going back
then<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.450> open<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.899> up<00:00:40.079> there<00:00:40.800> should<00:00:40.980> be

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
then you open it up there should be

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.030 
then you open it up there should be
paper<00:00:41.730> sticking<00:00:42.210> up<00:00:42.480> from<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.809> middle<00:00:43.110> like

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
paper sticking up from the middle like

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.540 
paper sticking up from the middle like
that<00:00:45.410> then<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:47.329> fold<00:00:48.329> these<00:00:48.660> sides<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.550> and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that then you fold these sides in and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.119 
that then you fold these sides in and
all<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.059> way<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> go<00:00:51.480> through<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.960> papers

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.000 

look<00:00:59.129> like<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.960> paper<00:01:01.199> should<00:01:01.530> still<00:01:01.859> be

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
look like this the paper should still be

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.000 
look like this the paper should still be
sticking<00:01:02.430> up<00:01:02.550> through<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.969> middle<00:01:04.010> then

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
sticking up through the middle then

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.210 
sticking up through the middle then
after<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.689> you<00:01:06.689> sold<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.680> plane<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.100> down

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
after that you sold the plane it down

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:19.310 
after that you sold the plane it down
like<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:13.040> like<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:17.180> then<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.869> fold<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
like that like this then you fold the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.090 
like that like this then you fold the
wings<00:01:19.650> out<00:01:23.869> in<00:01:24.869> their<00:01:25.049> front<00:01:25.290> try<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.830> make<00:01:26.070> it

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
wings out in their front try to make it

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.090 
wings out in their front try to make it
at<00:01:26.369> least<00:01:26.540> one<00:01:27.979> centimeter<00:01:28.979> off<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.939> tip

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
at least one centimeter off on the tip

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.510 
at least one centimeter off on the tip
and<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.130> do<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.610> from<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.299> both<00:01:33.600> sides<00:01:34.110> of

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
and you do that from on both sides of

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.840 
and you do that from on both sides of
the<00:01:35.520> wings<00:01:38.540> crease<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.750> hard<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.850> like

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
the wings crease it hard on that like

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.370 
the wings crease it hard on that like
this<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:44.270> there<00:01:45.270> here's<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.840> fastest

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
this and there here's the fastest

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.030 
this and there here's the fastest
airplane<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.920> world<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:48.259> also<00:01:49.259> if<00:01:49.710> you

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
airplane in the world and also if you

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.679 
airplane in the world and also if you
color<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.659> it<00:01:51.659> will<00:01:52.220> be<00:01:53.220> faster<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.600> will

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
color it it will be faster and it will

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.380 
color it it will be faster and it will
stay<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.110> air<00:01:55.259> longer<00:01:55.290> because<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.430> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
stay in the air longer because of the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.819 
stay in the air longer because of the
weight<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.530> put<00:01:58.770> on<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.920> airplane<00:01:59.369> and

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
weight that you put on that airplane and

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.350 
weight that you put on that airplane and
it<00:02:02.719> will<00:02:03.719> also

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
it will also

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.480 
it will also
be<00:02:06.490> looking<00:02:07.490> better<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.920> this<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:10.160> called<00:02:10.369> the

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
be looking better and this is called the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.000 
be looking better and this is called the
four<00:02:10.820> net
