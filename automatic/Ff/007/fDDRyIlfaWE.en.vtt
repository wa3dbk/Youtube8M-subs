00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.460 
got today I would say that they're not
bad<00:03:01.950> at<00:03:02.130> all<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.370> mean<00:03:02.580> obviously<00:03:03.240> they<00:03:03.630> are<00:03:03.870> toy

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
bad at all I mean obviously they are toy

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.120 
bad at all I mean obviously they are toy
quality<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:06.050> plastic<00:03:07.050> but<00:03:07.410> of<00:03:07.709> course<00:03:07.920> these

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
quality and plastic but of course these

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.350 
quality and plastic but of course these
are<00:03:08.190> aimed<00:03:08.550> at<00:03:08.850> a<00:03:09.060> younger<00:03:09.300> audience<00:03:09.690> so<00:03:10.590> I

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
are aimed at a younger audience so I

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.880 
are aimed at a younger audience so I
don't<00:03:12.360> see<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.540> problem<00:03:12.720> with<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:12.989> I<00:03:13.230> know<00:03:13.320> I<00:03:13.470> had

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
don't see a problem with it I know I had

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.320 
don't see a problem with it I know I had
necklaces<00:03:14.160> like<00:03:14.550> this<00:03:14.730> when<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:14.910> was<00:03:15.060> younger

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
necklaces like this when I was younger

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.630 
necklaces like this when I was younger
and<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:15.720> love<00:03:16.080> them<00:03:16.320> to<00:03:16.530> death<00:03:16.560> these<00:03:17.010> are<00:03:17.070> super

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
and I love them to death these are super

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.520 
and I love them to death these are super
pretty<00:03:17.820> I<00:03:18.150> love<00:03:18.450> anything<00:03:18.720> sparkly<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.440> shiny

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
pretty I love anything sparkly and shiny

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.770 
pretty I love anything sparkly and shiny
so<00:03:20.190> I<00:03:20.519> would<00:03:20.940> say<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.120> is<00:03:21.269> a<00:03:21.300> pretty<00:03:21.480> good<00:03:21.630> buy

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
so I would say this is a pretty good buy

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.050 
so I would say this is a pretty good buy
I<00:03:22.019> think<00:03:22.880> each<00:03:23.880> one<00:03:23.940> was<00:03:24.510> about<00:03:25.340> 120<00:03:26.340> yen

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
I think each one was about 120 yen

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.320 
I think each one was about 120 yen
it<00:03:27.480> wasn't<00:03:27.930> 200<00:03:28.380> yen<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.850> know<00:03:29.940> somewhere

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
it wasn't 200 yen so you know somewhere

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.729 
it wasn't 200 yen so you know somewhere
around<00:03:30.390> there<00:03:30.690> so<00:03:30.900> it's<00:03:31.050> not<00:03:31.110> really<00:03:31.530> super

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
around there so it's not really super

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.070 
around there so it's not really super
expensive<00:03:32.130> it's<00:03:32.519> a<00:03:32.580> nice<00:03:32.700> little<00:03:32.790> extra<00:03:33.080> and

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
expensive it's a nice little extra and

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.580 
expensive it's a nice little extra and
yes<00:03:34.739> so<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.160> was<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.700> sibyl's<00:03:36.239> stop<00:03:36.810> pendant

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
yes so that was the sibyl's stop pendant

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.860 
yes so that was the sibyl's stop pendant
