okay<00:00:07.350> guys<00:00:07.500> so<00:00:07.770> this<00:00:07.919> video<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.400> going<00:00:08.519> to<00:00:08.580> be

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
okay guys so this video is going to be

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.580 
okay guys so this video is going to be
about<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.360> sheer<00:00:10.370> scale<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.429> the

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
about the sheer scale of the

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.039 
about the sheer scale of the
Coolermaster<00:00:13.590> cosmos<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.639> which<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.210> mentioned

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
Coolermaster cosmos to which I mentioned

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.500 
Coolermaster cosmos to which I mentioned
in<00:00:16.080> my<00:00:16.139> unboxing<00:00:16.500> video<00:00:16.830> was<00:00:17.330> one<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.420> the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
in my unboxing video was one of the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.140 
in my unboxing video was one of the
heaviest<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.289> largest<00:00:20.250> cases<00:00:20.640> I'd<00:00:20.970> ever

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
heaviest and largest cases I'd ever

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.070 
heaviest and largest cases I'd ever
encountered

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
encountered

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.470 
encountered
but<00:00:22.439> what<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.619> didn't<00:00:23.070> realize<00:00:23.100> was<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:24.330> how

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
but what I didn't realize was just how

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.060 
but what I didn't realize was just how
big<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.869> was<00:00:25.019> because<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.560> hadn't<00:00:25.890> been<00:00:26.010> a

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
big it was because I hadn't been a

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.220 
big it was because I hadn't been a
direct<00:00:26.460> side-by-side<00:00:27.060> comparison<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:27.869> before

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
direct side-by-side comparison so before

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.810 
direct side-by-side comparison so before
we<00:00:28.349> get<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.680> go<00:00:28.800> any<00:00:29.010> further<00:00:29.250> in<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.490> video

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820

cosmos<00:00:59.670> s<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.420> see<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.260> is

cosmos s so you can see that it is
clearly<00:01:02.010> even<00:01:02.850> before<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.510> add<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
clearly even before you add the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.109 
clearly even before you add the
transform<00:01:04.500> loop<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.309> tripped<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
transform loop and I tripped the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.280 
transform loop and I tripped the
transportation<00:01:07.110> rails<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.159> top<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.729> stems

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
transportation rails on the top it stems

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.770 
transportation rails on the top it stems
well<00:01:10.290> over<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.159> Obsidian<00:01:11.850> 800<00:01:12.570> d<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:14.780> mean

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
well over the Obsidian 800 d and I mean

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.160 
well over the Obsidian 800 d and I mean
if<00:01:16.049> they<00:01:16.380> were<00:01:16.439> both<00:01:16.740> people<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:18.060> define<00:01:18.570> R<00:01:18.810> 3

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
if they were both people the define R 3

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.340 
if they were both people the define R 3
would<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.409> standing<00:01:20.070> like<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.939> know<00:01:21.350> River

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
would be standing like you know River

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.880 
would be standing like you know River
height<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> cosmos<00:01:24.000> -<00:01:24.420> okay<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.439> terms<00:01:25.680> of

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
height on the cosmos - okay in terms of

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.370 
height on the cosmos - okay in terms of
their<00:01:26.070> their<00:01:26.280> their<00:01:27.180> depth<00:01:27.540> here<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.200> want

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
their their their depth here if you want

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.440 
their their their depth here if you want
to<00:01:28.439> come<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:28.890> like<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.159> top-down<00:01:29.729> view<00:01:29.790> here

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
to come and do like a top-down view here

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.240 
to come and do like a top-down view here
I'm<00:01:30.630> actually<00:01:31.049> gonna<00:01:31.320> move<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> light<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.159> you

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
I'm actually gonna move the light so you

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.219 
I'm actually gonna move the light so you
guys<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.670> see<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> little<00:01:33.119> bit<00:01:33.299> better<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:34.170> you

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
guys can see a little bit better so you

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.130 
guys can see a little bit better so you
can<00:01:34.320> see<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.799> depth<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.939> cosmos<00:01:36.450> -<00:01:36.750> all

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
can see the depth of the cosmos - all

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.130 
can see the depth of the cosmos - all
that<00:01:37.439> room<00:01:37.710> for<00:01:38.009> radiators<00:01:38.670> comes<00:01:39.090> at<00:01:39.659> some

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
that room for radiators comes at some

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.690 
that room for radiators comes at some
cost<00:01:40.439> if<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.070> want<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.250> like<00:01:41.400> hold<00:01:41.610> it

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
cost if you just want to like hold it

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.270 
cost if you just want to like hold it
right<00:01:41.850> up<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.210> they<00:01:42.299> can<00:01:42.509> see<00:01:42.540> how<00:01:42.930> much<00:01:43.530> deeper

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
right up so they can see how much deeper

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.460 
right up so they can see how much deeper
it<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.790> actually<00:01:45.270> deeper<00:01:46.170> than<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
it is so it is actually deeper than the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.609 
it is so it is actually deeper than the
Obsidian<00:01:46.799> 800<00:01:47.490> D<00:01:47.670> as<00:01:47.850> well<00:01:48.360> as<00:01:48.689> being<00:01:49.290> taller

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
Obsidian 800 D as well as being taller

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.920 
Obsidian 800 D as well as being taller
than<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.189> look<00:01:50.430> at<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.729> width<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.720> want

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
than it and look at the width so I want

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.870 
than it and look at the width so I want
you<00:01:51.990> guys<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.200> look<00:01:52.890> at<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.189> width<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
you guys to look at the width of the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.780 
you guys to look at the width of the
cosmos<00:01:54.360> -<00:01:54.659> compared<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.710> case<00:01:55.979> like<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.340> 800

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
cosmos - compared to a case like the 800

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.130 
cosmos - compared to a case like the 800
D<00:01:56.969> which<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.450> already<00:01:58.049> quite<00:01:58.619> wide<00:01:59.600> indeed<00:02:00.600> ok

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
D which is already quite wide indeed ok

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.700 
D which is already quite wide indeed ok
so<00:02:01.380> now<00:02:02.180> let<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.360> comparisons<00:02:04.020> continue

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
so now let the comparisons continue

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.700 
so now let the comparisons continue
because<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.790> case<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.390> not<00:02:06.810> for<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.469> faint

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.160 
here we go all right so he gave you guys
some<00:02:45.209> idea<00:02:46.040> that<00:02:47.040> is<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.250> 24<00:02:47.819> inch<00:02:48.060> monitor<00:02:48.540> that

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
some idea that is a 24 inch monitor that

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.569 
some idea that is a 24 inch monitor that
is<00:02:49.319> not<00:02:49.500> by<00:02:49.680> any<00:02:49.889> stretch<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.400> imagination

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
is not by any stretch of the imagination

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.869 
is not by any stretch of the imagination
a<00:02:51.450> small<00:02:52.290> monitor<00:02:52.650> here<00:02:53.010> come<00:02:53.190> get<00:02:53.340> this<00:02:53.489> angle

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
a small monitor here come get this angle

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.360 
a small monitor here come get this angle
over<00:02:53.970> here<00:02:54.239> this<00:02:54.359> is<00:02:54.510> pretty<00:02:54.690> good

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
over here this is pretty good

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.550 
over here this is pretty good
so<00:02:56.370> there<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.909> is<00:02:57.030> from<00:02:57.510> this<00:02:57.720> angle<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:58.379> can

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
so there it is from this angle you can

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.160 
so there it is from this angle you can
really<00:02:58.950> see<00:02:59.190> how<00:02:59.849> it<00:02:59.879> absolutely<00:03:01.220> dwarfs<00:03:02.220> the

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
really see how it absolutely dwarfs the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.550 
really see how it absolutely dwarfs the
24<00:03:04.170> inch<00:03:04.440> LCD<00:03:04.799> monitor<00:03:05.549> that<00:03:06.209> it<00:03:06.540> is<00:03:06.750> next<00:03:07.170> to

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
24 inch LCD monitor that it is next to

24 inch LCD monitor that it is next to
and<00:03:08.329> the<00:03:09.329> cat<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:10.049> is<00:03:10.230> also<00:03:10.650> next<00:03:11.609> to<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:14.900> so

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
and the cat that is also next to it so

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.080

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.490 
that is my 30-inch monitor I don't have
anywhere<00:03:18.389> to<00:03:18.449> put<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.780> down<00:03:18.989> because<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.410> won't

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
anywhere to put it down because it won't

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.170 
anywhere to put it down because it won't
even<00:03:19.859> fit<00:03:20.489> on<00:03:20.730> my<00:03:21.209> desk<00:03:21.510> next<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.709> thing

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
even fit on my desk next to that thing

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.280 
even fit on my desk next to that thing
but<00:03:24.440> here<00:03:25.519> is<00:03:26.519> what<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:26.879> would<00:03:26.970> look<00:03:27.180> like<00:03:27.290> next

with this thing there you go so that is
a<00:03:35.129> 30-inch<00:03:36.060> monitor<00:03:36.599> and<00:03:37.410> this<00:03:37.739> case<00:03:38.040> makes<00:03:38.400> it

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
a 30-inch monitor and this case makes it

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.420

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
makes my own Silverstone gdo7 which is a

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.530 
makes my own Silverstone gdo7 which is a
pretty<00:03:45.510> big<00:03:45.840> case<00:03:46.169> by<00:03:46.949> most<00:03:47.220> accounts<00:03:47.609> look

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
pretty big case by most accounts look

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.930 
pretty big case by most accounts look
like<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:49.109> plaything<00:03:49.949> so<00:03:50.370> I'm<00:03:50.459> gonna<00:03:50.639> line<00:03:50.910> up

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
like a plaything so I'm gonna line up

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.180 
like a plaything so I'm gonna line up
the<00:03:51.239> backs<00:03:51.480> of<00:03:51.720> them<00:03:51.870> so<00:03:52.349> that<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.620> guys<00:03:52.769> can

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
the backs of them so that you guys can

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.720 
the backs of them so that you guys can
get<00:03:54.120> some<00:03:54.389> idea<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.930> that<00:03:55.199> of<00:03:55.889> the<00:03:56.099> scale<00:03:56.459> here

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
get some idea of that of the scale here

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.369 
get some idea of that of the scale here
so<00:03:56.909> that's<00:03:57.090> how<00:03:57.269> much<00:03:57.449> deeper<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:57.930> is<00:03:58.019> Benanti

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
so that's how much deeper it is Benanti

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.550 
so that's how much deeper it is Benanti
jo7<00:03:59.040> that's<00:03:59.760> how<00:03:59.909> much<00:04:00.060> taller<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.810> is<00:04:00.959> then

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
jo7 that's how much taller it is then

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.170 
jo7 that's how much taller it is then
it's<00:04:01.680> tjo<00:04:02.010> 7<00:04:02.459> I'm<00:04:02.549> gonna<00:04:02.730> get<00:04:02.849> you<00:04:02.909> some<00:04:03.060> better

it's tjo 7 I'm gonna get you some better
lighting<00:04:03.659> there<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.139> that<00:04:04.859> is<00:04:05.010> how<00:04:05.159> much

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
lighting there and that is how much

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.140 
lighting there and that is how much
wider<00:04:06.000> it<00:04:06.419> is<00:04:06.599> then<00:04:07.049> even<00:04:07.409> a<00:04:07.500> silverstone<00:04:08.150> TJ

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
wider it is then even a silverstone TJ

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.750 
wider it is then even a silverstone TJ
