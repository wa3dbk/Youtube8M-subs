00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.719 
do well but the two min pins walked
really<00:01:51.840> well<00:01:52.049> tank<00:01:52.470> had<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> good<00:01:52.890> time<00:01:53.100> hopping

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
really well tank had a good time hopping

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.870 
really well tank had a good time hopping
through<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> tall<00:01:54.149> grass<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:55.369> we<00:01:56.369> took<00:01:56.579> sugar

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
through the tall grass and we took sugar

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.109

I had to wear her in a little backpack

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.789 
I had to wear her in a little backpack
because<00:02:00.119> her<00:02:00.420> little<00:02:00.630> paws<00:02:00.899> can't<00:02:01.259> walk<00:02:01.530> five

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799

we<00:02:51.390> tried<00:02:51.600> God<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:51.959> War<00:02:52.080> three<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.590> demo<00:02:52.830> two

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
we tried God of War three the demo two

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.490 
we tried God of War three the demo two

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
and that's fun button mashing but I

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.660 
and that's fun button mashing but I
don't<00:02:55.709> think<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:55.890> could<00:02:56.040> play<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.190> for<00:02:56.519> any

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
don't think I could play that for any

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.190 
don't think I could play that for any
amount<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:56.940> time<00:02:57.120> because<00:02:57.510> it's<00:02:57.690> just<00:02:57.840> like

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200
