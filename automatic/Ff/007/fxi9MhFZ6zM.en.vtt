00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.440

 custard spectacular your milk to 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.760
 Bustle point bring a bowl after 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.780
 but what I do also bouquets 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.690
 mixing sugar 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.380

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.070
 the eggs 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.140
 maybe I do not have a dream that I keep 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.180
 the recipe good the truth 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.160
 because there are the year's most notes 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.150
 stockings there preview of views 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:05.660
 to churras the eggs the yolks and 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.660
 orange zest ease and orange 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.410
 decent very well 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.180
 in the following it does not happen that I have a 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.180
 doubt each single easy 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.630
 antonella before hundreds of situations and 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.630
 caves 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.360
 to a liter of milk a cup of milk and 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.580
 He impersonates her for a cup of juice 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.280
 well the orange security can you 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.280
 make them and of port of chocolate 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.820
 of Orange 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.439
 and now let's put the starch that the 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.270
 we will dissolve to nothing left 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.390
 in lumps outside the fire 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:04.350
 we return everything seems to integrate everything well 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.299
 there it is very well perfect 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.369
 and well once you are all 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.450
 Vomiting well dissolved in juice 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.480
 orange the yolks the egg the sugar the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.959
 zest we incorporate a little more 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.550
 of milk and how long to mix mix 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.980
 until everything that did not went well 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.659
 nothing remains 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.930
 and now within this mobile we are going to 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.930
 put 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.290
 this repair that is cold is 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.290
 cool 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.870
 not so it's fine because a flavor is 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.030
 because for me it is much easier for 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.310
 stir the edges that we always 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.959
 and now betray a little while 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.450
 how it incorporates hot milk 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.560
 I'm going stir to stir to be 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.530
 perfectly very well there until it 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.079
 will remove the foam with whom I 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.959
 I do not want the hot 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:02.989
 pastry you can not separate from her 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.060
 not a minute 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.639
 clear decant the sugar kanto 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.420
 movie and it burns 6 we can talk about 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.209
 whatever you want 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.579
 let's stir until it boils 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.030
 the foam completely disappears 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.030
 start to be 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.709
 at this moment is when is any 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:27.439
 decanting pastry at the bottom of the 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.150
 burning bowl causes a 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:31.669
 Burning taste in all the cream 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.370
 even if you liquidate it separates now what 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:35.210
 that you want the burning remains in your 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.060
 inside 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.450
 there's a name because I know that this 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.450
 note
