00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 it will not be necessary to give a blow of gas 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.109
 of brake release let go of the pedal we go 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.519
 step forward quietly and this is the 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.769
 dosage our accelerator that will do 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.920
 that we will move forward in flexibility so at 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.580
 early we slow down the moment when we attack 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.369
 the entrance here we accelerate because it's good 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.539
 hands 9:15 one never staggered 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.369
 see there and we'll try to never 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.570
 retreat 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.310
 oh no no gas blow no shot 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.680
 gas we try to be the most regular that 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.380
 it's rants that's where we 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.270
 is flexible to the point that they have advanced there 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.730
 still continue in Corsica in force 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.260
 especially neither accelerate harder nor let go 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.690
 the accelerator pedal we did 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.989
 still ian howe 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.670
 this is still a little we maintain 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.670
 acceleration the time that the rocker 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:56.460
 we ask since on the way morning is 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.359
 well right we'll get to face 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.100
 next module let's go two 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.320
 technologies that we will be able to feel 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.759
 here the first is the help to 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.630
 start up so the audi old 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:11.399
 assists that she is active and here we 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.810
 So we stop to wait until the 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.560
 breaking evidence of the module when she 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.090
 will be in the descent 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.340
 we will stop progressing so in 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.470
 the climb here we will stop completely 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.100
 the car so I 'll cases finds 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.840
 on the ramp 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.640
 I would say there we are after braking 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.710
 so we brake hard we stop the car 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.899
 compact and then we will use the top 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.890
 says he goes downhill 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.890
 on the way down 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:43.500
 gently below quietly 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:48.750
 and in fact completely in the blocks 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.430
 and brake without accelerating the car 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.500
 keep see the small parking the piper 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.240
 reds and greens we are of course 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.550
 start-up assistance at the door stops 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.740
 now to move forward I'm enough 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.720
 to speed up quietly and the car 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.070
 without receding will advance when it has 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.369
 the necessary couple of a launch 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.700
 so there with a manual box him 0 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:13.260
 and brakes before the descent has braked 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.959
 we go down a little towards the brake I'm going 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.600
 remove the daudet at boot up 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.550
 I activated the he descent she 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.420
 help with the descent so not what 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.090
 you're going to do is you 're going 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.620
 gradually release the pedal 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.030
 brake and you will feel the break 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.220
 take over who will take 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:34.580
 the train with the control its speed 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.580
 decent roof 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.250
 are we going a little bit then after we go 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.650
 do a little dr so do not move 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.600
 when in the back if we were in 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.220
 rolling we have an anti rollover if we 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.769
 at a standstill moving the car 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.000
 could do your so no blow of 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.280
 Flying them abruptly either I will you 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.780
 guide of course if ever the car 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.269
 or health turn around just enough 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.360
 to crack in the descent and 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.010
 to accelerate already tried everything to go 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.230
 more gently when we climb on the 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:09.410
 then crawl the rear wheel with 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.410
 ground 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.230
 now like a little bit more 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:25.810
 more sleep we lose foot 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:25.810
 slightly on the way to the other side 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.130
 and it goes alone 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.880
 we saw a march still to 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.880
 return online
