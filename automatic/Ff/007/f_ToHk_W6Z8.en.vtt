do is sharpen it and it's like having a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.450 
do is sharpen it and it's like having a
brand-new<00:00:50.809> chain<00:00:51.809> again<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.649> it's<00:00:52.890> perfect

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
brand-new chain again so it's perfect

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.279
