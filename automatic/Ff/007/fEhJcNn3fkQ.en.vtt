the<00:02:29.980> next<00:02:30.370> stroke<00:02:30.550> that<00:02:30.730> we'll<00:02:30.880> talk<00:02:31.120> about<00:02:31.300> is

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
the next stroke that we'll talk about is

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.960 
the next stroke that we'll talk about is
called<00:02:32.050> a<00:02:32.320> Down<00:02:32.860> stroke

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
called a Down stroke

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.930 
called a Down stroke
so<00:02:34.750> unlike<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.320> full<00:02:35.680> stroke<00:02:36.010> once<00:02:36.400> we<00:02:36.610> play

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
so unlike the full stroke once we play

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.090 
so unlike the full stroke once we play
it<00:02:37.150> we<00:02:37.360> don't<00:02:37.930> come<00:02:38.290> back<00:02:38.530> up<00:02:38.770> to<00:02:38.950> this

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
it we don't come back up to this

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.710 
it we don't come back up to this
position<00:02:39.730> our<00:02:39.880> down<00:02:40.720> stroke<00:02:41.080> goes<00:02:41.320> down<00:02:41.710> and

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
position our down stroke goes down and

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.890 
position our down stroke goes down and
stays<00:02:43.720> there<00:02:44.310> we<00:02:45.310> use<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.730> down<00:02:45.940> stroke<00:02:46.300> a<00:02:46.450> lot

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
stays there we use the down stroke a lot

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.980 
stays there we use the down stroke a lot

the<00:04:26.850> very<00:04:27.150> important<00:04:27.690> stroke<00:04:27.990> is<00:04:28.170> called<00:04:28.830> the

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
the very important stroke is called the

the very important stroke is called the
upstroke<00:04:30.480> now<00:04:31.260> this<00:04:31.590> one<00:04:31.830> is<00:04:31.980> a<00:04:32.010> little<00:04:32.370> bit

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
upstroke now this one is a little bit

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.120 
upstroke now this one is a little bit
tricky<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.180> get<00:04:33.420> because<00:04:34.380> we're<00:04:34.560> not<00:04:34.770> tapping

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
tricky to get because we're not tapping

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.070 
tricky to get because we're not tapping
here's<00:04:35.700> a<00:04:35.760> tap<00:04:37.700> we're<00:04:38.700> not<00:04:38.880> tapping<00:04:39.210> we're

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
here's a tap we're not tapping we're

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.380 
here's a tap we're not tapping we're
going<00:04:40.260> to<00:04:40.350> hit<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:40.770> drum<00:04:41.070> and<00:04:41.430> we're<00:04:42.120> going<00:04:42.300> to

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
going to hit the drum and we're going to

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.040 
going to hit the drum and we're going to
pull<00:04:42.720> our<00:04:43.080> stick<00:04:43.530> back<00:04:44.010> up<00:04:44.600> so<00:04:45.600> that<00:04:45.630> it<00:04:46.020> is

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
pull our stick back up so that it is

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.400 
pull our stick back up so that it is
ready<00:04:46.530> for<00:04:47.340> normally<00:04:47.910> a<00:04:48.060> down<00:04:48.720> stroke<00:04:49.200> that's

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
ready for normally a down stroke that's

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.370 
ready for normally a down stroke that's
going<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:49.740> follow<00:04:49.920> it<00:04:50.480> so<00:04:51.480> here's<00:04:52.050> what<00:04:52.230> the

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
going to follow it so here's what the

00:04:52.380 --> 00:05:02.360 
going to follow it so here's what the
upstroke<00:04:52.800> looks<00:04:53.130> like<00:05:00.920> notice<00:05:01.920> how<00:05:02.130> I

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
upstroke looks like notice how I

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.500 
upstroke looks like notice how I
immediately<00:05:03.590> pull<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.890> stick<00:05:05.280> up<00:05:05.550> so<00:05:06.210> I'm<00:05:06.330> not

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
immediately pull the stick up so I'm not

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.780 
immediately pull the stick up so I'm not
this<00:05:06.930> is<00:05:06.990> what<00:05:07.320> this<00:05:07.890> is<00:05:08.070> one<00:05:08.280> thing<00:05:08.490> that<00:05:08.550> you

this is what this is one thing that you

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.530 
this is what this is one thing that you
want<00:05:08.970> to<00:05:09.060> be<00:05:09.570> very<00:05:09.600> careful<00:05:10.380> of<00:05:11.270> pulling<00:05:12.270> the

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.390 

there's<00:05:24.630> an<00:05:24.810> exercise<00:05:25.080> that<00:05:25.530> we<00:05:25.650> use<00:05:25.950> that

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
there's an exercise that we use that

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.130 
there's an exercise that we use that
shows<00:05:26.670> all<00:05:26.910> four<00:05:27.330> of<00:05:27.360> these<00:05:27.540> strokes<00:05:27.900> in
