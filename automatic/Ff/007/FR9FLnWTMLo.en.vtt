00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
at both pictures you could see all the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.649 
at both pictures you could see all the
similarities<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.670> they<00:02:03.000> had<00:02:03.180> now<00:02:03.299> keep<00:02:03.509> in

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659

mind<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.990> one<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.320> left<00:02:04.560> was<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> pre-alpha

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
mind the one on the left was a pre-alpha

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.399 
mind the one on the left was a pre-alpha
build<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.090> he<00:02:06.210> was<00:02:06.299> giving<00:02:06.570> information<00:02:06.719> on

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
build that he was giving information on

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.109 
build that he was giving information on
and<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.950> one<00:02:08.069> on<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.250> right<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.879> build

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
and the one on the right is the build

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.270 
and the one on the right is the build
for<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.509> beta<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.410> lot<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.649> things<00:02:10.920> change

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
for the beta so a lot of things change

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.930 
for the beta so a lot of things change
from<00:02:11.550> that

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
from that

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.840 
from that
out<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.570> so<00:02:13.140> there's<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.950> couple<00:02:14.160> names<00:02:14.610> that

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
out and so there's a couple names that

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.070 
out and so there's a couple names that
are<00:02:14.970> different<00:02:15.330> but<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.630> get<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.930> general

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
are different but you get the general

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.350 
are different but you get the general
idea<00:02:16.350> that<00:02:16.800> they<00:02:16.950> are<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.100> same<00:02:17.460> scorestreaks

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
idea that they are the same scorestreaks

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.960 
idea that they are the same scorestreaks
and<00:02:18.450> about<00:02:18.930> ah<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.470> said<00:02:19.920> eighty<00:02:20.160> before<00:02:20.730> but<00:02:20.940> I

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
and about ah I said eighty before but I

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.030 
and about ah I said eighty before but I
think<00:02:21.060> about<00:02:21.420> sixty<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.050> seventy<00:02:22.560> percent<00:02:22.590> of

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
think about sixty to seventy percent of

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.640 
think about sixty to seventy percent of
this<00:02:23.130> is<00:02:23.370> accurate<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.510> was<00:02:24.720> given<00:02:25.110> two

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
and a half maybe even three months ago

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.860
