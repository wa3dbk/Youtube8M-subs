00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
I thought it'd be fun to do some Lego

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.049 
I thought it'd be fun to do some Lego
Easter<00:00:13.200> eggs<00:00:13.380> so<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:13.740> built<00:00:14.099> this<00:00:14.309> basic<00:00:14.730> model

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
Easter eggs so I built this basic model

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.029 
Easter eggs so I built this basic model
here<00:00:15.269> that<00:00:15.450> opens<00:00:15.630> up<00:00:15.990> easily<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.890> can

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
here that opens up easily so you can

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.150 
here that opens up easily so you can
hide<00:00:17.250> some<00:00:17.670> things<00:00:17.910> inside<00:00:18.529> and<00:00:19.529> have<00:00:19.920> some

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
hide some things inside and have some

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.370 
hide some things inside and have some
fun<00:00:20.310> Easter<00:00:20.640> eggs<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.119> let's<00:00:21.930> get<00:00:22.050> down<00:00:22.199> to

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
fun Easter eggs so let's get down to

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.810 
fun Easter eggs so let's get down to
building<00:00:22.680> these<00:00:23.039> are<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.310> pieces<00:00:23.490> you'll

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
building these are the pieces you'll

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.609 
building these are the pieces you'll
need<00:00:23.880> for<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.240> bottom<00:00:24.539> half<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> egg<00:00:25.109> so

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
need for the bottom half of the egg so

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.349 
need for the bottom half of the egg so
your<00:00:25.830> Easter<00:00:26.250> egg<00:00:26.369> can<00:00:26.580> be<00:00:26.609> any<00:00:26.910> color<00:00:27.150> you

connect those with some 2 by 2 bricks
and<00:00:42.829> some<00:00:43.829> 2<00:00:44.010> by<00:00:44.190> 2<00:00:44.250> bricks<00:00:44.670> around<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.149> sides

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
and some 2 by 2 bricks around the sides

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.580 
and some 2 by 2 bricks around the sides
and<00:00:48.329> we're<00:00:48.420> going<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.600> put<00:00:48.780> some<00:00:48.989> 1<00:00:49.230> by<00:00:49.379> 1

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
and we're going to put some 1 by 1

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.350 
and we're going to put some 1 by 1
bricks<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.070> fill<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.430> little<00:00:50.579> holes<00:00:50.940> around

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
bricks to fill the little holes around

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:01.760 
bricks to fill the little holes around
the<00:00:51.449> edges<00:00:59.090> now<00:01:00.090> going<00:01:01.020> across<00:01:01.230> here<00:01:01.590> we're

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the edges now going across here we're

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.299 
the edges now going across here we're
going<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.920> use<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> 2<00:01:02.399> by<00:01:02.430> 4<00:01:02.609> brick<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.890> a<00:01:04.890> 2<00:01:05.100> by<00:01:05.280> 4

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
going to use a 2 by 4 brick and a 2 by 4

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.200 
going to use a 2 by 4 brick and a 2 by 4
brick<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> other<00:01:06.180> side<00:01:06.510> then<00:01:07.700> across<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
brick on the other side then across the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.740 
brick on the other side then across the
tops<00:01:09.600> we'll<00:01:09.930> do<00:01:10.080> one<00:01:10.320> by<00:01:10.500> fours<00:01:14.299> and<00:01:15.299> now<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.450> ran

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
tops we'll do one by fours and now I ran

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.719 
tops we'll do one by fours and now I ran
out<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.930> one<00:01:16.170> by<00:01:16.320> fours<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:16.950> I'm<00:01:17.040> using<00:01:17.310> 1<00:01:17.580> by

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
out of one by fours so I'm using 1 by

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.359 
out of one by fours so I'm using 1 by
2's<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> next<00:01:18.659> level<00:01:19.040> but<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.070> could

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
2's on the next level but that could

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.330 
2's on the next level but that could
also<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.759> 1<00:01:20.970> by<00:01:21.090> 4<00:01:24.259> and<00:01:25.259> now<00:01:25.409> depending<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.009> if

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
also be a 1 by 4 and now depending on if

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.190 
also be a 1 by 4 and now depending on if
you<00:01:26.580> want<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.790> make<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.119> be<00:01:27.420> easy<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.990> pull

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
you want to make this be easy to pull

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.480 
you want to make this be easy to pull
apart<00:01:28.229> I'm<00:01:28.650> going<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.860> do<00:01:29.009> some<00:01:29.220> tile

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
apart I'm going to do some tile

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.730 
apart I'm going to do some tile
techniques<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.329> could<00:01:30.479> also<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.930> stop

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
techniques but you could also just stop

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.800 
techniques but you could also just stop
right<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.640> start<00:01:32.850> building<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.299> second

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
right here and start building the second

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.260 
right here and start building the second
half<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> egg<00:01:34.259> after<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.880> but<00:01:35.880> with<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
half of the egg after this but with the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.770 
half of the egg after this but with the
tile<00:01:36.540> level<00:01:36.960> we'll<00:01:37.140> do<00:01:37.350> one<00:01:37.860> by<00:01:38.040> fours<00:01:38.659> on<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
tile level we'll do one by fours on the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.780 
tile level we'll do one by fours on the
top<00:01:40.020> here<00:01:41.329> on<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> top<00:01:42.689> here<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.340> some<00:01:44.340> 1<00:01:44.579> by<00:01:44.729> 2

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
top here on the top here and some 1 by 2

00:01:44.790 --> 00:02:00.950 
top here on the top here and some 1 by 2
tiles<00:01:46.909> on<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:47.970> four<00:01:48.720> corners<00:01:49.380> here

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.200 

and<00:02:01.289> if<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:02.039> have<00:02:02.219> some<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.729> want<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.060> you

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and if you have some and want to you

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.819 
and if you have some and want to you
could<00:02:03.329> fill<00:02:03.539> on<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.840> part<00:02:04.229> with<00:02:04.380> tile<00:02:04.590> too

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
could fill on that part with tile too

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.340 
could fill on that part with tile too
but<00:02:05.039> it's<00:02:05.159> not<00:02:05.340> necessary<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.840> then<00:02:06.960> some<00:02:07.140> 1

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
but it's not necessary and then some 1

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.080 
but it's not necessary and then some 1
by<00:02:07.500> 2<00:02:07.560> plates<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.340> edge<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.789> what<00:02:09.000> I've

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
by 2 plates on the edge so what I've

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.300 
by 2 plates on the edge so what I've
done<00:02:09.239> here<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.539> I've<00:02:09.780> made<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.799> all<00:02:11.009> flat

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
done here is I've made this all flat

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.580 
done here is I've made this all flat
aside<00:02:11.670> from<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.940> few<00:02:12.180> spots<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.170> will<00:02:13.440> let

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
aside from a few spots so that will let

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.650 
aside from a few spots so that will let
us<00:02:13.739> connect<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.370> top<00:02:14.580> half<00:02:14.849> of<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.120> egg<00:02:15.239> nice

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
us connect the top half of the egg nice

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.150 
us connect the top half of the egg nice
and<00:02:15.900> loosely<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:16.349> it's<00:02:16.470> easy<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.799> pull<00:02:17.010> off

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
and loosely so it's easy to pull off

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.210 
and loosely so it's easy to pull off
without<00:02:17.370> pulling<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.849> whole<00:02:18.030> thing<00:02:18.239> apart

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
without pulling the whole thing apart

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.320 
without pulling the whole thing apart
these<00:02:20.220> are<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.459> pieces<00:02:20.640> you'll<00:02:20.940> need<00:02:21.060> for<00:02:21.239> the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
these are the pieces you'll need for the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.080 
these are the pieces you'll need for the
top<00:02:21.480> half<00:02:21.720> of<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.989> egg<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.879> I'm<00:02:23.879> going<00:02:24.030> to

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
top half of the egg so I'm going to

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.699 
top half of the egg so I'm going to
build<00:02:24.209> this<00:02:24.360> from<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.629> top<00:02:24.840> down<00:02:25.110> starting

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709
