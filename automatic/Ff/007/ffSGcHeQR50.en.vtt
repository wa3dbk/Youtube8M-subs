00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.679
 a bus trip can be super 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.210
 relaxing until you can lie down 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.609
 as long as that gentleman in the background looks at you 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.349
 as if you were crazy or 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.749
 it can simply be a very busy day 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.480
 how can you look at what there is to 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:31.130
 through your window can be about 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.130
 where do you live or somewhere far away 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.420
 one of the favorite places of the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.420
 politicians who like to tear down 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.820
 I am roig third worldist says what 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.820
 what do you think 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.100
 I have not said that for a long time 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.290
 are the incredible super buses of 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.060
 paraguay 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.060
 that are super well equipped 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.290
 I will go to hell for telling lies 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.330
 even a cart is better equipped 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.340
 that to a bus here in Paraguay 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.670
 and specifically I talk about those lines 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.670
 what 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.300
 to travel on a line here you have to 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.250
 cut off the legs in case it's 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.400
 so it's from there to find your 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.100
 seat we leave spaces so tiny 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.409
 that incredible syndication just a 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:35.060
 dwarf can sit quietly 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:38.200
 and do not even think your fat partners are about 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.200
 cables or not to enter 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.580
 poor things and things always 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.100
 complicates when we think about how from 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.080
 in Paraguay 20 the morning when you go to your 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.420
 work or 6 in the afternoon when you're 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.000
 leaving your work peak time 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.340
 let's put the collective always going 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.890
 overflowing there is never a seat or a 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.540
 space to a recondite to be able to be 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.570
 quietly one has to go hanging 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.580
 over the door and my mother if it is that 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.320
 someone comes to sneeze because 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.100
 me if someone is going to have to leave 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.100
 flying through the window 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.099
 thank goodness I bought it so I was not going 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.390
 to be nothing the situation many 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.769
 nations we have to pull the window 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.480
 body of going down collective because 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.040
 many times we do not get to the door of 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.370
 the exit nor of the entrance 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.560
 then the only internal bone formation 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.230
 a few weeks ago when I was in 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.209
 collective my faculty if I use the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.540
 collective like the people of the proletariat 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.310
 and that some problem what happened was that 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.470
 from one moment to the next the interior 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.530
 it began to fill with gray white smoke 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:47.680
 fuchsia fire shouting women doing 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.840
 drama and men not so men too 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.480
 we had to get off this collective 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.409
 shit and I could not get my money back 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.409
 and this is what happened 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.890
 and Paraguay because the government does not 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.020
 supports anything by giving us something much 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.060
 better in which our works will travel 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.280
 studies or wherever we understand that 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.770
 we have to keep traveling in these 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.740
 things full of cockroach are you with 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.840
 seat if you get a seat that 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.850
 gives a back pain and the eternal 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.490
 regulated that make us arrive late to 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.710
 wherever we plan to leave the only thing 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.640
 what remains is to manifest us arrive 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:30.680
 more to demand something better the 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.299
 metrobus bicycles what do I know 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.920
 but we all know that this is a 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.140
 waste of time to politicians les 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.439
 enter here 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:42.140
 we carry these super cars with 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:45.469
 airplanes so included and already with 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:49.219
 wheels and I do not know if there is that there is like 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:52.329
 exercise or read them a story 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.329
 a son when they are boys 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.510
 but I'm not complaining just for the 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.269
 terrible bus service create lines 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.410
 that we have here in Paraguay but for the 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.830
 lack of security 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.720
 that's mainly what bothers me 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.810
 imagine if instead of being a fire and 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.210
 humor would have happened a kind of 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.209
 explosion as well as in those movies of 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.519
 hollywood if there were deaths 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.190
 because of these time bombs in 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.710
 the one that we eat every day and that their 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.180
 owners of the companies 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.400
 responsible for these trucks are 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.440
 circulating refuse to leave aside 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.150
 to renew their truck and 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.970
 offer a better clear service not to them 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.889
 it suits with that silver only thus the 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.610
 things will change and they will improve in 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:43.039
 this country is a question how much more 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.190
 we have to endure and paraguay the thing 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:49.039
 it's like complaints strikes demonstrations and 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.289
 nothing happens but a tragedy happens and 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.630
 there goes everybody starts to move 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.940
 to improve the service I do not know if 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.490
 remember the theme of the ycuá bolaños good 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.680
 something like that has to happen for this 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.539
 of the junk collectives are no longer 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.550
 side and the truck plant is renewed 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.380
 this video I'm not doing it because 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.290
 we have for my life 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.720
 but because the other time I really 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.430
 It scared because I feared for my life 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.680
 companion of the person who was me 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.780
 accompanying during that journey and not 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.960
 I want to hear that I am sentimental 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.310
