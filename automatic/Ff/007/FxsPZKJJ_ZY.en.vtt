with this right here

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:17.530 
with this right here
um<00:01:12.979> so<00:01:13.979> got<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.880> as<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.570> currently<00:01:15.720> stands<00:01:16.140> I

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
um so got it as it currently stands I

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.940 
um so got it as it currently stands I
can<00:01:18.540> use<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.259> as<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> reference<00:01:19.830> point<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:21.950> can

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
can use this as a reference point I can

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.580 
can use this as a reference point I can
get<00:01:23.900> about<00:01:25.430> twelve<00:01:27.200> rotations<00:01:28.200> out<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.680> I

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
get about twelve rotations out of it I

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.469 
get about twelve rotations out of it I
don't<00:01:31.590> think<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.950> full<00:01:32.280> five<00:01:32.909> feet<00:01:33.180> five

I<00:01:40.020> can<00:01:40.170> get<00:01:40.320> more<00:01:41.189> rotations<00:01:41.729> more<00:01:42.329> power<00:01:42.680> and

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
I can get more rotations more power and

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.960 
I can get more rotations more power and
longer<00:01:44.610> pull<00:01:44.790> with<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:48.829> so<00:01:49.829> yeah<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.490> see<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.850> in
