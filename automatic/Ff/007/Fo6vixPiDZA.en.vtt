ghosts<00:03:45.519> and<00:03:45.610> advanced<00:03:46.570> warfare<00:03:46.930> you<00:03:47.140> know

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
ghosts and advanced warfare you know

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.990 
ghosts and advanced warfare you know
they<00:03:47.440> have<00:03:47.680> they<00:03:48.220> have<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.519> know<00:03:48.670> to<00:03:48.730> make<00:03:48.850> a

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
they have they have to know to make a

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.520 
they have they have to know to make a
bunch<00:03:49.299> of<00:03:49.420> changes<00:03:49.810> because<00:03:50.110> I<00:03:50.290> mean<00:03:50.410> they're

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
bunch of changes because I mean they're

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.860 
bunch of changes because I mean they're
not<00:03:50.650> just<00:03:50.769> gonna<00:03:50.920> make<00:03:51.730> a<00:03:51.790> game<00:03:52.060> similar<00:03:52.450> or

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
not just gonna make a game similar or

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.840 
not just gonna make a game similar or
just<00:03:53.350> like<00:03:53.470> similar<00:03:53.859> mechanics<00:03:54.519> or<00:03:54.609> anything

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
just like similar mechanics or anything

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.880 
just like similar mechanics or anything
like<00:03:54.880> that<00:03:55.000> because<00:03:55.299> they<00:03:55.570> I<00:03:55.870> mean<00:03:56.350> think<00:03:56.709> they

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
like that because they I mean think they

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.280 
like that because they I mean think they
ultimately<00:03:57.190> make<00:03:57.760> it<00:03:57.910> to<00:03:58.120> make<00:03:58.239> sales<00:03:58.510> and<00:03:58.840> a

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290
