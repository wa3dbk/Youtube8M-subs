top five reasons reason 5 glossy is

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.779 
top five reasons reason 5 glossy is
glossiness<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.779> 3d<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.220> the<00:00:20.220> truth<00:00:20.460> des<00:00:20.609> -

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
glossiness on the 3d is the truth des -

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.640 
glossiness on the 3d is the truth des -
des<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.270> actually<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.660> matte<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.470> matte

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
des is actually is matte the matte

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.009 
des is actually is matte the matte
finish<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.699> means<00:00:24.090> no<00:00:24.449> fingerprints

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
finish so that means no fingerprints

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.710 
finish so that means no fingerprints
which<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.890> big<00:00:26.250> deal<00:00:26.460> given<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.449> fact<00:00:27.630> that

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
which is a big deal given the fact that

you're<00:00:27.900> always<00:00:28.170> holding<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.680> system<00:00:29.070> and

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
you're always holding the system and

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.700 
you're always holding the system and
that's<00:00:30.539> those<00:00:30.869> fingerprints<00:00:31.320> they<00:00:31.500> get

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
that's those fingerprints they get

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.870

compared<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.790> this<00:04:05.910> which<00:04:06.540> at<00:04:06.810> last<00:04:07.019> is<00:04:07.230> only

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.229 
compared to this which at last is only
25<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.519> this<00:04:08.700> loss<00:04:08.880> is<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.299> 3.5<00:04:10.260> to<00:04:10.650> 5.5<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.459> I

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
25 and this loss is a 3.5 to 5.5 and I

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.240 
25 and this loss is a 3.5 to 5.5 and I
think<00:04:12.450> this<00:04:12.600> should<00:04:12.810> also<00:04:13.019> last<00:04:13.350> longer<00:04:13.980> just

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
think this should also last longer just

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.069 
think this should also last longer just
because<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:14.579> doesn't<00:04:14.700> have<00:04:14.850> to<00:04:14.970> be<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.359> if<00:04:15.959> you

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
because it doesn't have to be and if you

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.479 
because it doesn't have to be and if you
excellent<00:04:16.350> need<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.650> turn<00:04:16.739> on<00:04:16.829> your<00:04:16.979> 3<00:04:17.220> by

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.600 
storage consideration
um<00:04:24.910> this<00:04:25.780> second<00:04:26.470> reason<00:04:27.010> why<00:04:27.250> I<00:04:27.280> think<00:04:27.430> the

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
um this second reason why I think the

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.580 
um this second reason why I think the
two<00:04:27.730> years<00:04:27.970> is<00:04:28.120> better<00:04:28.270> is<00:04:28.540> because<00:04:28.810> it's<00:04:29.350> um

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
two years is better is because it's um

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.990 
two years is better is because it's um
it's<00:04:30.100> more<00:04:30.220> durable<00:04:31.410> but<00:04:32.410> gts<00:04:32.980> has<00:04:33.640> a<00:04:33.670> hinge

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
it's more durable but gts has a hinge

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.300 
it's more durable but gts has a hinge
and<00:04:34.210> this<00:04:34.810> hinge<00:04:35.080> I'm<00:04:35.560> not<00:04:35.830> sure<00:04:35.950> how<00:04:36.070> long

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
and this hinge I'm not sure how long

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.080 
and this hinge I'm not sure how long
it's<00:04:36.580> gonna<00:04:36.670> last

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
it's gonna last

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.020 
it's gonna last

long<00:04:52.180> I<00:04:52.570> mean<00:04:53.320> I<00:04:53.350> still<00:04:53.530> have<00:04:53.590> my<00:04:53.710> own<00:04:53.860> game<00:04:54.070> on

my old gameboy color

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.870 
my old gameboy color
I<00:04:55.720> might<00:04:56.020> need<00:04:56.140> boy<00:04:56.350> advance<00:04:56.710> the<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.610> first

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
I might need boy advance the the first

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.200 
I might need boy advance the the first
Game<00:04:58.060> Boy<00:04:58.210> Advance<00:04:58.420> not<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:58.720> SP<00:04:59.380> and<00:05:00.210> they're

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
Game Boy Advance not the SP and they're

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.880

still working fine it lasts
and<00:05:03.430> I<00:05:03.520> think<00:05:03.580> this<00:05:03.910> hinge<00:05:04.210> right<00:05:04.450> here<00:05:04.630> is

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
and I think this hinge right here is

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.410 
and I think this hinge right here is
what<00:05:05.590> gonna<00:05:05.800> make<00:05:06.010> this<00:05:06.220> what's<00:05:06.940> gonna<00:05:07.210> make

opening<00:05:22.030> this<00:05:22.150> up<00:05:22.360> a<00:05:22.540> a<00:05:23.500> little<00:05:23.970> ribbon<00:05:24.970> it's

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
opening this up a a little ribbon it's

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.510 
opening this up a a little ribbon it's
being<00:05:25.720> stressed<00:05:26.110> and<00:05:26.320> I'm<00:05:27.040> not<00:05:27.190> sure<00:05:27.340> how<00:05:27.490> long

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
being stressed and I'm not sure how long

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.500 
being stressed and I'm not sure how long
I'm<00:05:28.120> not<00:05:28.150> sure<00:05:28.270> how<00:05:28.510> long<00:05:28.690> that<00:05:28.750> lasts<00:05:29.500> but

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
I'm not sure how long that lasts but

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.740 
I'm not sure how long that lasts but
yeah<00:05:31.510> it's<00:05:31.780> the<00:05:32.320> chances<00:05:32.710> failure<00:05:33.130> is<00:05:33.280> more

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
yeah it's the chances failure is more

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.690 
yeah it's the chances failure is more
verses<00:05:34.750> A<00:05:34.780> to<00:05:35.020> D<00:05:35.050> yet<00:05:35.350> there's<00:05:36.010> just<00:05:36.220> one<00:05:36.430> piece

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
verses A to D yet there's just one piece

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.310 
verses A to D yet there's just one piece
you<00:05:37.510> don't<00:05:37.660> have<00:05:37.810> to<00:05:37.870> worry<00:05:38.020> about<00:05:38.110> that

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
you don't have to worry about that

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.540 
you don't have to worry about that
everything<00:05:38.620> is<00:05:38.710> connected<00:05:38.920> there's<00:05:39.430> no

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
everything is connected there's no

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.330 
everything is connected there's no
moving<00:05:39.760> parts<00:05:39.930> compare<00:05:40.930> this<00:05:41.080> which<00:05:42.010> is<00:05:42.160> why

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
moving parts compare this which is why

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.950 
moving parts compare this which is why
I'm<00:05:42.610> it's<00:05:43.150> like<00:05:43.270> the<00:05:43.360> theory<00:05:43.570> of<00:05:43.690> you<00:05:43.840> know

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
I'm it's like the theory of you know

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.020 
I'm it's like the theory of you know
Hawaii<00:05:44.230> s<00:05:44.350> is<00:05:44.530> solid<00:05:45.310> state<00:05:45.460> memory<00:05:45.640> is<00:05:45.880> better

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
Hawaii s is solid state memory is better

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.000 
Hawaii s is solid state memory is better
than<00:05:46.240> the<00:05:46.360> hard<00:05:46.540> drives<00:05:46.780> is<00:05:47.020> because<00:05:47.320> solid

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
than the hard drives is because solid

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.410 
than the hard drives is because solid
state<00:05:48.190> memories<00:05:48.520> don't<00:05:48.670> have<00:05:48.820> moving<00:05:49.090> parts

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.420 
state memories don't have moving parts

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.990 
state memories don't have moving parts
or<00:05:49.630> that<00:05:50.410> compared<00:05:51.400> to<00:05:51.430> a<00:05:51.520> hard<00:05:51.670> drive<00:05:51.760> what

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
or that compared to a hard drive what

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.910 
or that compared to a hard drive what
does<00:05:52.210> which<00:05:52.870> is<00:05:52.990> reason<00:05:53.320> which<00:05:53.470> is<00:05:53.500> the<00:05:53.770> reason

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 
does which is reason which is the reason

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.280 
does which is reason which is the reason
why<00:05:54.100> I<00:05:54.130> sell<00:05:54.340> SSDs<00:05:54.880> could<00:05:55.570> last<00:05:55.810> longer<00:05:55.930> than

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
why I sell SSDs could last longer than

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.680 
why I sell SSDs could last longer than
hard<00:05:56.530> drive<00:05:56.740> same<00:05:57.100> reason<00:05:57.370> here<00:05:57.520> this<00:05:58.180> TBS

hard drive same reason here this TBS

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.860 
hard drive same reason here this TBS
will<00:05:59.110> probably<00:05:59.470> last<00:05:59.650> longer<00:06:00.690> than<00:06:01.690> this

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.360 
will probably last longer than this
prettiest<00:06:02.320> because<00:06:02.830> it<00:06:02.980> doesn't<00:06:03.220> have<00:06:03.340> that

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370

prettiest because it doesn't have that
moving<00:06:03.790> hinge<00:06:03.970> and<00:06:04.780> my<00:06:05.320> final<00:06:06.010> reason<00:06:06.310> why<00:06:06.490> the

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
moving hinge and my final reason why the

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.000 
moving hinge and my final reason why the
QD<00:06:07.510> s<00:06:07.660> is<00:06:07.930> better<00:06:08.170> than<00:06:08.410> the<00:06:08.500> 3<00:06:08.680> es<00:06:08.830> is<00:06:09.960> pricing

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
QD s is better than the 3 es is pricing

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.520 
QD s is better than the 3 es is pricing
this<00:06:12.010> is<00:06:12.070> this<00:06:12.520> retails<00:06:12.880> for<00:06:13.230> $130<00:06:14.230> this

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
this is this retails for $130 this

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.270 
this is this retails for $130 this
retails<00:06:14.950> for<00:06:15.600> 170<00:06:16.600> dollars<00:06:16.830> which<00:06:17.830> is<00:06:18.010> a<00:06:18.040> big

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
retails for 170 dollars which is a big

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.710 
retails for 170 dollars which is a big
difference<00:06:18.400> it's<00:06:18.760> about<00:06:18.940> it's<00:06:19.210> a<00:06:19.330> $40

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
difference it's about it's a $40

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.440 
difference it's about it's a $40
difference<00:06:20.170> I'm<00:06:20.830> giving<00:06:21.400> tax<00:06:21.640> to<00:06:21.910> as<00:06:22.120> well

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.450 
difference I'm giving tax to as well

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.650 
difference I'm giving tax to as well
and<00:06:22.540> that's<00:06:23.530> almost<00:06:24.070> a<00:06:24.190> game<00:06:24.370> so<00:06:24.640> in<00:06:25.030> theory<00:06:25.390> if

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
and that's almost a game so in theory if

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.840 
and that's almost a game so in theory if
you<00:06:25.780> just<00:06:25.900> pick<00:06:26.050> up<00:06:26.110> this<00:06:26.260> 3ds<00:06:26.680> you're<00:06:27.670> not

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.850 
you just pick up this 3ds you're not

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.600 
you just pick up this 3ds you're not
gonna<00:06:28.000> you<00:06:28.840> can<00:06:28.870> if<00:06:29.260> you<00:06:29.350> have<00:06:29.440> only<00:06:29.620> $170<00:06:30.460> and

gonna you can if you have only $170 and

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.310 
gonna you can if you have only $170 and
you<00:06:30.700> pick<00:06:30.820> up<00:06:30.940> this<00:06:31.060> tree<00:06:31.270> Deus<00:06:31.510> you<00:06:32.050> can't

you pick up this tree Deus you can't

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.320 
you pick up this tree Deus you can't
afford<00:06:32.590> a<00:06:32.919> game<00:06:33.070> and<00:06:33.310> you're<00:06:33.910> stuck<00:06:34.180> with<00:06:34.270> a

afford a game and you're stuck with a

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.450 
afford a game and you're stuck with a
system<00:06:34.690> without<00:06:34.810> any<00:06:35.050> games<00:06:35.290> which<00:06:35.530> is<00:06:35.680> bad<00:06:35.919> if

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
system without any games which is bad if

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.490 
system without any games which is bad if
you<00:06:36.669> have<00:06:36.730> a<00:06:36.900> $170

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
you have a $170

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.200 
you have a $170
pick<00:06:38.740> up<00:06:38.860> this<00:06:38.980> system<00:06:39.220> and<00:06:39.610> the<00:06:39.790> video<00:06:40.030> game

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
pick up this system and the video game

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.060 
pick up this system and the video game
as<00:06:40.450> well<00:06:40.690> which<00:06:40.900> is<00:06:41.110> good<00:06:41.290> because<00:06:41.620> you<00:06:41.830> know

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
as well which is good because you know

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.390 
as well which is good because you know
Pokemon<00:06:43.060> to<00:06:43.180> last<00:06:43.360> you<00:06:43.480> a<00:06:43.510> long<00:06:43.660> time<00:06:44.400> Fire

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
Pokemon to last you a long time Fire

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.120 
Pokemon to last you a long time Fire
Emblem<00:06:45.580> there's<00:06:46.360> a<00:06:46.420> longer<00:06:46.690> games<00:06:46.900> on<00:06:47.100> the<00:06:48.100> 3ds

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.130 
Emblem there's a longer games on the 3ds

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.440 
Emblem there's a longer games on the 3ds
or<00:06:48.700> the<00:06:49.030> three<00:06:49.210> TS

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.450 
or the three TS

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.690 
or the three TS
so<00:06:50.050> I<00:06:50.080> mean<00:06:50.470> that's<00:06:50.620> always<00:06:50.770> good<00:06:51.010> and<00:06:51.280> also

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:51.700 
so I mean that's always good and also

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.600 
so I mean that's always good and also
not<00:06:51.880> every<00:06:52.120> game<00:06:52.300> requires<00:06:52.720> three<00:06:53.050> I<00:06:53.350> mean<00:06:53.920> the

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
not every game requires three I mean the

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.670 
not every game requires three I mean the
legends<00:06:54.880> don't<00:06:55.000> work<00:06:55.360> all<00:06:55.510> the<00:06:55.600> time<00:06:55.660> I<00:06:56.050> like

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 
legends don't work all the time I like

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.680 
legends don't work all the time I like
that<00:06:56.860> it<00:06:57.100> does<00:06:57.430> allows<00:06:57.820> you<00:06:58.000> to<00:06:58.090> use<00:06:58.240> redrew

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
that it does allows you to use redrew

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.260 
that it does allows you to use redrew
out<00:06:58.780> the<00:06:58.900> game<00:06:59.080> but<00:06:59.680> I<00:06:59.920> mean<00:07:00.250> if<00:07:00.400> I<00:07:00.520> didn't<00:07:01.150> have

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.270 
out the game but I mean if I didn't have

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.060 
out the game but I mean if I didn't have
to<00:07:01.300> read<00:07:01.600> I<00:07:01.720> wouldn't<00:07:02.230> hinder<00:07:02.440> my<00:07:02.590> experience

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.070 
to read I wouldn't hinder my experience

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:08.010 
to read I wouldn't hinder my experience
same<00:07:03.520> as<00:07:03.640> Pokemon<00:07:04.500> Fire<00:07:05.500> Emblem<00:07:05.620> and<00:07:07.020> most

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020 
same as Pokemon Fire Emblem and most

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.410 
same as Pokemon Fire Emblem and most
other<00:07:08.710> games<00:07:08.860> I<00:07:09.010> have<00:07:09.190> I<00:07:09.400> think<00:07:09.730> it's<00:07:09.880> all<00:07:10.060> hemp

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:10.420 
other games I have I think it's all hemp
