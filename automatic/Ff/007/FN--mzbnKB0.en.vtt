I

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:01.590 
I

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:07.250 
I
I<00:00:05.240> work<00:00:06.240> in<00:00:06.270> universities<00:00:06.870> because<00:00:07.020> I'm

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:07.260 
I work in universities because I'm

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.080 
I work in universities because I'm
driven<00:00:07.440> by<00:00:07.620> our<00:00:07.650> ideas<00:00:08.099> I<00:00:08.340> found<00:00:08.849> that<00:00:09.000> it

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
driven by our ideas I found that it

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.310 
driven by our ideas I found that it
doesn't<00:00:09.330> matter<00:00:09.480> too<00:00:09.690> much<00:00:09.720> whether<00:00:10.110> those

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
doesn't matter too much whether those

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.380 
doesn't matter too much whether those
ideas<00:00:10.680> are<00:00:10.769> mine<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.309> they<00:00:11.550> come<00:00:11.760> with<00:00:11.940> my<00:00:12.090> own

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:12.390 
ideas are mine and they come with my own

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.360 
ideas are mine and they come with my own
hands<00:00:12.960> whether<00:00:13.530> those<00:00:13.740> ideas<00:00:14.070> come<00:00:14.340> from

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
hands whether those ideas come from

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.129 
hands whether those ideas come from
others<00:00:14.760> and<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.970> can<00:00:15.150> watch<00:00:15.300> them<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.720> admire

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
others and I can watch them and admire

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.650 
others and I can watch them and admire
them<00:00:16.349> I<00:00:16.529> get<00:00:17.400> enormous<00:00:17.850> satisfaction<00:00:18.060> from

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
them I get enormous satisfaction from

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.570 
them I get enormous satisfaction from
building<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:18.990> sorts<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.380> environments<00:00:19.680> that

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
building the sorts of environments that

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.189 
building the sorts of environments that
foster<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:21.270> development<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.840> those<00:00:22.020> ideas

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
foster the development of those ideas

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.900 
foster the development of those ideas
and<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:23.039> environment<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.580> think<00:00:23.760> I've

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
and the environment that I think I've

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.580 
and the environment that I think I've
described<00:00:24.330> as<00:00:24.449> over<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.720> powerful<00:00:25.170> precinct

described as over the powerful precinct

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.109 
described as over the powerful precinct
is<00:00:25.740> precisely<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.400> sort<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.670> thing<00:00:26.820> we<00:00:26.940> need

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
is precisely the sort of thing we need

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.929 
is precisely the sort of thing we need
to<00:00:27.150> aspire<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.779> as<00:00:28.020> I<00:00:28.980> understand<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.760> the

fast as it could they built the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.560 
fast as it could they built the

University on the outside of a city and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.900 
University on the outside of a city and
it<00:00:39.719> was<00:00:39.750> surrounded<00:00:40.290> by<00:00:40.320> fields<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.670> when<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
it was surrounded by fields so when the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.580 
it was surrounded by fields so when the
time<00:00:42.090> came<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.480> build<00:00:42.660> large<00:00:42.899> hospitals<00:00:43.440> in

time came to build large hospitals in

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.290 
time came to build large hospitals in
like<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.130> obvious<00:00:44.280> place<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.730> put<00:00:45.030> them<00:00:45.180> was

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
like the obvious place to put them was

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.000 
like the obvious place to put them was
next<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.630> the<00:00:45.719> University<00:00:46.200> where<00:00:46.710> there<00:00:46.860> was<00:00:46.980> a

next to the University where there was a

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.280

it but I think what people really look
for<00:05:38.460> when<00:05:38.669> they<00:05:38.850> understand<00:05:39.690> what<00:05:39.810> research

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
for when they understand what research
