00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.959 
storage is already combined which makes
it<00:02:00.750> 2.66<00:02:01.560> gigabytes<00:02:02.100> which<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.460> think<00:02:02.670> enough

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
it 2.66 gigabytes which I think enough

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.179 
it 2.66 gigabytes which I think enough
for<00:02:03.180> some<00:02:03.390> decent<00:02:03.689> large<00:02:04.049> games<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.590> apps<00:02:04.860> I

comparing to the media tech phones it's

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.860 
comparing to the media tech phones it's
more<00:03:35.459> minimalist<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.239> each<00:03:36.480> year<00:03:36.660> to

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
more minimalist and each year to

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.509 
more minimalist and each year to
navigate<00:03:37.260> but<00:03:37.620> for<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.829> first<00:03:38.010> impression<00:03:38.160> of

navigate but for the first impression of

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.490 
navigate but for the first impression of
the<00:03:38.669> camera<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.209> find<00:03:39.450> below<00:03:39.690> average<00:03:39.930> for<00:03:40.169> the

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
the camera I find below average for the

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.710 
the camera I find below average for the
megapixel<00:03:41.370> quality<00:03:41.819> looking<00:03:42.209> at<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.450> screen

but<00:03:43.079> still<00:03:43.319> I<00:03:43.349> will<00:03:43.530> check<00:03:43.859> the<00:03:44.010> actual<00:03:44.310> output

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
but still I will check the actual output

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.280 
but still I will check the actual output
for<00:03:44.910> better<00:03:45.090> comparison<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:45.959> for<00:03:46.200> the
