00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.010
 now it was really worth it 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.110
 Winehouse was still deciding about 85 percent of the time 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.019
 home builder 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.529
 for a massive house stone on stone 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.470
 but the industry representatives seem to be in terms of quality and innovation 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.699
 to have followed suit 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.899
 We had a look at the German representative Tat last weekend 

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.899
 thrown behind the walls 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.300
 to the dream house 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.270
 in just a few days 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.040
 What a massive house with absolute illusion is with a prefabricated house 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.870
 to reality 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.060
 Because in just one or two days, a complete shell in return is pleased with 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.210
 The interior design can be started so fascinating again 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.220
 how fast about committee goes in the current weather but only insofar as 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.149
 impressed old pictures that something can do within a day 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.149
 is amazing kids keep covered what's for you 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.080
 Clock starts then so and so and so - 7 4% time is needed 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.130
 I ran in the future to put on only a counter and expand equipment 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.950
 BBG age quite in it 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.950
 Stefan Steinhauer is a lot of nothing behind it 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.950
 Prefabricated houses are the result of decades of sophisticated construction technology 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.220
 in which everything relieves in detail 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.780
 For example, everything is completely in one at this manufacturer 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.610
 Assembly hall manufactured 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.620
 we start with the preparation of the installation 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.200
 Water pipes Heating pipes everything that will be installed in the construction 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.370
 prepared here afterwards 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.119
 there wood and plates cut 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:37.950
 after all 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.330
 the assembly in the assembly of the wall 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.020
 Deckenbach elements 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.320
 and finally last 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.490
 window installation 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.460
 woodz 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.790
 and the loading on the truck 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.670
 until then, just three days pass 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.650
 a record time compared to a massive one 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.300
 a prefabricated house like this is by no means off the shelf 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.550
 because each construction project with specially supervised by an architect so can the 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.760
 Client changing his house individually We want to give the customer examples 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.409
 give 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.580
 he can make a house out of these catalogs and say that's mine 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.379
 direction 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.250
 If I do not want to postpone it, I want to build something on it here that is 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:21.150
 Anything is possible and percent can also be in individual is out of us 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.769
 either comes with it on the finished draft of a pari texts 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.040
 or our architect makes holidays a design specifically to his wishes 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.779
 tailored 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:34.069
 By contrast, technical developments such as the so-called 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.129
 KeyMatic wall 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:40.139
 an innovation that saves money and the indoor climate improves the band theme 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.149
 has two major advantages to go 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:47.249
 normal lance scenes for a name like a thief is open to us when system 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:51.420
 on the other hand we have a summer heat protection that means we 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:56.089
 need on the inside of the wall construction and no foil no 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:03:00.359
 The humidity is usually higher in the house than outdoors 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.900
 So it can ground into the wall and on the outside again 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.519
 step out 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.490
 Without foil, the band can act accordingly 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.740
 this is possible with a specially developed system 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.769
 just this effect ensures the pleasant room climate 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.439
 and in a purely ecological way 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:24.209
 By the way, wall is an innovation Med in Bavaria today is one 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.379
 prefabricated house 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.889
 what concerns the building materials who sustainable one of the buildings and it is 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.749
 Also used exclusively on healthy living building materials 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:37.730
 In this regard, the prefabrication I think Nell good development behind 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.499
 brought yourself 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:40.800
 a fact 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.600
 from the itself at the German prefabricated house day in many places the visitors themselves 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.169
 could convince 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.419
 not only the farmers of today but also the home builders of tomorrow 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:59.269
 a bear will stay after one in Munich right after the advertisement 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.860

 Lausanne dpa - a skill portal 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:32.339
 Schafkopfen's brother had the choice and around the clock 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.749
 So maybe sign up

 www Playjack de Norbert Fischer is obvious 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:42.419
 that's practically off the table 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.520
 They adapt to the changing light conditions 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.520
 I blindfolded Thor 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.809
 a camera can recommend no idea
