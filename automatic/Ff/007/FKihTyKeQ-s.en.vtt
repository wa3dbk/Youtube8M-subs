00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.790
 let's react between them these are 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.830
 very difficult days for people 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.570
 like me with the likes we have for 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.180
 what is happening as with san diego 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.910
 at this time then we fight 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.350
 a lot to support all the news and 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.380

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.650

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.349

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.300
 preview of the December episode of 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.219
 Christmas is not going to be a Christmas theme 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.890
 but it's going to be a special for Christmas 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.870
 this year 's charlotte series 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.239

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.680
 forms follow me on twitter and on tumblr 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.270
 and I think that right here I always talk about 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.940
 I love this Sherlock Holmes in 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.940
 general but sherlock the series I have a 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.579
 great love to her no and it's my series 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.420
 favorite and I love it then if not the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.980
 you know then we see that in the 21st century 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.300
 we go with three seasons there are three 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.129
 episodes for each season because it's 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.989
 miniseries each episode is 90 minutes 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.549
 then it 's like a movie we have 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.460
 only three seasons there was a special 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.310
 between the second and the third of like 20 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.750
 minutes and what they will do for between 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.720
 the third and fourth is this special 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.479
 of 90 minutes that is they have the length 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.500
 of a normal episode and it's going to launch 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.350
 this Christmas 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.470
 locke the only thing I know about this that is the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.670
 preview of it lasts one minute 27 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.100
 is that it was set in the sherlock 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.930
 original holmes that is Victorian is not 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:44.680
 I know why we're really going to know until 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:46.360
 see it to put it with 4 I do not even have that 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.979
 that my room is a bunker I work very 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.210
 well here because nothing distracts me because 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.180
 do not carry internet 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.040
 As you know, I can not give you the 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.619
 image on the screen because I do not have 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.790
 rights to the image then if they can 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.000
 listen to the audio there's no problem with 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.070
 but I can not give you the video 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.050
 sadly but I'll stop 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.880

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.170
 subtitled as always and if not what 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.980
 encounter left the original that I 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:18.629
 is riding two days to see this 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.629
 2 points 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.390
 this winter is calling 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.390

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.820

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.690

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.690
 i 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.370
 it leaves me 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.120
 Thank you 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.209
 in that 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.620
 good 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.659
 God 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.470
 but good 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.970
 in my emotion within the season have 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.950
 been two years and between the third 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.970
 season and the fourth are going to be 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:06.510
 probably in three and it looks very nice 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.190
 and since I'm a fan of the whole world of 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:14.850
 sherlock holmes and of these 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:17.510
 specifically and keeping me 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.640
 I was very excited and I'm very happy and 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.130
 already serious and that if I'm not wrong 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.380
 premieres this December as I was telling you if 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.900
 they have not really seen it, not what 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.880
 I highly recommend it if it's like 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.490
 sit in a movie like this one 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.540
 aware of that when I started to see 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.690
 I was already the whole first season 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.220
 then it's fine all followed is the 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.410
 three the three films plus eight 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.820
 followed and then wait like six months 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.100
 because there was not at the time then 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.230
 but about six months and the second one came out 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.820
 four months and came out the second and the 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.090
 second wait two years for the 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.040
 third and wait two years to see the 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.300
 expression reality and we do not know when 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.950
 the fourth will come out because they are two 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.100
 very busy men from that 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.540
 came out the first season of charlotte 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.980
 Benedict and Martin to both of 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.290
 exposure is like that eyes over 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.360
 yes it was that they have already started working 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.980
 many things like martÃ­n ended up being 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.510
 the hobbit and benedict is in all 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.210
 parts then movies of the world then 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.770
 I have to understand that they have to 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.840
 work many hours to be able to 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.890
 do this series but good has already been 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.840
 confirmed that a fourth season 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.910
 then we're not going to worry about that and 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.070
 according to this the writers and others 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.010
 michael stevens very fan steven moffat 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.680
 what makes the doctor who also imagine 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.290
 minecraft makes the fans are super 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.180
 two super super fans then like it 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.440
 a lot of work the details and they have gone 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.090
 children you understand a lot of 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.010
 small references well parents and them 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.260
 they visualized everything with at least five 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.670
 seasons or if they worked it in 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.900
 his mind that it were five seasons of 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.000
 the series and then find out what will happen 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.650
 then confirm we have until the 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.590
 fourth the fifth one because it will be seen 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.470
 but that has not bothered you that in the 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.080
 appetite with this award that is all a 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.880
 dinner very short of the minute 20 to be 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.620

 now it's going to be this Victorian special 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.500

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.660
