00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.710
 hello good in this tutorial we are going to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.400
 learn to get unlimited credits 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.740
 in the android game 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.809
 that is called exterior ride good in 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.930
 Spanish 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:18.360
 exterior sonar that is a game 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.810
 very similar to 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.990
 lime 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.970
 audio surf for pc that good the 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.220
 I recommend everyone well to start 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.869
 first of all we must take into account 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:34.239
 that we need a rooted terminal and 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.180
 the root explorer application that good 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.760
 it will be simple to obtain if 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.260
 you search on the internet easily good in 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.690
 first place as it is logical there is 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.470
 download the application here and I 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.250
 start it 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.250
 we started it 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.399
 we let them carry 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.190
 well it takes a little while to load 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.190
 but it's worth it 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.280
 well we selected the controls and 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.159
 we give here to add a song 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.460
 for example good anyone does not matter 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:29.080
 we just have to start a song and 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.080
 then we proceed with the next step 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.970
 there shit 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.000
 good for example where we have 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.640
 here you do not need to add any 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.020
 this and we give the green button of 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.049
 play no 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.479
 and select a ship and such and 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.329
 we choose a difficulty does not matter and 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.729
 we see how good credit goes down there 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.130
 the next step once started is 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.610
 exit the game but exit completely 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:04.590
 and I'll explain how we give here to 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.590
 home we go to settings 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.760
 let's go to applications 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.240
 and we look 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.720
 the application in question 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.000
 or the game in this case 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.250
 that will exist as external or 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.310
 northwest river ride 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.810
 look up now I tell you it's like stereo 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.030
 rei baix here the ice selection you give to 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.450
 force arrest 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:39.910
 and accept well second step 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.910
 you have to go to the root explorer application 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.569
 here it is 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.200
 or email I did not have open here 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.810
 excuse 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.239
 ruth explore good and now you have to 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.880
 mount the file system by pressing 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.000
 this button 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.000
 as I tell you, you have to be root, you have to 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.910
 have the terminal rooted and well let's go 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.110
 to the data folder 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.230
 subsequently back to another folder 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.530
 which is called equality and here we are going to 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.530
 look for not to complicate life the 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.230
 application puts us here outside this 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.900
 ere 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.330
 and we give him to look and good he will take 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.950
 a while in my case a lot because good 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.700
 depends on the number of applications 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.700
 have installed 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.610
 we wait 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.260
 and let's go to the folder is the first 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.060
 for all stereo bytes 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.690
 mobile 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.689
 click and go to harper's the last 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.419
 binder 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:43.269
 and let the second file will 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.020
 keep pressed and we open 

00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:48.490
 with 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.349
 and then a text editor 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.470
 and now we look for the next line of 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:55.569
 code because we open this file that 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.849
 is the configuration we go down the 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:00.910
 everything and see if I find it where it puts 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:03.639
 energy energy value and you see what the 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.949
 90 then we change it by the number of 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:09.569
 coins that we want in this case I'm going to 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:11.460
 put the 1999 9 for example 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:14.360
 It is worth once we do this we give 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.000
 options and save changes 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.379
 we saved changes were saved and what 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.990
 we have to do now is to give for 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:23.320
 back and delete the file that we were 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:27.190
 created of 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:29.230
 of backup mono you see this 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:33.040
 file the right to the bottom to which 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:37.090
 we just modified it because we eliminated it 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:41.020
 eliminate and accept is now we go back 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:43.720
 to the game of new exterior we initiate 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.169
 and if everything has gone well then there will be 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.169
 operated 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:19.170
 and here we see 9999 just what I put 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.699
 so we see how they come down 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.990
 and there we have it good because many 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:29.990
 thank you so much later
