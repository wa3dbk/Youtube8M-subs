whatever season you know I think this

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:10.830

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
top is so versatile it is big but I

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.890 
top is so versatile it is big but I
think<00:02:11.800> it<00:02:11.950> has<00:02:12.310> that<00:02:12.690> effort<00:02:13.690> looked

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
think it has that effort looked

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.500 
think it has that effort looked
effortless<00:02:14.940> appeal<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.300> so<00:02:17.170> yeah

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
effortless appeal to it so yeah

make a shorter longer however you want

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.120 
make a shorter longer however you want
it<00:05:05.060> so<00:05:05.660> it<00:05:06.080> actually<00:05:06.440> looked<00:05:06.650> like<00:05:06.710> a<00:05:06.800> dress

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
it so it actually looked like a dress

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.950 
it so it actually looked like a dress
when<00:05:07.310> I<00:05:07.340> wore<00:05:07.550> it<00:05:07.640> last<00:05:07.760> time<00:05:07.940> with<00:05:08.210> just<00:05:08.900> a

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
when I wore it last time with just a

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.800 
when I wore it last time with just a
capsule<00:05:09.170> and<00:05:09.440> then<00:05:09.620> this<00:05:09.800> belt<00:05:10.510> so<00:05:11.510> just

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
capsule and then this belt so just

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.970 
capsule and then this belt so just

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
imagine it without like this should top

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.490 
imagine it without like this should top
here<00:05:16.220> so<00:05:16.910> it<00:05:17.180> looked<00:05:17.420> like<00:05:17.540> a<00:05:17.930> dress<00:05:18.200> like<00:05:18.380> the

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
here so it looked like a dress like the

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.170 
here so it looked like a dress like the
two<00:05:18.740> tones<00:05:19.040> and<00:05:19.190> dress<00:05:19.400> and<00:05:19.640> it<00:05:19.820> was<00:05:20.000> really

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
two tones and dress and it was really

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.250 
two tones and dress and it was really
really<00:05:20.360> cool<00:05:22.870> just<00:05:23.870> wearing<00:05:23.990> the<00:05:24.110> same

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
really cool just wearing the same

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.130 
really cool just wearing the same
jewelry<00:05:24.650> this<00:05:25.460> would<00:05:25.760> be<00:05:25.970> like<00:05:26.390> a<00:05:26.420> business

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
jewelry this would be like a business

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.850

casual<00:05:27.740> look<00:05:28.960> this<00:05:29.960> belt<00:05:30.230> really<00:05:30.440> puts

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
casual look this belt really puts

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:39.430 
casual look this belt really puts
everything<00:05:31.250> together<00:05:31.690> and<00:05:34.120> yeah<00:05:35.830> so<00:05:36.830> I<00:05:38.230> am<00:05:39.230> not

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
everything together and yeah so I am not

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.090 
everything together and yeah so I am not
wearing<00:05:39.620> shoes<00:05:39.890> because<00:05:40.900> I'm<00:05:41.900> too<00:05:42.470> easy<00:05:42.500> to<00:05:42.980> go

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
wearing shoes because I'm too easy to go

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.880 
wearing shoes because I'm too easy to go
get<00:05:43.310> my<00:05:43.460> pumps<00:05:44.030> or<00:05:44.210> whatever<00:05:44.740> and<00:05:45.740> I<00:05:45.860> don't

get my pumps or whatever and I don't

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.560 
get my pumps or whatever and I don't
think<00:05:46.340> it<00:05:46.430> would<00:05:46.520> look<00:05:46.669> good<00:05:46.730> with<00:05:47.270> the<00:05:47.390> wedges

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
think it would look good with the wedges

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.390 
think it would look good with the wedges
just<00:05:47.810> because<00:05:48.350> the<00:05:48.440> wedges<00:05:48.710> are<00:05:48.860> my<00:05:48.980> casual

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
just because the wedges are my casual

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.770 
just because the wedges are my casual
and<00:05:49.460> this<00:05:49.610> is<00:05:49.760> more<00:05:50.000> of<00:05:50.120> like<00:05:50.300> a<00:05:50.330> business

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780
