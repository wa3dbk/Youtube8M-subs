 we are now 4 but we are 7 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:28.220
 72 is a large area but does not know here 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.220

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.220
 special 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.329
 go 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.710

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.990
 we are now 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.450

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.810
 you will not do 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.489
 like two years we have been taking out the 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.190
 disc about a year and a half ago we have 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.320
 could by the conclusion that there 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.150
 Sometimes there is a person who does not help 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.820
 not what we are trying to do is 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.400
 do it as independent but of 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.260
 moment has been given because there is no one 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.630
 to help us but we are going to do it and 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.160
 I hope that all the Latin people or 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.410

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.910

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.940

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.940

 little bit of psychedelia with a little bit of 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.989
 a little circus and the sound is the 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.060
 of the sound is the sound is strong 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.940

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.080

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.799
