big long from red ripcord because the

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.069 
big long from red ripcord because the
longer<00:02:27.389> the<00:02:27.660> cord

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
longer the cord

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.860 
longer the cord
the<00:02:28.410> bigger<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.799> revs<00:02:29.329> see<00:02:30.329> like<00:02:30.480> get<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.780> in

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
the bigger the revs see like get that in

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.920 
the bigger the revs see like get that in
there<00:02:31.489> there<00:02:32.489> now<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.239> see<00:02:33.299> how<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.600> works

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
there there now you see how that works

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.860 
there there now you see how that works
the<00:02:34.350> ripcord<00:02:34.910> goes<00:02:35.910> through<00:02:36.299> the<00:02:36.480> back<00:02:36.600> wheel

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
the ripcord goes through the back wheel

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.009 
the ripcord goes through the back wheel
and<00:02:37.170> when<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.680> pull<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.069> cord<00:02:38.720> well<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.930> do

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
and when you pull the cord well you do

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.379 
and when you pull the cord well you do
it<00:02:40.109> this<00:02:40.200> way<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.500> micro<00:02:40.739> shredder<00:02:41.269> pull<00:02:42.269> the

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
it this way it micro shredder pull the

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:42.819 
it this way it micro shredder pull the
cord

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
cord

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.319 
cord
the<00:02:43.829> big<00:02:43.980> wheel<00:02:44.130> spins<00:02:44.549> on<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.819> back<00:02:44.970> see<00:02:45.239> you

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
the big wheel spins on the back see you

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.080 
the big wheel spins on the back see you
and<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.109> fly<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.440> down<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.769> racetrack<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.430> we

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
and that fly it down the racetrack so we

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.509 
and that fly it down the racetrack so we
have<00:02:48.299> the<00:02:48.690> four<00:02:48.930> cars<00:02:49.200> installed<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.370> rip

it still works good and now we're going

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.740 
it still works good and now we're going
to<00:03:18.780> line<00:03:19.020> up<00:03:19.080> Mack<00:03:20.990> like<00:03:21.990> this<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.470> think<00:03:23.750> open

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
to line up Mack like this I think open

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.070 
to line up Mack like this I think open
it<00:03:24.840> up<00:03:24.990> there's<00:03:25.770> more<00:03:25.950> cars<00:03:26.810> ready<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:27.930> go

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
let's have a look well it's going to be

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.070 
let's have a look well it's going to be
tough<00:03:32.330> okay<00:03:33.330> we're<00:03:33.450> going<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.630> race<00:03:33.780> down<00:03:33.930> the

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
tough okay we're going to race down the

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:55.100 
tough okay we're going to race down the
track

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.260 

it<00:03:56.110> looks<00:03:56.319> like<00:03:56.500> Wingo<00:03:56.950> on<00:03:57.130> that<00:03:57.340> one<00:03:57.489> let's

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
it looks like Wingo on that one let's

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.300 
it looks like Wingo on that one let's
try<00:03:58.390> that<00:03:58.540> again

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
try that again

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:09.240 
try that again
three<00:04:00.310> two<00:04:00.760> one<00:04:07.650> okay<00:04:08.650> we'll<00:04:08.860> try<00:04:08.950> that<00:04:09.130> again

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
three two one okay we'll try that again

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.830 
three two one okay we'll try that again
it<00:04:09.610> probably<00:04:09.730> was<00:04:10.030> a<00:04:10.090> good<00:04:10.209> idea<00:04:10.480> that<00:04:10.540> had<00:04:10.750> the

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
it probably was a good idea that had the

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.680 
it probably was a good idea that had the
camera<00:04:11.230> on<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:12.220> track<00:04:12.459> at<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:12.790> end<00:04:12.819> to<00:04:13.540> have

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
camera on the track at the end to have

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.630 
camera on the track at the end to have
the<00:04:13.810> car<00:04:14.050> run<00:04:14.290> to<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.530> lens<00:04:14.709> but<00:04:15.370> it<00:04:15.459> didn't

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
the car run to the lens but it didn't

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.710 
the car run to the lens but it didn't
hurt<00:04:15.730> it<00:04:15.819> any<00:04:15.910> so<00:04:16.180> let's<00:04:16.329> try<00:04:16.450> that<00:04:16.570> one<00:04:16.690> more

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
hurt it any so let's try that one more

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.250 
hurt it any so let's try that one more
time

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
time

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.580 
time
here<00:04:17.530> goes<00:04:21.690> let's<00:04:22.690> definitely<00:04:22.900> boost<00:04:23.380> that

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
here goes let's definitely boost that

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:33.960 
here goes let's definitely boost that
time<00:04:31.650> let's<00:04:32.650> get<00:04:32.770> back<00:04:32.889> over<00:04:33.010> to<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.310> to<00:04:33.880> the

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
time let's get back over to the to the

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.879 
time let's get back over to the to the
set<00:04:34.180> so<00:04:34.720> there<00:04:34.900> you<00:04:35.020> have<00:04:35.050> it<00:04:35.169> our<00:04:35.350> four<00:04:35.650> new

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
set so there you have it our four new

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.010 
set so there you have it our four new
reflash<00:04:36.340> race<00:04:36.669> to<00:04:36.760> DJ<00:04:37.180> Wingo<00:04:37.570> it's<00:04:37.690> not<00:04:37.810> right

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
reflash race to DJ Wingo it's not right

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.960 
reflash race to DJ Wingo it's not right
on<00:04:38.050> boost<00:04:38.350> we'll<00:04:39.130> put<00:04:39.310> them<00:04:39.400> away<00:04:39.520> for<00:04:39.820> now

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
on boost we'll put them away for now

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.730 
on boost we'll put them away for now
we'll<00:04:40.150> have<00:04:40.270> more<00:04:40.419> races<00:04:40.810> later<00:04:40.930> if<00:04:41.500> you<00:04:41.590> have
