00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
I'll show it but it's a regular hardtop

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.850 
I'll show it but it's a regular hardtop
dryer<00:00:38.690> not<00:00:38.900> the<00:00:39.049> one<00:00:39.170> with<00:00:39.260> the<00:00:39.290> soft<00:00:39.559> bonnet

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
dryer not the one with the soft bonnet

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.549 
dryer not the one with the soft bonnet
it's<00:00:39.979> a<00:00:40.010> hard<00:00:40.220> time<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:40.640> you<00:00:41.540> use<00:00:41.809> that<00:00:41.839> after

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
it's a hard time and you use that after

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.100 
it's a hard time and you use that after
you<00:00:42.650> apply<00:00:42.890> this<00:00:43.180> to<00:00:44.180> step<00:00:44.449> protein<00:00:44.750> treatment

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
you apply this to step protein treatment

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.950 
you apply this to step protein treatment
from<00:00:45.199> root<00:00:45.440> to<00:00:45.470> tip<00:00:45.620> on<00:00:45.979> your<00:00:46.580> hair<00:00:46.850> and<00:00:47.030> it

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
from root to tip on your hair and it

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.070 
from root to tip on your hair and it
gets<00:00:48.260> hard<00:00:48.559> as<00:00:48.769> a<00:00:49.040> rock<00:00:49.070> I<00:00:49.699> the<00:00:50.479> reason<00:00:50.659> I<00:00:50.869> have

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
gets hard as a rock I the reason I have

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.020 
gets hard as a rock I the reason I have
this<00:00:51.199> for<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:51.500> long<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:51.949> I<00:00:52.129> never<00:00:52.580> use<00:00:52.790> it<00:00:52.820> is

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
this for so long and I never use it is

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.619 
this for so long and I never use it is
because<00:00:53.239> if<00:00:53.360> you<00:00:53.449> recall<00:00:53.780> in<00:00:55.000> 2009<00:00:56.000> early<00:00:56.510> two

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
because if you recall in 2009 early two

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:57.939 
because if you recall in 2009 early two
thousand<00:00:56.960> nine<00:00:56.989> or<00:00:57.229> late<00:00:57.440> two<00:00:57.559> thousand<00:00:57.890> eight

I don't recall no it was definitely 2009
I<00:01:00.440> had<00:01:00.979> that<00:01:01.190> protein<00:01:01.670> debacle<00:01:02.150> that<00:01:02.180> I<00:01:02.390> wrote

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
I had that protein debacle that I wrote

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.060 
I had that protein debacle that I wrote
about<00:01:02.629> on<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:02.989> blog<00:01:03.199> where<00:01:03.439> I<00:01:03.470> ended<00:01:03.979> up

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
about on the blog where I ended up

about on the blog where I ended up
having<00:01:04.309> to<00:01:04.339> cut<00:01:04.519> my<00:01:04.610> hair<00:01:04.820> it<00:01:04.909> was<00:01:05.030> completely

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
having to cut my hair it was completely

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.109 
having to cut my hair it was completely
my<00:01:05.570> fault<00:01:05.689> but<00:01:06.110> anyway<00:01:06.439> because<00:01:06.979> of<00:01:07.340> the

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
my fault but anyway because of the

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:09.700 
my fault but anyway because of the
excessive<00:01:08.360> protein<00:01:08.900> and<00:01:09.110> a<00:01:09.170> combination<00:01:09.680> of

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
excessive protein and a combination of

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.730 
excessive protein and a combination of
other<00:01:09.890> things<00:01:10.130> that<00:01:10.190> I<00:01:10.310> did<00:01:10.520> I<00:01:10.670> did<00:01:11.060> I<00:01:11.470> had<00:01:12.470> a

other things that I did I did I had a

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.860 
other things that I did I did I had a
problem<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:13.760> I<00:01:13.790> didn't<00:01:14.300> want<00:01:14.450> to<00:01:14.480> use<00:01:14.690> this

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
problem so I didn't want to use this

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.600 
problem so I didn't want to use this
effigy<00:01:15.200> two-step<00:01:15.680> protein<00:01:16.160> treatment<00:01:16.550> but

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
effigy two-step protein treatment but

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.920 
effigy two-step protein treatment but
then<00:01:16.730> I<00:01:16.760> watched<00:01:17.090> splinters<00:01:17.540> video<00:01:17.750> and<00:01:17.900> I

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
then I watched splinters video and I

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.930 
then I watched splinters video and I
said<00:01:18.110> you<00:01:18.200> know<00:01:18.290> what<00:01:18.320> just<00:01:18.560> go<00:01:18.800> for<00:01:19.040> it<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:19.250> I

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
said you know what just go for it and I

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.930 
said you know what just go for it and I
did<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:20.690> I'm<00:01:21.080> so<00:01:21.770> thankful<00:01:21.800> that<00:01:22.130> I<00:01:22.250> did<00:01:22.550> now

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
did and I'm so thankful that I did now

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.350 
did and I'm so thankful that I did now

this you okay I'm so thankful that I did

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.890 
this you okay I'm so thankful that I did
because<00:01:26.540> my<00:01:26.810> hair<00:01:27.400> felt<00:01:28.400> stronger<00:01:29.120> just<00:01:29.780> after

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
because my hair felt stronger just after

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.230 
because my hair felt stronger just after
washing<00:01:30.200> out<00:01:30.440> this<00:01:30.620> treatment<00:01:30.890> so<00:01:31.580> you<00:01:31.640> go

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
washing out this treatment so you go

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.060 
washing out this treatment so you go
under<00:01:32.510> the<00:01:32.600> dryer<00:01:32.870> you<00:01:33.140> make<00:01:33.290> it<00:01:33.409> hard<00:01:33.620> as<00:01:34.010> a

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
under the dryer you make it hard as a

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.010 
under the dryer you make it hard as a
rock<00:01:34.340> or<00:01:34.670> it<00:01:34.760> gets<00:01:34.850> hard<00:01:35.120> as<00:01:35.270> a<00:01:35.300> rock<00:01:35.420> as<00:01:35.780> you're

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
rock or it gets hard as a rock as you're

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.080 
rock or it gets hard as a rock as you're
under<00:01:36.260> the<00:01:36.290> dryer<00:01:36.620> and<00:01:36.860> when<00:01:37.580> it's<00:01:37.700> completely

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
under the dryer and when it's completely

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.380 
under the dryer and when it's completely
hard<00:01:38.420> you<00:01:39.320> then<00:01:39.710> wash<00:01:39.980> it<00:01:40.010> out<00:01:40.310> you<00:01:41.090> will<00:01:41.300> you

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
hard you then wash it out you will you

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.910 
hard you then wash it out you will you
let<00:01:41.570> some<00:01:41.720> water<00:01:41.900> hit<00:01:42.080> it<00:01:42.200> then<00:01:42.409> you<00:01:42.560> wash<00:01:42.740> it

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
let some water hit it then you wash it

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.540 
let some water hit it then you wash it
out<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:43.280> then<00:01:43.340> you<00:01:43.610> use<00:01:43.760> their<00:01:43.970> balancing

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
out and then you use their balancing

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.840 
out and then you use their balancing
moisturizing<00:01:47.500> product<00:01:48.500> which<00:01:49.220> I<00:01:49.430> can't<00:01:49.700> show

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
moisturizing product which I can't show

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.950 
moisturizing product which I can't show
you<00:01:49.940> right<00:01:50.030> now<00:01:50.120> because<00:01:50.420> I'm<00:01:50.540> finished<00:01:50.870> with

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
you right now because I'm finished with

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.870 
you right now because I'm finished with
that<00:01:51.200> bottle<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.920> reason<00:01:52.340> I<00:01:52.520> finished<00:01:52.820> that

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
that bottle the reason I finished that

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.130 
that bottle the reason I finished that
one<00:01:53.030> is<00:01:53.180> because<00:01:53.300> it<00:01:53.479> was<00:01:53.570> a<00:01:53.630> smaller<00:01:53.900> bottle

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
one is because it was a smaller bottle

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.510 
one is because it was a smaller bottle
than<00:01:54.440> this<00:01:54.560> one<00:01:54.770> they<00:01:54.890> came<00:01:55.040> bundled<00:01:55.280> together

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
than this one they came bundled together

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.160 
than this one they came bundled together
I<00:01:55.790> bought<00:01:56.030> them<00:01:56.180> both<00:01:56.360> for<00:01:56.540> like<00:01:56.750> 15<00:01:57.140> bucks

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
I bought them both for like 15 bucks

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.710 
I bought them both for like 15 bucks
they<00:01:57.860> were<00:01:57.950> packaged<00:01:58.310> together<00:01:58.490> but<00:01:59.210> I<00:01:59.240> used

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
they were packaged together but I used

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.600 
they were packaged together but I used
that<00:01:59.870> balancing<00:02:00.380> product<00:02:00.740> with<00:02:00.920> some<00:02:01.430> other

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
that balancing product with some other

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.850 
that balancing product with some other
protein<00:02:02.030> treatment<00:02:02.360> I<00:02:02.420> used<00:02:02.780> before<00:02:02.960> so<00:02:03.680> that

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
protein treatment I used before so that

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.500 
protein treatment I used before so that
one<00:02:04.010> had<00:02:04.159> gone<00:02:04.190> down<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:04.850> by<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.060> time<00:02:05.240> I

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
one had gone down so by the time I

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.979 
one had gone down so by the time I
finally<00:02:06.320> use<00:02:06.500> this<00:02:06.680> it<00:02:06.890> was<00:02:07.040> finished<00:02:07.360> now<00:02:08.360> the

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
finally use this it was finished now the

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.719 
finally use this it was finished now the
other<00:02:09.140> thing<00:02:09.259> that<00:02:09.409> I<00:02:09.590> need<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:09.860> do<00:02:10.159> the<00:02:10.549> next

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
other thing that I need to do the next

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.180 
other thing that I need to do the next
time<00:02:10.909> I<00:02:11.000> apply<00:02:11.390> this<00:02:11.450> product<00:02:12.379> is<00:02:12.590> because<00:02:13.010> my

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
time I apply this product is because my

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.580 
time I apply this product is because my
hair<00:02:13.430> was<00:02:13.459> just<00:02:14.270> hanging<00:02:14.600> down<00:02:14.840> when<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.140> apply

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
hair was just hanging down when I apply

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.730 
hair was just hanging down when I apply
this<00:02:15.650> protein<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.580> very<00:02:16.760> ends<00:02:17.120> never<00:02:17.360> got

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
this protein the very ends never got

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.230 
this protein the very ends never got
hard<00:02:17.980> they<00:02:18.340> were<00:02:18.430> kind<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:18.730> gooey<00:02:18.910> but<00:02:19.120> they

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
hard they were kind of gooey but they

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.020 
hard they were kind of gooey but they
never<00:02:19.420> hardened<00:02:20.410> because<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:21.430> guess<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.850> heat

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
never hardened because I guess the heat

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.580 
never hardened because I guess the heat
just<00:02:22.090> was<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.570> wasn't<00:02:22.900> sitting<00:02:23.050> far<00:02:23.380> enough

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
just was I wasn't sitting far enough

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.350 
just was I wasn't sitting far enough
under<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.010> whatever<00:02:24.340> it<00:02:24.400> just<00:02:24.550> didn't<00:02:25.060> reach

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
under it whatever it just didn't reach

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.840 
under it whatever it just didn't reach
it<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:25.630> it<00:02:25.720> didn't<00:02:25.960> harden<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.470> ends<00:02:26.830> so<00:02:27.280> you

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
it so it didn't harden the ends so you

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.670 
it so it didn't harden the ends so you
can<00:02:28.150> use<00:02:28.450> as<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.840> mentions<00:02:29.110> in<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.350> directions

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
can use as it mentions in the directions

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.380 
can use as it mentions in the directions
a<00:02:30.010> handheld<00:02:30.910> dryer<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:32.350> just<00:02:32.910> blow<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.090> out<00:02:34.210> as

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
a handheld dryer and just blow it out as

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.180 
a handheld dryer and just blow it out as

right<00:02:39.310> here<00:02:39.370> if<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.120> look<00:02:40.300> at<00:02:40.390> her<00:02:40.630> poutine<00:02:41.320> a

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
right here if you look at her poutine a

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.160 
right here if you look at her poutine a
two-step<00:02:42.040> treatment<00:02:42.430> she<00:02:42.520> uses<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:43.170> handheld

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
two-step treatment she uses a handheld

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.820 
two-step treatment she uses a handheld
dryer<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.680> just<00:02:45.130> blows<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.430> all<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:47.110> it<00:02:47.320> gets

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
dryer and just blows it all and it gets

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.500 
dryer and just blows it all and it gets
hard<00:02:48.070> in<00:02:48.190> that<00:02:48.340> way<00:02:48.520> so<00:02:48.580> i<00:02:48.730> think<00:02:49.000> i<00:02:49.060> may<00:02:49.330> need

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
hard in that way so i think i may need

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.390 
hard in that way so i think i may need
to<00:02:49.660> do<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:49.990> next<00:02:50.500> time<00:02:50.650> if<00:02:50.890> anything<00:02:51.250> just

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
to do that next time if anything just

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.130 
to do that next time if anything just
for<00:02:51.460> the<00:02:51.580> ends<00:02:51.940> so<00:02:52.090> everything<00:02:52.870> is<00:02:52.990> really

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
for the ends so everything is really

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.760 
for the ends so everything is really
hard<00:02:53.470> but<00:02:53.770> i<00:02:54.330> really<00:02:55.330> like<00:02:55.480> this<00:02:55.630> product<00:02:55.900> i<00:02:56.200> am

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
hard but i really like this product i am

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.890 
hard but i really like this product i am
going<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.100> certainly<00:02:57.520> use<00:02:57.880> it<00:02:58.030> again<00:02:58.270> it's<00:02:58.840> a

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
going to certainly use it again it's a

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.810 
going to certainly use it again it's a
great<00:02:59.140> protein<00:02:59.350> treatment<00:02:59.800> you<00:03:00.010> will<00:03:00.280> not<00:03:00.550> use

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
great protein treatment you will not use

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.400 
great protein treatment you will not use
this<00:03:00.940> everyday<00:03:01.270> use<00:03:01.600> this<00:03:01.720> like<00:03:01.930> every<00:03:02.170> six

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
this everyday use this like every six

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.760 
this everyday use this like every six
weeks<00:03:02.590> or<00:03:03.150> so<00:03:04.150> i<00:03:04.600> probably<00:03:04.870> won't<00:03:05.290> even<00:03:05.440> use<00:03:05.560> it

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
weeks or so i probably won't even use it

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.560 
weeks or so i probably won't even use it
every<00:03:05.920> six<00:03:06.130> weeks<00:03:06.190> but<00:03:06.700> when<00:03:06.940> I<00:03:06.970> feel<00:03:07.240> that<00:03:07.450> my

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
every six weeks but when I feel that my

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.670 
every six weeks but when I feel that my
hair<00:03:07.750> really<00:03:07.930> needs<00:03:08.200> a<00:03:08.260> good<00:03:08.350> protein

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
hair really needs a good protein

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.410 
hair really needs a good protein
treatment<00:03:09.130> that's<00:03:09.280> when<00:03:09.490> i'll<00:03:09.610> turn<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.150> it

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
treatment that's when i'll turn to it it

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.630 
treatment that's when i'll turn to it it
has<00:03:11.320> made<00:03:11.530> my<00:03:11.650> hair<00:03:11.830> harder<00:03:12.190> than<00:03:12.370> anything

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
has made my hair harder than anything

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.940 
has made my hair harder than anything
else<00:03:13.060> ever<00:03:13.390> has<00:03:13.480> but<00:03:14.020> then<00:03:14.200> after<00:03:14.380> you<00:03:14.620> balance

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
else ever has but then after you balance

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.560 
else ever has but then after you balance
everything<00:03:15.160> out<00:03:15.600> it's<00:03:16.600> soft<00:03:17.550> yet<00:03:18.550> strong<00:03:18.910> the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
everything out it's soft yet strong the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
but it certainly has something that

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.990 
but it certainly has something that
makes<00:03:54.340> this<00:03:55.830> protein<00:03:56.830> treatment<00:03:57.220> soften<00:03:57.820> and

is breaking or you have excessive
shedding<00:05:14.080> or<00:05:14.940> maybe<00:05:15.940> you<00:05:16.060> just<00:05:16.090> had<00:05:16.360> a<00:05:16.390> relaxer

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
shedding or maybe you just had a relaxer

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.110 
shedding or maybe you just had a relaxer
or<00:05:17.110> something<00:05:17.500> and<00:05:17.650> that<00:05:18.310> weakens<00:05:18.700> the<00:05:18.820> bonds

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
or something and that weakens the bonds

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.630 
or something and that weakens the bonds

of the protein within your hair that's
how<00:05:21.820> it<00:05:21.850> gets<00:05:22.030> straight<00:05:22.420> so<00:05:23.110> you<00:05:23.170> will<00:05:23.770> need
