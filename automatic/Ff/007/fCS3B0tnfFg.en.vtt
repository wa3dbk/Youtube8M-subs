00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.440
 hello ronderos welcome to a new 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.110
 video today I'm here to talk about something 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.080
 very very very special to me that is the 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.060
 official goal of my first role-playing game 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.490
 nexus 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.939
 this role play I want you to have something 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.740
 very important very distinctive that is going to 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.710
 be the fact that it's going to have a beta 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.660
 open on the internet for that as well as 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.610
 I say it does not sound very special but I 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.650
 I pretend that it is because you are 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.660
 on the other side is enough in an opportunity to 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.870
 give the game creator 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.150
 your opinions on then different 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.559
 no, yes, I like this if 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.839
 this is not if this can improve you're going to 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.670
 to be able to contribute something that manual and you're going to 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.309
 can do in a way that I hope that 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.920
 dynamic and easy it is through 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.720
 this channel and then as I have thought 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.820
 do it to begin with they are going to play 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.119
 games to the political game that you can 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.979
 see and that they will allow you then that 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:06.500
 know the mechanics see a little bit of 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.250
 what is the setting etc. and so on 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.200
 precisely speaking of the invitation 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.299
 In the information house I will leave you 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.070
 a link to my blog where I have input 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.590
 written in which I explain all the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.079
 details about the mitation of the game 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.399
 besides this and those comments that 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.719
 are you going to be able to do in the games then 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.060
 that you liked that is called the 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:25.859
 attention that I will not get more or less 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.920
 every 15 days a video in which I'm going to 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:31.289
 discuss any question about the game 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.729
 so a particular section my ideas 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.860
 about her that she intended when 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.079
 I wrote no and you are going to be able to 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.689
 give me your opinion because what you 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.100
 So that section seems like what do you think 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.689
 of if you really have what I am 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.969
 saying or not if it can be improved 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.100
 etcetera besides that with the 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.390
 more interesting questions that go to me 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.399
 coming or they call me more attention 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.810
 because interesting are going to be all but 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.880
 those that most appeal to me the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.829
 that I think that giving more play I'm going to 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.780
 bring here to a video too and I'm going 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.920
 to respond directly in video to 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.409
 that everyone can comment 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.329
 with me then how is it a 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.329
 open process I calculate that it's going to 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.190
 last about three months and I encourage you to 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.450
 follow these games to which you comment 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.459
 these videos to which you leave yours 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.769
 opinion about the game as you contribute 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.269
 everything what you want to contribute 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.560
 because normally it makes me a lot 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.970
 illusion to have the opportunity to tell 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.500
 with the community of women a realero 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.299
 but with all the people that you are 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.030
 there and that the best because you finish 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.600
 get to this 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.030
 and this video to all and to all I invite you 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.160
 to participate in the creation process and 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.170
 to share with me the illusion of 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.390
 take out a game that what will be 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.360
 supported a lot in the community in a 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.860
 very special vein so nothing I hope 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.370
 that you encourage to participate I hope that 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.260
 you like this video and that especially 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.360
 I hope this process goes well and 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.160
 be as wonderful as I think what 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.540
 is going to be and if you liked the video 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.120
 well, nothing to fight, to like 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.830
 and subscribe to channel see you in 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.000

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.000
