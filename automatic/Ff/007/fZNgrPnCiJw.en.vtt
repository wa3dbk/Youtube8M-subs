00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.189
 the tutorials in our house the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.170
 tutorials as you see here we have it 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.119

 not good video but let's learn a 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.910
 which will be good to teach 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.369
 how to make the armor let's not say everything 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.550
 what leads to helmets the classes 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.920
 or the pants and the shoes not all 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.420
 that which is then served to you not for 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.490
 protect it from the explosions of the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.960
 clippers of the sudden attacks of 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.000
 they get sick that everyone touches them a lot 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.830
 the cojones no and well then now it's going 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.020
 teach so see you later and good 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.370
 guys how do you see out here I'm going to 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.500
 be the armor that we have treated you 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.420
 there at the counter where I put good 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.670
 the things that we are going to learn but not 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.470
 here you see what it is that has nothing 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.450
 more and good now I will explain 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.160
 let's say how to identify in the amount 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.930
 of mature that gives you each different from 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.070
 armor not to mention each one is 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.479
 different kitty action as ya 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.060
 explained well I do not have to explain 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.979
 but good as I was saying in the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.740
 armor let's say it can be done 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.259
 different materials of no 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.090
 it comes to be diamond iron that 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.500
 obviously it is the hardest gold that I 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.630
 I do not recommend you but you can also 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.270
 make the armor of this and then of 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.560
 leather let's say the most basic material 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.090
 this is the one that less armor is going to 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.009
 give with armor I mean the 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.330
 shirts is that you have on top of 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.939
 hearts is not in the amount armor 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.710
 that gives you the clothes you wear and not good 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.149
 well the ether gets good explained 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.590
 with advice and with the duty you get 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.030
 for example killing cows at 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.470
 beginning principle of the game when still 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.480
 you do not have to say 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.460
 where you can find iron later 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.930
 pounding it by melting the ore 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.580
 the same gold and the diamond 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.090
 Finding you can be in your mines 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.800
 etc 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.220
 but I'm going to explain how 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.340
 you have to put here the materials 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.120
 not to do let's say the see with the 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.030
 chop the headboard not the headset on the 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.220
 torso I do not know how he will say but I say it 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.900
 and to this the breastplate as it is said 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.940
 pants and shoes but good now 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.230
 see you later all the guys this is very 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.310
 simple agree let's start with 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.450
 the pants by the pants 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.120
 you will have to put it in the next 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.430
 way you see here as we have 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.290
 the pants then to make the bib 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.180
 we have to resort everything but the 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.130
 little square up here I think that 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.470
 it makes sense are we say funny 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.930
 logical then the shoes are put on 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.640
 here and here the automatic ones and 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.140
 then the helmet makes a helmet not 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.270
 let's say you can not draw yourself 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.550
 with the diamonds in the inner kraft and 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.990
 It's already small, we have everything here 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.450
 our armor not created to fight 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.020
 those happy ones in brother and enemies that 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.060
 They charged us no and they screwed up our lives 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.010
 minecraft and they make us lose diamonds and 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.590
 lovely things but nothing guys 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.909
 I liked the video I have these things 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.739
 ready for the next tutorial 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:55.569
 well not all are the ideas that I have 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.220
 well prepared but I still like 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.989
 you give me suggestions and things 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.189
 I can do in the future but nothing to write 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.189
 see the next one and see you later
