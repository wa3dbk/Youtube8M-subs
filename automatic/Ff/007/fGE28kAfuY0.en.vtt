00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.180 
what the laptop looks like actually I
played<00:03:51.440> a<00:03:51.470> little<00:03:51.650> bit<00:03:51.799> with<00:03:51.920> this<00:03:52.040> yesterday

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
played a little bit with this yesterday

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.789 
played a little bit with this yesterday
everybody<00:03:55.190> was<00:03:55.430> buying<00:03:55.579> the<00:03:55.849> toshiba<00:03:56.690> one<00:03:56.870> but

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
everybody was buying the toshiba one but

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.390 
everybody was buying the toshiba one but
the<00:03:57.920> specs<00:03:58.250> wise<00:03:58.489> I<00:03:58.849> think<00:03:58.879> it<00:03:59.269> was<00:03:59.450> an<00:03:59.780> AMD

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
the specs wise I think it was an AMD

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.940 
the specs wise I think it was an AMD
chip<00:04:01.400> set<00:04:01.640> and<00:04:01.670> it<00:04:01.910> was<00:04:02.030> using<00:04:02.269> it<00:04:02.569> was<00:04:02.599> like

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
chip set and it was using it was like

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.449 
chip set and it was using it was like
1.7<00:04:04.510> for<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.569> processor<00:04:05.930> speed<00:04:06.170> on<00:04:07.040> this<00:04:07.250> one

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
1.7 for the processor speed on this one

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.599 
1.7 for the processor speed on this one
I<00:04:07.489> thought<00:04:07.790> was<00:04:07.940> nicer<00:04:08.359> this<00:04:08.690> is<00:04:08.810> Intel<00:04:09.170> based

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
I thought was nicer this is Intel based

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:15.220 
I thought was nicer this is Intel based
and<00:04:10.609> it<00:04:10.849> uses<00:04:11.209> a<00:04:11.480> it's<00:04:12.349> actually<00:04:12.890> 2.4<00:04:13.930> so<00:04:14.930> here

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
and it uses a it's actually 2.4 so here

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:22.140 
and it uses a it's actually 2.4 so here
is<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.769> side<00:04:16.010> of<00:04:16.220> it<00:04:20.709> ok

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
is the side of it ok

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.290 
is the side of it ok

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
and the front and I know the LED

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.790 
and the front and I know the LED
indicators<00:04:27.080> are<00:04:27.200> gonna<00:04:27.289> be<00:04:27.470> here<00:04:27.800> yep<00:04:28.389> ok<00:04:29.800> now
