00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.010
 video tutorial how to make a pompon of yarn 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.120
 we will do it here 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.400
 such a snowman 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.790
 the video shows how to make big 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.100
 bottom pompom snowman eyes and 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.890
 buttons are circles cut from 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.470
 cardboard spout also a piece of cardboard 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.220
 twisted into a cone cap and scarf it 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.060
 terry baby socks cut out 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.090
 cardboard two ringlet diameter large 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.489
 rings approximately 6 7 centimeters and in it 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.059
 even here so that's a hole cut more 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.040
 one smaller circle 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:45.050
 winding thread can be like this with 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.360
 using a needle and you can just take 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.250
 a bunch more is wrong and here you are it so 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.739
 to thread 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.969
 cheat on these these rings then 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.780
 scissor cut as shown in 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.510
 the video will be bad at first but 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.080
 then better scissors will take this 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.530
 pompon 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.790
 and so here we are separating these two rings 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.619
 to push there 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.619
 thread and fasten it 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.500
 for this we need exactly 2 cards 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.680
 so that was so convenient thread 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.200
 thread and tie we tie very tight 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.340
 so that we do not fall apart so pompom 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.159
 the strings did not fall out of it 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:43.549
 twist a few times and tie very 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.549
 tight on several knots 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.020
 This is the basis 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.200
 now we get rid of the cartons with 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:00.000
 using scissors to tidy them 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.690
 we cut and remove these cartons of them 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.130
 you can throw here turned out such 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.160
 pomponchik needs to be transformed a little 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.850
 to trim it with scissors 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.610
 tails that we have here are not beautiful 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.760
 crawl out and he turns like this 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.549
 cute fluffy pompom by 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.400
 then we do the second item and sculpt 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:27.200
