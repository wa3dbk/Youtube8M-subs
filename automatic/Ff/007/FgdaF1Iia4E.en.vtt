for sleeping he's already wanting to dig
in<00:03:17.310> there

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.569 

this<00:03:28.790> also<00:03:28.999> gives<00:03:29.239> them<00:03:29.390> a<00:03:29.480> lot<00:03:29.629> more<00:03:29.840> room<00:03:30.579> the

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
this also gives them a lot more room the

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.619 
this also gives them a lot more room the
other<00:03:31.700> bin<00:03:31.849> was<00:03:32.060> nice<00:03:33.730> but<00:03:34.730> it<00:03:34.999> really<00:03:35.269> took<00:03:35.480> up

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
other bin was nice but it really took up

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:41.530 
other bin was nice but it really took up
a<00:03:35.719> lot<00:03:35.840> of<00:03:35.870> space

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.809 

think

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
think

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:58.750

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.490 

it<00:03:59.180> looks<00:03:59.390> like<00:03:59.540> she<00:03:59.690> doesn't<00:03:59.810> even<00:04:00.080> need<00:04:00.319> the

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
it looks like she doesn't even need the

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.830 
it looks like she doesn't even need the
bin<00:04:03.910> pretty<00:04:04.910> easy<00:04:05.030> for<00:04:05.209> him<00:04:05.330> to<00:04:05.390> get<00:04:05.510> right<00:04:05.660> out

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
bin pretty easy for him to get right out

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:15.760 
bin pretty easy for him to get right out
of<00:04:05.870> there<00:04:12.910> it's<00:04:13.910> just<00:04:14.180> right<00:04:14.510> sized<00:04:14.780> hole<00:04:15.080> make

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
of there it's just right sized hole make

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.470 
of there it's just right sized hole make
an<00:04:15.950> easier<00:04:16.130> tunnel<00:04:16.459> in<00:04:16.639> and<00:04:16.940> kind<00:04:17.150> of<00:04:17.209> get<00:04:17.359> up

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480
