create<00:02:00.820> password<00:02:01.210> so<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.420> password<00:02:01.600> is<00:02:01.900> just

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
create password so the password is just

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.300 
create password so the password is just
going<00:02:02.290> to<00:02:02.409> be<00:02:02.760> password<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:05.650> password<00:02:05.680> hint

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
going to be password the password hint

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.279 
going to be password the password hint
is<00:02:06.400> just<00:02:06.580> going<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:06.760> be<00:02:06.820> password<00:02:07.210> because<00:02:07.690> why

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
is just going to be password because why

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.090 
is just going to be password because why
not<00:02:09.630> so<00:02:10.630> create<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:10.990> password<00:02:11.260> now<00:02:11.620> so<00:02:11.860> if<00:02:11.980> I

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
not so create the password now so if I

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:20.430 
not so create the password now so if I
log<00:02:12.520> off<00:02:12.670> again<00:02:17.459> which<00:02:18.459> takes<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.940> while<00:02:19.440> okay

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
log off again which takes a while okay

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.870 
log off again which takes a while okay
so<00:02:20.500> now<00:02:20.770> there's<00:02:21.070> actually<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.400> password<00:02:21.790> on

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
so now there's actually a password on

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.809 
so now there's actually a password on
this<00:02:22.000> machine<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.360> get<00:02:22.600> into<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.980> what

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
this machine to get into it so what

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.550 
this machine to get into it so what
we're<00:02:25.000> going<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.180> be<00:02:25.300> doing<00:02:25.630> is<00:02:25.840> using<00:02:26.140> sticky

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
we're going to be doing is using sticky

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.100 
we're going to be doing is using sticky
keys<00:02:26.830> so<00:02:27.100> if<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:27.250> do<00:02:27.310> this<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:28.540> can<00:02:28.690> see<00:02:28.780> sticky

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
keys so if I do this you can see sticky

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.470 
keys so if I do this you can see sticky
keys<00:02:29.290> pops<00:02:29.560> up<00:02:29.770> on<00:02:29.950> Windows<00:02:30.430> 7<00:02:30.760> here<00:02:30.910> we're

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
keys pops up on Windows 7 here we're

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.820 
keys pops up on Windows 7 here we're
going<00:02:31.600> to<00:02:31.690> replacing<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.350> so<00:02:32.470> when<00:02:32.590> we<00:02:32.620> press

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
going to replacing it so when we press

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.740 
going to replacing it so when we press
sticky<00:02:33.130> keys<00:02:33.340> five<00:02:33.580> times<00:02:33.970> command<00:02:34.390> prompt<00:02:34.630> to

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
sticky keys five times command prompt to

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.330 
sticky keys five times command prompt to
look<00:02:34.959> for<00:02:35.110> them<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.500> if<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.070> didn't<00:02:36.250> already

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
look for them and if you didn't already

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.729 
look for them and if you didn't already
know<00:02:36.610> this<00:02:37.000> if<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.269> just<00:02:37.480> log<00:02:37.660> off<00:02:37.840> again<00:02:40.739> sticky

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
know this if I just log off again sticky

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.380 
know this if I just log off again sticky
keys<00:02:42.040> works<00:02:42.519> on<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:44.110> login<00:02:44.440> screen<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:46.360> that

keys works on the login screen so that

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.340 
keys works on the login screen so that

means we're going to be getting a
command<00:02:47.620> prompt<00:02:47.860> here<00:02:47.920> instead<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.489> we're

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
command prompt here instead and we're

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.620 
command prompt here instead and we're
going<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.760> be<00:02:48.850> able<00:02:48.910> to<00:02:49.000> change<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.330> user's

all we're going to do is simply boot
into<00:02:54.550> Windows<00:02:55.180> 7<00:02:55.600> but<00:02:56.500> instead<00:02:56.920> of<00:02:57.040> the

then<00:03:12.940> I'm<00:03:13.030> going<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.239> reboot<00:03:13.630> this<00:03:13.750> machine<00:03:14.079> so

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
then I'm going to reboot this machine so

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.699 
then I'm going to reboot this machine so
now<00:03:14.500> when<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.630> PC<00:03:16.630> boots<00:03:16.810> back<00:03:17.110> up<00:03:17.260> again<00:03:17.530> is

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
now when the PC boots back up again is

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.250 
now when the PC boots back up again is
going<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:17.980> boot<00:03:18.220> into<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:19.420> Windows<00:03:19.959> 7

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
going to boot into the Windows 7

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.380 
going to boot into the Windows 7
installation<00:03:20.500> disk<00:03:21.010> so<00:03:21.910> that's<00:03:22.030> all<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:22.239> need

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
installation disk so that's all you need

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.870 
installation disk so that's all you need
for<00:03:22.570> this<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:24.100> can<00:03:24.250> get<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.549> anywhere

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
for this and you can get that anywhere

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.699 
for this and you can get that anywhere
real<00:03:25.090> Microsoft<00:03:25.690> even<00:03:25.930> gives<00:03:26.110> it<00:03:26.260> so<00:03:26.440> I'm

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
real Microsoft even gives it so I'm

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.180 
real Microsoft even gives it so I'm
gonna<00:03:26.890> boot<00:03:27.070> to<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.700> cd-rom<00:03:28.420> drive<00:03:28.950> press<00:03:29.950> any

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
gonna boot to the cd-rom drive press any

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.740 
gonna boot to the cd-rom drive press any
key<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.340> boot<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:30.820> the<00:03:31.120> windows<00:03:31.390> are<00:03:31.510> going<00:03:31.660> to

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
key to boot and the windows are going to

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.490 
key to boot and the windows are going to
load<00:03:31.930> files

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.680 

and<00:03:34.820> startup<00:03:35.820> so<00:03:36.000> this<00:03:36.150> is<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:36.420> installation

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
and startup so this is the installation

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.670 
and startup so this is the installation
for<00:03:37.170> Windows<00:03:37.440> 7<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:39.260> then<00:03:40.260> we're<00:03:40.380> going<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.620> be

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
for Windows 7 and then we're going to be

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.110 
for Windows 7 and then we're going to be
doing<00:03:40.920> some<00:03:41.100> couple<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.400> commands<00:03:41.700> in<00:03:41.850> command

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
doing some couple of commands in command

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.370 
doing some couple of commands in command
prompt<00:03:42.330> so<00:03:42.540> we're<00:03:42.660> not<00:03:42.750> actually<00:03:42.930> going<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.290> be

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
prompt so we're not actually going to be

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:52.160 
prompt so we're not actually going to be
installing<00:03:43.770> Windows<00:03:44.130> 7<00:03:44.430> here<00:03:50.780> takes<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.930> while

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
installing Windows 7 here takes a while

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.090 
installing Windows 7 here takes a while
obviously<00:03:53.780> so<00:03:54.780> once<00:03:54.990> it's<00:03:55.170> up<00:03:55.440> we're<00:03:55.680> going<00:03:55.860> to

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
obviously so once it's up we're going to

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.310 
obviously so once it's up we're going to

on Windows 8 I tried it it took a while

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.380 
on Windows 8 I tried it it took a while
but<00:05:07.950> eventually<00:05:08.100> I<00:05:08.550> just<00:05:08.760> gave<00:05:08.910> up<00:05:08.940> because

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.390 
apparently but this works on Windows 7
and<00:05:14.280> Windows<00:05:14.730> Vista<00:05:15.380> so<00:05:16.380> it's<00:05:16.680> still<00:05:17.040> usable

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
and Windows Vista so it's still usable

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.070 
and Windows Vista so it's still usable
today<00:05:17.640> because<00:05:18.150> a<00:05:18.330> lot<00:05:18.510> of<00:05:18.540> people<00:05:18.690> still<00:05:19.020> use
