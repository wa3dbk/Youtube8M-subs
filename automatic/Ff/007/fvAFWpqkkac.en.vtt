00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
hello and welcome to this blender

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.880 
hello and welcome to this blender
tutorial<00:00:02.730> which<00:00:03.000> is<00:00:03.179> about<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.899> new<00:00:04.110> Ramesh

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
tutorial which is about the new Ramesh

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.430 
tutorial which is about the new Ramesh
modifier<00:00:05.640> which<00:00:06.270> is<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.450> new<00:00:06.690> tool<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:07.259> has

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
modifier which is a new tool that has

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.530 
modifier which is a new tool that has
only<00:00:07.680> been<00:00:08.130> available<00:00:08.280> since<00:00:08.730> blender

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
only been available since blender

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.459 
only been available since blender
version<00:00:10.019> 2.6<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:11.280> onwards<00:00:12.059> so<00:00:12.929> if<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.200> have<00:00:13.349> an

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
version 2.6 to onwards so if you have an

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.560 
version 2.6 to onwards so if you have an
older<00:00:13.830> version<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.700> should<00:00:14.910> update<00:00:15.210> your

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
older version you should update your

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.950 
older version you should update your
software<00:00:16.340> from<00:00:17.340> blender<00:00:17.730> org<00:00:18.270> before

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
software from blender org before

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.640 
software from blender org before
continuing<00:00:19.710> with<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:21.260> the<00:00:22.260> Ramesh

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
continuing with this and the Ramesh

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.009 
continuing with this and the Ramesh
modifier<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.400> very<00:00:23.609> useful<00:00:24.060> for<00:00:24.090> correcting

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
modifier is very useful for correcting

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.849 
modifier is very useful for correcting
ugly<00:00:25.890> triangular<00:00:26.699> faces<00:00:27.660> on<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.050> mesh<00:00:28.349> which

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
ugly triangular faces on a mesh which

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.370 
ugly triangular faces on a mesh which
are<00:00:29.070> very<00:00:29.699> often<00:00:29.849> created<00:00:30.510> when<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.720> use<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
are very often created when you use the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.580 
are very often created when you use the
boolean<00:00:31.650> modifier<00:00:33.110> triangular<00:00:34.110> faces<00:00:34.320> are

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
boolean modifier triangular faces are

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.160 
boolean modifier triangular faces are
bad<00:00:34.739> for<00:00:34.770> many<00:00:35.280> reasons<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.090> one<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.020> most

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
bad for many reasons but one of the most

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.350 
bad for many reasons but one of the most
practical<00:00:37.380> reasons<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.309> they<00:00:38.879> do<00:00:38.940> not

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
practical reasons is that they do not

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.170 
practical reasons is that they do not
smooth<00:00:39.960> well<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.730> they<00:00:41.730> can<00:00:41.910> cause

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
smooth well and they can cause

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.930 
smooth well and they can cause
unpredictable<00:00:42.690> results<00:00:43.430> when<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.460> use<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
unpredictable results when you use the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.319 
unpredictable results when you use the
subsurface<00:00:45.390> modifier<00:00:46.789> so<00:00:47.789> first<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.239> all

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
subsurface modifier so first of all

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.180 
subsurface modifier so first of all
we're<00:00:48.600> going<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.780> use<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.200> building<00:00:49.620> modifier

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
we're going to use the building modifier

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.209 
we're going to use the building modifier
to<00:00:50.760> create<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> custom<00:00:51.629> shape<00:00:51.870> by<00:00:52.680> cutting<00:00:53.010> a

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
to create a custom shape by cutting a

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.389 
to create a custom shape by cutting a
hole<00:00:53.370> through<00:00:54.000> cube<00:00:54.420> as<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:55.230> did<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.250> last

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
hole through cube as we did in the last

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.099 
hole through cube as we did in the last
tutorial<00:00:57.410> so<00:00:58.410> add<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.770> cube<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.579> a<00:01:00.329> cylinder<00:01:00.840> to

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
tutorial so add a cube and a cylinder to

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.770 
tutorial so add a cube and a cylinder to
your<00:01:01.230> scene<00:01:01.500> then<00:01:02.340> add<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.910> boolean<00:01:03.270> modifier

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
your scene then add the boolean modifier

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.469 
your scene then add the boolean modifier
to<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> cube<00:01:04.500> use<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.580> difference<00:01:06.030> operation

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
to the cube use the difference operation

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.020 
to the cube use the difference operation
to<00:01:06.810> create<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> cylinder<00:01:07.650> shaped<00:01:07.920> hole<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
to create a cylinder shaped hole in the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.149 
to create a cylinder shaped hole in the
cube<00:01:09.979> finally<00:01:10.979> delete<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.490> cylinder<00:01:13.159> select

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
cube finally delete the cylinder select

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.149 
cube finally delete the cylinder select
the<00:01:14.280> cube<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.790> open<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> object<00:01:16.020> tab<00:01:16.290> then

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
the cube and open the object tab then

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.520 
the cube and open the object tab then
switch<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.759> wires<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.509> we<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.869> actually<00:01:19.080> see

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
switch on wires so we can actually see

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.590 
switch on wires so we can actually see
the<00:01:20.400> mesh<00:01:20.700> that's<00:01:21.600> been<00:01:21.900> created<00:01:22.560> for<00:01:22.799> us<00:01:23.600> so

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
the mesh that's been created for us so

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.410 
the mesh that's been created for us so
as<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.080> previous<00:01:25.290> tutorial<00:01:25.970> we<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.150> see

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
as in the previous tutorial we can see

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.010 
as in the previous tutorial we can see
these<00:01:28.049> ugly<00:01:28.979> triangular<00:01:29.729> faces<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.990> were

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
these ugly triangular faces that were

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.179 
these ugly triangular faces that were
created<00:01:31.439> by<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.860> building<00:01:32.310> operation<00:01:33.979> now<00:01:34.979> if

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
created by the building operation now if

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.429 
created by the building operation now if
we<00:01:35.400> add<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.909> rematch<00:01:36.360> modifier<00:01:36.990> from<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
we add the rematch modifier from the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.850 
we add the rematch modifier from the
modifiers<00:01:37.920> tab<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.759> cube<00:01:39.860> immediately

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
modifiers tab to the cube immediately

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.160 
modifiers tab to the cube immediately
blender<00:01:41.430> completely<00:01:42.150> recalculates<00:01:42.990> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
blender completely recalculates the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.740 
blender completely recalculates the
entire<00:01:43.530> mass<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> object<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.880> make<00:01:45.540> it

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
entire mass of the object to make it

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.730 
entire mass of the object to make it
primarily<00:01:46.439> quads<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.899> much<00:01:48.899> more<00:01:49.140> efficient

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
primarily quads and much more efficient

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.310 
primarily quads and much more efficient
effective<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.640> useful<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.840> terms<00:01:52.110> of

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
effective and useful in terms of

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.550 
effective and useful in terms of
manipulating<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:54.299> object<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:54.960> many

manipulating the object in many
different<00:01:55.799> ways<00:01:56.780> so<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.840> can<00:01:58.079> adjust<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
different ways so you can adjust the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.120 
different ways so you can adjust the
settings<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.659> rematch<00:02:00.659> modifier<00:02:01.200> such<00:02:01.860> as

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
settings in the rematch modifier such as

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.380 
settings in the rematch modifier such as
the<00:02:02.820> octree<00:02:03.390> depth<00:02:03.810> which<00:02:04.799> will<00:02:05.119> increase<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the octree depth which will increase the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.650 
the octree depth which will increase the
complexity<00:02:07.049> or<00:02:07.489> simplify<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.550> mesh<00:02:08.879> by

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
complexity or simplify the mesh by

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.990 
complexity or simplify the mesh by
making<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.229> more<00:02:10.470> or<00:02:10.590> less<00:02:10.739> accurate<00:02:11.340> compared

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
making it more or less accurate compared

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.980 
making it more or less accurate compared
to<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.660> orig

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
to the orig

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.040 
to the orig
object<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.880> can<00:02:15.000> also<00:02:15.180> just<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.690> scale

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
object and you can also just a scale

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.640 
object and you can also just a scale
which<00:02:16.830> increases<00:02:17.550> or<00:02:17.790> decreases<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:19.110> size<00:02:19.140> of

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
which increases or decreases the size of

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.330 
which increases or decreases the size of
the<00:02:19.740> faces<00:02:20.510> so<00:02:21.510> obviously<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.320> larger<00:02:22.770> the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
the faces so obviously the larger the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.790 
the faces so obviously the larger the
scale<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.540> less<00:02:24.750> detail<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.440> have<00:02:25.590> in<00:02:25.710> your

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
scale the less detail you have in your

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.970 
scale the less detail you have in your
object<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.570> it<00:02:27.570> can<00:02:27.840> begin<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.410> lose<00:02:28.710> its

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980

object and it can begin to lose its
original<00:02:29.790> shape<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.200> just<00:02:31.680> drop<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.100> try

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
original shape so you just drop to try

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.730 
original shape so you just drop to try
and<00:02:32.520> get<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.880> balance<00:02:33.120> right<00:02:33.360> between<00:02:33.740> these

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
and get the balance right between these

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.060 
and get the balance right between these
settings<00:02:35.660> so<00:02:36.660> using<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.230> Ramesh<00:02:37.590> modifier

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
settings so using the Ramesh modifier

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.340 
settings so using the Ramesh modifier
allows<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.670> end<00:02:38.820> up<00:02:38.970> with<00:02:39.240> a<00:02:39.390> much<00:02:39.630> better

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
allows you to end up with a much better

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.890 
allows you to end up with a much better
match<00:02:40.740> than<00:02:40.770> what<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.460> would<00:02:41.580> end<00:02:41.850> up<00:02:42.000> with<00:02:42.060> if

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
match than what you would end up with if

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.570 
match than what you would end up with if
you<00:02:43.080> just<00:02:43.320> accepted<00:02:43.800> what<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.130> boolean

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
you just accepted what the boolean

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.320 
you just accepted what the boolean
modifier<00:02:45.060> gives<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:47.340> next<00:02:47.580> we'll<00:02:47.790> have<00:02:48.120> a

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
modifier gives you so next we'll have a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.200

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
look at a quick example involving some

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.070 
look at a quick example involving some
typography<00:02:52.550> so<00:02:53.550> if<00:02:53.730> we<00:02:53.880> add<00:02:54.030> some<00:02:54.330> text<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:54.960> the

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080

trying<00:05:00.729> to<00:05:01.500> apply<00:05:02.500> this<00:05:02.620> technique<00:05:03.310> to<00:05:03.639> long

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:03.819 
trying to apply this technique to long

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:08.820 
trying to apply this technique to long
words<00:05:04.210> or<00:05:05.199> sentences<00:05:06.120> as<00:05:07.229> results<00:05:08.229> may<00:05:08.409> not<00:05:08.440> be

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
words or sentences as results may not be

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.159 
words or sentences as results may not be
quite<00:05:09.759> as<00:05:09.880> good<00:05:10.240> as<00:05:10.770> they<00:05:11.770> should<00:05:11.800> be<00:05:12.840> if<00:05:13.840> you

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
quite as good as they should be if you

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.370 
quite as good as they should be if you
use<00:05:14.979> long<00:05:15.460> complicated<00:05:16.060> objects<00:05:16.930> like<00:05:17.139> that

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
use long complicated objects like that

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.010 
use long complicated objects like that
so<00:05:18.370> one<00:05:18.550> of<00:05:18.669> the<00:05:18.759> problems<00:05:19.150> with<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:19.599> Ramesh

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
so one of the problems with the Ramesh

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.670 
so one of the problems with the Ramesh
modifier<00:05:20.710> is<00:05:21.090> that<00:05:22.090> it<00:05:22.330> tends<00:05:22.750> to<00:05:22.960> add<00:05:23.199> more

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
modifier is that it tends to add more

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.620 
modifier is that it tends to add more
faces<00:05:24.280> than<00:05:24.310> we<00:05:25.270> might<00:05:25.569> need<00:05:27.060> of<00:05:28.060> course<00:05:28.419> we

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
faces than we might need of course we

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.469 
faces than we might need of course we
can<00:05:28.810> actually<00:05:29.110> delete<00:05:29.469> them<00:05:29.770> and<00:05:30.479> marriage

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
can actually delete them and marriage

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.749 
can actually delete them and marriage
the<00:05:31.690> vertices<00:05:32.020> together<00:05:32.590> to<00:05:32.979> create<00:05:33.159> simpler

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 
the vertices together to create simpler

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:37.200 
the vertices together to create simpler
meshes<00:05:34.830> however<00:05:35.830> in<00:05:36.039> most<00:05:36.219> cases<00:05:36.610> if<00:05:37.000> the

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
meshes however in most cases if the

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.520 
meshes however in most cases if the
Ramesh<00:05:38.110> modifier<00:05:38.620> does<00:05:38.860> a<00:05:38.889> fantastic<00:05:39.099> job<00:05:39.639> and

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
Ramesh modifier does a fantastic job and

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.310 
Ramesh modifier does a fantastic job and
it's<00:05:41.530> a<00:05:41.770> very<00:05:41.800> welcome<00:05:42.460> addition<00:05:42.880> to<00:05:43.320> lenders

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
it's a very welcome addition to lenders
