00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.450 

clipping<00:00:03.420> masks<00:00:03.900> are<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.109> great<00:00:04.740> effect<00:00:05.189> when

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
clipping masks are a great effect when

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.820 
clipping masks are a great effect when
you<00:00:05.550> want<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:06.029> give<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.109> illusion<00:00:07.230> that<00:00:07.650> you

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
you want to give the illusion that you

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.310 
you want to give the illusion that you
are<00:00:07.980> looking<00:00:08.309> through<00:00:08.610> something<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.389> in

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
are looking through something and in

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.689 
are looking through something and in
this<00:00:10.469> case<00:00:10.709> we're<00:00:10.920> gonna<00:00:11.039> make<00:00:11.250> believe<00:00:11.549> we're

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:11.699 
this case we're gonna make believe we're

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:13.640 
this case we're gonna make believe we're
looking<00:00:11.940> at<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.360> ship<00:00:12.600> through<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.260> telescope

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
looking at this ship through a telescope

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.220 
looking at this ship through a telescope
lens<00:00:14.180> so<00:00:15.180> what's<00:00:15.449> going<00:00:15.600> to<00:00:15.629> happen<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.080> we're

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
lens so what's going to happen is we're

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.040 
lens so what's going to happen is we're
going<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.410> paint<00:00:16.740> an<00:00:16.920> ellipse<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.900> this<00:00:18.900> is

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
going to paint an ellipse and this is

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.420 
going to paint an ellipse and this is
important<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.710> understand<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:20.280> have<00:00:20.400> to

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
important that you understand we have to

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.190 
important that you understand we have to
use<00:00:20.610> a<00:00:20.640> painted<00:00:21.120> object<00:00:21.600> we<00:00:21.720> can't<00:00:21.960> use

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
use a painted object we can't use

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.870 
use a painted object we can't use
something<00:00:22.770> that's<00:00:22.920> going<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.160> have<00:00:23.340> like<00:00:23.700> a

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
something that's going to have like a

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.460 
something that's going to have like a
centerline<00:00:24.270> we<00:00:24.630> have<00:00:24.780> to<00:00:24.900> have<00:00:25.080> some<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.410> this

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
centerline we have to have some of this

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.860 
centerline we have to have some of this
one<00:00:25.650> have<00:00:25.770> a<00:00:25.800> contour<00:00:26.370> such<00:00:27.330> as<00:00:27.450> a<00:00:27.480> painted

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:27.870 
one have a contour such as a painted

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.660 
one have a contour such as a painted
object<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.680> we<00:00:28.800> can't<00:00:28.980> use<00:00:29.100> the<00:00:29.130> pencil<00:00:29.400> tool

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
object so we can't use the pencil tool

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.800 
object so we can't use the pencil tool
to<00:00:29.700> draw<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.030> shape<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.450> have<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.630> use<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
to draw the shape we have to use the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.529 
to draw the shape we have to use the
brush<00:00:31.020> tool<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.730> what<00:00:32.730> I'm<00:00:32.820> gonna<00:00:32.940> do<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.390> I'm

00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:33.539 
brush tool and what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:35.720 
brush tool and what I'm gonna do is I'm
going<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.809> draw<00:00:34.050> an<00:00:34.320> ellipse<00:00:34.739> using<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
going to draw an ellipse using the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.340 
going to draw an ellipse using the
ellipse<00:00:36.120> tool<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.480> we're<00:00:36.780> gonna<00:00:36.870> fill<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.230> in

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
ellipse tool and we're gonna fill it in

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.900 
ellipse tool and we're gonna fill it in
with<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.590> color<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.010> then<00:00:38.430> we're<00:00:38.670> going<00:00:38.820> to

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
with the color and then we're going to

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.180 
with the color and then we're going to
use<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.450> clipping<00:00:39.780> mask<00:00:39.810> to<00:00:40.290> hide<00:00:40.860> everything

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
use the clipping mask to hide everything

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.360 
use the clipping mask to hide everything
but<00:00:41.670> what's<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.149> on<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:43.320> circle<00:00:43.710> let's

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
but what's going on in that circle let's

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.680 
but what's going on in that circle let's
go<00:00:44.460> ahead<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.730> give<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.970> shot<00:00:45.239> I'm<00:00:45.540> gonna

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
go ahead and give that a shot I'm gonna

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.750 
go ahead and give that a shot I'm gonna
take<00:00:46.320> my<00:00:46.470> time<00:00:46.500> because<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.309> complicated

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
take my time because it's a complicated

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.430 
take my time because it's a complicated
effect<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.420> has<00:00:48.540> a<00:00:48.570> lot<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.809> steps<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.200> it

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
effect and it has a lot of steps to it

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.139 
effect and it has a lot of steps to it
the<00:00:50.130> first<00:00:50.309> thing<00:00:50.430> we're<00:00:50.610> going<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.790> do<00:00:50.910> is

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
the first thing we're going to do is

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.889 
the first thing we're going to do is
we're<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:51.540> to<00:00:52.160> go<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.220> the<00:00:53.660> exposure<00:00:54.660> sheet

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
we're going to go to the exposure sheet

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.240 
we're going to go to the exposure sheet
here<00:00:55.200> and<00:00:55.290> I'm<00:00:55.649> going<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.829> create<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.070> new

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
here and I'm going to create a new

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.190 
here and I'm going to create a new
object<00:00:56.489> here<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.120> new<00:00:57.300> drawing<00:00:57.630> object<00:00:58.050> I'm

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
object here a new drawing object I'm

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.780 
object here a new drawing object I'm
going<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.559> right<00:00:58.770> click<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.160> rename<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.640> right

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
going to right click to rename it right

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.479 
going to right click to rename it right
here<00:00:59.969> we're<00:01:00.120> sort<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.300> drawing<00:01:01.190> because<00:01:02.190> it's

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
here we're sort of drawing because it's

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.189 
here we're sort of drawing because it's
important<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.090> rename<00:01:03.450> your<00:01:03.660> elements<00:01:04.049> as<00:01:04.170> you

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
important to rename your elements as you

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.359 
important to rename your elements as you
work<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.649> you<00:01:04.739> don't<00:01:04.890> become<00:01:05.009> you<00:01:05.339> know

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
work so you don't become you know

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.370 
work so you don't become you know
disoriented<00:01:06.060> or<00:01:06.210> confused<00:01:06.810> as<00:01:06.959> to<00:01:07.020> what's

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
disoriented or confused as to what's

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.899 
disoriented or confused as to what's
what<00:01:07.679> when<00:01:07.859> you're<00:01:07.950> working<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.729> I'm<00:01:08.789> gonna

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
what when you're working so I'm gonna

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.499 
what when you're working so I'm gonna
call<00:01:09.149> this<00:01:09.829> telescope<00:01:13.399> and<00:01:14.399> I'll<00:01:15.270> put<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
call this telescope and I'll put the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.209 
call this telescope and I'll put the
word<00:01:15.630> mask<00:01:15.990> there<00:01:16.409> because<00:01:16.679> this<00:01:16.889> is<00:01:16.950> going<00:01:17.159> to

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:17.219 
word mask there because this is going to

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:19.219 
word mask there because this is going to
be<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.399> object<00:01:17.789> that<00:01:17.880> we're<00:01:18.060> going<00:01:18.209> to<00:01:18.329> use

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
be the object that we're going to use

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.489 
be the object that we're going to use
this<00:01:19.409> see<00:01:19.770> just<00:01:20.399> the<00:01:20.520> ship<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.420> now<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.409> we

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:22.499 
this see just the ship and now that we

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:25.219 
this see just the ship and now that we
have<00:01:22.529> that<00:01:22.920> let's<00:01:23.639> go<00:01:24.149> to<00:01:24.179> our<00:01:24.600> drawing<00:01:24.869> view

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
have that let's go to our drawing view

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.539 
have that let's go to our drawing view
to<00:01:25.380> create<00:01:25.679> this<00:01:25.799> artwork<00:01:26.069> so<00:01:26.310> I'm<00:01:26.369> going<00:01:26.490> to

to create this artwork so I'm going to
go<00:01:26.609> to<00:01:26.670> my<00:01:26.789> drawing<00:01:27.029> view<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.479> I'm<00:01:28.409> going<00:01:28.590> to

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
go to my drawing view and I'm going to

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.769 
go to my drawing view and I'm going to
go<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.859> where<00:01:29.219> the<00:01:29.399> paintbrush<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.299> over<00:01:30.539> here

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:30.779 
go to where the paintbrush is over here

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:32.769 
go to where the paintbrush is over here
and<00:01:30.899> I'm<00:01:30.959> going<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.259> choose<00:01:31.499> the<00:01:31.679> ellipse<00:01:32.189> tool

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:32.779 
and I'm going to choose the ellipse tool

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:35.199 
and I'm going to choose the ellipse tool
I'm<00:01:33.779> gonna<00:01:33.959> hold<00:01:34.109> down<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> shift<00:01:34.590> key<00:01:34.679> and

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:35.209 
I'm gonna hold down the shift key and

chip<00:03:28.739> scene<00:03:28.979> peg<00:03:29.930> so<00:03:30.930> now<00:03:31.109> the<00:03:31.199> ship<00:03:31.409> scene<00:03:31.680> is

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
chip scene peg so now the ship scene is

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.539 
chip scene peg so now the ship scene is
included<00:03:32.790> in<00:03:32.939> this<00:03:33.120> peg<00:03:33.949> now<00:03:34.949> as<00:03:35.129> you<00:03:35.220> see<00:03:35.370> here

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
included in this peg now as you see here

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.009 
included in this peg now as you see here
I'm<00:03:35.669> gonna<00:03:35.760> uncollapse<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.419> clipping<00:03:36.720> effect

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
I'm gonna uncollapse the clipping effect

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.780 
I'm gonna uncollapse the clipping effect
we<00:03:37.349> have<00:03:37.379> for<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.620> clipping<00:03:37.919> effect<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.669> we

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
we have for a clipping effect and we

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.879 
we have for a clipping effect and we
have<00:03:38.939> the<00:03:39.030> telescope<00:03:39.479> mask<00:03:39.750> attached<00:03:40.349> to<00:03:40.739> the

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
have the telescope mask attached to the

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.240 
have the telescope mask attached to the
mask<00:03:41.159> here<00:03:42.000> see<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.709> now<00:03:43.709> we<00:03:43.829> need<00:03:43.979> to<00:03:44.040> do<00:03:44.129> the

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
mask here see that now we need to do the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.490 
mask here see that now we need to do the
same<00:03:44.430> thing<00:03:44.699> and<00:03:44.939> instead<00:03:45.389> of<00:03:45.479> dragging<00:03:46.259> the

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
same thing and instead of dragging the

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.229 
same thing and instead of dragging the
ships<00:03:46.739> into<00:03:47.099> the<00:03:47.129> mask<00:03:47.430> we're<00:03:47.819> going<00:03:47.939> to<00:03:48.000> drag

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
ships into the mask we're going to drag

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.909 
ships into the mask we're going to drag
the<00:03:48.389> ship<00:03:48.449> scene<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:49.109> the<00:03:49.199> actual<00:03:49.530> clipping

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
the ship scene to the actual clipping

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.550 
the ship scene to the actual clipping
effect<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:50.819> once<00:03:50.970> again<00:03:51.239> your<00:03:51.659> artwork<00:03:52.109> which

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
effect so once again your artwork which

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.710 
effect so once again your artwork which
is<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.829> artwork<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.489> created<00:03:54.120> goes<00:03:54.359> to<00:03:54.599> the

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
is the artwork you created goes to the

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.080 
is the artwork you created goes to the
mask<00:03:55.019> section<00:03:55.799> of<00:03:55.919> the<00:03:56.250> clipping<00:03:56.549> effect<00:03:56.849> and

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
mask section of the clipping effect and

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.479 
mask section of the clipping effect and
you're<00:03:57.810> seeing<00:03:58.139> that<00:03:58.709> you're<00:03:58.889> trying<00:03:59.129> to<00:03:59.250> clip

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
you're seeing that you're trying to clip

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.520 
you're seeing that you're trying to clip
goes<00:04:00.030> on<00:04:00.209> top<00:04:00.419> of<00:04:00.569> the<00:04:00.659> clipping<00:04:00.989> effect<00:04:01.349> so

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
goes on top of the clipping effect so

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.559 
goes on top of the clipping effect so
let's<00:04:01.739> go<00:04:01.979> ahead<00:04:02.099> and<00:04:02.310> drag<00:04:02.609> that<00:04:02.879> right<00:04:03.120> to

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
let's go ahead and drag that right to

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.110 
let's go ahead and drag that right to
the<00:04:03.689> clipping<00:04:03.989> effect<00:04:04.319> and<00:04:04.560> now<00:04:05.220> we<00:04:05.280> have<00:04:05.609> the

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
the clipping effect and now we have the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.770 
the clipping effect and now we have the
clipping<00:04:06.449> effect<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.500> mask<00:04:08.569> what<00:04:09.569> I<00:04:09.599> want

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
clipping effect and the mask what I want

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.420 
clipping effect and the mask what I want
to<00:04:09.840> do<00:04:09.900> at<00:04:10.019> this<00:04:10.139> point<00:04:10.259> is<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:11.189> make<00:04:11.310> sure

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
to do at this point is to make sure

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.800 
to do at this point is to make sure
everything<00:04:11.729> is<00:04:11.759> extended<00:04:12.419> throughout<00:04:12.659> the

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
everything is extended throughout the

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.009 
everything is extended throughout the
entire<00:04:13.109> animation<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:14.459> I'm<00:04:15.359> going<00:04:15.629> to<00:04:15.780> now

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
entire animation and I'm going to now

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.170 
entire animation and I'm going to now
look<00:04:16.709> at<00:04:16.799> my<00:04:16.919> ship<00:04:17.130> scene<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.909> make<00:04:18.060> sure

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
look at my ship scene and make sure

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.289 
look at my ship scene and make sure
that's<00:04:18.299> all<00:04:18.539> there<00:04:18.780> as<00:04:18.870> well<00:04:19.070> and<00:04:20.180> I'm<00:04:21.180> gonna

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
that's all there as well and I'm gonna

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.909 
that's all there as well and I'm gonna
hit<00:04:21.539> the<00:04:21.690> return<00:04:22.109> key<00:04:22.139> on<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.440> keyboard<00:04:22.620> to

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
hit the return key on the keyboard to

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.310 
hit the return key on the keyboard to
see<00:04:23.070> what<00:04:23.190> this<00:04:23.250> looks<00:04:23.460> like<00:04:23.490> so<00:04:23.699> far<00:04:24.139> let's<00:04:25.139> go

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
see what this looks like so far let's go

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.860 
see what this looks like so far let's go
to<00:04:25.469> our<00:04:25.590> camera<00:04:25.889> view<00:04:25.919> first<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.750> there<00:04:27.750> you

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
to our camera view first and there you

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.890 
to our camera view first and there you
go

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
go

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.510 
go
we're<00:04:29.620> able<00:04:29.680> to<00:04:29.830> look<00:04:29.920> at<00:04:30.130> our<00:04:30.160> clipping

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
we're able to look at our clipping

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.890 
we're able to look at our clipping
effect<00:04:30.840> our<00:04:31.840> mask<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:34.300> actual<00:04:34.630> telescope

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
effect our mask and the actual telescope

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.460 
effect our mask and the actual telescope
effect

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
effect

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.140 
effect
let's<00:04:35.950> hit<00:04:36.070> return<00:04:36.370> to<00:04:36.610> preview<00:04:37.060> the

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
let's hit return to preview the

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:44.670 
let's hit return to preview the
animation<00:04:40.680> and<00:04:42.690> now<00:04:43.690> we<00:04:43.750> have<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.230> effect<00:04:44.440> of

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
animation and now we have the effect of

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.300 
animation and now we have the effect of
looking<00:04:45.040> through<00:04:45.220> a<00:04:45.250> telescope<00:04:45.340> at<00:04:46.000> our<00:04:46.360> scene

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
looking through a telescope at our scene

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.130 
looking through a telescope at our scene
if<00:04:48.310> you<00:04:48.490> want<00:04:48.700> to<00:04:48.850> further<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.420> effect<00:04:49.750> just

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
if you want to further the effect just

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.110 
if you want to further the effect just
drag<00:04:50.590> your<00:04:50.860> background<00:04:51.370> layer<00:04:51.430> or<00:04:51.820> create<00:04:52.090> a

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
drag your background layer or create a

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.940 
drag your background layer or create a
new<00:04:52.210> layer<00:04:52.540> right<00:04:53.230> to<00:04:53.410> the<00:04:53.500> top<00:04:53.740> of<00:04:53.890> the

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
new layer right to the top of the

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.500 
new layer right to the top of the
clipping<00:04:54.250> effect<00:04:54.550> and<00:04:54.730> it<00:04:54.820> won't<00:04:54.970> be<00:04:55.090> affected

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
clipping effect and it won't be affected

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.180 
clipping effect and it won't be affected
for<00:04:55.630> example<00:04:55.720> my<00:04:56.200> sky<00:04:56.470> is<00:04:56.530> a<00:04:56.680> solid<00:04:57.070> blue

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
for example my sky is a solid blue

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.650 
for example my sky is a solid blue
object<00:04:57.610> so<00:04:57.730> I<00:04:57.790> can<00:04:57.910> go<00:04:58.000> ahead<00:04:58.150> and<00:04:58.300> grab<00:04:58.630> that

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
object so I can go ahead and grab that

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.080 
object so I can go ahead and grab that
and<00:04:59.110> drag<00:04:59.140> it<00:04:59.860> all<00:05:00.100> the<00:05:00.280> way<00:05:00.370> to<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.580> top<00:05:00.820> so

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
and drag it all the way to the top so

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.110 
and drag it all the way to the top so
that<00:05:01.840> the<00:05:01.990> clipping<00:05:02.260> effect<00:05:02.910> northern<00:05:03.910> mask

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
that the clipping effect northern mask

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.700 
that the clipping effect northern mask
effects<00:05:04.510> it<00:05:04.720> and<00:05:04.900> now<00:05:05.050> we<00:05:05.110> have<00:05:05.350> this<00:05:05.500> solid

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710

likewise you can create a new drawing
element<00:05:11.230> and<00:05:11.380> just<00:05:11.710> color<00:05:11.860> it<00:05:12.010> black<00:05:12.220> or

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
to the top of the clipping effect so you

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.550 
to the top of the clipping effect so you
can<00:05:15.730> have<00:05:15.880> this<00:05:16.030> dark<00:05:16.360> color<00:05:16.630> so<00:05:16.870> that<00:05:17.290> we're

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
can have this dark color so that we're

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.350 
can have this dark color so that we're
looking<00:05:17.830> through<00:05:18.070> a<00:05:18.130> lens<00:05:18.370> so<00:05:19.090> once<00:05:19.240> again

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
looking through a lens so once again

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:26.510 
looking through a lens so once again
I'll<00:05:19.540> hit<00:05:19.660> return<00:05:19.990> so<00:05:20.260> we<00:05:20.350> can<00:05:20.470> see<00:05:20.590> the<00:05:20.710> effect
