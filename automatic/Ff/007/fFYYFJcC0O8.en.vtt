00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.830 
by Milani and this one also is quite a
light<00:02:13.170> color<00:02:13.590> it's<00:02:14.580> kind<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:15.000> light<00:02:15.240> peachy

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
light color it's kind of a light peachy

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.660 
light color it's kind of a light peachy
color<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.350> being<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.130> light<00:02:17.430> color

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
color and being that it is a light color

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.940 
color and being that it is a light color
I<00:02:17.850> like<00:02:18.030> using<00:02:18.270> this<00:02:18.570> as<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.840> highlight<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.320> this

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
I like using this as a highlight to this

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.820 
I like using this as a highlight to this
one<00:02:20.160> isn't<00:02:20.640> quite<00:02:20.700> as<00:02:21.210> shimmery<00:02:21.960> but<00:02:22.620> it

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
one isn't quite as shimmery but it

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.350 
one isn't quite as shimmery but it
really<00:02:23.130> does<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.760> job<00:02:23.790> this<00:02:24.120> one<00:02:24.300> is

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
really does the job this one is

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.360 
really does the job this one is
definitely<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:25.230> little<00:02:25.350> bit<00:02:25.590> more<00:02:25.740> peachy

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
definitely a little bit more peachy

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.900 
definitely a little bit more peachy
colored<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:30.260> then<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.410> last<00:02:31.650> one<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.550> the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
colored and then the last one is the

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.540 
colored and then the last one is the
lioele<00:02:33.390> silky<00:02:34.050> highlight<00:02:34.500> or<00:02:34.650> baby<00:02:34.980> touch<00:02:35.190> and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
lioele silky highlight or baby touch and

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.530 
lioele silky highlight or baby touch and
so<00:02:36.210> this<00:02:36.450> is<00:02:36.660> also<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:37.290> BB<00:02:37.890> cream<00:02:38.040> but<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:39.270> Pearl

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
so this is also a BB cream but the Pearl

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.820 
so this is also a BB cream but the Pearl
touch<00:02:39.870> gives<00:02:40.380> us<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:41.610> splendid<00:02:42.240> pneus<00:02:42.830> shining

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
touch gives us a splendid pneus shining

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.400 
touch gives us a splendid pneus shining
this<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.460> skin<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.570> there's<00:02:46.020> like<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.290> low

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
this to the skin and there's like a low

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.430 
this to the skin and there's like a low
and<00:02:46.890> hyaluronic<00:02:47.220> acid<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:49.050> just<00:02:49.260> really

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
and hyaluronic acid and I just really

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.230 
and hyaluronic acid and I just really
like<00:02:49.740> this<00:02:50.070> because<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.550> feel<00:02:50.850> like<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.000> gives

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
like this because I feel like it gives

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.240 
like this because I feel like it gives
you<00:02:51.450> kind<00:02:51.660> of<00:02:51.780> like<00:02:51.990> a<00:02:52.140> dewy<00:02:52.500> look<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.070> then

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
you kind of like a dewy look and then

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.910 
you kind of like a dewy look and then
this<00:02:53.430> one<00:02:53.490> you<00:02:53.850> actually<00:02:54.380> pump<00:02:55.380> from<00:02:55.740> the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
this one you actually pump from the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.190 
this one you actually pump from the
bottom<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.550> you'll<00:02:57.420> see<00:02:57.660> that<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.930> kind<00:02:58.140> of

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
bottom and you'll see that it kind of

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.250 
bottom and you'll see that it kind of
comes<00:02:58.470> out<00:02:58.860> there<00:02:59.420> here<00:03:00.420> I'll<00:03:00.540> do<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:00.810> over<00:03:01.140> on

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
comes out there here I'll do it over on

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.090 
comes out there here I'll do it over on
this<00:03:01.440> side<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:04.290> this<00:03:04.470> one<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:04.860> definitely

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
this side and so this one is definitely

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.570 
this side and so this one is definitely
more<00:03:06.170> moisturizing<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:07.680> this<00:03:07.860> might<00:03:08.100> be<00:03:08.130> a

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
more moisturizing so this might be a

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.330
