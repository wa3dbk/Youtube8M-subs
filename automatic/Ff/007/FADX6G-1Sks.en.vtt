00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 wash only me sonae of the twenty-first century the video 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.670
 today will be a box in a few days and 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.620
 was hired by tag staff 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.360
 literary experiences man entered 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.009
 contact me he explained to me 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.170
 About the project 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.250
 they are a club of signature of 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.119
 books 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.430
 ah and I had already seen on the isa channel and 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.980
 ie that the book was reading and she already had 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.840
 said a little about them and I 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.420
 I entered the site I found an idea is 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.369
 super nice, I do not know if I ever 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.170
 I commented with you, but this year I 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.750
 I promised myself that I would get out of the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.910
 my comfort zone and that I was going to read 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.660
 some different books 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.360
 the idea is that you have this signature and 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.910
 There you will receive a small box. 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.640
 if I'm not mistaken there are two types of plan 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.270
 then you get one pound a month and 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.640
 another plan in what it is to have everyone 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.859
 and there in that box but in a 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.250
 reviewed a book marker 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.400
 personalized and another treat to choose 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.530
 of books it was made from a 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.229
 contact they had with large 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.049
 names of the Brazilian scenario and the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.450
 about which books have changed 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.540
 their lives and then they took these 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.400
 indications and put the little boxes 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.920
 I'll open it for you to see what 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.900

 the advanced is for you not to stay in the 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.829
 boring 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:48.549

 russia is not only the country the 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.040
 better logic but also the origin of 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.330
 some of the largest and most noise of 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.220
 writers of the world 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.959
 we made this light girl to 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.120
 you decorate the session from your library 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.690
 for Russian authors 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.780
 this item is merely very decorative 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:31.850

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.549
 selection of the books for the 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.720
 revised to the river 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:53.030
 common questions are 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.790
 Everyone who 's downstairs for you to go 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.109
 know and know how it works 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.239
 right 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:02.690

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.470
 From here I'm in love with affection for 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:17.959
 Careful that these people have let's open 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:21.350
 to see which book came and came to 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:24.680
 two fantastic narratives the docile and the 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:28.010
 dream of a ridiculous man I confess 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.590
 Marché name is that I'm afraid of 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.049
 literature is afraid of the authors 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.790
 courses but how I told you I'm 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.040
 I really want to get out of my 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.790
 comfort this year and I think I'm going 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.090
 start here I'm super excited 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.750
 I loved the book that came and then have this 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.880
 super cute bookmark is not written 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.440
 here so that's the March kit 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.290
 here you have 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.300
 luiz felipe pondé I chose this author 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.430
 because it is eternal as death he 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.350
 shakespeare are better than almost 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.470
 all that mankind has produced in 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.330
 literature people the quality of material 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.720
 It's very cool. 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:15.060
 Yesterday, it looks beautiful people who 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:19.670
 stack of books does not have reader's note 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.959
 which is as soon as it opens the month 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.330
 very cool, I'll read it from here on 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.440
 enough care then the healer is the 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:30.870
 luiz felipe pondé was the one who chose the 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:35.060
 author of the month the book probably 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:37.260
 I also think there are his works, right? 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.540
 Unfortunately I do not know the author for 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.670
 tell you more about him 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:46.200
 Tell me a little about the indicated book. 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:51.210
 very cool people look is a material 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:56.010
 very nice very rich other works of the 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:05:03.380
 Author very very cool where lines 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:06.180
 Literature robs the good people at last 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.790
 Well, that's what came in the 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.570
 I was very happy I loved it. 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:15.030
 This story is what I had already seen in 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.030
 some American bookstores they make of 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:21.690
 an indie teeth blog knows them 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.300
 then put a book within a month 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:28.590
 without shine with rafael brown and they 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.390
 write there is romance the qr you 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.530
 buy a book without knowing what you 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.840
 is buying 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.240
 so it's very cool for who wants to leave 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.640
 from your comfort zone to those who are 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.540
 looking for something different I found this 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.240
 idea of ​​land literary experiences 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.340
 very cool really want to leave 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.770

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.100

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.470
 post 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.560

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.380

 and that's what I'm doing and 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.150
