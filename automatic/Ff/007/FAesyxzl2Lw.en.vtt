okay<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:02.070> then<00:02:02.250> when<00:02:02.369> I'm<00:02:02.460> going<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.960> pull

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
okay and then when I'm going to pull

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.809 
okay and then when I'm going to pull
pull<00:02:06.719> all<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.990> way<00:02:07.020> through<00:02:07.350> okay<00:02:07.819> leaving

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
pull all the way through okay leaving

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.100 
pull all the way through okay leaving
probably<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:10.370> third<00:02:11.660> maybe<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.780> little<00:02:12.959> less

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
probably a third maybe a little less

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.580 
probably a third maybe a little less
than<00:02:13.170> enough

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
than enough

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.330 
than enough
third<00:02:13.769> of<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.190> cord<00:02:14.989> on<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.080> other<00:02:16.230> side<00:02:16.440> okay

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
third of the cord on the other side okay

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.920 
third of the cord on the other side okay
I<00:02:17.550> guess<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.239> would<00:02:18.330> have<00:02:18.420> been<00:02:18.510> easier<00:02:18.780> if<00:02:18.870> I

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
I guess it would have been easier if I

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.449 
I guess it would have been easier if I
put<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.500> through<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.680> top<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:19.920> then<00:02:20.190> came<00:02:20.340> at

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
put it through the top and then came at

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.270 
put it through the top and then came at
the<00:02:20.580> bottom<00:02:20.879> and<00:02:21.810> just<00:02:22.080> pulled<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:22.950> about

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
the bottom and just pulled that about

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.640 
the bottom and just pulled that about
that<00:02:23.489> much<00:02:23.700> okay<00:02:24.599> from<00:02:24.989> here<00:02:25.349> what<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.530> want

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
that much okay from here what you want

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.720 
that much okay from here what you want
to<00:02:25.800> do<00:02:26.120> is<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.300> want<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.540> kind<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:28.550> pinch<00:02:29.550> this

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
to do is you want to kind of pinch this

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.690 
to do is you want to kind of pinch this
down<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.470> fold<00:02:31.470> fold<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.160> back<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.580> make

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
down and fold fold this back to make

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.020 
down and fold fold this back to make
kind<00:02:32.879> of<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.000> loop<00:02:33.209> okay<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.700> it's<00:02:35.849> going<00:02:35.970> to

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
kind of a loop okay so it's going to

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.390 
kind of a loop okay so it's going to
look<00:02:36.120> something<00:02:36.299> like<00:02:36.480> this<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:38.160> now<00:02:38.250> let's

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
look something like this and now let's

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.400 
look something like this and now let's
get<00:02:38.849> a<00:02:39.000> little<00:02:39.150> confusing<00:02:39.629> it's<00:02:39.930> not<00:02:40.110> it's<00:02:40.260> not

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
get a little confusing it's not it's not

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.710 
get a little confusing it's not it's not
hard<00:02:40.680> but<00:02:40.920> like<00:02:41.549> I<00:02:41.670> said<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.510> kind<00:02:42.690> of

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
hard but like I said to to kind of

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.330 
hard but like I said to to kind of
explain<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.260> it's<00:02:43.379> a<00:02:43.470> little<00:02:43.620> bit<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:44.010> little

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
explain it it's a little bit a little

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.220 
explain it it's a little bit a little
bit<00:02:44.430> hard<00:02:44.610> I<00:02:44.790> hope<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.239> doesn't<00:02:45.420> confuse

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
bit hard I hope it doesn't confuse

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.809 
bit hard I hope it doesn't confuse
anyone<00:02:46.739> but<00:02:47.010> you're<00:02:47.160> getting<00:02:47.370> basically<00:02:47.790> a

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
anyone but you're getting basically a

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.910 
anyone but you're getting basically a
little<00:02:48.150> little<00:02:48.390> loop<00:02:48.569> here<00:02:48.599> okay<00:02:49.560> then<00:02:49.739> from

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
little little loop here okay then from

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.309 
little little loop here okay then from
here<00:02:50.340> okay<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.630> want<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.810> pinch<00:02:52.049> right<00:02:52.260> here

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
here okay you want to pinch right here

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.430 
here okay you want to pinch right here
there's<00:02:52.890> these<00:02:53.130> three<00:02:53.459> pieces<00:02:54.079> okay<00:02:55.110> pinch

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
there's these three pieces okay pinch

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.449 
there's these three pieces okay pinch
these<00:02:55.620> together<00:02:57.500> okay<00:02:58.500> because<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:59.190> next

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
these together okay because the next

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.990 
these together okay because the next
step<00:02:59.670> you<00:02:59.819> want<00:02:59.849> to<00:03:00.030> do<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:01.340> bring<00:03:02.340> this<00:03:02.489> cord

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
step you want to do is bring this cord

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.130 
step you want to do is bring this cord
this<00:03:03.180> top<00:03:03.360> cord<00:03:04.010> down<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:06.440> around<00:03:07.730> okay<00:03:08.730> and

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
this top cord down and around okay and

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.630 
this top cord down and around okay and
then<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.200> want<00:03:10.379> to<00:03:10.410> do<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.709> just<00:03:10.860> by<00:03:11.400> pull

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
then you want to do is just by pull

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.039 
then you want to do is just by pull
making<00:03:11.970> each<00:03:12.150> one<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.420> these<00:03:12.510> loops<00:03:12.690> tight

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
making each one of these loops tight

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.759 
making each one of these loops tight
you're<00:03:13.860> going<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:14.040> keep<00:03:14.310> circling<00:03:15.019> okay<00:03:16.019> so

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
you're going to keep circling okay so

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.319 
you're going to keep circling okay so
now<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:16.950> got<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.489> free<00:03:17.670> strand<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.239> the

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
now you got the the free strand and the

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.740 
now you got the the free strand and the
loop<00:03:18.510> but<00:03:19.319> this<00:03:19.739> long<00:03:20.040> long<00:03:20.609> piece<00:03:20.910> here<00:03:21.269> you

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
loop but this long long piece here you

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.660 
loop but this long long piece here you
want<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:21.959> keep<00:03:22.109> circling<00:03:22.470> around<00:03:22.739> see<00:03:23.579> if<00:03:23.639> I

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
want to keep circling around see if I

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.509 
want to keep circling around see if I
can<00:03:23.790> bring<00:03:23.880> this<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.120> little<00:03:24.269> closer

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
can bring this a little closer

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.120 
can bring this a little closer
you<00:03:26.519> want<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.760> keep<00:03:26.880> looping<00:03:27.180> this<00:03:27.450> around

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
you want to keep looping this around

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.680 
you want to keep looping this around
okay<00:03:29.480> coming<00:03:30.480> up<00:03:30.599> towards<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.319> on<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.739> bottom

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.370 
sort of loops as you want okay and then
I'm<00:04:11.819> just<00:04:11.880> going<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.150> keep<00:04:12.239> continuing<00:04:12.389> till<00:04:13.349> I

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
I'm just going to keep continuing till I

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.099 
I'm just going to keep continuing till I
get<00:04:13.470> to<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.620> end<00:04:13.829> here<00:04:14.130> but<00:04:15.120> you<00:04:15.299> can<00:04:15.480> stop<00:04:15.959> at

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
get to the end here but you can stop at

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.219 
get to the end here but you can stop at
any<00:04:16.229> point<00:04:16.530> if<00:04:16.950> you<00:04:17.010> uh<00:04:17.690> like<00:04:18.690> let's<00:04:18.870> say<00:04:18.989> let's

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
any point if you uh like let's say let's

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.050 
any point if you uh like let's say let's
say<00:04:19.320> if<00:04:19.410> this<00:04:19.530> is<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.799> length<00:04:19.950> you<00:04:20.220> want<00:04:20.459> for

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
say if this is the length you want for

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.990 
say if this is the length you want for
this<00:04:21.180> then<00:04:21.989> I<00:04:22.169> do<00:04:22.229> stop<00:04:22.680> here<00:04:22.979> we<00:04:23.580> want<00:04:23.820> to<00:04:23.849> do

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
this then I do stop here we want to do

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.480 
this then I do stop here we want to do
is<00:04:24.870> speed<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.289> piece<00:04:25.860> you're<00:04:26.010> working<00:04:26.039> with

you want to feed that piece through the

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.140 
you want to feed that piece through the
loop<00:04:29.139> okay<00:04:31.530> like<00:04:32.530> that

forward and as you do so if you watch
this<00:04:54.160> loop<00:04:54.400> here<00:04:54.699> it's<00:04:55.419> going<00:04:55.570> to<00:04:55.630> get<00:04:55.720> tighter

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009 
this loop here it's going to get tighter

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:58.580 
this loop here it's going to get tighter
okay

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
okay

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.800 
okay
keep<00:04:59.590> doing<00:04:59.860> that<00:04:59.979> and<00:05:00.190> then<00:05:01.180> kind<00:05:01.419> of<00:05:01.479> pull<00:05:01.690> on

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
keep doing that and then kind of pull on

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.730 
keep doing that and then kind of pull on
this<00:05:01.930> one<00:05:02.430> this<00:05:03.430> longer<00:05:03.789> one<00:05:03.910> and<00:05:04.560> while<00:05:05.560> doing

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
this one this longer one and while doing

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.529 
this one this longer one and while doing
both<00:05:05.979> those<00:05:06.190> together<00:05:06.520> it's<00:05:07.120> good<00:05:07.270> tighten

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
both those together it's good tighten

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.710 
both those together it's good tighten
the<00:05:07.600> end<00:05:07.720> up<00:05:07.900> okay<00:05:08.910> so<00:05:09.910> then<00:05:10.060> you<00:05:10.180> have<00:05:10.360> your

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
the end up okay so then you have your

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.950 
the end up okay so then you have your

lanyard now to lesson lesson this size

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.430 
lanyard now to lesson lesson this size
loop<00:05:17.380> okay<00:05:18.280> you'll<00:05:19.210> be<00:05:19.300> pulling<00:05:19.570> one<00:05:20.260> of<00:05:20.380> the

loop okay you'll be pulling one of the

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.529 
loop okay you'll be pulling one of the
courts<00:05:20.800> and<00:05:21.070> this<00:05:21.250> is<00:05:21.370> just<00:05:21.550> by<00:05:21.669> trial<00:05:22.449> and

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
courts and this is just by trial and

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:23.700 
courts and this is just by trial and
error<00:05:22.660> this<00:05:22.870> happens<00:05:22.930> to<00:05:23.229> be<00:05:23.260> the<00:05:23.380> shorter

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
error this happens to be the shorter

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.430 
error this happens to be the shorter
cord<00:05:23.979> quote<00:05:24.430> shorter<00:05:24.910> ends<00:05:25.240> rather<00:05:25.539> by

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
cord quote shorter ends rather by

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.070 
cord quote shorter ends rather by
holding<00:05:26.889> this<00:05:27.039> and<00:05:27.280> sliding<00:05:28.180> this<00:05:28.810> whole

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
holding this and sliding this whole

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.920 
holding this and sliding this whole
piece<00:05:29.289> down<00:05:29.560> okay<00:05:30.490> you're<00:05:31.330> lessening<00:05:31.810> that

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
piece down okay you're lessening that

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.870 
piece down okay you're lessening that
loop<00:05:32.110> on<00:05:32.260> the<00:05:32.349> bottom<00:05:32.470> so<00:05:33.400> you<00:05:33.460> get<00:05:33.550> that<00:05:33.699> -

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
loop on the bottom so you get that -

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.480 
loop on the bottom so you get that -
whatever<00:05:34.090> whatever<00:05:34.930> size<00:05:35.320> you<00:05:35.530> like<00:05:35.560> whether

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
you want a big loop here or a very small

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.490 
you want a big loop here or a very small
loop<00:05:38.710> on<00:05:38.889> the<00:05:39.039> like<00:05:39.849> the<00:05:40.000> Sebenza<00:05:40.330> has<00:05:41.110> a<00:05:41.139> very

with okay let's say like this position
okay<00:05:51.010> and<00:05:51.340> then<00:05:52.090> very<00:05:52.690> simply<00:05:53.550> cut<00:05:54.550> cut<00:05:55.240> these

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
okay and then very simply cut cut these

very<00:06:21.370> very<00:06:21.430> simply<00:06:22.000> you<00:06:22.120> would<00:06:22.270> you<00:06:23.169> know<00:06:23.289> if

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380 
very very simply you would you know if

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.620 
very very simply you would you know if
it<00:06:23.470> was<00:06:23.590> mine<00:06:23.949> I<00:06:24.190> would<00:06:24.820> cut<00:06:25.030> it<00:06:25.060> probably

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
it was mine I would cut it probably

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.480 
it was mine I would cut it probably
right<00:06:25.780> here<00:06:26.020> and<00:06:26.169> then<00:06:26.889> just<00:06:26.919> like<00:06:27.220> I'm<00:06:27.340> out<00:06:27.460> of

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
right here and then just like I'm out of

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.219 
right here and then just like I'm out of
the<00:06:27.610> video<00:06:27.849> you<00:06:28.150> would<00:06:28.210> just<00:06:28.389> burn<00:06:28.870> the<00:06:29.020> ends

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:29.229 
the video you would just burn the ends
