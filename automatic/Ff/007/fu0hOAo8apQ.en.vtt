00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
it for the gaming challenge but the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.729 
it for the gaming challenge but the
thing<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.600> Nuzlocke<00:00:55.020> challenges<00:00:55.559> have

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
thing is the Nuzlocke challenges have

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.400 
thing is the Nuzlocke challenges have
become<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.430> commonplace<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.449> YouTube<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.170> I

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
become so commonplace on YouTube that I

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.990 
become so commonplace on YouTube that I
felt<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.190> had<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.520> do<00:00:59.609> something

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
felt like I had to do something

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.250 
felt like I had to do something
different<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.050> what<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.320> did<00:01:01.739> was<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.609> took<00:01:03.260> two

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
different so what I did was I took two

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.020 
different so what I did was I took two
emulators<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.250> hooked<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.549> up<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.000> I

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
emulators and I hooked it up so that I

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.520 
emulators and I hooked it up so that I
could<00:01:06.299> actually<00:01:06.479> play<00:01:06.869> both<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.140> them<00:01:07.350> at<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
could actually play both of them at the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.649 
could actually play both of them at the
same<00:01:07.710> time<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.280> if<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.430> were<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.580> hit<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.390> right

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
same time so if I were to hit the right

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.719 
same time so if I were to hit the right
direction<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:10.920> one<00:01:11.100> controller<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.490> would<00:01:11.640> hit

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
direction on one controller I would hit

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.149 
direction on one controller I would hit
it<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:11.880> both<00:01:12.119> games<00:01:12.540> if<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.900> hit<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.200> hit<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:13.979> both

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
it on both games if I hit a hit on both

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.679 
it on both games if I hit a hit on both
games<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> challenge<00:01:15.600> was

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
games and so on so the challenge was

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.420 
games and so on so the challenge was
basically<00:01:16.049> doing<00:01:16.320> two<00:01:16.470> games<00:01:16.920> at<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> same

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
basically doing two games at the same

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.760 
basically doing two games at the same
time<00:01:17.729> now<00:01:18.540> if<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.810> guys<00:01:18.960> have<00:01:19.200> seen<00:01:19.470> my

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
time now if you guys have seen my

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.910 
time now if you guys have seen my
original<00:01:20.900> firered<00:01:21.900> Nuzlocke<00:01:22.380> series<00:01:22.740> you

original firered Nuzlocke series you

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.249 
original firered Nuzlocke series you
know<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:24.030> editing<00:01:24.390> style<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.750> did<00:01:25.080> for

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
know that the editing style I did for

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.870 
know that the editing style I did for
that<00:01:25.380> was<00:01:25.560> very<00:01:25.799> very<00:01:26.040> fast-paced<00:01:26.549> I

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
that was very very fast-paced I

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.310 
that was very very fast-paced I
essentially<00:01:27.240> took<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.720> three<00:01:28.049> or<00:01:28.080> four

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
essentially took like a three or four

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.469 
essentially took like a three or four
hour<00:01:28.439> livestream<00:01:28.880> condensed<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.000> down<00:01:30.030> into

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
hour livestream condensed it down into

the challenge of controlling two games

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.980 
the challenge of controlling two games
with<00:02:41.580> one<00:02:41.670> controller<00:02:41.970> it's<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.450> lot<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.780> fun<00:02:42.960> I

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
with one controller it's a lot of fun I

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.660 
with one controller it's a lot of fun I
really<00:02:43.500> enjoyed<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.070> I<00:02:44.160> think<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.490> worked

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
really enjoyed it and I think it worked

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.100 
really enjoyed it and I think it worked
very<00:02:44.970> well<00:02:45.060> for<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.420> stream<00:02:45.630> people<00:02:45.930> seem<00:02:46.080> to

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
very well for the stream people seem to

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.840 
very well for the stream people seem to
enjoy<00:02:46.350> it<00:02:46.470> people<00:02:47.190> seem<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.340> have<00:02:47.520> a<00:02:47.550> good<00:02:47.700> time

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
enjoy it people seem to have a good time

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.150 
enjoy it people seem to have a good time
with<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.090> but<00:02:48.840> as<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:49.200> was<00:02:49.320> editing<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.830> trying

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
with it but as I was editing it trying

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.760 
with it but as I was editing it trying
to<00:02:50.310> trim<00:02:50.490> it<00:02:50.610> down<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:51.330> just<00:02:51.390> became<00:02:51.870> so<00:02:52.320> hard

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
to trim it down it just became so hard

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.460 
to trim it down it just became so hard
to<00:02:52.980> watch<00:02:53.190> because<00:02:53.870> it's<00:02:54.870> hard<00:02:55.110> enough<00:02:55.200> to

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
to watch because it's hard enough to

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.770 
to watch because it's hard enough to
follow<00:02:55.680> one<00:02:56.010> game<00:02:56.220> with<00:02:56.370> that<00:02:56.490> fast<00:02:56.760> style<00:02:57.120> but

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
follow one game with that fast style but

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.660 
follow one game with that fast style but
once<00:02:57.960> those<00:02:58.140> two<00:02:58.440> games<00:02:58.680> on-screen<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.430> just

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
once those two games on-screen it just

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.580 
once those two games on-screen it just
it<00:03:00.180> was<00:03:00.360> pretty<00:03:00.540> much<00:03:00.690> unwatchable<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.410> just

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
it was pretty much unwatchable I just

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.570 
it was pretty much unwatchable I just
couldn't<00:03:01.890> make<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.040> work

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
couldn't make it work

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.520 
couldn't make it work
that's<00:03:02.910> why<00:03:03.060> I<00:03:03.090> spent<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:03.630> long<00:03:03.810> editing<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.410> I

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
that's why I spent so long editing it I

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.960 
that's why I spent so long editing it I
mean<00:03:04.680> one<00:03:04.830> because<00:03:05.100> it's<00:03:05.250> just<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.520> high

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
mean one because it's just a high

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.570

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
whole big chunk of the video didn't like

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.740 
whole big chunk of the video didn't like
it<00:03:10.770> so<00:03:10.800> I<00:03:10.920> scrapped<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.520> tried<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.180> again<00:03:12.510> try

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750

to<00:03:12.780> make<00:03:13.050> it<00:03:13.200> watchable<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:13.710> it's<00:03:13.830> just<00:03:14.010> it

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
to make it watchable in it's just it

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.770

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
going on it's too hard to follow because

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.699 
going on it's too hard to follow because
you<00:03:18.390> know<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:18.600> pop<00:03:18.780> up<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:19.050> thing<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.440> have<00:03:19.680> a

you know you pop up a thing you have a

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.010 
you know you pop up a thing you have a
clip<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:20.340> shows<00:03:20.489> up<00:03:21.180> for<00:03:21.300> like<00:03:21.420> two<00:03:21.600> seconds

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
clip that shows up for like two seconds

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.630 
clip that shows up for like two seconds
and<00:03:22.170> then<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.680> goes<00:03:22.830> away<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.370> it's<00:03:23.489> like

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
and then it goes away and it's like

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.890 
and then it goes away and it's like
people<00:03:23.940> might<00:03:24.209> be<00:03:24.330> looking<00:03:24.570> at<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.750> wrong

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.420 
there is a particular series
I've<00:04:28.110> been<00:04:28.229> asking<00:04:28.590> for<00:04:28.770> pretty<00:04:29.009> much<00:04:29.099> since

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
I've been asking for pretty much since

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.640 
I've been asking for pretty much since
the<00:04:29.550> original<00:04:30.000> two<00:04:30.150> years<00:04:30.389> ago<00:04:30.660> and<00:04:31.080> that<00:04:31.500> is

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
the original two years ago and that is

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.230 
the original two years ago and that is
you<00:04:31.800> guys<00:04:31.949> wanted<00:04:32.310> to<00:04:32.370> see<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.550> randomizer

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
you guys wanted to see a randomizer

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.809 
you guys wanted to see a randomizer
nuzlocke<00:04:33.780> for<00:04:34.020> pokemon<00:04:34.440> emerald<00:04:34.710> so<00:04:35.610> I<00:04:35.639> think

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819 
nuzlocke for pokemon emerald so I think

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:37.999 
nuzlocke for pokemon emerald so I think
I<00:04:36.300> might<00:04:36.599> do<00:04:36.780> that<00:04:36.840> instead<00:04:37.410> we<00:04:37.560> can<00:04:37.680> take<00:04:37.889> it

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
I might do that instead we can take it

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.460 
I might do that instead we can take it
back<00:04:38.160> down<00:04:38.370> to<00:04:38.550> one<00:04:38.699> game<00:04:38.910> and<00:04:39.210> we<00:04:40.110> could<00:04:40.289> just

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
back down to one game and we could just

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.290 
back down to one game and we could just
do<00:04:40.800> that<00:04:40.979> so<00:04:41.250> I<00:04:41.370> think<00:04:41.520> what<00:04:41.819> I'm<00:04:41.910> going<00:04:42.030> to<00:04:42.120> do

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
do that so I think what I'm going to do

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.540 
do that so I think what I'm going to do
is<00:04:42.509> next<00:04:43.199> Saturday<00:04:43.530> or<00:04:43.710> this<00:04:43.889> coming<00:04:44.130> Saturday

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
I'm going to do the stream for part one

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.950 
I'm going to do the stream for part one
of<00:04:46.830> emerald<00:04:47.340> and<00:04:47.460> then<00:04:47.699> next<00:04:48.030> Sunday<00:04:48.240> so<00:04:48.660> seven

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
edited down I've done one game before I

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.110 
edited down I've done one game before I
know<00:04:55.560> I<00:04:55.740> can<00:04:55.979> make<00:04:56.099> that<00:04:56.280> work<00:04:56.520> I<00:04:56.789> know<00:04:56.849> it's

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
know I can make that work I know it's

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.180 
know I can make that work I know it's
gonna<00:04:57.210> be<00:04:57.300> fun<00:04:57.569> so<00:04:58.229> I'd<00:04:58.380> really<00:04:58.680> think<00:04:58.800> that's

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
gonna be fun so I'd really think that's

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.249 
gonna be fun so I'd really think that's
the<00:04:59.340> better<00:04:59.490> option<00:04:59.880> I<00:05:00.030> think<00:05:00.389> the<00:05:00.509> reason<00:05:00.990> why

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
the better option I think the reason why

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.279 
the better option I think the reason why
I<00:05:01.289> did<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:01.740> two<00:05:01.919> games<00:05:02.159> to<00:05:02.370> begin<00:05:02.610> with<00:05:02.759> is<00:05:03.289> so

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
I did the two games to begin with is so

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:05.689 
I did the two games to begin with is so
many<00:05:04.440> people<00:05:04.800> do<00:05:04.949> those<00:05:05.099> likes<00:05:05.370> it's<00:05:05.550> such<00:05:05.669> a

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
many people do those likes it's such a

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.120 
many people do those likes it's such a
common<00:05:06.060> challenge<00:05:06.360> nowadays<00:05:06.930> that<00:05:07.289> I<00:05:07.530> felt

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
common challenge nowadays that I felt

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.680 
common challenge nowadays that I felt
like<00:05:08.220> I<00:05:08.430> had<00:05:08.580> to<00:05:08.729> do<00:05:08.819> something<00:05:09.150> different<00:05:09.569> but

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
like I had to do something different but

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.089 
like I had to do something different but
now<00:05:09.870> that<00:05:10.050> I<00:05:10.080> have<00:05:10.229> kind<00:05:10.500> of<00:05:10.530> taken<00:05:10.680> a<00:05:10.889> step

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
now that I have kind of taken a step

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:12.950 
now that I have kind of taken a step
back<00:05:11.310> and<00:05:11.460> really<00:05:11.669> looked<00:05:11.849> at<00:05:12.000> it<00:05:12.030> I<00:05:12.330> kind<00:05:12.870> of

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
back and really looked at it I kind of

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.749 
back and really looked at it I kind of
realized<00:05:13.349> that<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:14.220> difference<00:05:14.639> in

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
realized that the difference in

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.610 
realized that the difference in
presentation<00:05:15.449> the<00:05:15.569> way<00:05:15.750> that<00:05:15.960> I<00:05:15.990> edit<00:05:16.349> it<00:05:16.470> is

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
presentation the way that I edit it is

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.469 
presentation the way that I edit it is
so<00:05:17.280> much<00:05:17.400> different<00:05:17.849> from<00:05:18.000> everyone<00:05:18.210> else

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
so much different from everyone else

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.330 
so much different from everyone else
already<00:05:18.720> then<00:05:19.199> I<00:05:19.229> really<00:05:19.590> don't<00:05:19.620> need<00:05:19.979> to<00:05:20.039> have

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
already then I really don't need to have

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.100 
already then I really don't need to have
these<00:05:20.550> ridiculous<00:05:20.970> challenges<00:05:21.630> I<00:05:21.810> could<00:05:21.960> just

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
these ridiculous challenges I could just

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.040 
these ridiculous challenges I could just
do<00:05:22.229> more<00:05:22.979> standard<00:05:23.430> challenge<00:05:23.819> but<00:05:24.569> make<00:05:24.900> it

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
do more standard challenge but make it

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.779 
do more standard challenge but make it
my<00:05:25.169> own<00:05:25.199> which<00:05:25.590> is<00:05:25.620> what<00:05:25.860> I'm<00:05:25.949> good<00:05:26.130> at<00:05:26.159> so<00:05:26.550> I

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
my own which is what I'm good at so I

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.790 
my own which is what I'm good at so I
think<00:05:27.270> that<00:05:27.810> this<00:05:28.020> is<00:05:28.169> gonna<00:05:28.289> work<00:05:28.590> out<00:05:28.770> I

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
think that this is gonna work out I

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.050 
think that this is gonna work out I
think<00:05:28.919> it's<00:05:29.159> gonna<00:05:29.280> make<00:05:29.430> for<00:05:29.610> a<00:05:29.639> better<00:05:29.819> video

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
think it's gonna make for a better video

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.830 
think it's gonna make for a better video
series<00:05:30.539> and<00:05:30.750> I'd<00:05:31.110> rather<00:05:31.319> do<00:05:31.560> this<00:05:31.770> than<00:05:32.099> have

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
series and I'd rather do this than have

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.779 
series and I'd rather do this than have
like<00:05:33.840> 200<00:05:34.500> hours<00:05:34.740> spent<00:05:35.039> on<00:05:35.130> a<00:05:35.190> series<00:05:35.550> I'm<00:05:35.669> not

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
like 200 hours spent on a series I'm not

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.790 
like 200 hours spent on a series I'm not
happy<00:05:36.000> with<00:05:36.180> and<00:05:36.360> have<00:05:36.539> you<00:05:37.110> know<00:05:37.229> five<00:05:37.440> or<00:05:37.500> six

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
happy with and have you know five or six

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.800 
happy with and have you know five or six
videos<00:05:38.159> that<00:05:38.699> I<00:05:38.729> just<00:05:39.150> don't<00:05:39.300> think<00:05:39.509> are<00:05:39.630> good

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
videos that I just don't think are good

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.899 
videos that I just don't think are good
so<00:05:40.110> I<00:05:40.320> think<00:05:40.830> this<00:05:41.099> is<00:05:41.280> the<00:05:41.370> better<00:05:41.520> choice<00:05:41.580> for

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
so I think this is the better choice for

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.310 
so I think this is the better choice for
the<00:05:41.969> channel<00:05:42.300> I'm<00:05:42.479> sorry<00:05:42.900> if<00:05:43.020> anyone's
