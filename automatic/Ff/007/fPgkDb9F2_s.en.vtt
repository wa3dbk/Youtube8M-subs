00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Hello youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.420
 new technique sloth video in this 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.210
 envelope here are several parts in it 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.139
 me now interested only first 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.250
 that as here namely a sim cards 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.440
 adapter set 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.060
 you can see it's easy 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.520
 Ripped up because I was straight 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.020
 In the video before so hated image was there 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.510
 I have to save nothing more 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.279
 I did something here again 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.660
 I invested a few euros 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.420
 really just a few and I've got it 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.579
 such a complete set indulged so far 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.940
 I always have that in my own glue 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.059
 instruction me so adapter tinkered or 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.399
 it has not as necessary now I am 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.780
 but sorry and want to stop it 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.280
 have a complete set 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.570
 You do not have much money 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.430
 spend those are just a few 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.469
 plastic stencils are already there 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.840
 manufacturer or distributor on ebay the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.149
 dinger for a few cents so flog 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.820
 More than 1 234 euro would have to 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.320
 no fall in such a way on the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.989
 back then give the still here 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.530
 how to make everything there 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.379
 can 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.210
 because while the generation of the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.260
 big sim-card devices so slow 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.110
 the manufacturer always dies out 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.060
 continue to have micro sim cards set 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.509
 catch the first here now 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:23.369
 outside of apple and put on 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.020
 the nano sim cards is so ideal 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.540
 it then so that the mobile service providers 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.030
 would go and only a sim card 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.070
 offer for everything say a small one 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.409
 a small nano sim card chip in the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.049
 adapter for the micro sim card in one 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.939
 adapter for normal sized sim card i 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.570
 faith plus begins so slowly now 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.399
 but the others are there in the 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.040
 usually the choice between a normal 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.770
 great sim card where then directly 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.360
 the micro sim card with it is the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.979
 then you can solve it then you have 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.200
 the micro sim card for his device and 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.490
 when you return to normal sized sim 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.710
 card then you need to pack in the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.600
 adapter and has then again that's 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.369
 the one variant or one says at 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.049
 manufacturer of the mobile service provider i 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.939
 need the nano sim card then get 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.409
 you only have a nano sim card if you are 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.509
 but then falls back on what has a 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.180
 micro card slot has or normal sized 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.760
 slot well then you need this here 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.409
 adapter 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.709
 or have shares somehow something 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:19.349
 home-made flying around and now 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:24.579
 Let's have a look at this plastic 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:26.019
 kladderadatsch once at 123 wonderful 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.000
 nice little plastic parts you 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.860
 can lose nicely if you are not there 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.110
 watch out and now I have mine here 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.760
 plastic border there comes to the nano 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.269
 I would have sim card here then 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.810
 directly my micro sim card and then 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:46.359
 I have two bigger ones here 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.980
 variants for the big sim card 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.659
 means here I could direct the 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.849
 nano sim card and I have a 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:54.489
 big or here comes the micro-sim 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.769
 pure or probably the funniest 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.530
 Variant in the micro simcard adapter 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:02.769
 just pack the nano sim card and then 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.049
 adapter in adapter with card in here 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.269
 if that fits really nicely yes 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.489
 smooth out if you can see it this way 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.680
 So that stop card in the card is that 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.459
 works here too, why do 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.769
 I like the whole thing because I'll have another one right away 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.349
 new nano sim card but has come 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.650
 into a device for a micro sim card 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.720
 and then I can test it directly 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.230
 that's a standard bigger one 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.260
 open cards opener i do not believe 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.449
 Many nano sim cards trace exactly how 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.459
 here it does not fit in 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.889
 so not too big otherwise 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.549
 because you make it so ugly 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:43.569
 further extension to your device at 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.650
 iphone since we have one more 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.989
 nano card in it 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.269
 Look there would fit in the thing 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.930
 where it will probably be again 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.599
 it gets complicated if he probably does 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.150
 here so nexus 5 they really have 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.799
 so very small fine opening there 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.810
 I would not be part of it then 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.180
 try not to drill because he would have 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.940
 really something very small or am 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.579
 best of course the original opening 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.739
 Part of the first impression of the thing I 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.989
 I think now have 23 euros here 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:14.199
 including shipping get paid three 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.690
 plastic card fits so I have more 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:18.370
 since not expected and I say 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.289
 now many thanks for bullet to look 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.060
 and in the next video you will see 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.270
 already what I intend to do until then 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.270
 bye
