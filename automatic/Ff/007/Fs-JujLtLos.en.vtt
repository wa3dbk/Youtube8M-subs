00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 the working conditions at metal gear 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.799
 solid 5 no mobbing in the new dom and 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.059
 a new extension for the star 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.620
 frauscher internet i am michael 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.620
 Obermeier and that are the news today 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.279
 always is not officially known why 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.740
 metal gear solid inventor hideo kojima 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.039
 wants to leave his employer konami 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.380
 but now there is a clue 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.519
 namely that for konami to work the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.660
 be hell 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.550
 This is reported by the Japanese magazine 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.760
 nikkei and explains that konami 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.739
 unusual for the industry puts that 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.450
 to pause the employees and to 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.489
 start of work and end of work one and 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.410
 stamp out and also the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.670
 filmed all day by video cameras 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.440
 then who in the too long 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.539
 lunch break stays or yourself 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.100
 otherwise considered inefficient 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.850
 Employee he knows that will be punished 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.149
 awakening with assembly line work or 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.660
 the cleaning of the house 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.039
 fitness area not only 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.989
 lower employees but also 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.789
 have caught senior staff 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.409
 So various producers that already there 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.170
 Among other things, they had to work for such things 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.970
 trivialities like the facebook posting 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.380
 a colleague who said he was too 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.950
 one competition for a change 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.030
 geliked and zack wachdienst or 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.790
 cleaning service so we imagine the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.790
 work at konami about this way 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.040
 until april 2015, the development of 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.170
 by the way, according to Nikkei 80 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.270
 That's what millions of dollars have cost 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.910
 no pinnacle but in development 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.410
 from opel play no new record 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.240
 the development is almost completed 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.250
 in september metal gear solid 5 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.150
 then appear in the beginning of september for the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.770
 consoles ps3 360 and xbox one and then 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.770
 middle september for the pc 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.910
 Blum will turn the cards editor stepmap 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.720
 support but apart from that 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.340
 no modding allow the explained 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.070
 mainland pete hines in interview with the 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.770
 website dark side of gaming with stepmap 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.780
 can be made manageable inside 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.120
 design levels and then with script 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.340
 provide large scale outdoor areas 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.130
 there is not but can not stepmap 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.450
 What can not be are your own textures 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.880
 So one will support only on the 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.680
 text clock pool can access the with 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.720
 you are included that has a reason 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.120
 according to bbe firmer the snap files 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.860
 small files remain so that all 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.540
 players use the same textures 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.800
 because not big own textures around 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.590
 have to be copied 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.060
 bistum appears and this will be in 2016 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.380
 But be it could well be that in 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.840
 solid again there again and 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.730
 back rowing, because otherwise we would be so 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.180
 a nonsense like this no longer 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.180
 to get 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.230
 chip is stretched so shipwrecked is called the 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.140
 latest single player extension for 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.459
 the survival game donzdorf and there turns 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.230
 everything as the name implies 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.239
 the shipping or at least the 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.280
 the navigation tries the extension 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.940
 delivers new characters to new creatures 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.800
 new flower and new seasonal 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.180
 seasons weather effects developed 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.400
 that's not by kley alone but 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.140
 together with the indie team from happy 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.440
 The whole thing should be in the fall for 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.360
 pc mac and linux appear that was it 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.920
 from me from the studio of the news 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.440
 Tomorrow 's the news with and again 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.450
 my colleague sebastian rod off 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.580
 Wednesday, I greet you then from the 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.350
 gamescom in cologne shows you in the morning 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.269

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.209
 in the halt would be glad if you 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.570
 So one turns on until the next 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.560
 times 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.560
 continue to play 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.069
 nope
