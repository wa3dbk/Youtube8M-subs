00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.269

 see all the bases of this contest 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.750
 that I really found it very funny and 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.490
 it's about finding a salmon in a 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.080
 website so do not forget here 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.330

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.650

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.480

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.090
 be competitive fishing salmon 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.640
 but good let's start today I'll bring you some 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.770
 animals that I found out there that neither I 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.920
 I think they are real and this 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.949
 animal is that you did not know that they exist 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.800
 the tarantula goliat my god I do not know you 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.870
 but I hate spiders give me like a 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.879
 dread and this little tarantula is 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.620
 considered the largest in the world 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.750
 I really do not know why the name is 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.530
 goliat but when it feels threatened 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.530
 he rubs his hands 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.330
 the squid of humboldt this squid me 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.190
 It looked very nice and is one of the most 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.840
 of the world and several times it has 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.490
 documented how it attacks humans 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.409
 but what impressed him most about this 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.840
 giant squid is that it has like 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.190
 suckers or suckers and on the arm that 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.009
 it becomes super super-mortal flyfly or 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.190
 res what impressed me the most about this 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.560
 horrible fly is that its larvae that is 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.420
 how their eggs survive on the skin of 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.700
 any mammal also in the skin of 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.830
 humans so it's likely that in your 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.020
 house there is a fly and you plant your 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.670
 eggs in your arm and then there grow 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.990
 more flies of these the coconut crab 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.399
 despite its impressive form situates 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.979
 This animal is not characterized by 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.229
 attack humans but he eats 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.149
 plants and eat fruits what 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.160
 characterizes is that it is very good climbing 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.550
 trees and then I imagine that eating 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.520
 coconuts 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.800
 and the irukandji jellyfish this jellyfish 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.110
 despite being very pretty and very small 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.790
 is lethal, so if it stings you can 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.910
 get to kill you so be careful 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.440
 road snakes even though 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.080
 it has been proven that they do not attack 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.760
 human beings I can not imagine seeing a nest 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.350
 of this type of snake here is the 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.510
 photo mole rat naked this photo is not 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.160
 It's a picture of your mother-in-law in the morning 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.020
 This rat is very common in Africa 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.730
 oriental and what characterizes this 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.430
 rat is the similarity it has with your 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.240
 younger sister the vampire bat 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.060
 that's it is not a horror story there are 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.130
 the vampires this little animal house of 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.520
 night and there have been cases that have 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.459
 hunted human the wasps you kill 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.860
 cicadas despite their horrible appearance 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.230
 I'm very afraid of bees and 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.360
 the wasps for their little sting quoted 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.160
 these wasps are not offensive to the 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.230
 human beings but otherwise we 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.480
 help keep excess in check 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.280
 of cicadas in the world thanks wasp 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.790
 you kill cicadas 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.890
 the valley is not there is not a picture of your ex 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.450
 or maybe it is this peculiar 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.790
 animal can be found in the 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.450
 island of madagascar there is like to move it 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.980
 move this little animal what 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.540
 they related a lot to death and it's 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.400
 that is why it is in danger of extinction 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.410
 but it is harmless to beings 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.170
 human nothing else is quite peculiar 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.450
 so if you see a there or your ex not what 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.690
