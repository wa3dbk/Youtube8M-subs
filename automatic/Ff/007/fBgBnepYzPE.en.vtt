distance automatically one of the nice

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.900 
distance automatically one of the nice
things<00:02:17.110> is<00:02:17.530> your<00:02:17.769> very<00:02:18.100> accurate<00:02:18.670> with<00:02:18.790> this

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
things is your very accurate with this

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.789 
things is your very accurate with this
type<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.090> estimating<00:02:19.660> man<00:02:20.110> this<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:20.500> just

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
type of estimating man this is just

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.360 
type of estimating man this is just
insane<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:23.470> will<00:02:23.709> change<00:02:23.890> our<00:02:24.160> life

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
you know what we're gonna give it a shot

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.140 
you know what we're gonna give it a shot
no<00:02:26.650> you're<00:02:27.040> gonna<00:02:27.160> give<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.489> a<00:02:27.519> shot<00:02:27.549> I'm<00:02:27.970> gonna

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
no you're gonna give it a shot I'm gonna

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.849 
no you're gonna give it a shot I'm gonna
give<00:02:28.359> it<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.510> shot<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:28.989> you're<00:02:29.290> gonna<00:02:29.380> see<00:02:29.680> that

give it a shot and you're gonna see that

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.030 
give it a shot and you're gonna see that
you're<00:02:30.010> gonna<00:02:30.160> wind<00:02:30.400> up<00:02:30.519> using<00:02:30.760> it

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
you're gonna wind up using it

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.560 
you're gonna wind up using it
Darla<00:02:33.040> always<00:02:33.370> do<00:02:33.490> an<00:02:33.580> estimate<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:34.180> if<00:02:34.360> I

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
Darla always do an estimate so if I

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.170 
Darla always do an estimate so if I
could<00:02:34.750> pull<00:02:34.960> off<00:02:35.250> doing<00:02:36.250> this<00:02:36.460> bid<00:02:36.850> with<00:02:37.060> the

could pull off doing this bid with the

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.120 
could pull off doing this bid with the
software<00:02:37.630> at<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:37.990> fraction<00:02:38.290> of<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.710> time<00:02:38.740> it's

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
software at a fraction of the time it's

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.120 
software at a fraction of the time it's
taken<00:02:39.190> him<00:02:39.520> to<00:02:39.790> do<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.060> same<00:02:40.360> exact<00:02:40.840> big<00:02:41.140> then

taken him to do the same exact big then

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.090 
taken him to do the same exact big then
maybe<00:02:42.370> I'll<00:02:42.640> convince<00:02:42.970> them<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.210> use<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:47.100> 45

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
maybe I'll convince them to use it 45

will it might take me a little bit
longer<00:03:22.450> do<00:03:23.020> estimates<00:03:23.380> my<00:03:23.710> way<00:03:23.950> but<00:03:24.610> at<00:03:24.760> the

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
longer do estimates my way but at the

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.700 
longer do estimates my way but at the
end<00:03:24.910> of<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.180> day<00:03:25.360> I<00:03:25.600> know<00:03:25.780> it's<00:03:26.080> done<00:03:26.290> right<00:03:28.710> so

uh do you have the stuff what stuff the
estimates<00:03:33.420> I've<00:03:34.420> been<00:03:34.630> waiting<00:03:34.810> all<00:03:35.200> day<00:03:35.230> to

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
estimates I've been waiting all day to

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.890 
estimates I've been waiting all day to
compare<00:03:36.460> the<00:03:36.580> two<00:03:36.760> estimates<00:03:37.180> that<00:03:37.330> Polanco

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
compare the two estimates that Polanco

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.930 
compare the two estimates that Polanco
and<00:03:37.990> I<00:03:38.050> were<00:03:38.200> working<00:03:38.380> on<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:38.710> day<00:03:38.950> before<00:03:39.370> let's

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
and I were working on a day before let's

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.390 
and I were working on a day before let's
see<00:03:40.090> where<00:03:40.240> your<00:03:40.420> numbers<00:03:40.840> came<00:03:41.020> out<00:03:41.400> see

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
see where your numbers came out see

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.820 
see where your numbers came out see
where<00:03:42.580> mine<00:03:42.790> came<00:03:43.060> out<00:03:43.260> look<00:03:44.260> how<00:03:44.350> beautiful

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
where mine came out look how beautiful

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.530 
where mine came out look how beautiful
this<00:03:44.920> is<00:03:44.980> as<00:03:45.250> well<00:03:45.430> but<00:03:45.820> everything's<00:03:46.300> broken

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
this is as well but everything's broken

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.750 
this is as well but everything's broken
down<00:03:46.870> nicenice<00:03:47.500> look<00:03:48.070> at<00:03:48.190> mine<00:03:48.340> my<00:03:48.490> little

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
down nicenice look at mine my little

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.520 
down nicenice look at mine my little
brokenness<00:03:49.090> look<00:03:49.750> at<00:03:49.840> this<00:03:49.930> late<00:03:50.230> you<00:03:50.440> got

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
brokenness look at this late you got

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.140 
brokenness look at this late you got
this<00:03:50.740> you<00:03:50.800> got<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.130> pie<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.610> I<00:03:51.850> don't<00:03:52.060> have

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
this you got the pie and I don't have

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.940 
this you got the pie and I don't have
the<00:03:52.270> sections<00:03:52.720> 2<00:03:52.840> pi<00:03:53.050> I'll<00:03:53.350> definitely<00:03:53.560> admit

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
the sections 2 pi I'll definitely admit

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.860 
the sections 2 pi I'll definitely admit
JD's<00:03:54.400> estimate<00:03:54.970> was<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.120> lot<00:03:55.330> prettier<00:03:55.720> than

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
JD's estimate was a lot prettier than

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.080 
JD's estimate was a lot prettier than
mine<00:03:56.170> but<00:03:56.620> what<00:03:56.920> really<00:03:57.130> matters<00:03:57.640> is<00:03:57.790> the
