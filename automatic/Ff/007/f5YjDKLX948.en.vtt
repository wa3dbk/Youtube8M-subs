00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
color pencils I just really like my

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.360

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
going to kind of line it up with the

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.250 
going to kind of line it up with the
bottom<00:02:52.250> right<00:02:52.520> corner<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.300> you'll<00:02:53.840> see<00:02:54.080> why

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:05.949 
bottom right corner and you'll see why
in<00:02:54.560> just<00:02:54.710> a<00:02:54.920> second

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.349 

so<00:03:06.620> my<00:03:06.769> name<00:03:06.950> is<00:03:07.069> pretty<00:03:07.280> easy<00:03:07.609> because<00:03:08.090> it

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
quinn's only has one of each letter so

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.069

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
since I only have one T and none of

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.069 
since I only have one T and none of
these<00:03:28.459> letters<00:03:28.819> are<00:03:28.969> exactly<00:03:29.569> the<00:03:29.750> same<00:03:29.930> with

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
these letters are exactly the same with

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.509 
these letters are exactly the same with
is<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.409> T<00:03:30.560> what<00:03:30.799> you're<00:03:30.889> gonna<00:03:31.010> see<00:03:31.189> me<00:03:31.310> do<00:03:31.430> is

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
is the T what you're gonna see me do is

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.599 
is the T what you're gonna see me do is
I<00:03:31.609> grab<00:03:31.819> the<00:03:31.969> F<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:32.510> I'm<00:03:33.170> lining<00:03:33.530> up<00:03:33.859> the<00:03:34.280> left

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
I grab the F and I'm lining up the left

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.000 
I grab the F and I'm lining up the left
side<00:03:35.000> so<00:03:35.659> I<00:03:35.719> know<00:03:35.870> where<00:03:36.290> that<00:03:36.439> left<00:03:36.650> side<00:03:36.859> is

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
side so I know where that left side is

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.800 
side so I know where that left side is
and<00:03:37.280> then<00:03:37.459> I'm<00:03:37.579> gonna<00:03:37.790> line<00:03:38.060> up<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.359> corner<00:03:38.659> of

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
and then I'm gonna line up the corner of

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.069 
and then I'm gonna line up the corner of
the<00:03:38.930> T<00:03:39.139> and<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.970> reason<00:03:41.329> I'm<00:03:41.480> doing<00:03:41.629> this<00:03:41.750> is

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
the T and the reason I'm doing this is

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.990 
the T and the reason I'm doing this is
since<00:03:42.620> I'm<00:03:42.739> lining<00:03:43.010> it<00:03:43.250> up<00:03:43.370> with<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.669> right

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
since I'm lining it up with the right

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.059 
since I'm lining it up with the right
side<00:03:44.269> of<00:03:44.389> my<00:03:44.419> paper<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:45.049> really<00:03:45.409> need<00:03:45.590> that<00:03:45.620> last

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
side of my paper I really need that last

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.179 
side of my paper I really need that last
letter<00:03:46.370> in<00:03:46.639> there<00:03:46.900> so<00:03:47.900> it's<00:03:48.139> better<00:03:48.349> to<00:03:48.439> to

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:49.189 
letter in there so it's better to to

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:51.610 
letter in there so it's better to to
have<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.609> one<00:03:49.849> and<00:03:50.120> fill<00:03:50.480> in<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:51.019> first<00:03:51.200> team

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
have that one and fill in the first team

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.709 
have that one and fill in the first team
rather<00:03:52.159> than<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:52.609> other<00:03:52.760> way<00:03:52.849> around<00:03:54.879> so<00:03:55.879> this

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:56.719 
rather than the other way around so this

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:58.780 
rather than the other way around so this
has<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.290> spacing<00:03:57.769> right<00:03:57.889> and<00:03:58.129> I<00:03:58.189> can<00:03:58.400> just<00:03:58.549> go

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
has the spacing right and I can just go

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.649 
has the spacing right and I can just go
in<00:03:59.030> and<00:03:59.299> fill<00:04:00.019> in<00:04:00.200> that<00:04:00.230> other<00:04:00.560> T<00:04:01.419> is<00:04:02.419> there's

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
in and fill in that other T is there's

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:09.849 
in and fill in that other T is there's
enough<00:04:03.319> space<00:04:03.500> left<00:04:03.829> for<00:04:08.290> now<00:04:09.290> I'm<00:04:09.409> using<00:04:09.469> the

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
enough space left for now I'm using the

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.979 
enough space left for now I'm using the
