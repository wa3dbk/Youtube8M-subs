till 99 which is a couple hours but yeah
i<00:01:00.030> might<00:01:00.449> do<00:01:00.870> construction<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.530> between<00:01:01.829> but

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
i might do construction in between but

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.969 
i might do construction in between but
we'll<00:01:02.460> see<00:01:02.640> for<00:01:02.789> now<00:01:02.989> another<00:01:03.989> 98<00:01:04.470> skills<00:01:04.830> in

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
construction and the breeze could be

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.260 
construction and the breeze could be
something<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.220> i<00:01:11.340> get<00:01:11.520> cooking<00:01:11.909> also

nine nights together so let's get 98

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.249 
nine nights together so let's get 98
construction<00:01:25.590> with<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> last<00:01:26.100> table<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.759> think

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
construction with the last table I think

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.700 
construction with the last table I think
there<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.350> go<00:01:28.500> one<00:01:28.680> more<00:01:28.799> level<00:01:29.150> which<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.710> nine

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
there we go one more level which is nine

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.440 
there we go one more level which is nine
key<00:01:31.920> planks<00:01:32.280> from<00:01:32.400> now<00:01:32.579> I'm<00:01:32.939> gonna<00:01:33.150> finish

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
key planks from now I'm gonna finish

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.960 
key planks from now I'm gonna finish
them<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.990> stay<00:01:34.890> at<00:01:35.009> 30<00:01:35.340> mph<00:01:35.579> speed

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
them and stay at 30 mph speed

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.999 
them and stay at 30 mph speed
construction<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.170> after<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.560> I'm<00:01:37.710> gonna<00:01:37.829> go

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
construction and after that I'm gonna go

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.620 
construction and after that I'm gonna go

which<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.040> lot<00:02:14.340> as<00:02:14.490> well<00:02:14.520> oh<00:02:14.940> yeah<00:02:15.810> there's

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
which is a lot as well oh yeah there's

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.050 
which is a lot as well oh yeah there's
no<00:02:16.260> other<00:02:16.380> way<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.650> do<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.850> should

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
no other way to do this and this should

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.080 
no other way to do this and this should
be<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.300> fastest<00:02:18.720> way<00:02:18.780> at<00:02:19.080> my<00:02:19.110> level<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:20.000> till<00:02:21.000> I

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
be the fastest way at my level so till I

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.970 
be the fastest way at my level so till I
can<00:02:21.300> make<00:02:21.420> room<00:02:21.630> play<00:02:21.840> Dex<00:02:22.110> I'll<00:02:22.380> boost<00:02:22.680> to

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
can make room play Dex I'll boost to

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.430 
can make room play Dex I'll boost to
level<00:02:23.550> plus<00:02:24.000> 5<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.300> then<00:02:24.630> I'll<00:02:24.780> keep<00:02:25.020> logging

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
level plus 5 and then I'll keep logging

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.670 
level plus 5 and then I'll keep logging
and<00:02:25.850> that<00:02:26.850> would<00:02:27.090> be<00:02:27.120> faster<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:27.720> think<00:02:27.990> just

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
and that would be faster I think just

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.730 
and that would be faster I think just
for<00:02:28.860> now<00:02:28.980> I'm<00:02:29.040> just<00:02:29.100> gonna<00:02:29.370> do<00:02:29.610> Eddie<00:02:30.120> plates

the 99 earlier before well action for
the<00:04:54.560> GE<00:04:54.830> came<00:04:55.100> out<00:04:55.250> because<00:04:55.370> it<00:04:55.640> was<00:04:55.670> then

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060

the GE came out because it was then
profitable<00:04:56.660> I<00:04:56.900> think<00:04:57.500> because<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.430> place

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
profitable I think because the place

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.360 
profitable I think because the place
were<00:04:58.760> going<00:04:58.970> for<00:04:59.150> 10.5<00:04:59.750> each<00:05:00.080> because<00:05:01.040> people

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
were going for 10.5 each because people

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.710

as I mentioned in the last clip casually
was<00:06:36.919> doing<00:06:37.190> some<00:06:37.400> fletching<00:06:37.880> in<00:06:38.030> the<00:06:38.120> GE<00:06:38.360> and<00:06:38.720> I

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
was doing some fletching in the GE and I

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.780 
was doing some fletching in the GE and I
just<00:06:39.110> got<00:06:39.290> 97<00:06:39.919> fletching<00:06:40.280> without<00:06:40.520> even

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:40.790 
just got 97 fletching without even

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.029 
just got 97 fletching without even
noticing<00:06:41.090> anyways<00:06:41.900> two<00:06:42.110> more<00:06:42.259> levels<00:06:42.410> and<00:06:42.889> I'm

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 
noticing anyways two more levels and I'm

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:44.320 
noticing anyways two more levels and I'm
just<00:06:43.190> going<00:06:43.370> to<00:06:43.400> stick<00:06:43.639> with<00:06:43.669> broad<00:06:44.000> bolts

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330 
just going to stick with broad bolts

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.700 
just going to stick with broad bolts
because<00:06:44.600> you<00:06:44.720> don't<00:06:44.900> agree<00:06:44.930> this<00:06:45.110> money<00:06:45.500> that

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
because you don't agree this money that

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.010 
because you don't agree this money that
way<00:06:45.860> I'll<00:06:46.490> actually<00:06:46.669> use<00:06:47.060> a<00:06:47.210> couple<00:06:47.449> mil<00:06:47.810> but

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
way I'll actually use a couple mil but

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.080 
way I'll actually use a couple mil but
that's<00:06:48.199> it<00:06:48.440> maybe<00:06:49.039> two<00:06:49.340> or<00:06:49.370> three<00:06:49.460> more<00:06:49.820> from

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
that's it maybe two or three more from

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.370 
that's it maybe two or three more from
96<00:06:50.810> to<00:06:50.900> 99<00:06:51.410> but<00:06:52.250> yeah<00:06:52.789> it's<00:06:53.090> kind<00:06:53.479> of<00:06:53.660> fast<00:06:54.080> I

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 
96 to 99 but yeah it's kind of fast I

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.590 
96 to 99 but yeah it's kind of fast I
think<00:06:54.919> but<00:06:55.460> there<00:06:55.699> are<00:06:55.789> other<00:06:56.000> methods<00:06:56.240> but

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:56.600 
think but there are other methods but

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.270 
think but there are other methods but
they<00:06:56.900> cost<00:06:57.169> more<00:06:57.470> and<00:06:57.530> I<00:06:57.770> can't<00:06:58.039> be<00:06:58.190> as

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 
they cost more and I can't be as

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.680 
they cost more and I can't be as
spending<00:06:58.699> money<00:06:58.880> and<00:06:58.970> fletching<00:06:59.389> right<00:06:59.509> now

00:06:59.680 --> 00:06:59.690 
spending money and fletching right now

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.180 
spending money and fletching right now
