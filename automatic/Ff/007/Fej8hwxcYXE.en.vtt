00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello nice quality people I am 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:09.300
 saivet the administrator of the blog and today 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:11.250
 let's give a no but we will not see 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.080
 that now with a few minutes a day 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.900
 today is going to present you on the highway 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.210
 this tutorial is part of the special 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.369
 that we are making my world of books 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.050
 keys in jets and reading about clouds with 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.480
 reason for the international day of the book 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.390
 that is the same day it 's good easy it's 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.180
 do it yourself or improvise to you 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.879
 same at home is a very tutorial 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.739
 simple how can we do our 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.510
 bookshelf I do not say that bookseller because no 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.309
 I am an official carpenter and neither 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.440
 I have a Ph.D. in woods a lot 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.199
 except I am a skillful with the hammer but 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.699
 I can give you some tips for those 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.979
 they do not have much money to 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.019
 get a bookseller and his books already 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.460
 They are overflowing as mine and 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.559
 I'm going to give you a practical guide 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.659
 rather , how can they make a 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.210
 very basic bookshelf the materials that 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:01.129
 we will need are very cheap to 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.350
 easy access the tools that 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.350
 we need some have to manage 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.350
 the tools that we need some 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.259
 they have to be handled very carefully 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.060
 especially as is the drill the 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.600
 hammer 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.670
 and entering and the hammer a wood that 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.670
 will depend on the archetype they need 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.230
 although the width of 15 centimeters 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.960
 thickness 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.760
 a drill of orders and it would be as if 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.380
 I believe everything because it burned all the walls 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.330
 they are equal a hammer a screwdriver 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.290
 handle for wood or water that are 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:43.040
 thick and brackets that are the reports 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:53.660
 It was our exhibition stand 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:55.370
 with me specifically what we will do with 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.930
 the drill 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.030
 plastic packages 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.880
 super I like the way you sell me 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.530
 centimeters the area we are also going to 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.810
 enter the navigation culture of 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.970
 color that we like will only use the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.880
 it would act white with a legend 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.130
 which says of better husband 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.320
 with the sandpaper that we will find a little 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.360
 wood mostly on the edges are 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.190
 chips that the sierra also left 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.640
 works so that the paint adheres 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.060
 better 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.590
 let's paint our wooden board 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.870
 obviously horizontally in a 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.660
 space and with precaution to cover 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.060
 areas like the floor or walls in a can 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.610
 of paint lasts approximately for one 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.340
 wood of one meter 20 centimeters by 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.620
 each side with 22 hours for this we are going to 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.080
 wait about an hour for 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.270
 to completely dry the edges of 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.010
 painters with care and not saturate 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.010
 those of paint will spill 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.490
 now we have to consider the length of 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.070
 our table to know what separation 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.290
 We are going to give our people 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.510
 very close to the bank or very focused if you 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.730
 wood is very long consider placing 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.010
 more than two and the longest part in the 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.990
 wall if you are very brave to use the 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.610
 drill and you alone or alone 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.710
 otherwise go with a brother 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.470
 friend or family member who is watching the 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.840
 package to make them goodbye by vigo 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.880
 Now we are going to place the screws 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.280
 wood making a test to know 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.530
 where are you left can you help from the nail 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.300
 for concrete how to mark it lightly 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.430
 the mirror that with the screw in the 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.390
 powerful judas and after mounting it 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.390
 definitely 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.450
 This is how our 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.489
 wood on the brackets to form 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.409
 bookshelf as you can see is not very 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.810
 right or perfect but it 's enough 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.730
 to be able to place the books 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.110
 that was all on my part I hope that you 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.500
 have served I hope you liked it 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.050
 if they try it carefully and if they like 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.310
 You can leave me the link or pictures of 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.230
 how they tried even on their own 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.390
 bookseller count only remember what that 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.040
 more trust you have and if you have me
