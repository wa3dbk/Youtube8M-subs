00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
body and whatever you do the sword is

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.200 
body and whatever you do the sword is
there<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.739> sword<00:01:01.010> it<00:01:01.430> doesn't<00:01:01.729> hang<00:01:01.879> out<00:01:02.030> like

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
there the sword it doesn't hang out like

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.280 
there the sword it doesn't hang out like
this<00:01:02.390> because<00:01:02.570> that<00:01:02.720> would<00:01:02.839> bring<00:01:03.019> the<00:01:03.110> energy

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
this because that would bring the energy

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.150 
this because that would bring the energy
down<00:01:03.710> in<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:04.100> wrong<00:01:04.250> direction<00:01:04.519> it's<00:01:05.360> always

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
down in the wrong direction it's always

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.980 
down in the wrong direction it's always
correctly<00:01:07.160> aligned<00:01:07.550> with<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:07.910> other<00:01:08.030> arm<00:01:08.270> and

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
correctly aligned with the other arm and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.870 
correctly aligned with the other arm and
it's<00:01:09.470> always<00:01:09.770> there<00:01:09.980> so<00:01:10.310> that<00:01:10.460> if<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:10.760> other

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
it's always there so that if the other

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.750 
it's always there so that if the other
person<00:01:11.240> does<00:01:11.450> offer<00:01:11.750> that<00:01:11.960> hand<00:01:12.580> you<00:01:13.580> can

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
person does offer that hand you can

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.130 
person does offer that hand you can
actually<00:01:14.030> just<00:01:14.180> turn<00:01:14.360> your<00:01:14.570> body<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:15.020> the

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
actually just turn your body and the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.780 
actually just turn your body and the
hand<00:01:15.380> will<00:01:15.500> be<00:01:15.620> there<00:01:15.830> automatically<00:01:16.370> you

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
hand will be there automatically you

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.950 
hand will be there automatically you
won't<00:01:16.970> have<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.210> reach<00:01:17.510> for<00:01:17.870> it<00:01:17.900> and<00:01:19.960> the

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
won't have to reach for it and the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.480 
won't have to reach for it and the
goodness<00:01:21.140> of<00:01:21.410> the<00:01:21.560> blade<00:01:21.800> moves<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.310> blade

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
goodness of the blade moves the blade

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.180 
goodness of the blade moves the blade
always<00:01:22.940> moves<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:23.960> that<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.260> edge<00:01:24.440> is<00:01:24.830> going

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
always moves so that the edge is going

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.280 
always moves so that the edge is going
the<00:01:25.310> same<00:01:25.520> direction<00:01:25.550> as<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:26.270> blade<00:01:26.510> so<00:01:27.110> that

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
the same direction as the blade so that

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.080 
the same direction as the blade so that
anything<00:01:27.530> it<00:01:27.740> comes<00:01:27.860> in<00:01:28.070> contact<00:01:28.250> with<00:01:28.640> will

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
anything it comes in contact with will

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.480 
anything it comes in contact with will
be<00:01:29.240> cut<00:01:29.480> every<00:01:30.350> movement<00:01:30.590> in<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:30.890> form<00:01:31.190> that

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
be cut every movement in the form that

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.460 
be cut every movement in the form that
has<00:01:32.240> to<00:01:32.360> be<00:01:32.480> happening<00:01:32.900> except<00:01:33.200> for<00:01:33.380> the

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
has to be happening except for the

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.080 
has to be happening except for the
thrusts<00:01:34.040> and<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.330> pummel<00:01:35.800> strikes<00:01:37.090> there

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
thrusts and the pummel strikes there

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.730 
thrusts and the pummel strikes there
every<00:01:38.659> movement<00:01:38.870> of<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.080> form<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.500> blade

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
every movement of the form the blade

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.620 
every movement of the form the blade
should<00:01:39.920> be<00:01:39.980> moving<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:40.550> that<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.790> edge<00:01:41.030> will

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
should be moving so that the edge will

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:53.810 
should be moving so that the edge will
cut<00:01:42.670> if<00:01:43.670> it<00:01:43.909> comes<00:01:44.120> in<00:01:44.270> contact<00:01:44.450> with<00:01:44.840> a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.580 

so<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.330> fingers<00:01:55.660> the<00:01:55.900> thumb<00:01:55.930> is<00:01:56.200> held<00:01:56.380> on<00:01:56.470> the
