00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
yeah so I'm sort of getting a search n

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.110 
yeah so I'm sort of getting a search n
destroy<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.860> little<00:00:53.100> bit<00:00:53.190> more<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.489> black<00:00:53.789> ops<00:00:53.940> 2

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.660 
greater chance to run that game and I'm
all<00:01:02.250> for<00:01:02.430> 2<00:01:02.640> ml<00:01:02.940> for<00:01:03.090> 3<00:01:03.329> i'm<00:01:04.220> pretty<00:01:05.220> good<00:01:05.339> at<00:01:05.400> it

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
all for 2 ml for 3 i'm pretty good at it

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.390 
all for 2 ml for 3 i'm pretty good at it
and<00:01:06.560> see<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.590> don't<00:01:07.740> know<00:01:08.040> what's<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.369> on

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
and see I don't know what's going on

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.520 
and see I don't know what's going on
with<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:09.030> uh<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.810> probably<00:01:10.080> cuz<00:01:10.290> of

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
with that but uh it's probably cuz of

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.870 
with that but uh it's probably cuz of
Scooby's<00:01:10.890> matchmaking<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:13.369> someone<00:01:14.369> told<00:01:14.640> me

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
Scooby's matchmaking and someone told me

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.950 
Scooby's matchmaking and someone told me
like<00:01:15.830> why<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.220> don't<00:01:18.000> like<00:01:18.299> trihard<00:01:18.810> that

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
like why I just don't like trihard that

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.219 
like why I just don't like trihard that
much<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:20.220> that's<00:01:20.430> because<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:21.570> really<00:01:22.110> don't

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
much and that's because I really don't

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.539 
much and that's because I really don't
care<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.710> high<00:01:22.920> score<00:01:23.130> for<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.340> minute

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
care if I the high score for a minute

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.789 
care if I the high score for a minute
and<00:01:23.670> then<00:01:23.729> they<00:01:23.939> were<00:01:24.000> like<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:25.380> can't<00:01:25.590> play

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
and then they were like you can't play

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.440 
and then they were like you can't play
good<00:01:26.100> against<00:01:26.460> killed<00:01:26.640> with<00:01:26.759> your<00:01:26.970> at<00:01:27.390> your

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
good against killed with your at your

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.859 
good against killed with your at your
same<00:01:27.840> skill<00:01:28.080> level<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:29.390> saying<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.479> kind<00:01:30.750> of

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
same skill level and saying that kind of

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.990 
same skill level and saying that kind of
contradicts<00:01:31.380> itself<00:01:31.500> because<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.430> you're

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
contradicts itself because if you're

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.280 
contradicts itself because if you're
playing<00:01:33.180> against<00:01:33.390> people<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.780> are<00:01:34.020> as<00:01:34.170> good

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
playing against people that are as good

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.170 
playing against people that are as good
as<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.710> are<00:01:34.740> you're<00:01:35.189> not<00:01:35.310> going<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.520> play<00:01:35.729> good

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
as you are you're not going to play good

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.280 
as you are you're not going to play good
and<00:01:37.159> people<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.369> tbnrfrags<00:01:38.790> he's<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.780> good<00:01:40.079> that

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
and people I tbnrfrags he's so good that

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.740 
and people I tbnrfrags he's so good that
the<00:01:40.470> game<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.920> match<00:01:41.159> him<00:01:41.520> with<00:01:41.759> people<00:01:42.630> that

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
the game can match him with people that

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.210 
the game can match him with people that

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
even on the circuit I don't think

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.860 
even on the circuit I don't think
anymore<00:03:05.370> unless<00:03:05.730> black<00:03:06.180> ops<00:03:06.360> 2<00:03:06.510> it's<00:03:06.630> gonna<00:03:06.780> go

anymore unless black ops 2 it's gonna go

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.259 
anymore unless black ops 2 it's gonna go
back<00:03:07.019> on<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.500> if<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.550> doesn't<00:03:08.940> then<00:03:08.970> I've

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
back on it and if it doesn't then I've

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.120 
back on it and if it doesn't then I've
been<00:03:09.510> playing<00:03:09.870> compared<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.500> think<00:03:10.860> it's<00:03:10.980> just

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
been playing compared I think it's just

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.850 
been playing compared I think it's just
pointless<00:03:11.310> now<00:03:11.810> but<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.840> mean<00:03:13.440> they're<00:03:13.680> still

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
pointless now but I mean they're still

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.979 
pointless now but I mean they're still
determines<00:03:14.459> that<00:03:14.550> are<00:03:14.700> like<00:03:14.910> like<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.840> gay

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
determines that are like like the gay

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.830 
determines that are like like the gay
males<00:03:16.230> tournaments<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.100> 360<00:03:18.030> icons<00:03:18.450> that's

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
males tournaments and 360 icons that's

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
still around and so that's the only

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.780 
still around and so that's the only
reason<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:22.019> can<00:03:22.170> foresee<00:03:22.590> playing<00:03:22.980> cod<00:03:23.430> still

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
reason I can foresee playing cod still

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.780 
reason I can foresee playing cod still

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
like screw around and trick shot or

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.180 
like screw around and trick shot or
something<00:05:13.740> like<00:05:13.919> that<00:05:14.010> and<00:05:15.890> see<00:05:16.890> I<00:05:16.919> didn't

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190
