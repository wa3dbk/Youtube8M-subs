00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
chord progression is six one two three

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.060 
chord progression is six one two three
so<00:00:16.289> let's<00:00:16.320> go<00:00:16.470> ahead<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.680> take<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> look<00:00:16.980> at

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
so let's go ahead and take a look at

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.740 
so let's go ahead and take a look at
what<00:00:17.160> those<00:00:17.250> chords<00:00:17.550> look<00:00:17.699> like<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.060> six<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.539> C

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
what those chords look like the six is C

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.080 
what those chords look like the six is C
sharp<00:00:18.779> minor<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.740> looks<00:00:19.920> like<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.369> C

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
sharp minor so that looks like this C

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.140 
sharp minor so that looks like this C
sharp<00:00:21.119> E<00:00:22.039> and<00:00:23.039> G<00:00:23.310> sharp<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:24.720> one<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.970> which<00:00:26.970> is

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
sharp E and G sharp the one is which is

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.120 
sharp E and G sharp the one is which is
e<00:00:27.449> G<00:00:28.170> sharp<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.680> B<00:00:29.300> the<00:00:30.300> two<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.929> f<00:00:31.650> sharp<00:00:31.679> minor

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
e G sharp and B the two is f sharp minor

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.290 
e G sharp and B the two is f sharp minor
so<00:00:32.550> that's<00:00:32.700> F<00:00:32.940> sharp<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.829> and<00:00:34.829> C<00:00:35.190> sharp<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.700> then

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
so that's F sharp a and C sharp and then

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.420 
so that's F sharp a and C sharp and then
the<00:00:36.420> 1<00:00:36.630> over<00:00:36.899> 3<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.800> same<00:00:37.950> as<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.250> one

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
the 1 over 3 is the same as the one

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.610 
the 1 over 3 is the same as the one
except<00:00:38.820> for<00:00:38.850> our<00:00:39.450> left<00:00:39.690> hand<00:00:39.899> side<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.230> 3<00:00:40.440> so

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
except for our left hand side is a 3 so

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.889 
except for our left hand side is a 3 so
it's<00:00:40.800> e<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.640> our<00:00:41.730> left<00:00:41.910> hand<00:00:42.120> plays<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.510> G

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
it's e and our left hand plays the G

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.350 
it's e and our left hand plays the G
sharp<00:00:42.930> over<00:00:43.890> here<00:00:44.040> all<00:00:45.030> right<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.149> that's

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
sharp over here all right so that's

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:58.100 
sharp over here all right so that's
listen<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> how<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.050> sounds

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.210 

all<00:00:59.110> right<00:00:59.230> and<00:00:59.379> we'll<00:00:59.590> repeat<00:00:59.829> that<00:00:59.890> two

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
all right and we'll repeat that two

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.100 
all right and we'll repeat that two
times<00:01:00.460> before<00:01:00.700> we<00:01:01.000> go<00:01:01.120> to<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.300> verse<00:01:01.510> so<00:01:01.960> let's

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
times before we go to the verse so let's

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.600 
times before we go to the verse so let's
take<00:01:02.230> a<00:01:02.260> look<00:01:02.410> at<00:01:02.470> the<00:01:02.559> verse<00:01:02.739> starts<00:01:03.280> on<00:01:03.520> the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
take a look at the verse starts on the

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.560 
take a look at the verse starts on the
one<00:01:03.820> so<00:01:04.150> it's<00:01:04.360> e<00:01:04.800> we<00:01:05.800> already<00:01:06.010> looked<00:01:06.159> at<00:01:06.250> that

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
one so it's e we already looked at that

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.280 
one so it's e we already looked at that
then<00:01:07.570> it<00:01:07.659> goes<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.050> six<00:01:08.350> and<00:01:10.110> then<00:01:11.110> it<00:01:11.170> goes

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
then it goes to the six and then it goes

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.410 
then it goes to the six and then it goes
to<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.530> four<00:01:11.740> which<00:01:11.920> is<00:01:11.950> a<00:01:12.250> major<00:01:12.700> a<00:01:13.000> major

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
to the four which is a major a major

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.240 
to the four which is a major a major
looks<00:01:13.810> like<00:01:13.930> this<00:01:14.110> a<00:01:14.460> C<00:01:15.460> sharp<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:15.909> E<00:01:16.659> and<00:01:17.440> then

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
looks like this a C sharp and E and then

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.859 
looks like this a C sharp and E and then
it<00:01:18.340> goes<00:01:18.430> to<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.759> five<00:01:18.970> which<00:01:19.330> is<00:01:19.360> B<00:01:19.690> major

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
it goes to the five which is B major

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.530 
it goes to the five which is B major
which<00:01:20.290> is<00:01:20.500> B<00:01:20.970> d<00:01:21.970> sharp<00:01:22.000> and<00:01:22.649> F<00:01:23.649> sharp<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:25.330> let's

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
which is B d sharp and F sharp and let's

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:44.469 
which is B d sharp and F sharp and let's
go<00:01:25.659> and<00:01:25.810> take<00:01:25.869> a<00:01:25.930> look<00:01:26.050> at<00:01:26.110> how<00:01:26.170> that<00:01:26.320> sounds

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.899 

and<00:01:44.960> then<00:01:45.110> we<00:01:45.200> add<00:01:45.350> that<00:01:45.380> on<00:01:45.829> the<00:01:46.310> six<00:01:47.740> and<00:01:48.909> then

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
and then we add that on the six and then

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.950 
and then we add that on the six and then
I<00:01:51.520> said<00:01:52.520> we<00:01:52.579> go<00:01:52.700> back<00:01:52.880> to<00:01:53.060> one<00:01:53.360> therefore<00:01:53.630> I<00:01:53.750> see
