00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.780
 hello guys and girls like this consumers 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.110
 welcome to a new video in this 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.030
 If the closed beta of club 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.180
 It is open from August 25 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.360
 until August 29 I think if I do not 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.669
 wrong for pc this beta is the same 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.320
 very similar to the one they made a 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.930
 month or something so I can not try 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.700
 because he was out he has been implemented 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.489
 some changes like a beast patch 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.620
 let's say with some news but in 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.149
 general in the game modes everything 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.739
 what can be done is very similar to 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.440
 previous beta but like me the beta 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.000
 previous not the web and as in what 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.980
 they taught in the gamescom of the club was 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.260
 the same as in e3 you can say that 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.699
 since June I do not play at the club that 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.129
 I do not see anything new so I wanted to 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.230
 much this beta to see where it's going 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.030
 the game and give you as always my opinion 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.859
 first of all tell you that in the 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.230
 description is the way you have of 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.749
 get the beta an access to the goal 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.420
 to play until the 29th plus I 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:04.309
 I'm also giving away by 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.390
 twitter raffling putting them and the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.780
 first that the pineapples are left 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.979
 keys to download it in you play well 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.610
 it's good to just go to the 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.250
 description 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.020
 intention and desire to try the game what 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.540
 what did I do in this game that you are 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.000
 seeing is to start in las vegas and from 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.860
 las vegas mark a route of what they were 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.120
 80 kilometers inside the game 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.240
 obviously there are many more in the 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.830
 reality 80 kilometers to new york 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.290
 That was my route and I wanted to do it 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.520
 I did I think in 30 minutes like that and it's what 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.590
 you are seeing now landscapes 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.410
 ice cream when you pass through the mountains 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.780
 rocky the go shit west mp 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.790
 leave them in the texture of the floor here already 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.200
 you know I never talk about graphics but 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.030
 has really good details 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.350
 Then he has other things that I think 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.780
 you have to finish polishing the ones like 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.420
 physical sometimes popping is 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.160
 say that cars appear and disappear 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.810
 in the distance because it is a very map 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.030
 great so I think to be a 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.369
 beta is very good at the level of 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.560
 graphic performance I also say that at 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.090
 have to record I started my pc is also not 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.759
 no wonder and sometimes there was 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.320
 some some frame failures by 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.490
 second but they were because I was recording 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.250
 when I did not record the wta 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.800
 So I made this trip and it's the one 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.989
 you are watching now I'm about 35 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.510
 minutes in fact they say it seems that it has 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.370
 calculated that around with 40 to 45 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.500
 minutes you can make the trip of the 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.440
 angels to new york evidently was 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.690
 key or 300 hours and only in 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.390
 Main roads if you go by 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.830
 secondary roads and such is 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.510
 can lengthen a lot more because it does not 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.769
 there's only the highway but you can 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.239
 catch a detour do more things for 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.130
 true what you are seeing is while 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.860
 I was driving someone has me 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.420
 invited to make a career a part 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.519
 of history a mission of history 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.590
 and we have created a patrol a cross 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.000
 to play attention attention to the train of 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.950
 ski rock value there we are 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.090
 you can accept or not obviously 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.280
 you can do it with friends or with 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.590
 complete strangers on the map are going 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.110
 showing up people is a bit like 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.120
 to the free world of network within missions 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.040
 you remember, it seems to me that he is the one 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.870
 it seems more of the games that I have 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.890
 played for you to understand the experience 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.569
 Well, here we are doing the 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.010
 mission I was on my way to new york 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.390
 suddenly I come in and to do the 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.310
 mission and then I stay in Detroit or 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.390
 I can go back where I was not then in 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.130
 the beta can do things from 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.090
 multiplayer you can do the story 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.099
 this pretty 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.620
 now I will talk about her 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.730
 driving and in general what I 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.470
 it's looking like play attention that 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.629
 has advance we can advance things 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.160
 overtake do not push me forward is not me 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.980
 ahead is cuckoo a lot I do not know how it 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.660
 called as one in 1955 I do not care what 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.430
 what we are going to do is very ugly but it is 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.020
 necessary sometimes you have to do what 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.600
 you have to do goodbye 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.010
 to win in the race well then what 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.230
 I thought what is looking like 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.730
 Well, the same thing that I thought was a game 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.740
 that is not simulation I think not 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.170
 pretends to be a simulation is a game 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.330
 arcade is a game to have fun is 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.990
 a game to enjoy the tension of 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.940
 drive 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.280
 there are many game modes I think 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.020
 that whoever wants to enjoy 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.310
 can be done by anyone who wants 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.360
 do things with your friends you can 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.500
 do the one who wants to do challenges of 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.810
 skill and such can be done by 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.520
 want to customize the car here you see 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.280
 how is it managed then the people who are 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.890
 in the same package and then your club is 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.480
 say those who are your friends because there are 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.950
 many different options for the type 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.630
 of game that you want you can like 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.030
 I said customize and then there's the 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.290
 history the story has really 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.030
 surprised I did not know anything about the 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.430
 story as I say I had not seen the 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.810
 previous beta and in e3 and all that we 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.280
 he had taught history and history 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.640
 apart from that the graphs of the 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.620
 kinematics are the cock good on 26 and 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.750
 I think they are incredible, they are 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.370
 cinematic but you the history is 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.680
 well to see is not a very typical story 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.840
 of what putean 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.990
 he wants revenge from a corrupt policeman and 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.180
 and that's why they get in and they come back 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.600
 infiltrate a band of pilots 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.990
 illegitimate bastards etc then 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.639
 good 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.900
 I liked it, I thought the story 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.400
 interesting honestly I did not 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.960
 I was waiting so that's let's say an added 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.370
 more you can do history then do 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.930
 the other thing I think is a very game 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.509
 complete that can be quite adapted to 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.300
 what the player wants from it 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:04.620
 there will be no other beta for console too 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.860
 the description is explained how 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.900
 get it to participate in it to 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.360
 play 4 xbox one for now we have 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.280
 seen in the pc and the truth that as I say 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.720
 the game has left me very good 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.349
 sensations has refirmed the opinion that 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.000
 had as I say I think you can not 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:22.590
 compare, neither want nor want 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.979
 compare for example to a game like 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.320
 granturismo pulls more towards need for 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.729
 speed but with a very large map 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.990
 really the map has always 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.900
 nice to say it's the biggest map 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.759
 never created and the truth that good 45 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.620
 minutes going in a straight line 300 times 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:39.000
 so it's pretty bit about everything 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.039
 so I say it's not just 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.220
 that you can run on the highway but 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:45.510
 that really in each town because nothing 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.010
 but there are tiny cities there 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.230
 different cities and in each of 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.170
 they are skill challenges there are little things 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.610
 that you can do challenges that come out 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.140
 that are pretty good as I said 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.600
 also important customization 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.070
 customization skills tree 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.170
 you can buy cars anyway what is 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.720
 usual in this type of games but 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.490
 here is also power so enough 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.290
 already chatter and we will finally arrive 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.060
 to new york that will be the goal of 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.440
 our trip there we are this is new 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.760
 york rock as we know that this is new 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.620
 york because he puts it down there at the 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.780
 right greenwich village and also look 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.570
 look to the right no longer wait look at the 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.700
 and right now there are with 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.230
 skyline looks again to the right rock 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.240
 look out the window that these people 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.560
 wants to see things good, well, that's 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.210
 It goes through looking out the window and then you 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.830
 You give a host rock as we know that 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.450
 this is no bigger because there is the 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.160
 statue the freedom so finally 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.690
 we have arrived at our destination I hope 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.100
 that you have served some thing the 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.360
 video that has entertained you already know 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.650
 if you want to try the sale of this game 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.540
 in the description is all the 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:43.130
 information to achieve it until the 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.130
 next guys goodbye
