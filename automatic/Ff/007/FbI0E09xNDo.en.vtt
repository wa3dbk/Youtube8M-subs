00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
form and then i can play a little bit

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.410 
form and then i can play a little bit
more<00:00:16.740> advanced<00:00:17.130> alright<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.150> i'm<00:00:18.240> going<00:00:18.330> to

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
more advanced alright and i'm going to

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.880 
more advanced alright and i'm going to
incorporate<00:00:18.690> some<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.350> principle<00:00:19.859> that

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
incorporate some of the principle that

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.099 
incorporate some of the principle that
you<00:00:20.100> learn<00:00:20.340> throughout<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.270> volumes<00:00:21.689> alright

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
you learn throughout the volumes alright

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.990 
you learn throughout the volumes alright
so<00:00:22.320> if<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.500> just<00:00:22.590> have<00:00:22.769> volume<00:00:23.100> one<00:00:23.310> or<00:00:23.580> two<00:00:23.760> or

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
so if you just have volume one or two or

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.089 
so if you just have volume one or two or
three<00:00:24.180> or<00:00:24.269> four<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.960> doesn't<00:00:25.619> matter<00:00:25.710> i'll

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
three or four it doesn't matter i'll

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.620 
three or four it doesn't matter i'll
show<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.460> where<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.730> can<00:00:26.760> expect<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.390> each<00:00:27.510> of

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
show you where you can expect in each of

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.480 
show you where you can expect in each of
those<00:00:27.720> volumes<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.650> i<00:00:28.769> will<00:00:28.949> be<00:00:28.980> able<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.279> go

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
those volumes and i will be able to go

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.400 
those volumes and i will be able to go
into<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.730> just<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.090> little<00:00:30.119> bit<00:00:30.599> but<00:00:31.199> if<00:00:31.349> you

chord progressions for that song now
we're<00:01:33.470> gonna<00:01:33.530> be<00:01:33.680> able<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:33.920> cover<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.520> when

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
and the why and why we wrap saying what

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.030 
and the why and why we wrap saying what
chords<00:01:37.729> we<00:01:37.850> should<00:01:38.030> be<00:01:38.120> using<00:01:38.150> and<00:01:38.720> why<00:01:39.290> now<00:01:39.890> if

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
chords we should be using and why now if

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.010 
chords we should be using and why now if
you<00:01:40.160> can<00:01:40.340> play<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:40.580> song<00:01:40.880> in<00:01:41.000> that<00:01:41.180> basic<00:01:41.630> form

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
you can play the song in that basic form

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.469 
you can play the song in that basic form
or<00:01:42.229> if<00:01:42.560> you<00:01:42.650> can't<00:01:42.920> that's<00:01:43.130> okay<00:01:43.520> my<00:01:44.150> ball<00:01:44.360> you
