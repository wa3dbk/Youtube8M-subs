00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.109
 hi guys today i'll show you one 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.250
 semi-permanent polish attempted without 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.870
 oven or beautician's accessories 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.289
 the important thing is that you have a nail polish 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.470
 my booth agreement is transparent 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.350
 beauty and a nail polish of your choice a 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.970
 a color in the square I play catto la 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.289
 my transparent base as you can well 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:32.189
 see you room lights with the light of 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.860
 sun glitters and dried and therefore now 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.770
 I'm going to pass my normal course 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:48.420
 colored is not waterproof it is nothing 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:51.000
 normal as simple as it is as if under the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.960
 their technique and simply apply 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.960
 in this way 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.810
 we think very easy to do however the 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:37.030
 I named myself right next to it 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:41.710
 customer are like a clear nail polish 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.710
 show taken 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:02:04.340
 ok we ask that we will be given to this 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.340
 i will know normal simple 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:21.659
 obviously having to do his hand too 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:24.150
 because otherwise this was more thanks to 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:26.760
 the transparent base reb and now if 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.180
 you want you can take this one again 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.159
 over it 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.230
 obviously when you melt you have to 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:35.640
 wait a quarter of an hour by mail 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.519
 or you can not normally 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.110
 leave only this colorful but without 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.730
 in this island 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.940
 I'm going to do the other dark guy like that 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.750
 from the component to zero if you have the 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.890
 small of the small glaze residues 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.299
 previous what you take a cotton bud 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.340
 simple the real one is a bit of 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:04.680
 accept their news right towards 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:07.790
 they are the angles because in these parts 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.709
 that you don't really want the nail polish 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:17.840
 I do the first I had to do me 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:17.840
 happen to have to put a burger 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:31.870
 and it keeps me doing it of course 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:34.450
 they kept looking I should safe and 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:41.710
 more than that of stripe too 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:47.260
 do not weigh what I think will come back 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:49.150
 me, however, I think then my uncle 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.970
 the beautician together with my cousin e 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.580
 have a beauty salon and do the 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.560
 request to close it darmon inter 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.060
 France and told me this 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.440
 little trick because of having 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.720
 eight videos on youtube didn't tell me 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.190

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:08.320
 touch everything present obviously me or 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:13.030
 shorten the time because here or are 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:17.610
 those which then became provinces stands 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.610
 at the base of the transparent base 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.290
 ok 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.510

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.840
 we close our enamel I repeat the 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.090
 mine and the current bit and minutes it 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.389

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.449

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.729

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:11.500
 lips of the file looks like a normal 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:15.970
 rumors renault brawn not so much because it 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:19.330
 same brush is that when 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:22.000
 the lie burns you want to burn 2 star 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.370
 3 minutes and remove a bretti journal of 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.040

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.560
 I know very well that you inflate your hairspray 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.979
 so it was touches to the underworld lips

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:58.060
 the chicken row is good though it is 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:06:02.370
