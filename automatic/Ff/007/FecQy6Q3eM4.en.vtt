00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.140
 windows in this day so 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.300
 important for the inter 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.219
 left-handed but we are also following the 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.049
 let's make our own Catania day 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.850
 in sicily from peppe di stefano who is in 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:21.880
 company of the managing director 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:24.449
 right of catania pablo here we are 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.920
 we are as you were saying with pablo cosentino 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.130
 meanwhile we thank Catania for 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.599
 this beautiful day of opening at 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.580
 opening press we have 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.840
 interviewed many players in the pre of 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.270
 such an important match 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.010
 let's start from here Cosenza has heard 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.830
 many players especially those who 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.700
 arrived in the last market 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.980
 enthusiasm and truth were many 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.450
 mistakes made in the field and not only though 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.980
 the enthusiasm is to start from here from 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.840
 this from this desire to this 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.040
 team to try to come back soon 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.110
 A league 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.680
 the desire was always no even when 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.050
 we did not do well and the speech is 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.770
 which is fine we started badly 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.839
 unfortunately and maybe even difficult for 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.460
 soccer player who hadn't done so much 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.470
 the live series had not done so 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.520
 directly descend into a reality 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.850
 different 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.600
 now it looks like we found the 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.870
 right way to move forward and we are 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.670
 confident of doing well 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.070
 many wonder how it was possible 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.050
 being able to bring players to Catania 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.880
 how it fell like a rosin like rinaudo that 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.590
 we remember the game was in the thirty 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.820
 disabled of the last world championship 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.200
 world 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.700
 even a difficult market operation 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.680
 because then we like the sky in the end 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.300
 always talk about the market as it has been 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.280
 how hard it was how good 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.880
 may be useful to the Catania cause 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.880
 in the next months 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.310
 then it is here we always take also 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.260
 of the will of the player rinaudo a 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.600
 boy also particular not because he 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.100
 he had decided to stay here even if he did 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.450
 sporting also played ciampino c 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.940
 the sporty coach asked her to 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.860
 stay he had given the word not 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.350
 we only friends with the comrades al 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.270
 milone capuano spolli is he to 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.530
 locker room next year I will play 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.509
 catania in series b and 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.490
 and he did everything to come then 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.540
 it becomes much easier because yes no 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.670
 for us it is impossible to do it later too 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.170
 calataio rosina I was even though 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.450
 they had other requests they decided to 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.310
 come here lend a hand in the city they are 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.080
 giving very well great 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.720
 the last thing he asks, however, I leave a 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.280
 you are also referred to once again at 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.780
 market at the market in January before 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.239
 sannino I said I train this team 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.040
 maybe then January could happen 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.720
 something will happen something 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.180
 important is the catania can change 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.830
 much or will be some purchases 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.060
 targeted department by department 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.830
 what do you think cosentino in your head 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.660
 that the team is fine so I am 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.269
 very confident that this team after 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.700
 talking about the market we always are 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.680
 we are vigilant on the market there is something 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.780
 that we can improve the rose 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.819
 we do it but it's not like the team is 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.920
 incomplete or that we think with 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.390
 these we cannot do well then 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.269
 these players are the ones who 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.370
 we chose is yes we can recover 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.290
 all of the injuries even now also 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.769
 glomera had a bad injury to the 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.190
 ankle 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.140
 we can be in everyone and we can 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.610
 also continue like this after sure 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.130
 if there is something to do we do it like 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.570
 they made me so I listen to me 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.610
 yes to get into a little more detail 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.049
 on the question that interests two 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.120
 fans of Catania that naturally 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.160
 understand the ambitions of this company 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.780
 I don't seem to understand the championship of 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.000
 series b this year is more balanced 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.620
 that never really very complicated because 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.480
 then the places to climb to get back into 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.970
 Syria are those that schools are not 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.320
 that how to say they aspire to this 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.549
 There are so many goals 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.310
 for example, I ask you this bologna 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.010
 new bonali tacopina what I say makes you 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.870
 fear but it scares me but also which ones 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.280
 may be the schools that give more 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.989
 annoyance at this time of the strongest 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.209
 in series b besides you of course not 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.400
 I don't like talking about other teams 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.079
 I think we have to go 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.890
 after game certainly the bologna is one 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:05.299
 strong team but there is also in Livorno there 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.440
 they are the ones who are first in this 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.660
 moment in the standings 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.489
 we can speak frosinone ricard p 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.829
 also bari a team for the second 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.780
 me very strong and Latin and is doing it 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.220
 bad 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.079
 a team seemed to me like a team 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.970
 good a completely strong team 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.730
 for that we have to be a lot 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.850
 very quiet watching the game later 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:28.060
 the game must and must be the 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.530
 perfect thought we thank you and 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.690
 thanks to the availability 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.130
 the managing director of the francesino 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.130
 thanks to peppe di stefano
