any sort of light activity that involves

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.480 
any sort of light activity that involves
kind<00:02:35.630> of<00:02:35.810> like<00:02:35.900> extreme<00:02:36.500> sports<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:37.130> shooting

kind of like extreme sports and shooting

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.250 
kind of like extreme sports and shooting
but<00:02:37.730> I<00:02:37.970> think<00:02:38.540> that<00:02:38.600> they're<00:02:38.780> great<00:02:38.930> for<00:02:39.110> nerf
