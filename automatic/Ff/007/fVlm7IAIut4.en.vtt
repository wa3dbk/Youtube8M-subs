one<00:04:08.269> fantastic<00:04:09.079> detail<00:04:09.260> but<00:04:09.799> articulation<00:04:10.459> is

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579

just<00:04:10.849> okay<00:04:11.599> and<00:04:12.319> I<00:04:12.410> think<00:04:12.680> it<00:04:12.769> has<00:04:12.950> to<00:04:12.980> do<00:04:13.400> with

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
just okay and I think it has to do with

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.580 
just okay and I think it has to do with
a<00:04:13.670> lot<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.329> cost<00:04:14.630> implications<00:04:15.380> of<00:04:15.500> the

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
a lot of the cost implications of the

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.890 
figure and in hospital is really trying
to<00:04:18.709> earn<00:04:18.859> more<00:04:19.190> more<00:04:19.760> money<00:04:20.090> by<00:04:20.419> increasing

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
to earn more more money by increasing

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.710 
to earn more more money by increasing
the<00:04:21.320> price<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:22.030> removing<00:04:23.030> the<00:04:23.120> articulation

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
the price and removing the articulation

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.740 
the price and removing the articulation
and<00:04:24.669> as<00:04:25.669> some<00:04:25.880> of<00:04:25.970> you<00:04:26.090> in<00:04:26.180> Manila<00:04:26.510> may<00:04:26.630> already

know the tentative quarters figures from

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.960 
know the tentative quarters figures from
Hasbro<00:04:30.080> already<00:04:30.410> increased<00:04:30.950> prices<00:04:31.490> by<00:04:31.760> one

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
Hasbro already increased prices by one

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.990

dollar<00:04:32.210> and<00:04:32.660> as<00:04:33.650> you<00:04:33.770> can<00:04:33.860> see<00:04:33.919> it<00:04:34.250> this<00:04:34.610> figure

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
dollar and as you can see it this figure

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.310 
dollar and as you can see it this figure
still<00:04:35.300> has<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.990> hinge<00:04:36.650> hips<00:04:37.960> ball<00:04:38.960> hinge
