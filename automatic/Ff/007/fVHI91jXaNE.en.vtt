sure that it's wide enough that covers
the<00:00:49.500> edge<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.250> board<00:00:50.489> which<00:00:50.820> you'll<00:00:51.000> just

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the edge of the board which you'll just

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.580 
the edge of the board which you'll just
see<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> edge<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.660> my<00:00:51.690> board<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.260> corner

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
see the edge of my board in the corner

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.619 
see the edge of my board in the corner
of<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.829> screen<00:00:53.039> there<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.550> just<00:00:54.180> keep<00:00:54.329> going

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
of the screen there so just keep going

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.660 
of the screen there so just keep going
all<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> way

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
all the way

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.119 
all the way
trying<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.879> keep<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.210> an<00:00:57.329> even<00:00:57.930> thickness<00:00:58.230> now

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
trying to keep it an even thickness now

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.400 
trying to keep it an even thickness now
if<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.699> do<00:00:59.910> take<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.239> long<00:01:00.480> time<00:01:00.780> over<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.230> you

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
if you do take a long time over this you

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.290 
if you do take a long time over this you
will<00:01:01.530> find<00:01:01.800> your<00:01:01.980> icing<00:01:02.370> starts<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.850> dry<00:01:03.090> and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
will find your icing starts to dry and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.690 
will find your icing starts to dry and
crack<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> quicker<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.129> do<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
crack so the quicker you can do it the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.179 
crack so the quicker you can do it the
better<00:01:06.229> obviously<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.500> more<00:01:07.619> times<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.040> do

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
better obviously the more times you do

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.440 
better obviously the more times you do
it<00:01:08.220> these<00:01:08.580> are<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.909> would<00:01:09.119> come<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
it these are it would come in the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.149 
it these are it would come in the
quickly<00:01:09.750> you'll<00:01:09.900> you'll<00:01:10.260> find<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.010> do

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
quickly you'll you'll find it is to do

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.090 
quickly you'll you'll find it is to do
anyway<00:01:11.490> now<00:01:12.150> trim<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.140> only<00:01:13.740> bit<00:01:13.860> off<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
anyway now trim just only bit off the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.160 
anyway now trim just only bit off the
edge<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.549> because<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.390> might<00:01:15.570> find<00:01:15.780> like<00:01:15.990> me

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
edge just because you might find like me

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.630 
edge just because you might find like me
sometimes<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.740> icing<00:01:17.040> cracks<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.369> little<00:01:17.400> bit

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
sometimes the icing cracks a little bit

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.399 
sometimes the icing cracks a little bit
on<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.820> very<00:01:18.030> edge<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.930> I'm<00:01:19.020> going<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.229> trim

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
on the very edge so I'm going to trim

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.690 
on the very edge so I'm going to trim
those<00:01:19.590> bits<00:01:19.830> off<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.310> they<00:01:20.400> can't<00:01:20.610> be

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
those bits off so that they can't be

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.820 
those bits off so that they can't be
seen<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.869> cake<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.080> there's<00:01:22.530> my<00:01:22.650> cake

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
seen on the cake so there's my cake

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.120 
seen on the cake so there's my cake
board<00:01:23.060> with<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> cake<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.770> and<00:01:25.770> I'm<00:01:25.890> just

board with the cake on and I'm just
going<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.369> put<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> tiny<00:01:26.790> bit<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.060> water<00:01:27.210> around

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
going to put a tiny bit of water around

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.800 
going to put a tiny bit of water around
the<00:01:27.990> edge<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> board<00:01:28.560> then<00:01:29.369> I'm<00:01:29.490> laying

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
the edge of the board then I'm laying

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.380 
the edge of the board then I'm laying
the<00:01:30.810> flat<00:01:31.049> edge<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.590> my<00:01:32.009> icing<00:01:32.460> around<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.329> I'm

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
the flat edge of my icing around and I'm

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.090 
the flat edge of my icing around and I'm
just<00:01:33.600> pulling<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.079> round<00:01:34.320> all<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.680> way<00:01:34.860> around

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
just pulling it round all the way around

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.190 
just pulling it round all the way around
slotting<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:39.000> touching<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.630> side<00:01:40.049> of

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
slotting it so it's touching the side of

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.310 
slotting it so it's touching the side of
the<00:01:40.290> cake<00:01:40.500> now<00:01:40.680> overlap<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.850> at<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:41.970> back<00:01:42.320> and

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the cake now overlap it at the back and

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.520 
the cake now overlap it at the back and
then<00:01:43.619> run<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> knife<00:01:44.070> through<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.840> ice<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.259> and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
then run a knife through the ice in and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.590 
then run a knife through the ice in and
then<00:01:46.770> take<00:01:47.040> off<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.549> better<00:01:48.060> either<00:01:48.270> side

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
then take off the better either side

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.880 
then take off the better either side
then<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.810> should<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:48.990> able<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.140> just<00:01:49.380> join<00:01:49.619> it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
then you should be able to just join it

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.590 
then you should be able to just join it
and<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.310> press<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.670> down<00:01:50.700> now<00:01:51.090> sometimes<00:01:51.479> you

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
and just press it down now sometimes you

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.170 
and just press it down now sometimes you
are<00:01:51.720> left<00:01:51.899> at<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.110> sidelines<00:01:52.790> obviously<00:01:53.790> if

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
are left at the sidelines obviously if

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.999 
are left at the sidelines obviously if
it's<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> back<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.960> cake<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.560> shouldn't

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
it's the back of the cake it shouldn't

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.889 
it's the back of the cake it shouldn't
be<00:01:56.100> seen<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.430> any<00:01:56.579> way<00:01:56.759> or<00:01:57.119> if<00:01:57.600> you're<00:01:57.780> putting

something<00:01:58.079> on<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.409> front<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.369> board<00:01:59.579> you

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
something on the front of the board you

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.760 
something on the front of the board you
can<00:02:00.000> move<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.509> front<00:02:00.630> now<00:02:01.200> I'm<00:02:01.590> just

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
can move it to the front now I'm just

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.959 
can move it to the front now I'm just
going<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:01.950> trim<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.399> edge<00:02:02.490> with<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> knife

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
going to trim the edge with a knife

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.399 
going to trim the edge with a knife
going<00:02:03.299> all<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.780> way<00:02:03.810> around<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:06.409> carefully

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.169 
going all the way around just carefully
making<00:02:07.619> sure<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.160> don't<00:02:08.310> tear<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:08.879> I'll

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
making sure that you don't tear it I'll

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.010 
making sure that you don't tear it I'll
pull<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.420> off<00:02:09.569> are<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.929> going<00:02:10.200> around

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.630 

okay<00:02:15.020> now<00:02:15.740> that's<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:16.070> now<00:02:16.190> normally<00:02:16.550> I<00:02:16.580> would

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
okay now that's it now normally I would

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.760 
okay now that's it now normally I would
just<00:02:16.850> smooth<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.360> board<00:02:17.600> but<00:02:18.440> because<00:02:18.650> it's

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
just smooth the board but because it's

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.920 
just smooth the board but because it's
got<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:18.980> cake<00:02:19.160> on<00:02:19.340> if<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.550> use<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.730> smooth<00:02:20.120> you

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
got the cake on if you use a smooth you

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.980 
got the cake on if you use a smooth you
will<00:02:21.110> end<00:02:21.380> up<00:02:21.680> catching<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.370> cake<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:22.990> so

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
will end up catching the cake and so

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.050 
will end up catching the cake and so
that's<00:02:24.140> it<00:02:24.350> then<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.400> can<00:02:25.520> finish<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:26.030> off

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
that's it then you can finish it off

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.370 
that's it then you can finish it off
with<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.330> ribbon<00:02:26.630> around<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.960> edge<00:02:27.050> if<00:02:27.290> you
