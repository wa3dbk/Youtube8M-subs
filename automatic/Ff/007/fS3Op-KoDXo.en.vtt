workout videos I'll check out this guy
right<00:04:17.479> here<00:04:19.299> you<00:04:20.299> get<00:04:20.479> huge<00:04:22.840> notice<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.990> range

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
right here you get huge notice the range

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.010 
right here you get huge notice the range
of<00:04:24.410> motion<00:04:24.680> that<00:04:25.160> I<00:04:25.220> have<00:04:25.550> I'm<00:04:26.539> not<00:04:26.720> going

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
of motion that I have I'm not going

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.469 
of motion that I have I'm not going
straight<00:04:27.650> down<00:04:27.910> perpendicular<00:04:28.910> to<00:04:29.389> the

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
straight down perpendicular to the

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.500 
straight down perpendicular to the
ground<00:04:29.510> surface<00:04:30.500> I'm<00:04:31.039> kind<00:04:31.310> of<00:04:31.370> pushing<00:04:32.330> it<00:04:32.419> in

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
ground surface I'm kind of pushing it in

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.650 
ground surface I'm kind of pushing it in
an<00:04:32.600> angle<00:04:33.020> so<00:04:33.229> on<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:34.070> negative<00:04:35.030> i'm<00:04:35.389> actually

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
an angle so on the negative i'm actually

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.490 
an angle so on the negative i'm actually
pushing<00:04:36.320> forward<00:04:36.830> holding<00:04:37.340> it<00:04:37.460> up<00:04:38.350> some<00:04:39.350> would

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
pushing forward holding it up some would

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.230 
pushing forward holding it up some would
say<00:04:39.680> that<00:04:39.860> I'm<00:04:39.949> firing<00:04:40.250> your<00:04:40.430> shoulders<00:04:40.880> but<00:04:41.060> I

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
say that I'm firing your shoulders but I

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.659 
say that I'm firing your shoulders but I
mean<00:04:41.449> for<00:04:42.260> me<00:04:42.380> I<00:04:42.410> really<00:04:42.680> feel<00:04:43.010> this<00:04:43.220> hits<00:04:43.490> my

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
mean for me I really feel this hits my

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.189
