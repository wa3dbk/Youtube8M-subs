00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.629
 explain today well in this video I'm going 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.800
 to explain the way to die players 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:55.550

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.040
 point 6.4 well what are we going to do in 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.340
 this mod 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.320
 let's just explain them 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.140
 how to become a brother in a 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.910
 crime in a pig go in what 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.170
 you want one I will not leave it 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.690
 that you want a spider a 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.160
 skeleton what you want is worth 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.020
 Well first I'll leave the link to him 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.380
 so that they download this more for the 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.880
 version 1.6 point 2 and 1 point 6.4 in the 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.440
 link in the description of the video well 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.510
 so that works we are very well this 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.850
 mod transforms in any other way 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.890
 monster can make you bigger and more 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.909
 boy with this you can make yourself more huge 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.009
 we put new agreement as 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.530
 well just here to change from 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.950
 monster can you just give it 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.740
 of the next vampire as you will see I am already 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.409
 a vampire here appears as a vampire 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.280
 and this greatly affects the modality 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.790
 Well, now I'm a place. 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.080
 blaze myth 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:05.730
 I follow a spider, a chicken, a cow, a 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:09.899
 dragon to have a brother in denver 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:12.649
 they will keep on derman glass zombie leaves 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.649
 I take it more 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.350
 is that this is a giant in a zombie 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.160
 giant 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:25.180
 the base of the cat cow is typical 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.150
 zombie body the sheep of this earth a 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.690
 Skeleton can be a writing without an arc 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.690
 obviously 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.210
 welfare year right now the attack 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.890
 look at this look at these 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.890
 these little sisters 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.030
 do not 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:52.709
 this then I'm going to change with this 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.709
 and I think that is what is going to attack 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.840
 he took my sword 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.920

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.250

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.220
 mod 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:16.040
 simply to switch to any 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.530
 skin that you want good more then of a 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.620
 kripper like I do in several videos 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.990
 that you have seen I go out as 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.800
 several then 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:30.980
 copies of these are all these and 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.010
 more if they have more mods installed I do not know 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.069
 if this serves for well for 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.409
 play of two players I do not know if it serves the 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.700
 I can truly be a dog if you are in a 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:45.110
 server and if it serves please tell me and 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.790
