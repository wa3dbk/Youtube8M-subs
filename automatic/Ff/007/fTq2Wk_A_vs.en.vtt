00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
saw at the beginning which pretty much

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.140 
saw at the beginning which pretty much
got<00:01:07.590> me<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:08.130> early<00:01:08.280> pave<00:01:08.640> low<00:01:08.850> and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
got me a really early pave low and

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.120 
got me a really early pave low and
pretty<00:01:09.900> much<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:10.170> set<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.590> pace<00:01:10.830> for<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
pretty much just set the pace for the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.620 
pretty much just set the pace for the
rest<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> game<00:01:11.729> i<00:01:11.760> want<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.150> say<00:01:12.299> because

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
rest of the game i want to say because

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.750 
rest of the game i want to say because
you<00:01:12.780> know<00:01:12.869> give<00:01:13.260> me<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.470> momentum<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.189> that

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
you know give me that momentum and that

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.940 
you know give me that momentum and that
confidence<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.479> pull<00:01:15.990> off<00:01:16.200> what<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.470> did<00:01:16.680> here

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
confidence to pull off what I did here

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.399 
confidence to pull off what I did here
so<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> pretty<00:01:17.490> good<00:01:17.729> gameplay<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
class that I'm running is pretty much

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.149 
class that I'm running is pretty much
one<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> only<00:01:21.960> classes<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.740> run<00:01:23.009> now

higher<00:02:59.950> kill<00:03:00.280> games<00:03:00.549> so<00:03:00.850> yeah<00:03:01.480> I<00:03:01.780> find<00:03:02.290> that's

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
higher kill games so yeah I find that's

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.250 
higher kill games so yeah I find that's
a<00:03:02.560> big<00:03:02.980> necessity<00:03:03.519> in<00:03:03.610> hardline<00:03:04.030> is<00:03:04.630> my<00:03:04.840> second

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
a big necessity in hardline is my second

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.140 
a big necessity in hardline is my second
perk<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:05.769> pretty<00:03:06.100> much<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:06.340> know<00:03:06.549> on<00:03:06.850> these

higher kill games you get probably going

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.830

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
alive build on my streak and get to my

second<00:04:48.850> pave<00:04:49.030> low<00:04:49.270> which<00:04:49.510> I<00:04:49.780> inevitably<00:04:50.770> did

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
second pave low which I inevitably did

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.470 
second pave low which I inevitably did
and<00:04:51.340> you<00:04:51.520> know<00:04:51.550> I'm<00:04:51.760> starting<00:04:51.880> to<00:04:52.090> get<00:04:52.210> closer

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
and you know I'm starting to get closer

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.330 
and you know I'm starting to get closer
to<00:04:52.810> that<00:04:52.840> assault<00:04:53.260> mode<00:04:53.470> but<00:04:53.740> like<00:04:53.860> I<00:04:53.950> said<00:04:54.010> it

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
to that assault mode but like I said it

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.430 
to that assault mode but like I said it
didn't<00:04:54.580> really<00:04:54.820> cross<00:04:55.450> my<00:04:55.510> mind<00:04:55.690> that<00:04:55.990> all<00:04:56.260> the

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
didn't really cross my mind that all the

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.770 
didn't really cross my mind that all the
this<00:04:56.740> entire<00:04:57.130> game<00:04:57.400> until<00:04:57.820> I<00:04:57.880> actually<00:04:58.120> got<00:04:58.570> it

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
this entire game until I actually got it

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.510 
this entire game until I actually got it
and<00:04:58.930> it's<00:04:59.440> pretty<00:04:59.620> funny<00:04:59.920> how<00:05:00.160> it's<00:05:00.340> played

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
and it's pretty funny how it's played

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.040 
and it's pretty funny how it's played
out<00:05:00.550> because<00:05:01.000> there<00:05:01.180> were<00:05:01.300> you<00:05:01.600> know<00:05:01.630> few

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
out because there were you know few

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.250 
out because there were you know few
games<00:05:02.730> previously<00:05:03.730> not<00:05:04.540> necessarily<00:05:05.080> this

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
games previously not necessarily this

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.990 
games previously not necessarily this
day<00:05:05.470> but<00:05:05.740> I<00:05:05.920> have<00:05:06.160> played<00:05:06.460> games<00:05:06.730> where<00:05:06.880> I've

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
day but I have played games where I've

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.330 
day but I have played games where I've
gotten<00:05:07.300> like<00:05:07.330> a<00:05:07.450> 23<00:05:08.050> assault<00:05:08.410> Moab<00:05:08.620> streak<00:05:09.100> and

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
gotten like a 23 assault Moab streak and

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.540 
gotten like a 23 assault Moab streak and
just<00:05:09.940> because<00:05:10.330> I<00:05:10.740> had<00:05:11.740> a<00:05:11.770> feeling<00:05:12.070> that<00:05:12.280> was

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
just because I had a feeling that was

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.790 
just because I had a feeling that was
close<00:05:12.880> to<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.300> assault<00:05:13.570> Moab<00:05:13.870> I<00:05:14.140> kind<00:05:14.380> of<00:05:14.470> you

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
close to the assault Moab I kind of you

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.230 
close to the assault Moab I kind of you
know<00:05:14.830> playing<00:05:15.160> completely<00:05:15.610> different<00:05:16.030> made

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
know playing completely different made

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.300 
know playing completely different made
some<00:05:16.420> stupid<00:05:16.630> mistakes<00:05:16.840> and<00:05:17.350> I<00:05:17.680> kind<00:05:18.250> of

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
some stupid mistakes and I kind of

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.220 
some stupid mistakes and I kind of
panicked<00:05:18.550> and<00:05:18.940> choked<00:05:19.210> a<00:05:19.360> little<00:05:19.390> bit<00:05:19.750> so<00:05:20.020> in

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
panicked and choked a little bit so in

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.830 
panicked and choked a little bit so in
this<00:05:20.410> game<00:05:20.680> I<00:05:21.010> guess<00:05:21.580> because<00:05:21.820> the<00:05:22.390> assault

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
this game I guess because the assault

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.080 
this game I guess because the assault
model<00:05:23.200> Moab<00:05:23.680> wasn't<00:05:24.130> even<00:05:24.310> a<00:05:24.400> thought<00:05:24.430> that<00:05:24.880> I

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
model Moab wasn't even a thought that I

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.580 
model Moab wasn't even a thought that I
actually<00:05:25.510> you<00:05:25.840> know<00:05:25.870> I<00:05:25.960> just<00:05:26.080> kept<00:05:26.380> playing

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
actually you know I just kept playing

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.620 
actually you know I just kept playing
the<00:05:27.250> way<00:05:27.400> I<00:05:27.430> was<00:05:27.640> playing<00:05:27.910> the<00:05:28.150> rest<00:05:28.450> of<00:05:28.540> the

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
the way I was playing the rest of the

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.150 
the way I was playing the rest of the
game<00:05:28.840> and<00:05:29.080> it<00:05:29.260> paid<00:05:29.440> off<00:05:29.470> when<00:05:29.890> you<00:05:29.950> worked

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
game and it paid off when you worked

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.400 
game and it paid off when you worked
pretty<00:05:30.370> well<00:05:30.640> so<00:05:31.180> that's<00:05:31.390> you<00:05:31.810> know<00:05:31.840> something

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
pretty well so that's you know something

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.740 
pretty well so that's you know something
that<00:05:32.530> i<00:05:32.560> can<00:05:32.620> set<00:05:32.920> suggest<00:05:33.550> you<00:05:33.820> but<00:05:34.510> I<00:05:34.660> know

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
that i can set suggest you but I know

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.720 
that i can set suggest you but I know
it's<00:05:35.260> easier<00:05:35.560> said<00:05:35.800> than<00:05:35.980> done<00:05:36.040> you<00:05:36.400> know<00:05:36.520> if

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
it's easier said than done you know if

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.280 
it's easier said than done you know if
you<00:05:36.910> are<00:05:37.120> on<00:05:37.300> the<00:05:37.420> street<00:05:37.690> like<00:05:37.900> this<00:05:38.110> if

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
you are on the street like this if

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.380 
you are on the street like this if
you're<00:05:38.410> getting<00:05:38.560> close<00:05:38.830> to<00:05:38.860> a<00:05:39.010> MOAB<00:05:39.430> or<00:05:39.700> just

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
you're getting close to a MOAB or just

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.500 
you're getting close to a MOAB or just
any<00:05:40.570> streak<00:05:40.930> in<00:05:41.110> general<00:05:41.730> don't<00:05:42.730> panic<00:05:43.000> try<00:05:43.450> to

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
any streak in general don't panic try to

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.390 
any streak in general don't panic try to
play<00:05:43.780> how<00:05:44.350> you<00:05:44.410> were<00:05:44.740> for<00:05:44.980> the<00:05:45.040> rest<00:05:45.250> of<00:05:45.310> the

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
play how you were for the rest of the

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.070 
play how you were for the rest of the
game<00:05:45.640> because<00:05:45.850> if<00:05:45.940> you<00:05:46.060> did<00:05:46.240> you<00:05:46.570> build<00:05:46.810> up<00:05:46.990> a

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
game because if you did you build up a

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.570 
game because if you did you build up a
street<00:05:47.350> this<00:05:47.560> far<00:05:47.800> then<00:05:48.010> you<00:05:48.130> probably<00:05:48.370> were

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
street this far then you probably were

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.160 
street this far then you probably were
playing<00:05:48.880> pretty<00:05:49.150> well<00:05:49.240> so<00:05:49.600> just<00:05:49.630> continue

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.170 
playing pretty well so just continue

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.600 
playing pretty well so just continue
what<00:05:50.590> you<00:05:50.680> were<00:05:50.710> doing<00:05:51.100> don't<00:05:51.310> change<00:05:51.490> your

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
what you were doing don't change your

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.850 
what you were doing don't change your
play<00:05:51.790> style<00:05:52.030> try<00:05:52.750> to<00:05:52.810> remain<00:05:53.140> calm<00:05:53.440> and<00:05:53.680> I<00:05:53.800> know

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
play style try to remain calm and I know

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.710 
play style try to remain calm and I know
you<00:05:54.010> know<00:05:54.280> look<00:05:54.880> at<00:05:54.970> this<00:05:55.090> right<00:05:55.360> here<00:05:55.390> this<00:05:55.570> is

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
you know look at this right here this is

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.420 
you know look at this right here this is
probably<00:05:56.020> the<00:05:56.200> funniest<00:05:56.500> part<00:05:56.860> in<00:05:57.070> the<00:05:57.190> game<00:05:57.400> I

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
probably the funniest part in the game I

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.460 
probably the funniest part in the game I
was<00:05:57.700> actually<00:05:57.850> one<00:05:58.270> away<00:05:58.570> from<00:05:59.080> a<00:05:59.110> pret

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
was actually one away from a pret

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.340 
was actually one away from a pret
missile<00:05:59.890> along<00:06:00.610> with<00:06:00.640> an<00:06:01.150> assault<00:06:01.540> Moab<00:06:01.750> but<00:06:02.200> I

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
missile along with an assault Moab but I

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:03.750 
missile along with an assault Moab but I
didn't<00:06:02.620> know<00:06:02.740> I<00:06:02.770> was<00:06:03.070> one<00:06:03.220> away<00:06:03.430> from<00:06:03.490> the

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
didn't know I was one away from the

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.060 
didn't know I was one away from the
assault<00:06:04.060> Moab<00:06:04.240> so<00:06:04.630> thinking<00:06:05.440> that<00:06:05.650> I<00:06:05.680> just<00:06:05.890> got

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
assault Moab so thinking that I just got

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.460 
assault Moab so thinking that I just got
the<00:06:06.250> predator<00:06:06.610> missile<00:06:06.940> I<00:06:07.090> was<00:06:07.780> about<00:06:08.020> to<00:06:08.230> hide

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
the predator missile I was about to hide

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.620 
the predator missile I was about to hide
in<00:06:08.650> that<00:06:08.680> corner<00:06:09.220> to<00:06:09.670> call<00:06:09.970> it<00:06:10.090> in<00:06:10.210> real<00:06:10.450> quick

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
in that corner to call it in real quick

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.140 
in that corner to call it in real quick
but<00:06:10.960> I<00:06:10.990> accidentally<00:06:11.740> called<00:06:12.550> in<00:06:12.700> the<00:06:12.790> Moab

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
but I accidentally called in the Moab

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.690 
but I accidentally called in the Moab
that<00:06:13.420> I<00:06:13.570> caught<00:06:13.930> by<00:06:14.110> accident<00:06:14.710> so<00:06:14.920> never<00:06:15.460> heard

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
that I caught by accident so never heard

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.490 
that I caught by accident so never heard
of<00:06:15.790> somebody<00:06:16.000> getting<00:06:16.240> moab<00:06:16.810> by<00:06:16.840> accident

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
of somebody getting moab by accident

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.100 
of somebody getting moab by accident
before<00:06:17.800> but<00:06:18.040> this<00:06:18.970> is<00:06:19.150> a<00:06:19.180> first<00:06:19.450> for<00:06:19.570> me<00:06:19.690> and<00:06:19.990> I

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
before but this is a first for me and I

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.720 
before but this is a first for me and I
think<00:06:20.320> the<00:06:20.380> first<00:06:20.560> on<00:06:20.800> youtube<00:06:21.160> and<00:06:21.430> you<00:06:21.490> see<00:06:21.700> I

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:21.730 
think the first on youtube and you see I

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.550 
think the first on youtube and you see I
pretty<00:06:22.330> much<00:06:22.420> just<00:06:22.600> failed<00:06:23.080> with<00:06:23.350> my

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
pretty much just failed with my

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.030 
pretty much just failed with my
prednisolone<00:06:25.110> ammo<00:06:26.110> obviously<00:06:26.740> you<00:06:26.830> wipes

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
prednisolone ammo obviously you wipes

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.820 
prednisolone ammo obviously you wipes
the<00:06:27.190> enemy<00:06:27.460> team<00:06:27.760> and<00:06:28.050> with<00:06:29.050> spawn<00:06:29.350> protection

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
the enemy team and with spawn protection

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.100 
the enemy team and with spawn protection
in<00:06:29.920> this<00:06:30.100> game<00:06:30.310> any<00:06:30.640> explosive<00:06:31.600> killstreaks

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
in this game any explosive killstreaks

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.870 
in this game any explosive killstreaks
such<00:06:32.410> as<00:06:32.560> a<00:06:32.590> pred<00:06:32.890> missile<00:06:33.250> isn't<00:06:33.550> going<00:06:33.700> to<00:06:33.790> be

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
such as a pred missile isn't going to be

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.480 
such as a pred missile isn't going to be
able<00:06:34.000> to<00:06:34.300> kill<00:06:34.690> the<00:06:34.870> enemy<00:06:35.230> within<00:06:35.920> the<00:06:36.220> first

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
able to kill the enemy within the first

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.250 
able to kill the enemy within the first
i<00:06:36.670> think<00:06:36.730> five<00:06:37.120> or<00:06:37.180> six<00:06:37.600> seconds<00:06:38.050> of<00:06:38.140> them

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.260 
i think five or six seconds of them

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.080 
i think five or six seconds of them
spawning<00:06:38.650> don't<00:06:39.040> pull<00:06:39.340> me<00:06:39.460> on<00:06:39.550> the<00:06:39.670> time

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
spawning don't pull me on the time

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.430 
spawning don't pull me on the time
think<00:06:40.300> it's<00:06:40.389> around<00:06:40.480> there<00:06:40.870> so<00:06:41.350> you

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
think it's around there so you

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.930 
think it's around there so you
definitely<00:06:41.710> want<00:06:42.040> to<00:06:42.100> wait<00:06:42.310> at<00:06:42.520> least<00:06:42.580> that

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
definitely want to wait at least that

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.320 
definitely want to wait at least that
you<00:06:43.060> know<00:06:43.150> that<00:06:43.449> much<00:06:43.720> for<00:06:44.620> the<00:06:44.710> enemy<00:06:45.040> to

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
you know that much for the enemy to

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.700 
you know that much for the enemy to
actually<00:06:46.330> spawn<00:06:46.630> and<00:06:46.930> get<00:06:47.110> rid<00:06:47.260> of<00:06:47.290> that<00:06:47.380> spawn

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
actually spawn and get rid of that spawn

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.550 
actually spawn and get rid of that spawn
spawn<00:06:48.490> protection<00:06:49.150> so<00:06:49.360> you<00:06:49.419> know<00:06:49.630> had<00:06:50.169> I<00:06:50.199> play

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 
spawn protection so you know had I play

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.080 
spawn protection so you know had I play
that<00:06:50.770> little<00:06:50.919> bit<00:06:51.160> smarter<00:06:51.610> I<00:06:51.639> might<00:06:51.940> have

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
that little bit smarter I might have

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.700 
that little bit smarter I might have
been<00:06:52.210> able<00:06:52.330> to<00:06:52.510> get<00:06:52.630> those<00:06:52.810> extra<00:06:53.020> four<00:06:53.440> kills

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
been able to get those extra four kills

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.469 
been able to get those extra four kills
that<00:06:53.889> I<00:06:53.919> needed<00:06:54.190> or<00:06:54.430> you<00:06:54.850> know<00:06:54.940> even<00:06:54.970> just<00:06:55.360> a

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:55.479 
that I needed or you know even just a

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:56.909 
that I needed or you know even just a
couple<00:06:55.690> extra<00:06:55.930> kills<00:06:56.320> which<00:06:56.530> would<00:06:56.770> have<00:06:56.860> held

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:56.919 
couple extra kills which would have held

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:58.500 
couple extra kills which would have held
me<00:06:57.220> in<00:06:57.340> the<00:06:57.430> long<00:06:57.610> run<00:06:57.639> regardless<00:06:57.970> of<00:06:58.449> the

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.510 
me in the long run regardless of the
