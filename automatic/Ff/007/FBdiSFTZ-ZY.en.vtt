hour<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.559> runescape<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.969> i'm<00:00:39.239> going<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.510> show

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
hour in runescape so i'm going to show

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.709 
hour in runescape so i'm going to show
you<00:00:39.719> it's<00:00:40.020> very<00:00:40.230> easy<00:00:40.820> it<00:00:41.820> does<00:00:42.120> require<00:00:42.300> you

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
you it's very easy it does require you

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.619 
you it's very easy it does require you
to<00:00:42.899> have<00:00:42.930> been<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.500> combat<00:00:44.430> level<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.910> about<00:00:45.210> all

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
to have been a combat level of about all

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.630 
to have been a combat level of about all
I'd<00:00:45.899> say<00:00:46.730> 126<00:00:47.730> 130<00:00:48.629> as<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.410> minimum<00:00:49.770> because

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
I'd say 126 130 as the minimum because

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.240 
I'd say 126 130 as the minimum because
you<00:00:51.510> know<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.750> does<00:00:51.870> require<00:00:52.050> some<00:00:52.230> combat<00:00:52.949> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
you know it does require some combat and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.639 
you know it does require some combat and
it's<00:00:54.149> easier<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.809> higher<00:00:54.960> your<00:00:55.170> combat<00:00:55.500> level

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
it's easier the higher your combat level

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.010 
it's easier the higher your combat level

going<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.430> kill<00:02:14.640> grot<00:02:14.940> worms<00:02:15.150> now<00:02:15.420> ground

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
going to kill grot worms now ground

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.750 
going to kill grot worms now ground
worms<00:02:15.810> are<00:02:16.020> level<00:02:16.290> 120<00:02:16.830> they<00:02:17.430> don't<00:02:17.610> require

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
worms are level 120 they don't require

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.360 
worms are level 120 they don't require
any<00:02:18.390> levels<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.920> don't<00:02:20.130> think<00:02:20.310> they

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
any levels and I don't think they

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.950 
any levels and I don't think they
require<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:21.060> quest<00:02:21.630> so<00:02:22.410> that's<00:02:22.830> good<00:02:23.270> but<00:02:24.270> they

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
require a quest so that's good but they

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.130 
require a quest so that's good but they
are<00:02:25.430> weak<00:02:26.430> against<00:02:26.850> range<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:27.660> people

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
are weak against range and people

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.280 
are weak against range and people
usually<00:02:28.290> use<00:02:28.790> chaotic<00:02:29.790> crossbows<00:02:30.720> or<00:02:31.020> black

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
usually use chaotic crossbows or black

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.040 
usually use chaotic crossbows or black
salamanders<00:02:32.120> because<00:02:33.120> those<00:02:33.360> seem<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.690> be<00:02:33.810> the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
salamanders because those seem to be the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.430 
salamanders because those seem to be the
you<00:02:34.620> know<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:35.390> strongest<00:02:36.390> but<00:02:36.960> if<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.200> can't

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
you know the strongest but if you can't

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.430

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
going to have to go to your lodestone

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.220 
going to have to go to your lodestone
and<00:03:06.260> teleport<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.350> port<00:03:07.680> sarim<00:03:07.950> so<00:03:09.050> i'll<00:03:10.050> show

go to the west and go up towards the
north<00:03:32.150> a<00:03:32.270> little<00:03:32.300> bit<00:03:32.570> when<00:03:32.720> you<00:03:32.780> get<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:32.990> this

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
north a little bit when you get to this

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.620 
north a little bit when you get to this
point<00:03:33.320> and<00:03:33.560> you<00:03:34.370> should<00:03:34.610> see<00:03:34.970> this<00:03:35.270> little

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
point and you should see this little

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.750 
point and you should see this little
camp<00:03:35.990> with<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.410> white<00:03:36.650> knights<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:37.190> cerebral

camp with the white knights and cerebral

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.310 
camp with the white knights and cerebral
now<00:03:38.510> go<00:03:38.750> down<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.050> cave<00:03:39.230> entrance<00:03:39.410> and

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
now go down the cave entrance and

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.420 
now go down the cave entrance and
continue<00:03:42.320> going<00:03:42.440> down<00:03:42.770> and<00:03:43.040> just<00:03:43.160> follow<00:03:43.340> the

continue going down and just follow the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.770 
continue going down and just follow the
pathway<00:03:43.610> that<00:03:43.880> I'm<00:03:44.030> going<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:46.630> make<00:03:47.630> your

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
pathway that I'm going and make your

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.370 
pathway that I'm going and make your
first<00:03:47.930> left<00:03:48.140> until<00:03:49.010> you<00:03:49.160> come<00:03:49.370> across<00:03:49.610> a

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
first left until you come across a

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.590 
first left until you come across a
passion<00:03:51.380> to<00:03:51.410> wet<00:03:51.620> a<00:03:51.830> passageway<00:03:52.400> over<00:03:53.330> here

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
passion to wet a passageway over here

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.780 
passion to wet a passageway over here
where<00:03:54.440> it<00:03:54.500> says<00:03:54.530> investigate<00:03:55.130> shortcut<00:03:55.580> and

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
where it says investigate shortcut and

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.420 
where it says investigate shortcut and
you<00:03:56.090> could<00:03:56.210> do<00:03:56.330> that<00:03:56.360> and<00:03:56.950> if<00:03:57.950> you<00:03:58.100> don't<00:03:58.310> have

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
you could do that and if you don't have

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.740 
you could do that and if you don't have
the<00:03:58.520> levels<00:03:58.790> for<00:03:58.940> that<00:03:59.090> you<00:03:59.240> can<00:03:59.420> go<00:03:59.540> around

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
the levels for that you can go around

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:08.500 
the levels for that you can go around
and<00:04:06.550> this<00:04:07.550> is<00:04:07.670> where<00:04:07.820> the<00:04:07.910> grout<00:04:08.090> worms<00:04:08.270> should

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
and this is where the grout worms should

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.360 
and this is where the grout worms should
be<00:04:08.660> now<00:04:09.290> these<00:04:09.470> things<00:04:09.680> are<00:04:09.800> pretty<00:04:10.010> easy<00:04:10.220> to

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
be now these things are pretty easy to
