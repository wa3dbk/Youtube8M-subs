00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.710
 hello how about this techno jacks 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.920
 well I have a very quick video 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.320
 very simple as you know there is a 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.619
 application of decides there is a tweet that 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.320
 called app cracker that what he was doing was 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.730
 just allow us to buy things 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.650
 in such applications 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.440
 completely free that the name of 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.870
 this is technical is in app purchases 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.570
 or shopping within applications by 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:35.010
 the general applications are free 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:37.800
 well that's the tweet for that 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.159
 6 no it does not work at least I do not 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.620
 It worked well, it came out another tweet that 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:45.659
 just this if it works I do not know if to 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.659
 times older but at least in 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:52.100
 you are 6 works perfectly and it is 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:53.840
 very very easy to install 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.550
 obviously what we have to do is 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.370
 go to cydia so we have to have 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.519
 our psjailbreak device and if not 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.320
 they know how there is click on that button and 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.659
 they're going to go to a video on how to do it 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.790
 It is very easy and already the only thing that 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.310
 have to do is go to the search engine 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:15.540
 and in the search put 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:18.360
 exactly what is there and Africa 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.150
 depends on the repositories that have 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.580
 they are going to be able to go out there 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.790
 there are several options then I what 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.830
 I have this is the 3.3 I have it from the repo 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.860
 of insein link in the description of 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.910
 video left the address of the repo de 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.650
 have to add here in cydia 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.390
 obviously it's totally free and 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.770
 well they 're just going to install in me 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.190
 case with the install installs says 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.930
 modify the install they will ask you to 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.840
 do a res print idea do not stick 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.810
 that will only restart the device and 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.000
 then they go here to any game I 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.729
 example I'm in this tiny tower and I 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.580
 I'm going to see bugs and here he bought dollars from 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.869
 for the game but they will come out in 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.479
 reality dollars 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.450
 well I put I do not know any 500 look 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.989
 that I have 500 dollars now 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.700
 for I have a thousand and totally free of charge 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.620
 that's absolutely no cost to me 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.170
 in my idea of ​​apple I have not assigned 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.569
 no credit card so I 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.209
 it comes out absolutely nothing to have that and 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.150
 well now I have a thousand dollars here in the 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.730
 game not like that with any game clarified 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.580
 that this is not for all games 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.910
 some games do it in others it's not going to 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.950
 work this is like this is totally 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.799
 random so it's a matter of 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.630
 try do not start asking me everything 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.250
 the time to adjust games continues for 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.799
 such because I do not know I do not know what I know 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.310
 try to see if it works and then another 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.500
 another important clarification is that because 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.310
 when you install this tweet because to 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.069
 it happened to me apart, that's why I say it is that 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.230
 when they make the jump they are not asked 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.970
 your average device is answered 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.849
 from the surprise of when he turned to 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.700
 start the device had been deleted 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:08.340
 absolutely all my applications do not 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.590
 had no only the natives of 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.230
 ios but all have been erased 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.180
 absolutely all good nothing happens 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.190
 do not get scared you just have to 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.080
 turn off the device do not make a 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.870
 I breathe and not again turn it off 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.349
 full of power turn it off completely 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.989
 and relearning it and there he went back to 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.120
 appear absolutely all sometimes is 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.580
 very rarely does that happen with they install something 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.250
 from cydia he does that they have to 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.530
 turn off and turn on the device and nothing else 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.170
 after everything working and also not 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.620
 I can stop mentioning the user that 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.420

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.829

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.370
