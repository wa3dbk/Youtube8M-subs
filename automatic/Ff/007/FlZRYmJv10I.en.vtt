00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:12.789
 hello g8 friends welcome to macintosh mode 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:16.779
 this time not only turn with a mast 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.079
 that will be very short flight will be 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.939
 about how to have a start of 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.079
 - Thomas a little faster from the group ban 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.439
 we already know that the first days 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.100
 It's flying but after that 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.060
 d some time of use began to notice a little 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.960
 it is not of consideration but 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.100
 Of course it is notorious 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.100
 we will know it to system preferences 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.790
 beautiful accounts 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.460
 genoa range we will activate all the applications that 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.670
 let's have for example 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.180
 when installing some applications these are automatically 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.210
 add to the bank efe 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.540
 on that computer is to say that at the time of posing 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.330
 these start with 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.660
 with the system and that makes it a bit slower 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.760
 the boot since the statement load etc. and so on 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.040
 well then what we have to do is 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.550
 verbeek in the selection 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.510
 i 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.440
 efe 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.890
 that is the 1st 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.690
 the second ones 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.300
 when we have 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.870
 too many 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.390
 and we know all 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.390
 It takes the same time to load, it does not do the same as it does 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.670
 because if we had little 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.910
 but for that we are going to occupy 2 6 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.750
 how will they taste with spices 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.470
 what you do have the rights 2 ppt more slowly 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.250
 well then monza 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.250
 donostia lorenzo capece of application 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.370
 the application is free both played 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.809
 now what we are gonna do 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:12.809
 let's create let's assume it 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:20.009
 the length of the attempts 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:23.839
 in pesos, cgt delegate 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.839
 but in the nightclub 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.499
 all the tests 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:32.549
 so marquez 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.549
 we respect it efe p 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.239
 what good did I do well 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.259
 and overturned in hospitals are dog activated 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:44.349
 the institution 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.999
 when we wandered 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.839
 the application will be like this 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:52.199
 and so will start 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:55.199
 system / ical with few icons to be here 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.679
 brush is a bit 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:01.279
 we can still see the icons a little smaller for what 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:05.139
 it is the least distant least time 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:11.139
 and well that's a recommendation 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.139
 preferential house because its application 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:18.149
 what we have to do 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:20.559
 percent every time 

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:23.969
 fighting with everyone because that would be a bit annoying we have 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:26.459
 the catastrophe 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.059
 it is not everyone who regularly their masters 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:32.059
 but all good to start working a lot of art 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:35.219
 the de facto bonus type friends 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:36.719
 I hope he 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:38.349
 because he serves 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.779
 and that they put prÃ©val and have a faster computer 

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:45.899
 I say goodbye Sunday and at least one penis to comment 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.119
 efe 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:50.259
 chinedu up 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:51.929
 those funds Juan
