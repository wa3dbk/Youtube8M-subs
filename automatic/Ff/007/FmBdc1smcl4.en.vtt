here is his all level the pin connecter

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.000 
here is his all level the pin connecter
bridge<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.750> course<00:00:30.900> was<00:00:31.170> done<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.500> an<00:00:31.650> earlier

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.010 
bridge of course was done in an earlier

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.500 
bridge of course was done in an earlier
video<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:33.150> you<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.449> see<00:00:33.690> its<00:00:34.650> construction

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
video so you can see its construction

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.530 
video so you can see its construction
and<00:00:36.510> down<00:00:36.809> here<00:00:37.489> it's<00:00:38.489> again<00:00:38.850> level<00:00:39.239> I've<00:00:39.360> got

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
and down here it's again level I've got

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.420 
and down here it's again level I've got
the<00:00:39.720> deck<00:00:39.930> out<00:00:40.140> here<00:00:40.170> both<00:00:40.650> ends<00:00:40.949> with<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.400> a

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
the deck out here both ends with is a

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.640 
the deck out here both ends with is a
barrel<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:41.970> top<00:00:42.210> for<00:00:42.540> water<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.320> still<00:00:43.530> got

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
barrel on top for water and I still got

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.950 
barrel on top for water and I still got
to<00:00:43.739> build<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:44.040> handrail<00:00:44.430> around<00:00:44.790> here<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.809> it

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
to build a handrail around here and it

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.399 
to build a handrail around here and it
continues<00:00:46.410> across<00:00:46.710> into<00:00:47.519> the<00:00:47.670> oncoming<00:00:48.409> track

continues across into the oncoming track
of<00:00:49.589> that<00:00:49.739> end<00:00:49.949> the<00:00:50.790> retaining<00:00:51.180> pins<00:00:51.809> are<00:00:52.050> in

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:52.229 
of that end the retaining pins are in

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.369 
of that end the retaining pins are in
here<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.949> all<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.970> all<00:00:54.299> the<00:00:54.570> events<00:00:54.720> are<00:00:55.140> now

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
here and all that all the events are now

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.899 
here and all that all the events are now
in<00:00:55.530> place<00:00:59.690> the<00:01:00.690> bents<00:01:01.110> needs<00:01:01.920> some<00:01:02.250> support

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
in place the bents needs some support

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.200 
in place the bents needs some support
until<00:01:03.299> the<00:01:03.420> scenery's<00:01:03.839> in<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:05.060> what<00:01:06.060> I've

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
until the scenery's in and what I've

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.420 
until the scenery's in and what I've
done<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.350> put<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:09.380> another<00:01:10.380> timber<00:01:10.830> piece

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
done here is put a another timber piece

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.690 
done here is put a another timber piece
of<00:01:11.549> scrap<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> underside<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.840> pilings

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
of scrap on the underside of the pilings

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.160 
of scrap on the underside of the pilings
essentially<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.850> wholeness<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.900> give<00:01:16.080> it

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
essentially the wholeness and give it

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.200 
essentially the wholeness and give it
some<00:01:16.320> support<00:01:16.549> and<00:01:17.549> I've<00:01:17.700> just<00:01:17.850> put<00:01:17.940> in<00:01:18.150> some

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
some support and I've just put in some

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.160 
some support and I've just put in some
12<00:01:18.659> by<00:01:18.810> 12<00:01:19.079> pieces<00:01:19.649> of<00:01:19.829> wood<00:01:20.189> at<00:01:20.460> each<00:01:20.609> end

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
12 by 12 pieces of wood at each end

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.359 
12 by 12 pieces of wood at each end
underneath<00:01:22.170> each<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.009> bins

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
underneath each one of the bins

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.940 
underneath each one of the bins
that'll<00:01:24.090> temporarily<00:01:24.659> support<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.560> until<00:01:25.920> I

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
that'll temporarily support this until I

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.039 
that'll temporarily support this until I
actually<00:01:26.369> get<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.789> scenery<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.539> of

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
actually get the scenery in and of

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.319 
actually get the scenery in and of
course<00:01:28.079> the<00:01:28.289> scenery<00:01:28.799> will<00:01:29.399> will<00:01:29.820> come<00:01:30.030> up<00:01:30.210> on

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
course the scenery will will come up on

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.240 
course the scenery will will come up on
an<00:01:30.450> angle<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.960> got<00:01:31.170> covering<00:01:31.560> these<00:01:31.770> upper

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
an angle I got covering these upper

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.969 
an angle I got covering these upper
Timbers<00:01:32.670> here<00:01:33.000> cross<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.109> then<00:01:34.200> back<00:01:34.409> up<00:01:34.649> here

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
Timbers here cross and then back up here

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.880 
Timbers here cross and then back up here
and<00:01:35.219> then<00:01:35.310> cuts<00:01:35.579> across<00:01:36.049> on<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.289> side<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
and then cuts across on the side of the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:46.399 
and then cuts across on the side of the
retaining<00:01:38.789> wall<00:01:42.170> on<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.439> end<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.960> grade

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
retaining wall on this end the grade

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.499 
retaining wall on this end the grade
will<00:01:46.649> be<00:01:46.770> much<00:01:46.950> lower<00:01:47.249> than<00:01:47.729> at<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.060> opposite

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
will be much lower than at the opposite

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.160 
will be much lower than at the opposite
in<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.899> it'll<00:01:49.590> go<00:01:49.890> up<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.969> shallow<00:01:51.270> area<00:01:51.810> and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
in and it'll go up on a shallow area and

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.649 
in and it'll go up on a shallow area and
then<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.399> then<00:01:53.399> an<00:01:53.520> embankment<00:01:53.820> up<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.359> here

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
then a then an embankment up in here

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.359 
then a then an embankment up in here
with<00:01:54.869> some<00:01:55.049> rock<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.469> so<00:01:55.829> under<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.219> would

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
with some rock and so under this would

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.609 
with some rock and so under this would
be<00:01:56.460> sitting<00:01:56.670> on<00:01:56.789> a<00:01:56.850> rock<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.299> it'll<00:01:58.079> cut<00:01:58.319> up<00:01:58.469> on

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
be sitting on a rock and it'll cut up on

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.300 
be sitting on a rock and it'll cut up on
the<00:01:58.649> side<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.249> here<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.299> you'll<00:02:00.749> see<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.979> I

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
the side in here so you'll see that I

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.609 
the side in here so you'll see that I
put<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.759> couple<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.060> supports<00:02:03.539> the<00:02:04.259> same<00:02:04.499> as

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
put in a couple of supports the same as

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.919 
put in a couple of supports the same as
the<00:02:04.740> opposite<00:02:05.189> side<00:02:05.520> just<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.569> carry<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
the opposite side just to carry the

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:08.960 
the opposite side just to carry the
weight<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.109> this<00:02:07.380> whereas<00:02:08.069> these<00:02:08.220> ones<00:02:08.550> here

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
weight of this whereas these ones here

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.720 
weight of this whereas these ones here
are<00:02:09.240> already<00:02:09.690> in<00:02:10.410> place<00:02:10.740> on<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.310> piece<00:02:11.550> of

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
are already in place on this piece of

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.120 
are already in place on this piece of
plywood<00:02:11.880> here<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:13.800> these<00:02:13.980> have

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
plywood here that that so these have

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.670 
plywood here that that so these have
been<00:02:14.250> sized<00:02:15.060> exactly<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.020> fit<00:02:16.200> here<00:02:16.410> because

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
been sized exactly to fit here because

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.380 
been sized exactly to fit here because
this<00:02:16.830> will<00:02:16.980> be<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.130> relatively<00:02:17.670> flat<00:02:17.940> grade

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
this will be a relatively flat grade

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.809 
this will be a relatively flat grade
going<00:02:18.630> across<00:02:18.990> here<00:02:19.440> where<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.250> spills<00:02:20.580> away

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
going across here where it spills away

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.149 
going across here where it spills away
into<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.330> river<00:02:21.600> in<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.440> background<00:02:22.470> and

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
into the river in the background and

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.729 
into the river in the background and
comes<00:02:23.700> forward<00:02:24.060> into<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.569> fairly<00:02:24.959> flat<00:02:25.200> area<00:02:25.680> in

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
comes forward into a fairly flat area in

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.870 
comes forward into a fairly flat area in
here<00:02:26.099> we<00:02:26.879> all<00:02:27.000> have<00:02:27.239> the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
here we all have the

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.110 
here we all have the
water<00:02:28.060> tank<00:02:28.420> will<00:02:29.410> be<00:02:29.440> positioned<00:02:30.160> in<00:02:30.820> this

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
water tank will be positioned in this

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.480 
water tank will be positioned in this
general<00:02:31.720> area<00:02:31.990> here<00:02:32.530> for<00:02:32.830> some<00:02:33.040> foreground

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
general area here for some foreground

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.540 
general area here for some foreground
detail<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.320> so<00:02:35.320> I<00:02:35.380> do<00:02:35.470> need<00:02:35.740> a<00:02:35.770> flat<00:02:36.070> area<00:02:36.310> in

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
detail and so I do need a flat area in

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:46.230 
detail and so I do need a flat area in
here<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:42.070> plaster<00:02:42.490> abutment<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:45.240> now

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
here the plaster abutment is now

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.750 
here the plaster abutment is now
finished<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:47.500> came<00:02:47.740> in<00:02:47.890> two<00:02:48.010> pieces<00:02:48.430> one<00:02:48.580> is<00:02:48.730> a

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
finished it came in two pieces one is a

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.180 
finished it came in two pieces one is a
casting<00:02:49.330> like<00:02:50.200> this<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.830> then<00:02:50.920> there's<00:02:51.130> a

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
casting like this and then there's a

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.310 
casting like this and then there's a
capstone<00:02:51.730> on<00:02:51.760> top<00:02:52.120> so<00:02:52.750> I've<00:02:52.840> prefinished

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
capstone on top so I've prefinished

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.910 
capstone on top so I've prefinished
these<00:02:53.730> using<00:02:54.730> some<00:02:55.030> combination<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:56.650> alcohol

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
these using some combination of alcohol

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.640 
these using some combination of alcohol
a<00:02:57.190> shoe<00:02:57.460> die<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:57.970> also<00:02:58.210> some<00:02:58.570> diluted<00:02:59.080> local

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
a shoe die and also some diluted local

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.710 
a shoe die and also some diluted local
stains<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.190> then<00:03:00.880> I've<00:03:01.000> dropped<00:03:01.240> some<00:03:01.450> dark

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
stains and then I've dropped some dark

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.410 
stains and then I've dropped some dark
stain<00:03:02.710> just<00:03:03.010> in<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.880> joints<00:03:04.270> a<00:03:04.390> little

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
stain just in the joints a little

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.330 
stain just in the joints a little
capillary<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.530> down<00:03:05.920> three<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:06.220> just

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
capillary and down three I just

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.700 
capillary and down three I just
highlighting<00:03:07.000> very<00:03:07.210> gently<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.500> motor

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
highlighting very gently the the motor

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.160 
highlighting very gently the the motor
joints<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:10.030> when<00:03:10.210> I<00:03:10.240> was<00:03:10.420> setting<00:03:10.780> this<00:03:10.930> whole

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
joints and when I was setting this whole

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.100 
joints and when I was setting this whole
thing<00:03:11.380> in<00:03:11.500> place<00:03:12.510> then<00:03:13.510> what<00:03:13.660> I've<00:03:13.810> done<00:03:13.930> is

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
thing in place then what I've done is

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.410 
thing in place then what I've done is
I've<00:03:14.290> put<00:03:14.370> shims<00:03:15.370> underneath<00:03:15.760> here<00:03:16.060> that's

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
I've put shims underneath here that's

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.120 
I've put shims underneath here that's
how<00:03:16.600> I've<00:03:16.750> adjusted<00:03:16.930> this<00:03:17.500> so<00:03:17.710> that<00:03:17.860> this<00:03:17.950> was

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
how I've adjusted this so that this was

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.230 
how I've adjusted this so that this was
level<00:03:18.430> up<00:03:18.550> above<00:03:19.050> and<00:03:20.050> then<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.770> the<00:03:21.430> steel

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
level up above and then the the steel

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.920 
level up above and then the the steel
shoes<00:03:22.600> that<00:03:22.960> the<00:03:23.800> bridge<00:03:24.190> sits<00:03:24.550> on<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:25.750> you

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
shoes that the bridge sits on that you

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.460 
shoes that the bridge sits on that you
saw<00:03:26.290> earlier<00:03:26.470> where<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.780> spray<00:03:28.780> painted<00:03:29.200> in

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
saw earlier where the spray painted in

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.590 
saw earlier where the spray painted in
rust<00:03:29.800> colors<00:03:30.130> they're<00:03:30.790> sitting<00:03:31.150> in<00:03:31.330> on<00:03:31.480> the

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
rust colors they're sitting in on the

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.070 
rust colors they're sitting in on the
top<00:03:31.920> of<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.130> Buckman<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.570> shoes<00:03:34.840> from

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
top of the Buckman and the shoes from

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.950 
top of the Buckman and the shoes from
the<00:03:35.260> trestle<00:03:35.710> or<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.400> bridge<00:03:36.580> are<00:03:37.030> sitting<00:03:37.780> on

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
the trestle or the bridge are sitting on

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:45.150 
the trestle or the bridge are sitting on
it<00:03:38.140> now<00:03:42.030> only<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.060> small<00:03:43.510> perimeter<00:03:44.410> area<00:03:44.740> that

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
it now only a small perimeter area that

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.420 
it now only a small perimeter area that
I<00:03:45.220> mentioned<00:03:45.610> before<00:03:45.670> of<00:03:46.270> these<00:03:46.810> shoes<00:03:47.430> the

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
I mentioned before of these shoes the

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.400 
I mentioned before of these shoes the
shoe<00:03:48.580> place<00:03:48.730> will<00:03:49.360> actually<00:03:49.810> show<00:03:50.080> but<00:03:50.290> it

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
shoe place will actually show but it

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.080 
shoe place will actually show but it
it's<00:03:50.800> a<00:03:50.920> little<00:03:51.100> easier<00:03:51.400> to<00:03:51.460> prefinished<00:03:51.850> I

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
it's a little easier to prefinished I

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.850 
it's a little easier to prefinished I
was<00:03:52.210> ahead<00:03:52.300> of<00:03:52.420> time<00:03:52.690> and<00:03:53.260> you<00:03:53.320> can<00:03:53.560> see<00:03:53.710> them

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
was ahead of time and you can see them

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.600 
was ahead of time and you can see them
on<00:03:53.950> opposite<00:03:54.760> sides<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.950> ones<00:03:57.160> on<00:03:57.370> one

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
on opposite sides and the ones on one

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.140 
on opposite sides and the ones on one
end<00:03:57.850> actually<00:03:58.810> sit<00:03:59.050> on<00:03:59.080> roller<00:03:59.560> bearings

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
end actually sit on roller bearings

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.300 
end actually sit on roller bearings
because<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.300> trestle<00:04:01.780> does<00:04:02.500> have<00:04:02.920> some

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
because the trestle does have some

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.150 
because the trestle does have some
extension<00:04:04.000> with<00:04:04.180> heat<00:04:04.420> as<00:04:04.680> in<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.800> daytime

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.780 
will come down here with rubble on top
and<00:05:28.780> it'll<00:05:29.470> actually<00:05:29.560> come<00:05:29.950> down<00:05:30.010> the<00:05:30.520> side

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
and it'll actually come down the side

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.870 
and it'll actually come down the side
here<00:05:31.210> and<00:05:31.360> into<00:05:31.690> this<00:05:32.580> retaining<00:05:33.580> wall<00:05:33.850> here
