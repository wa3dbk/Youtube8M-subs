00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.500
 Hi girls, I hope you also have the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.480
 today I will be teaching you 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.430
 how to make this simple makeup to 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.280
 Water proof and also with protection 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.290
 solar perfect for those beach days and 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.700
 other tub that has nothing wrong with 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.380
 one put on makeup a little 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.420
 any of those two sites also 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.089
 I will be designing everything that 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.589
 I carry in my pool bag that is not 

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:36.749
 too much but those are the ways 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:39.920
 I want to show so I'm going to start 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:39.920
 I hope you enjoy it 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.670
 The first thing I like to use and 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.649
 It is always very moisturizing in the face 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.879
 contain sunscreen and my favorite 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.129
 it is this that maintains the brand it is 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.839
 filtering 30 in additional free 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.579
 oils so it's really hot 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.180
 is supposed to control the fat a 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.180
 a little bit better 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.560
 to create a good foundation of makeup 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.030
 it lasts a little longer and in 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.160
 addition to doing it almost waterproof 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.020
 I'm going to be applying this first of 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.700
 face of the mack brand that is being 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.330
 matificantes so it's supposed to help 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.330
 a lot 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.750
 now he is covering some tasks that 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.330
 I have the skin using this concealer 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.610
 of the mack brand is called phoenix studio 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:26.220
 concealer contains 35 of sunscreen 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.220
 and so they are left mittens ln w 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.060
 I almost never apply the areas because 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.979
 it's too thick but they're 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.979
 blurring everything with blades 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.369
 good to cover my dark circles I'll be 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.500
 using this palette of connectors 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.210
 make make forever mark all are a 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.840
 water proof that's why I love it so much 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.840
 of colors 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.620
 I recommend using a base to go to 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.900
 the beach the pool because 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.030
 They are definitely too thick if 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.099
 I recommend some I lived with some 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.750
 Moisturizer a color most of 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.700
 Sometimes these include sunscreen 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.470
 what is very very good something that I 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.909
 really like the studio fix theme is 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.459
 also being a powder to do for is 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.900
 natural well covers to perfection and goes 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.549
 to be the only thing that I will be applying 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.780
 in today so I'm going to use my 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.780
 brochita of the sewing brand 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.900
 I personally do not like to use 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.880
 shadows but if I'm going to cover these 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.530
 blessings and imperfections that I have in 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.420
 the eyelid and for that I will be 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.640
 using this cream shadow the brand 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.410
 wrong in the tone this thinks that comes 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.360
 being the color of my skin in cantalejo 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.569
 that contains acrylic and alone to test 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.569
 of water 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.670
 to give a little bit of color but not 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.650
 it looks so exaggerated I like it 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.970
 uses some hard water proof line 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.610
 like this that you see here from the brand 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.590
 urban and 24/7 this is called electric 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.420
 you come in a very precious turquoise to me 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.490
 I also really like the gold that is 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.900
 golden but today I decided 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.370
 with this turquoise because I brought myself 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.420
 bathroom has this color and what I 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.950
 I always do is that he applied it in 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.190
 lower eyelid well attached to the 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.190
 tabs 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.530
 is free to me I love it because 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.910
 honestly they do not run at all not 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.920
 I'm going to spend so much work on my eyebrows 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.100
 so I'm going to apply a little bit 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.100
 plus 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.840
 well the last thing I'm going to apply 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:49.340
 all is water proof mask 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.319
 obviously my favorite of all 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.680
 times is this that you see here of the brand 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:58.189
 l'oréal is called at least hydro fuse 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.290
 is in the color white or black and I 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:03.790
 love to last a lot of time I do not know 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.790
 Run is a success 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.020
 I like to apply a little 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.020
 only what looks good exaggerated 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.549
 in a matter of blush I like that 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.320
 be cream because they look super 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.570
 natural in addition simply in the 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.250
 water are quite resistant so 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.020
 I will be using this that you see here 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.330
 of the maybelline brand is called mandrin 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.570
 we go english and it's in the color pink 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.570
 long 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.850
 ok now I'm going to apply this treatment 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.530
 of lips of the churros brand has 15 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.950
 of sunscreen and also a little bit 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.950
 color 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.290
 finally I will seal my makeup 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.910
 with the average guard of urbani key that 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.570
 it's a success because it has a lot of 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.570
 sunscreen 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.210
 ah 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.100
 my bag is this that they will go to the brand 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.140
 victoria's secret I bought it I'm going 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.150
 puntocom because this is still a 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.790
 old edition no longer gets me 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.800
 love the color combination the 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.750
 Victoria's Secret name as well as 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.890
 figures in ray stones and in the part 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.690
 inside the only thing that I do not like is that 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.640
 he has no pocket for those 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.870
 quite spaces the first thing that I 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.580
 I wear especially when I go to a 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.780
 pool is a white towel because one 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.610
 he never knows who sleeps in those 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.470
 chairs so what I see is that 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.730
 placed the towel on top of the chair 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.620
 then I have been put on top of the 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.510
 towel and it's a success because the po 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.340
 disinfect with chlorine and it is not going to 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.720
 paint I also have around here protector 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.360
 solar this is from the Hawaiian brand 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.490
 tropic is called silk hide review has 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.680
 15 sunscreen here says it's a 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.150
 Water proof lasts 80 minutes but 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.890
 honestly the most I like that is 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.810
 in the form of spray I also have here 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.610
 these glasses are from the pepsi brand 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.680
 johnson I love studying well the 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.720
 metallic pink the style is pretty 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.430
 classic but oversize as I like 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.990
 also the legs have a little bit of 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.850
 golden and at the end a little hearts 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.140
 subtracted super cute obviously also 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.390
 I'm carrying my cell phone because it's coming 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.790
 being my method of entertainment here 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:12.190
 I read books I get into instagram 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.420
 by phone or listen to music as a 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.100
 difference of the beach in the pool 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.870
 sand mesh I like to use or 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.810
 wear these brand hearing aids 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.270
 Friends are great at seeing 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:25.300
 super cute have these colors like this 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.340
 litmus and tropical media and then 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.110
 include this bag so you do not get 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.910
 are going to damage then another that I always 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.710
 I wear is the dandy keys this comes in a 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:35.200
 cell phone protector proof 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.630
 water basically you put the cell phone the 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.890
 them well well after that you can 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.330
 put on the beach in the pool without 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.620
 no problem and the best of all is 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.090
 that you can continue using it 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.710
 because it's here it's finger-proof 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.330
 I also like to use these gummies 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.650
 spiral shaped asia especially 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.690
 when I want to hold my hair what 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.340
 I have wet because if you use a rubber band 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.930
 traditional tends to the hair area 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.880
 this also I do not like to wear a 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.620
 brush that is the effect of centering 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.660
 so that it would rain wet and that's why 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.010
 I would use the time low teaser but 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.110
 there are other days that also led the 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.820
 comes back another thing that can not be missing are 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.320
 favorite moments of the brands bush 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.300
 obviously I always carry another kind of 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.010
 snacks and things to drink but never 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.320
 in the course ok in this portfolio that what 

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:13.210
 buy also two years ago super 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.800
 cute here I put the money and the 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.660
 cards because honestly I do not 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.160
 they matter if they get wet or good and the last 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.980
 that I have here in the bag is no longer 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.300
 nothing more and it's this silicone primer 

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.520
 that I bought two years ago also in 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.380
 turns only I have two things this 

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.240
 puppy of victoria's secret and the 

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.190
 lip treatment that I wear 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.990
 today of the brand yúgar rose 

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.550
 so far today's video I hope that 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.140
 you liked it let me know in the 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.580
 bottom part what do you carry 

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.830
 in their verse when they go to the beach or the 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.240
 pool I have a lot of curiosity like 

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.740
 always custom I will place everything 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.270
 that I mentioned in the description of the video 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.939
 just in case it does not interest and see you in 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:49.220

00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:52.180
 right now 

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.180
 but
