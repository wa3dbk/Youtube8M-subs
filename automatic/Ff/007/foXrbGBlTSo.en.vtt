00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
put that down in there mix it around and

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.479 
put that down in there mix it around and
now<00:01:48.099> here<00:01:48.670> is<00:01:48.819> our<00:01:49.719> oil<00:01:50.110> and<00:01:50.469> this<00:01:50.799> is<00:01:50.979> pure

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:51.489 
now here is our oil and this is pure

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
those other oils the type i like to use

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.339 
those other oils the type i like to use
for<00:01:57.369> an<00:01:57.579> application<00:01:58.179> like<00:01:58.209> this<00:01:58.569> is<00:01:58.989> only

00:01:59.339 --> 00:01:59.349 
for an application like this is only

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:01.889 
for an application like this is only
this<00:01:59.739> pure<00:02:00.069> olive<00:02:00.369> oil<00:02:00.700> and<00:02:00.879> this<00:02:01.450> happens<00:02:01.840> to

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
this pure olive oil and this happens to

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.740 
this pure olive oil and this happens to
be<00:02:02.020> a<00:02:02.110> three<00:02:02.439> to<00:02:02.560> one<00:02:02.739> ratio<00:02:02.770> so<00:02:03.520> we<00:02:03.700> put<00:02:03.969> six

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
be a three to one ratio so we put six

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.229 
be a three to one ratio so we put six
tablespoons<00:02:05.200> of<00:02:05.770> vinegar<00:02:06.009> so<00:02:06.459> this<00:02:06.640> is<00:02:06.849> my

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:07.239 
tablespoons of vinegar so this is my

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:10.440 
tablespoons of vinegar so this is my
math<00:02:07.450> is<00:02:07.479> right<00:02:07.689> eighteen<00:02:08.640> tablespoons<00:02:09.640> so

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
math is right eighteen tablespoons so

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.660 
math is right eighteen tablespoons so
we'll<00:02:10.660> just<00:02:10.690> dump<00:02:11.019> that<00:02:11.230> right<00:02:11.290> in<00:02:11.739> there<00:02:11.920> now

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
we'll just dump that right in there now

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.640 
we'll just dump that right in there now
in<00:02:12.850> a<00:02:12.880> blender<00:02:13.420> you'd<00:02:13.630> have<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.870> drizzle<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.500> in

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
in a blender you'd have to drizzle it in

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.830 
in a blender you'd have to drizzle it in
to<00:02:15.100> make<00:02:15.250> an<00:02:15.400> emulsification<00:02:15.940> but<00:02:16.510> this<00:02:16.660> thing

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
to make an emulsification but this thing

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:35.809 
to make an emulsification but this thing
is<00:02:16.959> so<00:02:17.139> powerful<00:02:17.380> that<00:02:17.980> watch<00:02:18.639> what<00:02:18.819> happens
