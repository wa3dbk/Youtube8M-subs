hello everybody my name is Nicolas I'm
with<00:00:02.490> redshift<00:00:03.000> in<00:00:03.870> this<00:00:04.049> video<00:00:04.350> we're<00:00:04.500> going

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
with redshift in this video we're going

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.099 
with redshift in this video we're going
to<00:00:04.650> show<00:00:04.740> you<00:00:04.920> some<00:00:05.190> live<00:00:05.370> rendering<00:00:05.879> in<00:00:06.420> XSI

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
to show you some live rendering in XSI

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.070 
to show you some live rendering in XSI
so<00:00:07.830> we're<00:00:08.099> running<00:00:08.220> Softimage<00:00:08.970> 2012<00:00:09.719> Service

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
so we're running Softimage 2012 Service

Pack 1 64-bit on windows 7 we've got the

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.709 
Pack 1 64-bit on windows 7 we've got the
classroom<00:00:14.130> scene<00:00:14.400> here<00:00:14.610> loaded<00:00:15.000> some<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.660> you

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
classroom scene here loaded some of you

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.720 
classroom scene here loaded some of you
might<00:00:15.929> be<00:00:16.109> familiar<00:00:16.320> with<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.859> from<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.310> xsi

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
might be familiar with it from the xsi

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.670 
might be familiar with it from the xsi
mailing<00:00:18.119> list<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:19.260> we're<00:00:19.350> going<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.500> go<00:00:19.590> ahead

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
mailing list so we're going to go ahead

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.029 
mailing list so we're going to go ahead
and<00:00:19.920> first<00:00:20.160> just<00:00:20.490> do<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.730> straight<00:00:21.270> up<00:00:21.390> render

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
and first just do a straight up render

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.380 
and first just do a straight up render
so<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.279> using<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.609> irradiance<00:00:24.060> point

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
so this is using the irradiance point

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.439 
so this is using the irradiance point
cloud<00:00:24.630> for<00:00:25.109> secondary<00:00:25.590> bounces<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.490> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
cloud for secondary bounces and the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.040 
cloud for secondary bounces and the
irradiance<00:00:27.750> cache<00:00:27.840> for<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.320> primaries<00:00:28.890> and

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
irradiance cache for the primaries and

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.780 
irradiance cache for the primaries and
as<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.650> can<00:00:31.740> see<00:00:31.800> it's<00:00:32.099> chewing<00:00:32.369> through<00:00:32.640> this

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
as you can see it's chewing through this

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.100 
as you can see it's chewing through this
scene<00:00:33.059> very<00:00:33.750> quickly<00:00:35.570> it's<00:00:36.570> almost<00:00:36.750> done<00:00:36.960> the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
scene very quickly it's almost done the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.490 
scene very quickly it's almost done the
irradiance<00:00:37.380> cache<00:00:37.530> already<00:00:38.239> so<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.719> fact<00:00:40.020> you

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
irradiance cache already so in fact you

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.470 
irradiance cache already so in fact you
could<00:00:40.649> actually<00:00:40.770> get<00:00:41.160> even<00:00:41.610> better<00:00:41.760> faster

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
could actually get even better faster

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.410 
could actually get even better faster
times<00:00:42.719> with<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.340> by<00:00:44.340> turning<00:00:44.820> down<00:00:45.149> your

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
times with this by turning down your

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.389 
times with this by turning down your
settings<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.809> bit<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.140> using<00:00:46.559> quite<00:00:46.890> high

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
settings a bit this is using quite high

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.910 
settings a bit this is using quite high
settings<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.469> so<00:00:49.469> if<00:00:49.590> you're<00:00:49.710> just

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
settings and so if you're just

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.910 
settings and so if you're just
previewing<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.969> don't<00:00:51.149> need<00:00:51.920> absolutely

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
previewing and you don't need absolutely

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.400 
previewing and you don't need absolutely
perfect<00:00:53.370> results<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.899> could<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.260> could

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
perfect results and you could you could

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.400 
perfect results and you could you could
get<00:00:55.530> even<00:00:55.710> faster<00:00:56.070> render<00:00:56.309> times<00:00:57.079> as<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.289> can

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
get even faster render times as you can

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.049 
get even faster render times as you can
see<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.890> even<00:00:59.010> with<00:00:59.219> these<00:00:59.309> high<00:00:59.579> settings

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
see that even with these high settings

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.549 
see that even with these high settings
we're<00:01:00.809> getting<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.649> almost<00:01:01.890> done<00:01:02.160> here<00:01:02.489> and

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
we're getting it's almost done here and

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.810 
we're getting it's almost done here and
in<00:01:04.559> fact<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:04.920> scene<00:01:05.129> isn't<00:01:05.309> even<00:01:05.549> using

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
in fact this scene isn't even using

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.490 
in fact this scene isn't even using
portal<00:01:06.180> lights<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.780> poor<00:01:07.110> lights<00:01:07.350> would

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
portal lights and poor lights would

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.830 
portal lights and poor lights would
definitely<00:01:07.830> help<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.180> scene<00:01:09.180> clean<00:01:09.450> up<00:01:09.600> even

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
definitely help this scene clean up even

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.340 
definitely help this scene clean up even
quicker<00:01:12.799> so<00:01:13.799> there<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.159> go<00:01:14.189> it's<00:01:14.340> done<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:16.200> that

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
quicker so there we go it's done so that

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.200 
quicker so there we go it's done so that
was<00:01:16.439> great<00:01:16.610> next<00:01:17.610> thing<00:01:17.759> we're<00:01:17.880> going<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.030> do

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
was great next thing we're going to do

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.859 
was great next thing we're going to do
is<00:01:18.479> turn<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.049> progressive<00:01:19.619> rendering<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.869> in

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
is turn on progressive rendering and in

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.240 
is turn on progressive rendering and in
this<00:01:22.020> mode<00:01:22.290> we're<00:01:22.470> going<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:22.740> able<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.040> do

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
this mode we're going to be able to do

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.300 
this mode we're going to be able to do
some<00:01:23.460> live<00:01:23.640> edits<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:26.100> scene

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
some live edits and have the scene

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.760 
some live edits and have the scene
update<00:01:26.729> very<00:01:27.000> quickly<00:01:27.330> give<00:01:27.659> us<00:01:27.810> really<00:01:28.560> quick

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
update very quickly give us really quick

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.100 
update very quickly give us really quick
feedback<00:01:29.210> so<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.509> see<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.780> started

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
feedback so as you can see it started

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.020 
feedback so as you can see it started
off<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> little<00:01:31.380> bit<00:01:31.650> noisy<00:01:31.799> or<00:01:32.610> quite<00:01:32.880> noisy

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
off a little bit noisy or quite noisy

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.990 
off a little bit noisy or quite noisy
but<00:01:33.509> cleaned<00:01:33.840> up<00:01:33.990> very<00:01:34.200> quickly<00:01:34.880> now<00:01:35.880> I'm

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
but cleaned up very quickly now I'm

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.109 
but cleaned up very quickly now I'm
going<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.240> move<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.110> Sun<00:01:37.670> lower<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> sky

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
going to move the Sun lower in the sky

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.889 
going to move the Sun lower in the sky
to<00:01:39.990> get<00:01:40.140> more<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.409> sunset<00:01:40.890> effect<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:42.180> you

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
to get more of a sunset effect and you

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.370 
to get more of a sunset effect and you
can<00:01:42.930> see<00:01:44.149> we<00:01:45.149> get<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.360> really<00:01:45.720> good<00:01:46.020> idea<00:01:46.140> of

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
can see we get a really good idea of

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.510 
can see we get a really good idea of
what<00:01:46.590> that's<00:01:46.680> going<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.920> look<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.460> our

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
what that's going to look like in our

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.569 
what that's going to look like in our
final<00:01:47.939> render<00:01:48.299> very<00:01:48.899> very<00:01:49.140> quickly<00:01:49.520> so<00:01:50.520> I'm

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
final render very very quickly so I'm

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.130 
final render very very quickly so I'm
going<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.790> move<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.030> back<00:01:51.060> up<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.899> tiny

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
going to move it back up a just a tiny

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.319 
going to move it back up a just a tiny
bit<00:01:52.439> just<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:53.460> give<00:01:53.640> some<00:01:53.820> more<00:01:53.970> light<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
bit just to give some more light in the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.730 
bit just to give some more light in the
room<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:54.899> can<00:01:55.049> see<00:01:55.200> what's<00:01:55.350> going<00:01:55.560> on

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
room just so we can see what's going on

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.370 
room just so we can see what's going on
and<00:01:56.210> I'm<00:01:57.210> going<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.390> go<00:01:57.509> ahead<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.840> add<00:01:57.990> some

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
and I'm going to go ahead and add some

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.850 
and I'm going to go ahead and add some
geometry<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.430> here<00:01:59.790> show<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.420> some<00:02:00.860> material

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
geometry in here show you some material

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.410 
geometry in here show you some material
tweaking<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.810> I've<00:02:03.869> added<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.170> sphere<00:02:05.420> I'm

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
tweaking so I've added a sphere I'm

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.309 
tweaking so I've added a sphere I'm
going<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.689> shrink<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.259> little<00:02:07.439> bit<00:02:07.649> and

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
going to shrink it a little bit and

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.580 
going to shrink it a little bit and
tessellate<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.470> some

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
tessellate it some

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.110 
tessellate it some
and<00:02:13.590> I'm<00:02:14.070> going<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:15.800> move<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.920> closer<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.760> the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
and I'm going to move a closer to the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.850 
and I'm going to move a closer to the
middle<00:02:19.070> of<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:21.360> room<00:02:21.600> so<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:21.960> we<00:02:22.200> can<00:02:22.410> see<00:02:22.710> it

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
middle of the room so that we can see it

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.070 
middle of the room so that we can see it
better<00:02:25.820> I'll<00:02:26.820> go<00:02:27.090> ahead<00:02:27.210> and<00:02:27.450> check<00:02:27.930> out<00:02:28.050> the

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
better I'll go ahead and check out the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.330 
better I'll go ahead and check out the
material<00:02:28.860> here<00:02:29.310> on<00:02:30.980> this<00:02:31.980> guy<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:34.130> let's<00:02:35.130> add

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
material here on this guy and let's add

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:45.670 
material here on this guy and let's add
a<00:02:35.480> standard<00:02:36.480> architectural

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.210 

and<00:02:46.680> go<00:02:47.340> ahead<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.760> make<00:02:47.880> this<00:02:48.890> let's<00:02:49.890> move

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
and go ahead and make this let's move

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.820 
and go ahead and make this let's move
these<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:51.750> we<00:02:51.840> can<00:02:51.870> see<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.260> sphere<00:02:52.560> we're

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
these so we can see the sphere we're

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.710 
these so we can see the sphere we're
going<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.010> go<00:02:53.100> ahead<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.400> make<00:02:53.520> this<00:02:53.730> very

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
going to go ahead and make this very

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.600 
going to go ahead and make this very
reflective<00:02:55.140> I'm<00:02:55.830> just<00:02:56.040> going<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.190> change<00:02:56.370> some

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
reflective I'm just going to change some

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.010 
reflective I'm just going to change some
settings<00:02:57.890> real<00:02:58.890> quick<00:02:59.220> here<00:02:59.750> this<00:03:00.750> is<00:03:00.930> not

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
settings real quick here this is not

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.510 
settings real quick here this is not
meant<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.290> look<00:03:01.500> great<00:03:01.770> this<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.160> just<00:03:02.370> to

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
meant to look great this is just to

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.800 
meant to look great this is just to
demonstrate<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.210> I'm<00:03:03.300> going<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.510> make<00:03:03.660> it

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
demonstrate so I'm going to make it

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.210 
demonstrate so I'm going to make it
transparent<00:03:04.710> as<00:03:04.980> well<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:07.680> there<00:03:07.800> we<00:03:07.920> go<00:03:08.040> we've

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
transparent as well so there we go we've

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.950 
transparent as well so there we go we've
got<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.460> glass<00:03:09.300> type<00:03:09.720> ball<00:03:10.470> there<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:12.120> let's<00:03:12.840> go

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
got a glass type ball there and let's go

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.630 
got a glass type ball there and let's go
ahead<00:03:13.020> and<00:03:13.230> set<00:03:13.410> some<00:03:13.560> keys<00:03:13.890> we'll<00:03:14.460> show<00:03:14.610> you

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
ahead and set some keys we'll show you

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.940 
ahead and set some keys we'll show you
some<00:03:14.730> motion<00:03:15.210> blur<00:03:15.410> let's<00:03:16.410> move<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.860> here

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
some motion blur let's move it to here

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.030 
some motion blur let's move it to here
to<00:03:17.100> one<00:03:17.700> side<00:03:18.830> key<00:03:20.930> other<00:03:21.930> side<00:03:22.290> as<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.920> can

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
to one side key other side as you can

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.420 
to one side key other side as you can
probably<00:03:23.160> tell<00:03:23.340> I'm<00:03:23.610> not<00:03:23.790> an<00:03:23.910> artist<00:03:25.430> but

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
probably tell I'm not an artist but

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.520 
probably tell I'm not an artist but
it'll<00:03:26.820> have<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.180> do<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.630> course<00:03:28.050> I<00:03:28.200> keyed<00:03:28.410> on

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
it'll have to do of course I keyed on

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.660 
it'll have to do of course I keyed on
the<00:03:28.620> same<00:03:28.800> frame<00:03:29.100> so<00:03:29.310> let's<00:03:29.460> try<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:29.820> again

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.660 

over<00:03:37.490> key<00:03:38.840> that's<00:03:39.840> better<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.950> I'm<00:03:41.520> going<00:03:41.640> to

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
over key that's better and I'm going to

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.030 
over key that's better and I'm going to
go<00:03:41.790> ahead<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.150> turn<00:03:42.330> on<00:03:42.450> motion<00:03:42.840> blur<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:46.260> I'm

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
go ahead and turn on motion blur and I'm

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.230 
go ahead and turn on motion blur and I'm
going<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.250> increase<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:49.470> frame<00:03:49.770> time

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
going to increase the the frame time

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.910 
going to increase the the frame time
just<00:03:51.240> to<00:03:51.390> exaggerate<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.990> effect<00:03:52.350> for<00:03:52.650> so

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
just to exaggerate the effect for so

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.420 
just to exaggerate the effect for so
that<00:03:53.070> you<00:03:53.130> can<00:03:53.280> see<00:03:54.830> but<00:03:55.830> you<00:03:55.890> can<00:03:56.040> see<00:03:56.250> the

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
that you can see but you can see the

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.800 
that you can see but you can see the
sphere<00:03:56.790> is<00:03:57.030> now<00:03:57.240> blurry<00:03:58.200> back<00:03:58.470> there<00:03:59.720> I'm<00:04:00.720> in

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
sphere is now blurry back there I'm in

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.300 
sphere is now blurry back there I'm in
fact<00:04:01.020> maybe<00:04:01.170> even<00:04:01.290> too<00:04:01.770> blurry<00:04:02.010> so<00:04:02.160> let's

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
fact maybe even too blurry so let's

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.450 
fact maybe even too blurry so let's
let's<00:04:02.550> just<00:04:02.730> turn<00:04:02.910> that<00:04:04.010> dial<00:04:05.010> that<00:04:05.250> back<00:04:05.310> a

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
let's just turn that dial that back a

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:14.930 
let's just turn that dial that back a
little<00:04:05.640> bit<00:04:08.210> there<00:04:09.210> we<00:04:09.330> go<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:13.730> that's<00:04:14.730> about

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
little bit there we go and that's about

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.720 
little bit there we go and that's about
it<00:04:15.060> so<00:04:15.210> let's<00:04:15.630> say<00:04:15.870> let's<00:04:16.350> finish<00:04:17.130> up<00:04:17.370> by<00:04:17.520> just

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
it so let's say let's finish up by just

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.360 
it so let's say let's finish up by just
doing<00:04:17.820> a<00:04:18.000> final<00:04:18.150> render<00:04:18.570> here<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:19.250> turn<00:04:20.250> off

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
doing a final render here and turn off

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.540 
doing a final render here and turn off
progressive<00:04:20.880> rendering<00:04:21.299> and<00:04:22.280> let<00:04:23.280> it<00:04:23.400> rip

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
progressive rendering and let it rip

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:31.530 
progressive rendering and let it rip
through

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.590 

you<00:04:32.110> can<00:04:32.260> see<00:04:32.530> we're<00:04:32.950> doing<00:04:33.850> a<00:04:34.060> radiance<00:04:34.360> cache

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
you can see we're doing a radiance cache

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.080 
you can see we're doing a radiance cache
here<00:04:38.250> this<00:04:39.250> point<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.610> motion<00:04:39.880> blur<00:04:40.060> is

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
here this point the motion blur is

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.970 
here this point the motion blur is
looking<00:04:40.480> pretty<00:04:40.870> grainy<00:04:41.260> but<00:04:41.620> it's<00:04:41.770> going<00:04:41.920> to

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
looking pretty grainy but it's going to

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.680 
looking pretty grainy but it's going to
clean<00:04:42.160> up<00:04:42.190> nicely<00:04:42.550> in<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:42.970> final<00:04:43.270> render<00:04:43.390> pass

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
clean up nicely in the final render pass

00:04:43.690 --> 00:05:04.149 
clean up nicely in the final render pass
with<00:04:43.990> our<00:04:44.340> relatively<00:04:45.340> high<00:04:45.610> AAA<00:04:45.910> settings

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:06.850 

so<00:05:04.729> I<00:05:04.759> hope<00:05:05.029> this<00:05:05.209> video<00:05:05.389> gives<00:05:05.719> you<00:05:05.899> a<00:05:05.929> good

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
so I hope this video gives you a good

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.399
