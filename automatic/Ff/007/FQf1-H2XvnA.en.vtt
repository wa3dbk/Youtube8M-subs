1-sided<00:00:31.439> 2-sided<00:00:31.880> three-sided<00:00:32.880> if<00:00:33.030> you're

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
1-sided 2-sided three-sided if you're

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.069

make the trench but after this video you
should<00:00:43.500> get<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> better<00:00:44.070> idea<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.520> what<00:00:45.120> your

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
should get a better idea of what your

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.400 
should get a better idea of what your
restraints<00:00:46.170> are<00:00:47.719> now<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:49.020> use<00:00:49.200> any

restraints are now you can use any
colors<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.800> want<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.550> I'm<00:00:50.640> going<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.000> be

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
colors you want but I'm going to be

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.180 
colors you want but I'm going to be
using<00:00:51.239> some<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.840> these<00:00:51.930> earth<00:00:52.140> tone<00:00:52.469> colors<00:00:52.890> uh

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
using some of these earth tone colors uh

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.970 
using some of these earth tone colors uh
last<00:00:54.180> time<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.449> did<00:00:54.719> anything<00:00:54.989> with<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.739> dredge

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
last time I did anything with the dredge

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.229 
last time I did anything with the dredge
I<00:00:56.160> used<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.760> lot<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.030> my<00:00:58.370> Gray's<00:00:59.370> because<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.000> just

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
I used a lot of my Gray's because I just

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.910 
I used a lot of my Gray's because I just
have<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.600> many<00:01:00.690> more<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.079> them<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.590> didn't

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
have so many more of them but I didn't

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.950 
have so many more of them but I didn't
quite<00:01:02.100> like<00:01:02.309> their<00:01:02.520> look<00:01:02.789> but<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.600> had<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.840> go

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
quite like their look but I had to go

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.539 
quite like their look but I had to go
with<00:01:04.080> them<00:01:04.229> because<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.500> didn't<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:04.920> as<00:01:05.220> many

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
with them because I didn't have as many

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.590 
with them because I didn't have as many
of<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.700> earth<00:01:05.820> tones<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.240> I'm<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.420> going<00:01:06.570> to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
of the earth tones so I'm just going to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.210 
of the earth tones so I'm just going to
go<00:01:06.750> with<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.960> tan<00:01:07.229> see<00:01:07.560> how<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.860> goes<00:01:08.040> this

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
go with the tan see how that goes this

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.109

time another thing you're going to need
is<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> lot<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:12.830> bricks<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.070> aren't<00:01:14.580> going

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
is a lot of just bricks you aren't going

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.520 
is a lot of just bricks you aren't going
to<00:01:14.909> show<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.780> trench<00:01:16.080> but<00:01:16.259> you're<00:01:16.409> going

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
to show in the trench but you're going

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.830 
to show in the trench but you're going
to<00:01:16.619> need<00:01:16.770> them<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.040> build<00:01:17.220> up<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.520> sides

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
to need them to build up the sides

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.510 
to need them to build up the sides
underneath<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.080> different<00:01:19.770> things<00:01:19.979> just<00:01:20.159> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
underneath and different things just to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.880 
underneath and different things just to
hold<00:01:21.180> places<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.900> support<00:01:22.259> things<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.710> get<00:01:22.830> a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
hold places and support things so get a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.039 
hold places and support things so get a
box<00:01:23.100> full<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.460> bricks<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.420> won't<00:01:24.630> really<00:01:24.780> need

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
box full of bricks you won't really need

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.539 
box full of bricks you won't really need
to<00:01:25.140> show<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.650> they<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:25.890> be<00:01:25.979> any<00:01:26.130> color<00:01:26.369> you

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549

to show so they can be any color you
want<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:28.549> obviously<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.729> first<00:01:29.759> thing<00:01:30.090> we

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
want so obviously the first thing we

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.240 
want so obviously the first thing we
want<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.360> do<00:01:30.479> here<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.750> build<00:01:31.439> up<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.710> base<00:01:31.950> of

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
want to do here is build up the base of

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.899 
want to do here is build up the base of
the<00:01:32.700> trench<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.479> take<00:01:33.720> some<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.049> those<00:01:34.909> just

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
the trench so take some of those just

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.490 
the trench so take some of those just
plain<00:01:36.299> old<00:01:36.479> pieces<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.049> need<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:39.500> build

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
plain old pieces you need and build

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.130 
plain old pieces you need and build
those<00:01:40.710> up<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.240> form<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.540> bottom<00:01:42.780> of

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
those up so you can form the bottom of

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.039 
those up so you can form the bottom of
your<00:01:43.500> trench<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.310> then<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.390> take<00:01:45.630> either

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
your trench and then you can take either

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.410 
your trench and then you can take either
these<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.130> be<00:01:47.220> solid<00:01:47.490> bricks<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:48.000> them<00:01:48.240> use

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
these can be solid bricks to them use

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.690 
these can be solid bricks to them use
the<00:01:48.570> plate<00:01:48.810> form<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.380> just<00:01:49.890> lay<00:01:50.100> those<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.490> top

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the plate form and just lay those on top

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.219 
the plate form and just lay those on top
when<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.360> everything<00:01:51.659> there<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.990> course

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
when you have everything there of course

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.109 
when you have everything there of course
and<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:53.600> will<00:01:54.600> form<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.189> floor<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.460> your

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
and that will form the floor of your

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.249 
and that will form the floor of your
trench<00:01:58.189> so<00:01:59.189> here<00:01:59.399> we<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.939> floor<00:02:00.509> base<00:02:01.020> of

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
trench so here we have the floor base of

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.740 
trench so here we have the floor base of
our<00:02:01.380> trench<00:02:02.119> obviously<00:02:03.119> yours<00:02:03.329> just<00:02:03.509> going<00:02:03.689> to

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
our trench obviously yours just going to

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.690 
our trench obviously yours just going to
be<00:02:03.840> bigger<00:02:04.049> or<00:02:04.259> however<00:02:04.890> big<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.280> want<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.579> to

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
be bigger or however big you want it to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.930 
be bigger or however big you want it to
be<00:02:06.770> next<00:02:07.770> up<00:02:08.009> we're<00:02:08.220> going<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.459> have<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.759> build

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
be next up we're going to have to build

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.630 
be next up we're going to have to build
the<00:02:09.119> walls<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.840> trench<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.319> add<00:02:10.500> one<00:02:11.400> more

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
the walls of the trench so add one more

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.800 
the walls of the trench so add one more
layer

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
layer

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.710 
layer
your<00:02:13.440> plain<00:02:14.280> old<00:02:14.310> bricks<00:02:14.849> on<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.180> side<00:02:15.420> and

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
your plain old bricks on the side and

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.790 
your plain old bricks on the side and
then<00:02:16.500> you're<00:02:16.590> going<00:02:16.770> from<00:02:17.130> there<00:02:17.370> build<00:02:17.910> up

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
then you're going from there build up

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.740 
then you're going from there build up
with<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:20.340> same<00:02:20.580> color<00:02:20.849> as<00:02:21.030> your<00:02:21.060> floor<00:02:21.420> or

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
with the same color as your floor or

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.250 
with the same color as your floor or
whatever<00:02:22.110> tones<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.950> want<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.310> use<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:24.260> your

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
whatever tones you want to use and your

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.160 
whatever tones you want to use and your
trench<00:02:25.530> usually<00:02:26.190> will<00:02:26.280> be<00:02:26.400> about<00:02:26.640> five<00:02:27.000> or<00:02:27.480> six

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
trench usually will be about five or six

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.300 
trench usually will be about five or six
high<00:02:29.569> just<00:02:30.569> get<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> Lego<00:02:30.959> person<00:02:31.380> out<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.830> see

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
high just get a Lego person out and see

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.100 
high just get a Lego person out and see
how<00:02:32.519> many<00:02:32.700> you'll<00:02:32.910> need<00:02:33.120> lego<00:02:33.750> people<00:02:34.019> are

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
how many you'll need lego people are

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.640 
how many you'll need lego people are
usually<00:02:34.410> about<00:02:34.530> four<00:02:34.950> four<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.640> half<00:02:36.650> so

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
usually about four four and a half so

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.050 
usually about four four and a half so
depending<00:02:38.099> on<00:02:38.130> how<00:02:38.250> big<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.550> want<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.819> to<00:02:38.910> be

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
depending on how big you want it to be

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.520 
depending on how big you want it to be
to<00:02:39.269> protect<00:02:39.420> your<00:02:39.750> figure

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
to protect your figure

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.470 
to protect your figure
so<00:02:40.709> here<00:02:40.890> I've<00:02:41.040> created<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.670> walls<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.239> my

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
so here I've created the walls of my

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.740 
so here I've created the walls of my
trench<00:02:42.959> they<00:02:43.920> are<00:02:44.130> one<00:02:44.430> two<00:02:44.819> three<00:02:44.850> four<00:02:45.239> five

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
trench they are one two three four five

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.170 
trench they are one two three four five
six<00:02:46.200> high<00:02:46.610> so<00:02:47.610> if<00:02:47.700> you're<00:02:47.819> going<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.060> do<00:02:48.150> a

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
six high so if you're going to do a

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.850 
six high so if you're going to do a
trench<00:02:48.510> this<00:02:48.720> big<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.260> want<00:02:49.500> there<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.680> be

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
trench this big and you want there to be

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.220 
trench this big and you want there to be
kind<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.280> lip<00:02:50.549> for<00:02:51.299> your<00:02:51.390> soldiers<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.840> stand

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
kind of a lip for your soldiers to stand

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.949 
kind of a lip for your soldiers to stand
on<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.950> can<00:02:53.100> start<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.549> up<00:02:53.700> too<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.420> I'm

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
on you can start that up too and I'm

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.539 
on you can start that up too and I'm
going<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.140> use<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.290> double<00:02:55.739> block<00:02:56.040> so<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.370> the

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
going to use a double block so that the

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:57.920 
going to use a double block so that the
colors<00:02:56.819> don't<00:02:56.850> overlap<00:02:57.299> because<00:02:57.510> then<00:02:57.720> if<00:02:57.840> you

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
colors don't overlap because then if you

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.979 
colors don't overlap because then if you
look<00:02:58.140> in<00:02:58.319> you'll<00:02:58.920> see<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.190> split<00:02:59.760> of<00:03:00.000> where<00:03:00.720> and

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
look in you'll see a split of where and

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.740 
look in you'll see a split of where and
you<00:03:01.049> can<00:03:01.200> see<00:03:01.349> the<00:03:01.530> blocks<00:03:02.340> underneath<00:03:02.790> and

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
you can see the blocks underneath and

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.690 
you can see the blocks underneath and
I'm<00:03:03.870> going<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.049> have<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.590> single<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.580> then

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
I'm going to have a single and then

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.720 
I'm going to have a single and then
another<00:03:05.849> double<00:03:06.269> and<00:03:06.450> then<00:03:06.930> it's<00:03:07.049> single<00:03:07.700> so<00:03:08.700> I

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
another double and then it's single so I

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.789 
another double and then it's single so I
did<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:08.940> little<00:03:09.090> bit<00:03:09.269> of<00:03:09.299> modifying<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:10.230> work<00:03:10.530> in

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
did a little bit of modifying to work in

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.089 
did a little bit of modifying to work in
a<00:03:11.130> ladder<00:03:12.030> here<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.720> trench<00:03:12.989> it's<00:03:13.739> not<00:03:13.920> too

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
a ladder here to the trench it's not too

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.440 
a ladder here to the trench it's not too
big<00:03:14.220> of<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.340> deal<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:14.730> had<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:14.970> redo<00:03:15.180> everything

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
big of a deal I had to redo everything

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.970 
big of a deal I had to redo everything
so<00:03:15.870> if<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.049> want<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.260> put<00:03:16.380> these<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:16.560> kind<00:03:16.920> of

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
so if you want to put these in kind of

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.490 
so if you want to put these in kind of
plan<00:03:17.130> ahead<00:03:17.690> basically<00:03:18.690> what<00:03:18.840> you'll<00:03:19.019> do<00:03:19.200> is

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
plan ahead basically what you'll do is

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.810 
plan ahead basically what you'll do is
you'll<00:03:19.799> dig<00:03:20.430> one<00:03:20.760> piece<00:03:21.030> in<00:03:21.209> front<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:22.820> then

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
you'll dig one piece in front and then

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.060 
you'll dig one piece in front and then
up<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.090> base<00:03:25.049> or<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.470> could<00:03:25.620> just<00:03:25.769> have<00:03:25.920> it

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
up to base or you could just have it

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.890 
up to base or you could just have it
flat<00:03:26.579> I<00:03:26.880> don't<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.269> doesn't<00:03:27.299> really<00:03:27.600> matter

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
flat I don't it doesn't really matter

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.080 
flat I don't it doesn't really matter
and<00:03:28.049> then<00:03:28.709> just<00:03:28.890> all<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.160> way<00:03:29.190> up<00:03:29.400> your<00:03:29.819> ladder

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
and then just all the way up your ladder

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.539 
and then just all the way up your ladder
and<00:03:30.329> then<00:03:30.810> obviously<00:03:31.230> get<00:03:31.650> your<00:03:31.799> ladder<00:03:31.980> you

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
and then obviously get your ladder you

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:33.920 
and then obviously get your ladder you
get<00:03:32.700> two<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:32.910> these<00:03:33.090> little<00:03:33.420> pieces<00:03:33.569> on<00:03:33.840> the

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
get two of these little pieces on the

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
get two of these little pieces on the
bottom<00:03:35.569> stick<00:03:36.569> it<00:03:36.690> in<00:03:36.780> there<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.260> if<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.739> want

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
bottom stick it in there and if you want

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.319 
bottom stick it in there and if you want
you<00:03:38.069> can<00:03:38.160> put<00:03:38.310> this<00:03:38.400> little<00:03:38.609> pole<00:03:38.850> on<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.090> top

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
you can put this little pole on the top

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.069 
you can put this little pole on the top
so<00:03:40.109> it'll<00:03:40.260> stay<00:03:40.470> in<00:03:40.680> better<00:03:41.780> okay<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:42.810> I've

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
so it'll stay in better okay so I've

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.479 
so it'll stay in better okay so I've
added<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.440> few<00:03:43.470> more<00:03:43.799> things<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.130> make<00:03:44.340> it<00:03:44.459> look

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
added a few more things to make it look

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.270 
added a few more things to make it look
like<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.790> trench<00:03:45.440> what<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:46.470> would<00:03:46.680> advise<00:03:46.920> doing

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
like a trench what I would advise doing

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.710 
like a trench what I would advise doing
is<00:03:47.400> making<00:03:47.639> the<00:03:47.880> walls<00:03:48.090> look<00:03:48.359> a<00:03:48.420> little<00:03:48.569> bit

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
is making the walls look a little bit

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.539 
is making the walls look a little bit
more<00:03:48.870> sporadic<00:03:49.170> than<00:03:49.680> straight<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.220> can<00:03:50.400> make

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
more sporadic than straight you can make

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.150 
more sporadic than straight you can make
them<00:03:50.760> curved<00:03:51.269> like<00:03:51.510> this<00:03:51.540> on<00:03:51.930> both<00:03:52.230> sides<00:03:52.680> you

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
them curved like this on both sides you

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.059 
them curved like this on both sides you
can<00:03:53.579> put<00:03:53.819> some<00:03:54.030> little<00:03:54.230> drop<00:03:55.230> craters<00:03:55.680> out<00:03:55.920> of

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
can put some little drop craters out of

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.670 
can put some little drop craters out of
it<00:03:56.190> here<00:03:57.150> I've<00:03:57.480> just<00:03:57.510> put<00:03:57.930> one<00:03:58.170> little<00:03:58.470> piece

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
it here I've just put one little piece

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.309 
it here I've just put one little piece
that's<00:03:58.950> out<00:03:59.069> of<00:03:59.100> place<00:03:59.660> do<00:04:00.660> what<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.959> can<00:04:01.170> to

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
that's out of place do what you can to

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.870 
that's out of place do what you can to
make<00:04:01.350> it<00:04:01.500> look<00:04:01.799> more<00:04:02.069> rugged<00:04:02.400> because

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
make it look more rugged because

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.759 
make it look more rugged because
remember<00:04:03.269> these<00:04:03.480> were<00:04:03.660> built<00:04:03.870> by<00:04:03.989> hand<00:04:04.530> and

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
remember these were built by hand and

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.849 
remember these were built by hand and
they<00:04:04.889> were<00:04:04.950> very<00:04:05.280> hastily<00:04:05.790> built<00:04:06.410> so<00:04:07.410> our<00:04:07.530> next

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
they were very hastily built so our next

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.690 
they were very hastily built so our next
part<00:04:08.160> is<00:04:08.400> no-man's<00:04:09.090> land<00:04:09.950> now<00:04:10.950> for<00:04:11.280> this<00:04:11.430> part

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
part is no-man's land now for this part

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.729 
part is no-man's land now for this part
I've<00:04:11.850> just<00:04:12.060> used<00:04:12.299> these<00:04:12.480> plates<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.410> expend

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
I've just used these plates to expend

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.590 
I've just used these plates to expend
off<00:04:13.859> the<00:04:14.040> main<00:04:14.220> trench<00:04:14.639> but<00:04:15.269> if<00:04:15.389> we're<00:04:15.510> going

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
off the main trench but if we're going

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.870 
off the main trench but if we're going
to<00:04:15.660> build<00:04:15.840> say<00:04:16.260> a<00:04:16.560> hundred<00:04:17.459> meters<00:04:17.729> of

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
to build say a hundred meters of

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.610 
to build say a hundred meters of
no-man's<00:04:18.239> land<00:04:18.419> we're<00:04:18.930> going<00:04:19.139> to<00:04:19.260> need<00:04:19.350> a<00:04:19.410> lot

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
no-man's land we're going to need a lot

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.289 
no-man's land we're going to need a lot
more<00:04:19.650> plates<00:04:20.160> now<00:04:20.880> there's<00:04:21.090> two<00:04:21.269> different

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
more plates now there's two different

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.909 
more plates now there's two different
methods<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:21.959> can<00:04:22.109> use<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.590> build<00:04:22.770> your

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
methods you can use to build your

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.520 
methods you can use to build your
no-man's<00:04:23.400> land

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
no-man's land

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.990 
no-man's land
either<00:04:24.770> one<00:04:25.040> of<00:04:25.070> them<00:04:25.310> is<00:04:25.460> good<00:04:25.670> it<00:04:25.850> just

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
either one of them is good it just

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.050 
either one of them is good it just
depends<00:04:26.330> on<00:04:26.389> what<00:04:26.570> pieces<00:04:26.840> you<00:04:27.110> have<00:04:28.060> all

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
depends on what pieces you have all

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.180 
depends on what pieces you have all
right<00:04:29.300> so<00:04:29.480> what<00:04:29.630> I<00:04:29.660> used<00:04:29.960> in<00:04:30.110> my<00:04:30.139> trench<00:04:30.889> video

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
right so what I used in my trench video

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.540 
right so what I used in my trench video
to<00:04:31.280> make<00:04:31.610> my<00:04:32.380> no<00:04:33.380> man's<00:04:33.590> land<00:04:33.710> was<00:04:34.070> I<00:04:34.100> use<00:04:34.370> these

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
to make my no man's land was I use these

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.720 
to make my no man's land was I use these
large<00:04:34.820> green<00:04:35.410> one<00:04:36.410> block<00:04:36.680> thick<00:04:37.070> plates<00:04:37.460> and

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
large green one block thick plates and

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.170 
large green one block thick plates and
what<00:04:37.820> I<00:04:37.850> did<00:04:38.060> is<00:04:38.210> I<00:04:38.330> held<00:04:38.570> them<00:04:38.690> up<00:04:38.900> with<00:04:39.830> these

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
what I did is I held them up with these

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.020 
what I did is I held them up with these
white<00:04:41.180> pylons<00:04:41.810> here<00:04:42.400> now<00:04:43.400> I<00:04:43.460> got<00:04:43.669> all<00:04:43.700> these

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
white pylons here now I got all these

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.550 
white pylons here now I got all these
from<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.330> same<00:04:44.570> set<00:04:44.960> the<00:04:45.110> flying<00:04:45.380> ninja

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
from the same set the flying ninja

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.710 
from the same set the flying ninja
fortress<00:04:46.130> and<00:04:46.400> of<00:04:46.790> course<00:04:47.120> everyone<00:04:47.510> doesn't

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
fortress and of course everyone doesn't

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.670 
fortress and of course everyone doesn't
own<00:04:47.990> this<00:04:48.290> set<00:04:49.190> or<00:04:49.490> pieces<00:04:50.120> like<00:04:50.540> this<00:04:50.750> so<00:04:51.530> what

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
own this set or pieces like this so what

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.820 
own this set or pieces like this so what
you<00:04:51.800> can<00:04:52.040> do<00:04:52.280> if<00:04:52.460> you<00:04:52.580> don't<00:04:52.700> have<00:04:52.970> those<00:04:53.240> is

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
you can do if you don't have those is

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.950 
you can do if you don't have those is
just<00:04:54.830> start<00:04:55.840> piling<00:04:56.840> up<00:04:56.960> these<00:04:57.260> plates<00:04:57.950> and

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
just start piling up these plates and

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.810 
just start piling up these plates and
you<00:04:59.960> can<00:05:00.140> build<00:05:00.340> basically<00:05:01.340> you<00:05:01.520> can<00:05:01.669> build

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
you can build basically you can build

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.050 
you can build basically you can build
these<00:05:01.970> pylons<00:05:02.480> out<00:05:02.750> of<00:05:02.960> any<00:05:03.230> pieces<00:05:03.500> you<00:05:03.770> have

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
these pylons out of any pieces you have

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.680 
these pylons out of any pieces you have
just<00:05:05.060> take<00:05:05.240> some<00:05:05.600> bricks<00:05:06.350> you<00:05:06.500> got<00:05:07.690> build

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
just take some bricks you got build

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.890 
just take some bricks you got build
those<00:05:08.930> up<00:05:09.200> and<00:05:10.000> use<00:05:11.000> them<00:05:11.180> as<00:05:11.330> support<00:05:11.510> now

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
those up and use them as support now

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.180 
those up and use them as support now
make<00:05:12.140> sure<00:05:12.169> this<00:05:13.450> pylon<00:05:14.450> holds<00:05:15.440> up<00:05:15.620> both<00:05:15.950> of

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
make sure this pylon holds up both of

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.770 
make sure this pylon holds up both of
this<00:05:16.310> plate<00:05:16.640> and<00:05:16.910> this<00:05:17.150> plate<00:05:17.210> so<00:05:17.570> I'm<00:05:17.660> going

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
this plate and this plate so I'm going

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:28.150 
this plate and this plate so I'm going
to<00:05:17.810> need<00:05:17.930> one<00:05:17.990> more<00:05:18.260> piece<00:05:18.530> here<00:05:26.860> now<00:05:27.860> this<00:05:28.010> is

to need one more piece here now this is

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.070 
to need one more piece here now this is
gonna<00:05:28.280> be<00:05:28.370> a<00:05:28.430> little<00:05:28.610> tricky<00:05:29.000> obviously<00:05:29.660> and

gonna be a little tricky obviously and
you're<00:05:30.800> going<00:05:30.919> to<00:05:30.979> want<00:05:31.130> to<00:05:31.190> place<00:05:31.460> them<00:05:31.840> your

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
you're going to want to place them your

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.990 
you're going to want to place them your
pylon<00:05:33.229> strategically<00:05:33.979> so<00:05:34.520> that<00:05:34.550> you<00:05:34.790> have

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
pylon strategically so that you have

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.180 
pylon strategically so that you have
them<00:05:35.150> on<00:05:35.300> it's<00:05:36.229> hard<00:05:36.440> to<00:05:36.530> see<00:05:36.680> here<00:05:36.919> this<00:05:37.130> is

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
them on it's hard to see here this is

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.490 
them on it's hard to see here this is
the<00:05:37.340> split<00:05:37.790> of<00:05:37.820> two<00:05:38.090> fitted<00:05:38.330> plates<00:05:38.750> so<00:05:39.410> you

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
the split of two fitted plates so you

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.650 
the split of two fitted plates so you
can<00:05:39.650> have<00:05:39.800> them<00:05:40.010> support<00:05:40.460> as<00:05:40.610> many<00:05:41.030> of<00:05:41.270> these

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
can have them support as many of these

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.750 
can have them support as many of these
ground<00:05:42.050> plates<00:05:42.320> as<00:05:42.470> possible<00:05:42.979> and<00:05:43.160> use<00:05:43.610> the

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
ground plates as possible and use the

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.930 
ground plates as possible and use the
least<00:05:43.910> amount<00:05:44.060> of<00:05:44.330> pieces<00:05:45.700> so<00:05:46.700> if<00:05:46.820> you're

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
least amount of pieces so if you're

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.580 
least amount of pieces so if you're
going<00:05:47.180> to<00:05:47.330> be<00:05:47.419> ordering<00:05:47.750> these<00:05:47.960> I<00:05:48.169> definitely

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
going to be ordering these I definitely

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.100 
going to be ordering these I definitely
get<00:05:48.830> some<00:05:49.729> of<00:05:49.820> the<00:05:49.910> bigger<00:05:50.090> size<00:05:50.360> I<00:05:50.750> don't<00:05:50.780> know

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
get some of the bigger size I don't know

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.740 
get some of the bigger size I don't know
exactly<00:05:51.710> how<00:05:51.919> big<00:05:52.130> pick<00:05:52.460> a<00:05:52.490> brick<00:05:52.669> does<00:05:53.060> but

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
exactly how big pick a brick does but

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.450 
exactly how big pick a brick does but
get<00:05:53.870> some<00:05:54.050> of<00:05:54.140> these<00:05:54.229> bigger<00:05:54.500> either<00:05:54.979> brown<00:05:55.190> or

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
get some of these bigger either brown or

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.430 
get some of these bigger either brown or
tan<00:05:55.760> ones<00:05:56.030> whatever<00:05:56.510> color<00:05:56.780> you're<00:05:56.990> using<00:05:57.020> and

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
tan ones whatever color you're using and

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.110 
tan ones whatever color you're using and
if<00:05:57.860> you're<00:05:58.010> going<00:05:58.130> to<00:05:58.310> use<00:05:58.490> these

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
if you're going to use these

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.560 
if you're going to use these
I<00:05:59.150> would<00:05:59.630> suggest<00:05:59.810> lowering<00:06:00.740> them<00:06:00.919> one<00:06:01.570> plate

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
I would suggest lowering them one plate

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.620 
I would suggest lowering them one plate
below<00:06:03.260> your<00:06:04.130> ground<00:06:04.460> surface<00:06:04.910> here<00:06:05.210> on<00:06:05.360> the

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
below your ground surface here on the

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.870 
below your ground surface here on the
trench<00:06:05.930> that<00:06:06.530> way<00:06:06.740> you<00:06:06.800> can<00:06:07.039> put<00:06:07.280> other<00:06:07.550> plates

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
trench that way you can put other plates

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.029 
trench that way you can put other plates
on<00:06:08.090> them<00:06:08.330> that<00:06:09.140> are<00:06:09.320> going<00:06:09.500> to<00:06:09.590> be<00:06:09.680> colored

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 
on them that are going to be colored

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:12.010 
on them that are going to be colored
because<00:06:10.220> obviously<00:06:10.669> no<00:06:10.970> man's<00:06:11.330> land<00:06:11.479> is<00:06:11.870> in

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
because obviously no man's land is in

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.230 
because obviously no man's land is in
green<00:06:12.289> all<00:06:13.070> right<00:06:13.310> in<00:06:13.460> the<00:06:13.580> second<00:06:13.910> method<00:06:14.030> I

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
green all right in the second method I

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.580 
green all right in the second method I
was<00:06:14.390> talking<00:06:14.690> about<00:06:14.900> is<00:06:15.110> that<00:06:15.140> you<00:06:15.440> could

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
was talking about is that you could

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.960 
was talking about is that you could
build<00:06:16.270> technically<00:06:17.270> you<00:06:17.510> could<00:06:17.690> build<00:06:17.840> a<00:06:18.970> the

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
build technically you could build a the

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.420 
build technically you could build a the
terrain<00:06:20.360> sloping<00:06:20.810> down<00:06:21.050> to<00:06:21.080> this<00:06:21.680> plate<00:06:22.160> and

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
terrain sloping down to this plate and

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.240 
terrain sloping down to this plate and
just<00:06:22.970> have<00:06:23.150> this<00:06:23.360> be<00:06:23.600> the<00:06:23.780> ground<00:06:24.080> the<00:06:25.070> only

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
just have this be the ground the only

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.040 
just have this be the ground the only
problem<00:06:25.550> with<00:06:25.610> that<00:06:25.820> is<00:06:26.120> then<00:06:26.510> you<00:06:26.660> can't<00:06:26.900> make

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
problem with that is then you can't make

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.450 
problem with that is then you can't make
any<00:06:27.260> craters<00:06:27.740> and<00:06:28.360> there's<00:06:29.360> a<00:06:29.450> big<00:06:29.660> just<00:06:30.110> like

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
any craters and there's a big just like

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.529 
any craters and there's a big just like
your<00:06:31.460> trench<00:06:31.760> is<00:06:31.910> almost<00:06:32.090> just<00:06:32.180> like<00:06:32.300> a<00:06:32.390> big

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
your trench is almost just like a big

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:35.230 
your trench is almost just like a big
hump<00:06:32.810> in<00:06:33.020> the<00:06:33.110> ground<00:06:33.400> which<00:06:34.400> I<00:06:34.669> mean<00:06:34.820> is<00:06:34.970> okay

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
hump in the ground which I mean is okay

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.270 
hump in the ground which I mean is okay
if<00:06:35.360> you<00:06:35.450> don't<00:06:35.539> have<00:06:35.659> the<00:06:35.870> pieces<00:06:36.080> but<00:06:36.500> just

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
if you don't have the pieces but just

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.200 
if you don't have the pieces but just
doesn't<00:06:37.460> look<00:06:37.669> the<00:06:37.820> great

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
doesn't look the great

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.480 
doesn't look the great
and<00:06:38.330> isn't<00:06:38.479> exactly<00:06:39.020> realistic<00:06:39.740> but<00:06:39.949> it<00:06:40.039> is<00:06:40.250> an

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
and isn't exactly realistic but it is an

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.170 
and isn't exactly realistic but it is an
option<00:06:41.410> and<00:06:42.410> no<00:06:43.070> man's<00:06:43.280> land<00:06:43.430> is<00:06:43.759> going<00:06:43.970> to<00:06:44.060> be

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
option and no man's land is going to be

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.090 
option and no man's land is going to be
relatively<00:06:44.570> flat<00:06:44.780> except<00:06:45.590> for<00:06:45.650> you<00:06:45.919> might

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.100 
relatively flat except for you might

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.920 
relatively flat except for you might
want<00:06:46.250> to<00:06:46.280> throw<00:06:46.490> in<00:06:46.669> some<00:06:46.910> blast<00:06:47.180> craters<00:06:47.690> this

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930 
want to throw in some blast craters this

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.260 
want to throw in some blast craters this
is<00:06:48.080> just<00:06:48.289> an<00:06:48.410> example<00:06:48.500> of<00:06:48.889> one<00:06:49.070> of<00:06:49.100> course<00:06:49.520> use

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
is just an example of one of course use

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.469 
is just an example of one of course use
like<00:06:50.570> black<00:06:50.900> or<00:06:51.139> brown<00:06:51.919> earth<00:06:52.490> tone<00:06:52.789> pieces<00:06:53.300> to

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:53.479 
like black or brown earth tone pieces to

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:55.840 
like black or brown earth tone pieces to
show<00:06:53.960> that<00:06:54.110> last<00:06:54.530> crater<00:06:54.800> but<00:06:55.340> basically<00:06:55.639> what

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:55.850 
show that last crater but basically what

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.129 
show that last crater but basically what
you're<00:06:55.970> going<00:06:56.060> to<00:06:56.150> do<00:06:56.270> is<00:06:56.479> you're<00:06:56.990> going<00:06:57.080> to

you're going to do is you're going to

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:00.939 
you're going to do is you're going to
start<00:06:57.410> with<00:06:57.740> a<00:06:59.080> stage<00:07:00.080> in<00:07:00.350> the<00:07:00.380> bottom<00:07:00.800> and

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:00.949 
start with a stage in the bottom and

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:02.830 
start with a stage in the bottom and
just<00:07:00.979> kind<00:07:01.340> of<00:07:01.370> bloom<00:07:01.669> your<00:07:01.910> way<00:07:02.120> out<00:07:02.419> make

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:02.840 
just kind of bloom your way out make

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.600 
just kind of bloom your way out make

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
everything and keep in mind when you're

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 
want this blast crater to be you're

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:15.129 
want this blast crater to be you're
going<00:07:13.789> to<00:07:13.910> have<00:07:14.120> to<00:07:14.270> elevate<00:07:14.630> your<00:07:14.750> trench

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:22.669 
it higher up than your trench you could

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:25.749 
it higher up than your trench you could
have<00:07:22.970> a<00:07:23.240> little<00:07:23.690> mound<00:07:24.050> over<00:07:24.860> it<00:07:25.009> where<00:07:25.669> it
