00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hello today, the conversation will go 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.910
 go about raspberries a lot of questions were on 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.760
 about 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.309
 trim well and generally how to care for 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.199
 my work, I specifically put 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:19.250
 a piece of cm from show day did not 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.439
 cut the old raspberry raspberry it 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.039
 biennial plant biennial bush 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.890
 the first year grows branch's say 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.779
 lonely first year there is nothing 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.739
 happens in the second year on this thread 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.739
 it gives side shoots and grows running to 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.879
 after the second year this branch 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.610
 should just delete everything and 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.770
 it means the berries grow on our branches 2 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.410
 years, here I look, here I am specifically 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.190
 left here they are branches 2 years they 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.160
 dry up 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.789
 they are best cut in the fall because 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.829
 them here on these branches last year 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.850
 winter usually these all pests that 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.329
 then us in the spring 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.040
 I do not live in peace as well here 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.530
 it turned out that there was no time 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.210
 edges and that's just specially left 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.750
 for you see my marina is on 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.960
 trellis 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:18.750
 I screw it on a wire for me 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:24.750
 of this i made a chopped bun beam 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:27.250
 copper aluminum wire breaks 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.400
 that's 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.800
 it's raspberry like she has autumn 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.290
 pleases the able wines so that was with 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.920
 explicit means it should break out 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.800
 I can break this into raspberries 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.430
 don't want to worship they pressed her foot and she 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.530
 broke off well so you can break and 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:02:01.100
 the whole bush I 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:02:03.160
 honors circumcised unplugged after 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.450
 how to cut raspberries 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:15.200
 it needs to be tied up immediately 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:16.280
 tether and now also trim 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.010
 edges 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:24.400
 I cut at a level somewhere high 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:29.390
 level twenty eight meters in hand 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.820
 you can put and more well then you need 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.130
 raspberries on top join together here 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.769
 documents further twist here 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.370
 look tall friend for very hard 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:42.160
 she was 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:45.980
 there was a berry so there was a berry when the branches 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.160
 the wind will blow and they 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.230
 simply fall and so as not to fall 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.950
 i do this the neighboring post and the country between 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:59.590
 here we are custom 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.590
 you can still live to connect more so 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.050
 it is not necessary to tighten much because 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.740
 when will it grow 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:12.240
 she will be thicker you tied him chiknuli 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.710
 cut everything so I talked about pruning 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.310
 raspberries 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:22.740
 if here you are now spring 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:24.600
 go young shoots could not believe 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.540
 in the year young shoots 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.420
 well this is young sipping on top of ours 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.500
 show show young shoots here they are 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.320
 how does raspberry reach height 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.500
 80 there 90 centimeters can be even lower 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.090
 somehow don't regret breaking off the top of your head 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:47.360
 what you are doing here took the crown again 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:49.790
 pinched out of it starts type hit and 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.630
 on top here look what's here 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:58.110
 that here here here here 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:00.480
 show here friends pinched off already higher and 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.490
 went escape from raspberry was a sprig 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.360
 close and and here pinched here in it 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:09.300
 the place of the form here and go runaways one here 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.360
 one court here and here what else 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.670
 It turns out now here in the spring 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.650
 see shoots gone 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:20.930
 already on those here these were only in 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:25.020
 this year, they get out shoots 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.090
 its victory and it turns out small 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.280
 tree as a result 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.730
 on one on one branch it turns out 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.600
 crop 3 to 4 times more than you can 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.430
 get it here as far as trimming 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.620
 you need to trim here below and if you 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.950
 grow raspberries in general 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:48.940
 Well, as in the field it is better to collect 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:54.310
 bundles and tie at the top when you have 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:57.940
 will be big and if you cut below you 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.180
 branches will go then more branches and will be from 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.790
 single bush 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:06.040
 from one speck of dust a good bush 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.680
 regards loved ones here is an anomaly on his 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.170
 can be seen in the window prischepov but they are very 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.900
 high about the bill we need these 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:17.520
 pinch grandfather centimeters 80 then 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:22.110
 it will generally be fine to begin 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:25.270
 the branch will begin to bush from the place 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:28.330
 trim and get here such here 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:32.770
 small trees respectively harvest 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:35.800
 you all go up 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.660
 transplant will show what happened well here 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.320
 look what happened this raspberry 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:45.030
 which I transplanted here it is there at the beginning 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:50.610
 the film has been shown here already passed 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:52.650
 a week and a half here we have watered land 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:58.280
 at the design fence is not visible 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:00.570
 here it is in the ground and does not bother us 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:04.530
 well, but the roots are already left-right 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:12.830
 will not run away and here it is raspberry on and 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:19.620
 I can cut 2 hall of the soul do not need to plant 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:27.260
 in thirty to forty centimeters this one 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:29.520
 raspberry something old she has no 8 idea 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:33.660
 dig only if it goes beyond 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:36.030
 lines literally two words by 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:39.540
 repair raspberry repair raspberry 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:42.750
 who has you prune her in the fall after 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:46.500
 how the berries were cut off in the fall and 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.100
 want a bone type 1 right over here 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.340
 raspberries 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.770
 century nothing just look also here 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:55.710
 some glands still live and shoots 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:59.520
 don't go here weeds need this 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:01.200
 smudges save here and so not 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.130
 forget it must necessarily be 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:08.850
 crop and that's what created for this 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:13.230
 who created it the idea was such that the bush 

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:14.850
 cut off by the winter it does not freeze and 

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:18.880
 spring starts on young shoots 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:22.050
 raspberry grows 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:25.570
 unlike here this two year raspberry 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:28.440
 well, here's another little tip or 

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:31.240
 like my grandma's recipes 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:37.390
 just about the roots from raspberries are not collected 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:40.620
 over my soul and another rosehip root and here 

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:44.620
 in equal proportions take by handful 

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:48.430
 wild rose roots a handful of raspberry roots 

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:52.180
 3 liter pot cook will 

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:55.300
 such a red computer is very tasty not 

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:58.140
 can we gave I drank my time until when 

00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:03.220
 was a little avonley here very well 

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:05.530
 heals removes sand from the kidneys naked there 

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:07.750
 which stones with urolithiasis 

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:10.810
 up with urolithiasis can 

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:13.510
 can use not throw away very 

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:15.040
 useful thing all well and on this let's 

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:20.430
 finish thank you for your attention 

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:20.430
 come back with me bye bye
