Altair are not in the same exact
bloodline<00:01:04.970> they're<00:01:05.119> not<00:01:05.239> related<00:01:05.479> directly

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
bloodline they're not related directly

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.169

but<00:01:10.420> its<00:01:11.420> CEO<00:01:11.659> and<00:01:11.840> I'll<00:01:11.929> tear<00:01:12.140> come<00:01:12.439> from<00:01:12.619> two

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
but its CEO and I'll tear come from two

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.919 
but its CEO and I'll tear come from two
separate<00:01:13.249> bloodlines<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.569> the<00:01:14.659> reason<00:01:14.780> for

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
separate bloodlines and the reason for

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:16.899 
separate bloodlines and the reason for
that<00:01:15.079> is<00:01:15.170> very<00:01:15.469> simple<00:01:15.740> it's<00:01:16.310> more<00:01:16.549> important

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
that is very simple it's more important

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.330 
that is very simple it's more important
for<00:01:16.939> Desmond<00:01:17.539> to<00:01:17.810> be<00:01:17.929> the<00:01:18.229> convergence<00:01:18.859> of<00:01:19.069> a

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
for Desmond to be the convergence of a

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.550 
for Desmond to be the convergence of a
lot<00:01:19.579> of<00:01:19.729> special<00:01:20.420> bloodlines<00:01:20.869> rather<00:01:21.229> than<00:01:21.409> be

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
lot of special bloodlines rather than be

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.649 
lot of special bloodlines rather than be
one<00:01:21.889> sort<00:01:22.310> of<00:01:22.340> diluted<00:01:22.819> blood<00:01:23.030> line<00:01:23.240> which

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
one sort of diluted blood line which

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.739 
one sort of diluted blood line which
would<00:01:23.869> happen<00:01:24.200> if<00:01:24.460> if<00:01:25.460> Altair<00:01:25.969> went<00:01:26.240> to<00:01:26.359> Ezio

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:26.749 
would happen if if Altair went to Ezio

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:31.209 
would happen if if Altair went to Ezio
you<00:01:27.319> know<00:01:27.439> towards<00:01:27.829> Desmond<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:29.299> so<00:01:30.219> different

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
you know towards Desmond so so different
