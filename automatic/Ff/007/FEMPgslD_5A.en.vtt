doing<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:05.970> little<00:00:06.000> install<00:00:06.509> it<00:00:06.629> on<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.990> old

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
doing a little install it on the old

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.919 
doing a little install it on the old
Landau<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:08.719> I'm<00:00:09.719> 75<00:00:10.260> movin<00:00:10.559> forward<00:00:10.769> so<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.929> put

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
Landau and I'm 75 movin forward so I put

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.770 
Landau and I'm 75 movin forward so I put
this<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.259> other<00:00:13.349> day<00:00:13.730> nice<00:00:14.730> optima<00:00:15.210> but

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
this in the other day nice optima but

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.310 
this in the other day nice optima but
even<00:00:16.020> with<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.199> new<00:00:16.320> battery<00:00:18.020> sometimes<00:00:19.020> it

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
even with the new battery sometimes it

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.689 
even with the new battery sometimes it
just<00:00:19.619> doesn't<00:00:19.710> seem<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:19.949> be<00:00:20.070> charging<00:00:20.520> right

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
just doesn't seem to be charging right

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.429 
just doesn't seem to be charging right
and<00:00:21.359> I've<00:00:21.510> measured<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.900> alternator<00:00:22.230> it's

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
and I've measured the alternator it's

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.259 
and I've measured the alternator it's
actually<00:00:22.680> putting<00:00:22.859> him<00:00:23.039> up<00:00:23.189> too<00:00:23.310> bad<00:00:23.519> it's

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
actually putting him up too bad it's

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.960 
actually putting him up too bad it's
putting<00:00:24.449> out<00:00:24.570> 14.3<00:00:25.230> volts<00:00:25.789> so<00:00:26.789> there

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
putting out 14.3 volts so there

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.880 
putting out 14.3 volts so there
shouldn't<00:00:27.090> be<00:00:27.180> any<00:00:27.330> problems<00:00:27.680> half<00:00:28.680> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
shouldn't be any problems half the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.790 
shouldn't be any problems half the
reason<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.310> think<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.300> because<00:00:30.800> that

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
reason I think it is is because that

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.860 
reason I think it is is because that
tiny<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.520> little<00:00:32.790> skinny<00:00:33.000> wire<00:00:33.210> right<00:00:33.540> there

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
tiny that little skinny wire right there

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.400 
tiny that little skinny wire right there
with<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:35.010> little<00:00:35.219> bit<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.399> yellow<00:00:35.610> on<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:36.200> as<00:00:37.200> you

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
with a little bit of yellow on it as you

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.299 
with a little bit of yellow on it as you
can<00:00:37.500> see<00:00:37.680> right<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.040> middle<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
can see right in the middle of the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.010 
can see right in the middle of the
screen<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.360> actually<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> wire

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
screen that is actually the wire

charging<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.920> alternator<00:00:41.430> now<00:00:42.800> we're

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
charging of the alternator now we're

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.910 
charging of the alternator now we're
going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.980> be<00:00:44.070> replacing<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.700> with<00:00:44.910> my<00:00:45.719> arm<00:00:46.050> new

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
going to be replacing it with my arm new

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.580 
going to be replacing it with my arm new

i put in anything ages ago do comment if
you<00:01:10.979> were<00:01:11.130> actually<00:01:11.369> subscribed<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:12.060> me<00:01:12.180> when

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
you were actually subscribed to me when

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.480 
you were actually subscribed to me when
you<00:01:12.960> saw<00:01:13.140> me<00:01:13.170> put<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.799> right<00:01:14.040> first<00:01:14.250> thing

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
you saw me put that in right first thing

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.219 
you saw me put that in right first thing
first<00:01:14.670> gave<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.270> degrees<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.020> bit<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.200> a

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
first gave it a degrees and bit of a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.870 
first gave it a degrees and bit of a
clean<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.100> better<00:01:17.729> place<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.630> work<00:01:18.659> in

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
clean so it's better place to work in

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.530 
clean so it's better place to work in
probably<00:01:20.880> hard<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.060> tell<00:01:21.240> but<00:01:21.390> it's

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
probably hard to tell but it's

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.149 
probably hard to tell but it's
definitely<00:01:21.720> clean<00:01:22.080> off<00:01:22.229> that's<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.740> factory

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
definitely clean off that's in a factory

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.080 
definitely clean off that's in a factory
ground<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:24.810> that's<00:01:26.540> what<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.659> going<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.020> be

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.200 
ground and that's what it's going to be
put<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> nice<00:01:30.390> little<00:01:30.659> cap<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.170> there<00:01:32.210> and

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
put a nice little cap on it there and

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.679 
put a nice little cap on it there and
salt<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:34.070> i'm<00:01:35.070> using<00:01:35.430> i<00:01:35.700> use<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> different

salt it in i'm using i use a different

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.880 
salt it in i'm using i use a different
side<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.079> some<00:01:37.229> people<00:01:37.470> use<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:37.860> a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
side of the some people use it's like a

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.910 
side of the some people use it's like a

from<00:01:41.130> maine<00:01:41.369> that's<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.790> two<00:01:41.939> Grands<00:01:43.040> see<00:01:44.040> it

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
from maine that's the two Grands see it

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.600 
from maine that's the two Grands see it
once<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> factory<00:01:45.090> block<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.720> ones<00:01:45.930> that

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
once to the factory block and ones that

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.780 
once to the factory block and ones that
white<00:01:47.610> thing<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.810> end<00:01:49.049> point<00:01:49.200> now

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
white thing this is the end point now

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.160 
white thing this is the end point now
below<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.149> bolt<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.810> bolts<00:01:52.049> that

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
below that is a bolt and it bolts that

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.660 
below that is a bolt and it bolts that
in<00:01:52.320> some<00:01:52.560> seen<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.770> use<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:52.950> for<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> ground

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
in some seen you use that for the ground

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.770 
in some seen you use that for the ground
there<00:01:53.939> ah<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.549> taken<00:01:56.850> off<00:01:56.909> and

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
there ah and so just taken off and

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.160 
there ah and so just taken off and
positive<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.670> way<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.880> worked<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:01.020> goes

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
positive so the way it worked is it goes

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.160 
positive so the way it worked is it goes
alternator<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:03.149> there<00:02:03.479> which<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.930> kind

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
alternator to that there which is kind

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.830 
alternator to that there which is kind
of<00:02:04.229> like<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.409> distribution<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:06.450> know<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.659> like

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
of like a distribution you know in like

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.990 
of like a distribution you know in like
everything<00:02:07.380> all<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.890> positives<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.610> car

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
everything all the positives of the car

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.460 
everything all the positives of the car
come<00:02:09.330> from<00:02:09.479> they<00:02:09.630> obviously<00:02:09.810> one's<00:02:10.140> going<00:02:10.440> to

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
come from they obviously one's going to

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.850 
come from they obviously one's going to
the<00:02:10.649> fuse<00:02:10.890> box<00:02:12.200> or<00:02:13.200> diff<00:02:13.380> obviously<00:02:13.740> the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
the fuse box or diff obviously the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.320 
the fuse box or diff obviously the
distributor<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.370> mean<00:02:14.580> started<00:02:15.060> my<00:02:15.090> tour

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
distributor I mean started my tour

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.030 
distributor I mean started my tour
different<00:02:15.600> things<00:02:15.750> go<00:02:15.930> from<00:02:16.080> them<00:02:16.320> so<00:02:16.560> I'm

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
different things go from them so I'm

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.710 
different things go from them so I'm
going<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.220> leave<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.460> factory<00:02:18.150> factory

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
going to leave that factory factory

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.710 
going to leave that factory factory
power<00:02:19.080> water<00:02:19.290> there<00:02:19.940> ok<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.090> then<00:02:21.240> one<00:02:21.450> came

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
power water there ok and then one came

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.710 
power water there ok and then one came
off<00:02:21.870> there<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.380> battery<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:23.510> all<00:02:24.510> I'm

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
off there to the battery so all I'm

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.560 
off there to the battery so all I'm
doing<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:25.110> joining<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.980> battery<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:27.300> the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
doing is joining the battery to the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.320 
doing is joining the battery to the
alternator<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.890> it's<00:02:29.040> direct<00:02:29.459> which<00:02:30.060> means

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
alternator so it's direct which means

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.030 
alternator so it's direct which means
that<00:02:30.510> thing<00:02:30.870> there<00:02:31.080> is<00:02:31.290> still<00:02:31.590> connected<00:02:31.830> to

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
that thing there is still connected to

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.490 
that thing there is still connected to
the<00:02:32.190> battery<00:02:32.280> there's<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.300> positive<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.440> the

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
the battery there's the positive and the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.160 
the battery there's the positive and the
two<00:02:34.890> negs<00:02:35.720> negatives<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.840> massive<00:02:37.290> but<00:02:38.000> no

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
two negs negatives a massive but no

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.520 
two negs negatives a massive but no
these<00:02:40.170> nice<00:02:40.410> looking<00:02:40.800> these<00:02:41.610> ones<00:02:41.850> I<00:02:42.410> gave<00:02:43.410> her

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
these nice looking these ones I gave her

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.470 
these nice looking these ones I gave her
the<00:02:43.650> pic<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:43.950> those<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.520> those<00:02:45.120> proper--

tsunami nice looking ones everything is

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.120 
tsunami nice looking ones everything is
attached<00:02:47.610> at<00:02:47.910> one<00:02:48.030> end<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:49.230> car<00:02:49.530> into<00:02:50.100> the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
attached at one end to the car into the

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.960 
attached at one end to the car into the
alternator<00:02:50.989> so<00:02:51.989> that's<00:02:52.739> all<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.550> will

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
alternator so that's all that I will

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.970 
alternator so that's all that I will
give<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.209> wire<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.450> bit<00:02:54.600> of<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.750> clean<00:02:55.050> it's<00:02:55.860> all

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
give the wire a bit of a clean it's all

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.260 
give the wire a bit of a clean it's all
dirty<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.370> greasy<00:02:56.580> still<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.780> no<00:02:58.500> sides<00:02:59.010> that

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
dirty and greasy still so no sides that

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.250 
dirty and greasy still so no sides that
we're<00:03:00.270> gonna<00:03:00.420> hook<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.600> up<00:03:00.720> there<00:03:01.050> we<00:03:01.140> have<00:03:01.230> a

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
we're gonna hook it up there we have a

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.530 
we're gonna hook it up there we have a
finished<00:03:01.440> product<00:03:01.739> i<00:03:02.300> would<00:03:03.300> run<00:03:03.510> these

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
finished product i would run these

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.229 
finished product i would run these
perfectly<00:03:04.140> together<00:03:04.410> but<00:03:05.070> you<00:03:05.790> can't<00:03:06.060> because

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
perfectly together but you can't because

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.050 
perfectly together but you can't because
I<00:03:06.450> was<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.750> Rings<00:03:06.989> hip<00:03:07.290> so<00:03:07.890> that's<00:03:08.070> that<00:03:08.280> well

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
I was the Rings hip so that's that well

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.699 
I was the Rings hip so that's that well
I<00:03:09.090> look<00:03:09.540> like<00:03:09.690> one<00:03:09.870> straight<00:03:09.900> one<00:03:10.440> but<00:03:10.650> you

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
I look like one straight one but you

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.630 
I look like one straight one but you
look<00:03:10.830> on<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.010> sides<00:03:11.220> too<00:03:12.049> there's<00:03:13.049> the

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
look on the sides too there's the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.400 
look on the sides too there's the
grounds<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:15.480> we've<00:03:15.690> got<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.930> nice<00:03:16.080> area

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
grounds and we've got the nice area

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.729 
grounds and we've got the nice area
gauge<00:03:16.590> run<00:03:16.860> they're<00:03:17.900> pretty<00:03:18.900> active<00:03:19.200> that<00:03:19.380> and

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
gauge run they're pretty active that and

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.370 
gauge run they're pretty active that and
I<00:03:19.830> definitely<00:03:20.010> think<00:03:20.370> it's<00:03:20.930> maybe<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.049> engine

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
I definitely think it's maybe the engine

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.770 
I definitely think it's maybe the engine
bay<00:03:22.500> look<00:03:22.709> a<00:03:22.769> bit<00:03:22.920> better<00:03:23.480> even<00:03:24.480> though<00:03:24.570> it's

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
bay look a bit better even though it's

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.949 
bay look a bit better even though it's
 old<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:25.500> dirty<00:03:25.650> but<00:03:26.269> yeah<00:03:27.269> I<00:03:27.630> think

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
 old and dirty but yeah I think

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.530 
 old and dirty but yeah I think
it<00:03:28.110> blends<00:03:28.320> in<00:03:28.470> pretty<00:03:28.560> good<00:03:28.709> with<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.250> leads

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
it blends in pretty good with the leads

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.810 
it blends in pretty good with the leads
looks<00:03:30.540> like<00:03:30.660> it's<00:03:30.810> flowing<00:03:31.080> and<00:03:31.680> red<00:03:32.489> which

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
looks like it's flowing and red which

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.699 
looks like it's flowing and red which
I'll<00:03:33.000> definitely<00:03:33.269> get<00:03:33.600> rid<00:03:33.750> of<00:03:33.840> at<00:03:34.320> four<00:03:34.470> games

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
I'll definitely get rid of at four games

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.229 
I'll definitely get rid of at four games
one<00:03:34.860> day<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.160> replace<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:35.489> with<00:03:35.670> 0<00:03:36.000> gauge

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
one day and replace it with 0 gauge

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.620 
one day and replace it with 0 gauge
there<00:03:37.080> might<00:03:37.200> be<00:03:37.230> up<00:03:37.530> in<00:03:37.860> stores

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
there might be up in stores

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.100 
there might be up in stores
this<00:03:38.750> in<00:03:38.960> the<00:03:39.080> future<00:03:39.290> not<00:03:40.100> near<00:03:40.310> future<00:03:40.580> but

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.450 

one<00:03:43.470> day<00:03:43.620> I'm<00:03:43.680> going<00:03:43.860> to<00:03:43.950> rebuild<00:03:44.220> this<00:03:44.400> whole

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
one day I'm going to rebuild this whole

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.990 
one day I'm going to rebuild this whole
thing<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:45.930> there's<00:03:46.620> no<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:46.980> started<00:03:47.520> battery

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
thing and there's no I started battery

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.860 
thing and there's no I started battery
and

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:04:10.280 

I wasn't<00:03:52.049> gonna<00:03:52.200> fall<00:03:52.409> back

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.349
