00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.139 
will have to have repeaters facing this
way<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.990> right<00:02:01.229> way<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.860> then<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.729> part<00:02:02.969> that

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
way the right way and then the part that

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.969 
way the right way and then the part that
is<00:02:03.240> going<00:02:03.270> away<00:02:03.960> from<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.380> redstone<00:02:04.799> lamp

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
is going away from the redstone lamp

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.200 
is going away from the redstone lamp
will<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.460> have<00:02:05.579> them<00:02:05.700> facing<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.090> other

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
will have to have them facing the other

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.359 
will have to have them facing the other
way<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.509> it'll<00:02:06.899> be<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> repeating<00:02:07.979> current

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
way so it'll be like a repeating current

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.580 
way so it'll be like a repeating current
that<00:02:08.550> goes<00:02:08.700> around<00:02:08.849> in<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.330> circle<00:02:09.360> however<00:02:10.259> it

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
that goes around in a circle however it

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.110 
that goes around in a circle however it
won't<00:02:10.770> go<00:02:11.009> back<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.550> pressure<00:02:11.819> place

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
won't go back to the pressure place

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.880 
won't go back to the pressure place
because<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:12.780> repeater<00:02:13.200> right<00:02:13.440> here

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
because this repeater right here

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.570 
because this repeater right here
is<00:02:14.630> facing<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:16.170> wrong<00:02:16.410> way<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.069> can't<00:02:17.340> go

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
is facing the wrong way and it can't go

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.630 
is facing the wrong way and it can't go
the<00:02:17.730> wrong<00:02:17.850> way<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:19.709> have<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.459> it

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
the wrong way so you have this and it

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.150 
the wrong way so you have this and it
goes<00:02:20.819> around<00:02:21.209> in<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.810> circle<00:02:22.110> like<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.680> it

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
goes around in a circle like that and it

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.380 
goes around in a circle like that and it
turns<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.790> off<00:02:23.970> as<00:02:24.240> I'll<00:02:24.390> show<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.720> know

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
turns on and off as I'll show you know

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.260 
turns on and off as I'll show you know
step<00:02:27.390> on<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:29.310> goes<00:02:29.490> around<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:30.180> a

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
step on that and it goes around in a

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.150 
step on that and it goes around in a
circle<00:02:30.510> but<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.959> does<00:02:31.140> never<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.680> does<00:02:31.920> never

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
circle but it does never it does never

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.850 
circle but it does never it does never
it<00:02:32.430> does<00:02:32.610> not<00:02:32.760> catch<00:02:33.060> up<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.360> its<00:02:33.540> own<00:02:33.860> current

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
it does not catch up to its own current

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.370 
it does not catch up to its own current
and<00:02:35.070> thus<00:02:35.670> creating<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.360> flashing<00:02:36.840> red<00:02:37.080> light

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
and thus creating a flashing red light

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.530 
and thus creating a flashing red light
now<00:02:37.620> if<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.340> want<00:02:38.490> to<00:02:38.550> make<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.790> upstairs<00:02:39.240> or

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
now if you want to make it upstairs or

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.559 
now if you want to make it upstairs or
to<00:02:39.630> any<00:02:39.780> other<00:02:40.050> part<00:02:40.290> in<00:02:40.560> your<00:02:43.850> any<00:02:44.850> other<00:02:45.239> part

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
to any other part in your any other part

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.360 
to any other part in your any other part
in<00:02:45.630> your<00:02:45.750> house<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.830> will<00:02:46.950> just<00:02:47.190> have<00:02:47.340> to

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
in your house you will just have to

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.520 
in your house you will just have to
connect<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.910> redstone<00:02:48.360> from<00:02:48.720> any<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.410> the

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
connect the redstone from any of the

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.290 
connect the redstone from any of the
blocks<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:50.100> these<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.430> redstone<00:02:50.820> blocks<00:02:51.060> not

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
blocks and these the redstone blocks not

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.400 
blocks and these the redstone blocks not
the<00:02:51.420> repeaters<00:02:51.780> because<00:02:51.959> that<00:02:52.110> won't<00:02:52.290> work

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
the repeaters because that won't work

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.340 
the repeaters because that won't work
and<00:02:52.880> just<00:02:53.880> make<00:02:54.120> sure<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.570> goes<00:02:54.780> up<00:02:55.110> and

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
and just make sure it goes up and

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.710 
and just make sure it goes up and
that'll<00:02:55.680> flash<00:02:55.920> on<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.400> off<00:02:56.550> just<00:02:57.060> like<00:02:57.450> the

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
that'll flash on and off just like the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.110 
that'll flash on and off just like the
other<00:02:57.900> one<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.430> pretty<00:02:59.610> much<00:02:59.730> it<00:03:00.030> for

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
other one so that is pretty much it for

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.600 
other one so that is pretty much it for
the<00:03:00.660> alarm<00:03:01.050> system<00:03:01.350> now<00:03:01.739> what<00:03:02.040> if<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.280> want<00:03:02.459> to

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
the alarm system now what if you want to

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.670 
the alarm system now what if you want to
enable<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.180> or<00:03:03.330> disable<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.200> well<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:05.220> is<00:03:05.820> I

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
enable it or disable it well that is I

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.050 
enable it or disable it well that is I
haven't<00:03:07.680> found<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.950> best<00:03:08.280> way<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.640> do<00:03:08.880> that<00:03:09.030> I

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
haven't found a best way to do that I

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.630 
haven't found a best way to do that I
bet<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:09.480> guys<00:03:09.660> will<00:03:09.989> in<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.410> comments<00:03:10.920> but

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
bet you guys will in the comments but

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.449 
bet you guys will in the comments but
the<00:03:12.239> best<00:03:12.420> way<00:03:12.630> I<00:03:12.660> found<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.530> just<00:03:13.980> do<00:03:14.310> that

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
the best way I found is just do that

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.660 
the best way I found is just do that
turn<00:03:14.940> on<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.269> redstone<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.489> that'll<00:03:17.489> leave

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
turn on the redstone and that'll leave

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.870 
turn on the redstone and that'll leave
the<00:03:17.970> lights<00:03:18.239> in<00:03:18.600> an<00:03:18.900> on<00:03:19.160> position<00:03:20.160> now<00:03:20.400> if<00:03:20.700> you

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
the lights in an on position now if you

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.550 
the lights in an on position now if you
turn<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.329> off<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:22.470> problem<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:24.410> that<00:03:25.410> it

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
turn it off the problem is that it

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.680 
turn it off the problem is that it
doesn't<00:03:25.769> reset<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.700> this<00:03:26.880> part<00:03:27.150> still<00:03:27.390> stays

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
doesn't reset and this part still stays

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.569 
doesn't reset and this part still stays
on<00:03:27.870> because<00:03:28.019> it's<00:03:28.350> its<00:03:28.500> own<00:03:28.709> current<00:03:29.280> going

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
on because it's its own current going

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.780 
on because it's its own current going
around<00:03:29.760> in<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.060> circle<00:03:30.239> so<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.950> main<00:03:32.190> fix<00:03:32.549> I

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
around in the circle so the main fix I

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.840 
around in the circle so the main fix I
see<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.269> this<00:03:33.390> is<00:03:33.660> gone<00:03:33.959> like<00:03:34.170> this<00:03:34.730> letting<00:03:35.730> it

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
see to this is gone like this letting it

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.060 
see to this is gone like this letting it
all<00:03:35.970> go<00:03:36.030> die<00:03:36.780> down<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.380> then<00:03:37.620> just<00:03:37.799> putting

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
all go die down and then just putting

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.530 
all go die down and then just putting
another<00:03:38.130> redstone<00:03:38.519> there<00:03:38.760> that's<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.269> only

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
another redstone there that's the only

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.720 
another redstone there that's the only
way<00:03:39.660> I<00:03:39.690> know<00:03:39.870> how<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.230> do<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.590> if<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.220> guys<00:03:41.430> know

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
way I know how to do it if you guys know

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.430 
way I know how to do it if you guys know
a<00:03:41.760> better<00:03:42.030> way<00:03:42.269> I<00:03:42.299> bet<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:42.989> do<00:03:43.140> in<00:03:43.320> the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
a better way I bet you do in the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.390 
a better way I bet you do in the
