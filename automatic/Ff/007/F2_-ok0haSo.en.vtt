00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.690 
just I kept thinking that this litter
and<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.140> would<00:01:04.229> wash<00:01:04.379> off<00:01:04.619> or<00:01:04.949> whatever<00:01:05.100> but

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
and it would wash off or whatever but

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.320 
and it would wash off or whatever but
it's<00:01:05.760> actually<00:01:06.060> threads<00:01:07.369> sewn<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.240> was

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
it's actually threads sewn and so it was

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.640 
it's actually threads sewn and so it was
rated<00:01:10.310> into<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.720> fabrics<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:12.990> yeah<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.500> that's

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
rated into the fabrics so yeah so that's

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.499 
rated into the fabrics so yeah so that's
a<00:01:13.770> really<00:01:13.799> huge<00:01:14.250> plus<00:01:14.520> I'm<00:01:14.790> surprised<00:01:15.180> it

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
a really huge plus I'm surprised it

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.859 
a really huge plus I'm surprised it
wasn't<00:01:15.689> as<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.200> big<00:01:16.650> hit<00:01:16.920> as<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.310> was<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.119> I

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
wasn't as a big hit as it was and I

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.050 
wasn't as a big hit as it was and I
think<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.170> was<00:01:19.259> 16<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.369> i<00:01:20.759> ended<00:01:21.000> up

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
think it was 16 on and i ended up

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.789 
think it was 16 on and i ended up
getting<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.420> bigger<00:01:21.689> size<00:01:21.990> than<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.409> really
