try<00:04:26.990> that<00:04:27.140> out<00:04:27.260> yesterday<00:04:27.860> you<00:04:28.370> dig<00:04:28.550> so<00:04:28.970> right

try that out yesterday you dig so right
now<00:04:29.270> I'm<00:04:29.450> just<00:04:29.540> thinking<00:04:30.020> about<00:04:30.110> what<00:04:30.380> color

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
now I'm just thinking about what color

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.990 
now I'm just thinking about what color
to<00:04:30.710> use<00:04:30.800> next<00:04:31.010> because<00:04:31.250> there's<00:04:31.430> so<00:04:31.580> many<00:04:31.760> and

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
to use next because there's so many and

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.300 
to use next because there's so many and
I<00:04:32.060> decided<00:04:32.480> on<00:04:32.690> this<00:04:33.140> top<00:04:33.500> right<00:04:33.800> blue<00:04:34.040> color

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
I decided on this top right blue color

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.430 
I decided on this top right blue color
it's<00:04:34.490> kind<00:04:34.670> of<00:04:34.730> a<00:04:34.820> Navy<00:04:35.060> but<00:04:35.990> it's<00:04:36.110> showing<00:04:36.350> up

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
it's kind of a Navy but it's showing up

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.420 
it's kind of a Navy but it's showing up
a<00:04:36.530> little<00:04:36.650> bit<00:04:36.770> lighter<00:04:36.950> because<00:04:37.100> there's<00:04:37.370> a

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
a little bit lighter because there's a

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.670 
a little bit lighter because there's a
bright<00:04:37.760> orange<00:04:38.120> underneath<00:04:38.660> this<00:04:38.900> looks<00:04:39.230> so

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
bright orange underneath this looks so

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.070 
bright orange underneath this looks so

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
what it's really great for is blending

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.640 
what it's really great for is blending
two<00:05:01.880> colors<00:05:02.270> together<00:05:02.480> the<00:05:02.930> blue<00:05:03.140> once<00:05:03.410> it<00:05:03.560> was

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
two colors together the blue once it was

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.320 
two colors together the blue once it was
on<00:05:03.680> my<00:05:04.040> eyes<00:05:04.250> I<00:05:04.460> felt<00:05:04.670> like<00:05:04.760> it<00:05:04.850> was<00:05:04.940> a<00:05:04.970> little

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
on my eyes I felt like it was a little

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.150 
on my eyes I felt like it was a little
bit<00:05:05.600> too<00:05:05.810> much<00:05:05.960> unless<00:05:06.260> I<00:05:06.380> was<00:05:06.470> like<00:05:06.650> going<00:05:06.980> for

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
bit too much unless I was like going for

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.980 
bit too much unless I was like going for
a<00:05:07.190> parody<00:05:07.790> of<00:05:07.820> some<00:05:08.120> look<00:05:08.360> or<00:05:08.510> something<00:05:08.630> but

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
a parody of some look or something but

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.810 
a parody of some look or something but
for<00:05:09.140> a<00:05:09.169> normal<00:05:09.380> smoky<00:05:09.890> eye<00:05:09.919> I<00:05:10.220> think<00:05:10.400> that<00:05:10.730> it

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
for a normal smoky eye I think that it

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.610 
for a normal smoky eye I think that it
was<00:05:10.910> too<00:05:11.180> blue<00:05:11.419> next<00:05:11.720> to<00:05:11.780> the<00:05:11.900> orange<00:05:12.050> so<00:05:12.440> it's

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
was too blue next to the orange so it's

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.960 
was too blue next to the orange so it's
just<00:05:12.830> blending<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:13.400> two<00:05:13.550> colors<00:05:13.850> together

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
just blending the two colors together

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.180 
just blending the two colors together
seamlessly<00:05:14.450> and<00:05:14.930> kind<00:05:15.380> of<00:05:15.470> toning<00:05:15.770> that<00:05:15.800> blue

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
seamlessly and kind of toning that blue

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.950 
seamlessly and kind of toning that blue
down<00:05:16.430> a<00:05:16.460> little<00:05:16.760> bit<00:05:16.940> now<00:05:17.360> I'm<00:05:17.480> just<00:05:17.630> going<00:05:17.780> in

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
down a little bit now I'm just going in

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.540 
down a little bit now I'm just going in
with<00:05:18.080> a<00:05:18.110> lighter<00:05:18.440> powder<00:05:18.680> just<00:05:19.040> to<00:05:19.190> clean<00:05:19.400> up

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
with a lighter powder just to clean up

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.980 
with a lighter powder just to clean up
the<00:05:19.669> edges<00:05:19.850> and<00:05:20.090> make<00:05:20.150> there<00:05:20.570> kind<00:05:20.780> of<00:05:20.810> like<00:05:20.870> a

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
the edges and make there kind of like a

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.960 
the edges and make there kind of like a
harsh<00:05:21.290> line<00:05:21.530> drawing<00:05:21.950> back<00:05:22.160> on<00:05:22.400> my<00:05:22.520> face<00:05:22.730> I

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
harsh line drawing back on my face I

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.180 
harsh line drawing back on my face I
just<00:05:23.480> think<00:05:23.810> that<00:05:23.900> this<00:05:24.050> is<00:05:24.230> more<00:05:24.830> flattering

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
just think that this is more flattering

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.100 
just think that this is more flattering
for<00:05:25.430> everyone<00:05:25.970> the<00:05:26.480> next<00:05:26.750> step<00:05:26.900> we're<00:05:27.020> going

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
for everyone the next step we're going

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.750 
for everyone the next step we're going
to<00:05:27.169> do<00:05:27.320> is<00:05:27.500> take<00:05:27.740> the<00:05:27.980> dark<00:05:28.220> brown<00:05:28.460> that<00:05:28.669> we

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
to do is take the dark brown that we

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.640 
to do is take the dark brown that we
just<00:05:29.000> took<00:05:29.150> in<00:05:29.330> the<00:05:29.450> crease<00:05:29.660> lightly<00:05:30.169> and<00:05:30.350> pop

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.260 
that all along the bottom lash line very
very<00:05:33.080> heavily<00:05:33.350> to<00:05:33.950> create<00:05:34.280> a<00:05:34.310> smokey<00:05:34.880> eye<00:05:35.000> I

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
very heavily to create a smokey eye I

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.260 
very heavily to create a smokey eye I
like<00:05:35.780> stopping<00:05:36.080> the<00:05:36.350> dark<00:05:36.560> line<00:05:36.770> about

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
like stopping the dark line about

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.250 
like stopping the dark line about
three-quarters<00:05:38.270> of<00:05:38.300> the<00:05:38.419> way<00:05:38.510> in<00:05:38.810> I<00:05:38.990> don't<00:05:39.169> go

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
three-quarters of the way in I don't go

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.690 
three-quarters of the way in I don't go

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
there's a little bit of space of that

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.140 
there's a little bit of space of that
white<00:05:42.260> left<00:05:42.530> so<00:05:42.830> your<00:05:43.010> eyes<00:05:43.160> can<00:05:43.490> pop<00:05:43.730> and<00:05:44.000> they

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
white left so your eyes can pop and they

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.180 
white left so your eyes can pop and they

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
I thought that this look was missing

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.890 
I thought that this look was missing
just<00:06:05.639> a<00:06:05.789> little<00:06:06.180> something<00:06:06.569> so<00:06:06.690> I'm<00:06:06.780> taking

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
just a little something so I'm taking

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.020 
just a little something so I'm taking
this<00:06:07.199> gold<00:06:07.500> color<00:06:07.800> and<00:06:08.220> I'm<00:06:08.310> placing<00:06:08.759> it<00:06:09.000> right

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
this gold color and I'm placing it right

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.760 
this gold color and I'm placing it right
next<00:06:09.330> to<00:06:09.509> the<00:06:09.629> white<00:06:09.810> on<00:06:10.020> the<00:06:10.110> tear<00:06:10.319> duct<00:06:10.500> just

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
next to the white on the tear duct just

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.290 
next to the white on the tear duct just
to<00:06:10.860> kind<00:06:11.069> of<00:06:11.099> give<00:06:11.250> a<00:06:11.280> gradient<00:06:11.639> to<00:06:11.879> the<00:06:12.090> lid

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
to kind of give a gradient to the lid

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.330 
to kind of give a gradient to the lid
and<00:06:12.509> just<00:06:12.930> add<00:06:13.110> more<00:06:13.379> depth<00:06:13.680> to<00:06:13.800> the<00:06:13.979> look<00:06:14.190> I

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 
and just add more depth to the look I

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.520 
and just add more depth to the look I
think<00:06:14.639> that<00:06:14.759> it<00:06:14.879> adds<00:06:15.150> a<00:06:15.419> pop<00:06:15.750> and<00:06:16.050> it<00:06:16.319> kind<00:06:16.500> of

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
think that it adds a pop and it kind of

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.129 
think that it adds a pop and it kind of
looks<00:06:16.740> like<00:06:16.830> sunset<00:06:17.819> II<00:06:17.849> and<00:06:18.240> pretty<00:06:18.509> and<00:06:18.840> I

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 
looks like sunset II and pretty and I

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:20.270 
looks like sunset II and pretty and I
don't<00:06:19.349> know<00:06:19.440> I<00:06:19.590> think<00:06:19.680> that<00:06:19.889> when<00:06:20.039> you<00:06:20.099> have<00:06:20.220> a

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
don't know I think that when you have a

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.830 
don't know I think that when you have a
lot<00:06:20.490> of<00:06:20.520> dark<00:06:20.819> colors<00:06:20.909> mixed<00:06:21.509> you<00:06:21.599> need<00:06:21.720> to

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
lot of dark colors mixed you need to

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.300 
lot of dark colors mixed you need to
have<00:06:21.960> a<00:06:21.990> lot<00:06:22.169> of<00:06:22.199> light<00:06:22.440> colors<00:06:22.680> as<00:06:22.860> well<00:06:22.979> so

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
have a lot of light colors as well so

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.129 
have a lot of light colors as well so
