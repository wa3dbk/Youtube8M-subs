free roam planets and I'm actually quite

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.679 
free roam planets and I'm actually quite
surprised<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.869> even<00:00:22.140> an<00:00:22.350> issue

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
surprised that this is even an issue

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.710 
surprised that this is even an issue
because<00:00:24.689> it's<00:00:25.560> actually<00:00:25.769> quite<00:00:26.160> easy<00:00:26.300> but<00:00:27.300> in

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
because it's actually quite easy but in

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
extremely easy ways to get to the moon

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.020 
extremely easy ways to get to the moon
or<00:00:42.030> any<00:00:42.239> free<00:00:42.540> roam<00:00:42.780> location<00:00:43.579> right<00:00:44.579> here<00:00:44.640> you

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
or any free roam location right here you

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
where you can go free play or do any of

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.910 
where you can go free play or do any of
the<00:00:54.199> the<00:00:55.199> worlds<00:00:55.649> or<00:00:55.800> planet<00:00:57.109> excuse<00:00:58.109> me<00:00:58.289> so

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the the worlds or planet excuse me so

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.189 
the the worlds or planet excuse me so
you<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.340> basically<00:00:59.550> go<00:00:59.910> here<00:01:00.300> literally

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
you just basically go here literally

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.139 
you just basically go here literally
right<00:01:01.980> there<00:01:02.190> from<00:01:02.430> when<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.609> start<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> game

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
right there from when you start the game

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.010 
right there from when you start the game
now<00:01:04.729> another<00:01:05.729> way<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.510> simply

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
now another way to do it is simply

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.940 
now another way to do it is simply
pressing<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:08.220> select<00:01:08.460> button<00:01:08.970> or<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:10.110> mean<00:01:10.890> it

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
pressing the select button or I mean it

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.170 
pressing the select button or I mean it
depends<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.310> what<00:01:11.430> you're<00:01:11.549> playing<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:12.030> it's

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
depends on what you're playing but it's

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.520 
depends on what you're playing but it's
basically<00:01:12.450> where<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.810> select<00:01:13.110> button<00:01:13.260> would

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
basically where the select button would

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.490 
basically where the select button would
be<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.610> brings<00:01:14.880> up<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.330> same<00:01:15.570> exact<00:01:16.140> globe

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
be and it brings up the same exact globe

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.050 
be and it brings up the same exact globe
from<00:01:17.369> anywhere<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.540> free<00:01:19.080> roam<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:20.100> don't<00:01:20.909> think

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
from anywhere in free roam I don't think

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.749 
from anywhere in free roam I don't think
you<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.210> do<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> levels<00:01:21.869> but<00:01:22.200> anyway

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
you can do it in the levels but anyway

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.640 
you can do it in the levels but anyway
and<00:01:23.759> if<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.450> not<00:01:24.479> enough<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:25.200> not<00:01:25.500> an

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
and if that is not enough in not an

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.310 
and if that is not enough in not an
option<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.360> basically<00:01:27.509> exit<00:01:28.200> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
option we just basically exit the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.230 
option we just basically exit the
control<00:01:28.770> room<00:01:29.009> now<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.490> might<00:01:29.759> have<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> have

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
control room now you might have to have

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.940 
control room now you might have to have
a<00:01:30.270> certain<00:01:30.630> amount<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:31.049> gold<00:01:31.290> bricks<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.829> do

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
a certain amount of gold bricks to do

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.819 
a certain amount of gold bricks to do
this<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.400> can't<00:01:33.030> remember<00:01:33.299> at<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.659> point<00:01:33.829> but

to<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.350> moon<00:02:04.500> base<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:05.130> literally<00:02:06.119> go

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
to the moon base that literally go

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.910 
to the moon base that literally go
straight<00:02:06.750> out<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.020> control<00:02:07.380> panel<00:02:07.740> room

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
straight out of the control panel room

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.070 
straight out of the control panel room
jump<00:02:08.670> down<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.179> that'll<00:02:09.300> bring<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
jump down and that'll bring you to the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.699 
jump down and that'll bring you to the
moon<00:02:10.259> base

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
moon base

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.509 
moon base
use<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.549> slide<00:02:12.150> ways<00:02:12.680> teleporter<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.980> this

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
use the slide ways teleporter and this

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.199 
use the slide ways teleporter and this
is<00:02:14.700> where<00:02:14.879> every<00:02:15.239> planet<00:02:15.689> is<00:02:16.469> right<00:02:16.920> here<00:02:17.340> you

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
is where every planet is right here you

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.030 
is where every planet is right here you
can<00:02:18.390> kind<00:02:18.689> of<00:02:18.719> go<00:02:18.900> through<00:02:19.230> each<00:02:19.469> little

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
can kind of go through each little

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.360 
can kind of go through each little
portal<00:02:21.019> individually<00:02:22.019> now<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.530> dunno<00:02:22.859> again

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
portal individually now I dunno again

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.069 
portal individually now I dunno again
you<00:02:23.700> do<00:02:23.879> have<00:02:23.909> to<00:02:24.269> have<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.480> certain<00:02:24.810> amount<00:02:24.989> of

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
you do have to have a certain amount of

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.220 
you do have to have a certain amount of
bricks<00:02:25.760> in<00:02:26.760> order<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.299> get<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.510> each<00:02:27.750> planet

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
bricks in order to get to each planet

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.679 
bricks in order to get to each planet
but<00:02:28.379> it<00:02:28.620> doesn't<00:02:28.980> take<00:02:29.159> very<00:02:29.189> long<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:30.000> once

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
but it doesn't take very long and once

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.000 
but it doesn't take very long and once
you've<00:02:30.840> beaten<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.230> game<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.620> should<00:02:31.650> have

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
you've beaten the game you should have

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.089 
you've beaten the game you should have
enough<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.459> get<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.879> at<00:02:33.060> least<00:02:33.920> two<00:02:34.920> or<00:02:35.069> three

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
enough to get to at least two or three

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.470 
enough to get to at least two or three
planets<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.000> then<00:02:36.719> you<00:02:37.709> know<00:02:37.799> so<00:02:38.010> there's<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.579> I

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
planets and then you know so there's a I

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.720 
planets and then you know so there's a I
use<00:02:40.049> malt<00:02:40.349> right<00:02:41.340> here<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.150> have<00:02:42.329> quard<00:02:43.730> you

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
use malt right here you have quard you

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.940 
use malt right here you have quard you
have<00:02:45.139> xamarin<00:02:46.909> over<00:02:47.909> here<00:02:48.569> is<00:02:50.450> Bukhara<00:02:51.450> and

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
have xamarin over here is Bukhara and

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.190 
have xamarin over here is Bukhara and
then<00:02:52.950> we<00:02:53.129> have<00:02:53.400> knock<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.980> then<00:02:55.980> we<00:02:56.189> have<00:02:57.200> Odom

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
then we have knock and then we have Odom

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.839 
then we have knock and then we have Odom
so<00:02:59.129> obviously<00:02:59.609> one<00:02:59.969> is<00:03:00.000> missing<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:01.700> what<00:03:02.700> you

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
so obviously one is missing and what you

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.589 
so obviously one is missing and what you
do<00:03:03.030> for<00:03:03.239> that<00:03:03.450> one<00:03:03.719> is<00:03:04.909> let's<00:03:05.909> go<00:03:06.030> get<00:03:06.150> plastic

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
do for that one is let's go get plastic

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.240 
do for that one is let's go get plastic
man<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:07.079> mean<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.349> could<00:03:07.530> have<00:03:07.590> flown<00:03:07.919> if<00:03:08.159> I

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
man I mean I could have flown if I

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.580 
man I mean I could have flown if I
wanted<00:03:08.609> to<00:03:08.760> but<00:03:08.969> this<00:03:09.060> is<00:03:09.180> way<00:03:09.329> more<00:03:09.510> fun

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
wanted to but this is way more fun

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.959 
wanted to but this is way more fun
basically<00:03:10.590> go<00:03:10.919> to<00:03:10.980> this<00:03:11.099> little<00:03:11.310> grate<00:03:11.700> right

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:11.969 
basically go to this little grate right

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:15.500 
basically go to this little grate right
here<00:03:12.680> slide<00:03:13.680> on<00:03:13.919> through<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.669> there's<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.090> huge

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
here slide on through and there's a huge

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.170 
here slide on through and there's a huge
portal<00:03:16.019> for<00:03:16.169> OA<00:03:16.349> which<00:03:17.340> again<00:03:17.639> I<00:03:17.699> think<00:03:18.030> this

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
portal for OA which again I think this

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.250 
portal for OA which again I think this
is<00:03:18.329> the<00:03:18.419> one<00:03:18.569> that<00:03:18.659> you<00:03:18.750> have<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.019> have<00:03:19.139> the

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
is the one that you have to have the

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.849 
is the one that you have to have the
most<00:03:19.470> gold<00:03:19.799> bricks<00:03:20.099> for<00:03:20.370> so<00:03:21.239> um<00:03:21.650> you<00:03:22.650> know<00:03:22.739> and

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
most gold bricks for so um you know and

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.460 
most gold bricks for so um you know and
then<00:03:22.949> you<00:03:23.010> just<00:03:23.159> use<00:03:23.310> your<00:03:23.489> slide<00:03:23.729> ways

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
then you just use your slide ways

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.979 
then you just use your slide ways
sideways<00:03:25.470> solid<00:03:26.010> slide<00:03:26.280> way<00:03:26.870> something<00:03:27.870> like

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
sideways solid slide way something like

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.949 
sideways solid slide way something like
that<00:03:28.139> and<00:03:29.099> this<00:03:29.909> will<00:03:30.120> bring<00:03:30.209> you<00:03:30.389> to<00:03:30.419> low

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
that and this will bring you to low

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.750 
that and this will bring you to low
where<00:03:31.409> you<00:03:31.530> can<00:03:31.709> do<00:03:31.919> all<00:03:32.189> of<00:03:32.250> your<00:03:34.760> vehicle

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
where you can do all of your vehicle

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.999 
where you can do all of your vehicle
gameplay<00:03:36.269> if<00:03:36.419> you<00:03:36.569> will<00:03:36.949> so<00:03:37.949> there<00:03:38.699> you<00:03:38.849> go<00:03:40.009> so

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:41.009 
gameplay if you will so there you go so

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:43.309 
gameplay if you will so there you go so
basically<00:03:41.519> those<00:03:42.329> are<00:03:42.569> all<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.930> locations

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
basically those are all the locations

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.390 
basically those are all the locations
you<00:03:43.799> want<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.099> look<00:03:44.220> out<00:03:44.370> for<00:03:44.900> as<00:03:45.900> far<00:03:46.199> as<00:03:46.439> fast

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
you want to look out for as far as fast

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.640 
you want to look out for as far as fast
traveling<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.359> and<00:03:48.540> getting<00:03:49.109> around<00:03:49.439> and

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650

traveling and and getting around and
getting<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:50.040> where<00:03:50.189> you<00:03:50.310> want<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.609> be<00:03:51.139> but<00:03:52.139> once

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
getting to where you want to be but once

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.229 
getting to where you want to be but once
you've<00:03:52.680> got<00:03:52.919> them<00:03:53.069> all<00:03:53.220> unlocked<00:03:53.579> literally

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
you've got them all unlocked literally

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.449 
you've got them all unlocked literally
just<00:03:54.449> pressing<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:55.109> select<00:03:55.650> button<00:03:56.009> will<00:03:56.310> let

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
just pressing the select button will let

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.059 
just pressing the select button will let
you<00:03:56.699> kind<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.209> you<00:03:58.019> know<00:03:58.109> go<00:03:58.319> to<00:03:58.379> each<00:03:58.739> and

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
you kind of you know go to each and

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.089 
you kind of you know go to each and
every<00:03:59.489> spot<00:03:59.970> that<00:04:00.329> you<00:04:00.449> want<00:04:00.659> to<00:04:00.810> get<00:04:00.989> to

every spot that you want to get to
so<00:04:02.400> keep<00:04:02.849> unlocking<00:04:03.389> those<00:04:03.509> gold<00:04:03.870> bricks<00:04:04.199> and

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:04.699 
so keep unlocking those gold bricks and

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:07.249 
so keep unlocking those gold bricks and
those<00:04:05.699> are<00:04:05.939> the<00:04:06.030> locations<00:04:06.599> you<00:04:06.780> need<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:07.079> get

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:07.259

those are the locations you need to get
to<00:04:07.500> to<00:04:07.620> get<00:04:07.769> around<00:04:08.359> if<00:04:09.359> I<00:04:09.540> realize<00:04:09.959> this<00:04:10.229> was

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
to to get around if I realize this was

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.569 
to to get around if I realize this was
going<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.709> be<00:04:11.090> a<00:04:12.979> challenge<00:04:13.979> I<00:04:14.250> would<00:04:14.489> have

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
going to be a challenge I would have

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.640 
going to be a challenge I would have
made<00:04:14.759> this<00:04:14.909> video<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.239> little<00:04:15.389> bit<00:04:15.599> sooner<00:04:15.989> so<00:04:16.620> I

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
made this video a little bit sooner so I
