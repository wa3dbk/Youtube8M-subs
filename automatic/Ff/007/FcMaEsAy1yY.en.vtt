plays<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.869> we<00:01:06.930> get<00:01:07.110> high<00:01:07.229> scores<00:01:07.530> just

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
plays and we get high scores just

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.219 
plays and we get high scores just
because<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.880> views<00:01:09.180> lodestar<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.990> can't

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
because like a views lodestar you can't

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.359 
because like a views lodestar you can't
get<00:01:10.380> kills<00:01:10.650> while<00:01:10.830> you're<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.100> your<00:01:11.250> room

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
get kills while you're in your room

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.670 
get kills while you're in your room
started<00:01:12.000> if<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.659> use<00:01:12.689> kill<00:01:13.049> streaks<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.500> do

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
started if you use kill streaks that do

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.679 
started if you use kill streaks that do
work<00:01:13.860> while<00:01:14.189> you're<00:01:14.520> doing<00:01:15.000> work<00:01:15.299> as<00:01:15.479> well

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
work while you're doing work as well

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.710 
work while you're doing work as well
then<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.439> can<00:01:16.650> get<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.640> most<00:01:17.820> kills<00:01:18.150> possible

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
then you can get the most kills possible

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.090 
then you can get the most kills possible
in<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.990> game<00:01:19.229> because<00:01:19.409> you're<00:01:19.740> running<00:01:20.009> around

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
in a game because you're running around

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.590 
in a game because you're running around
getting<00:01:20.340> kills<00:01:20.700> your<00:01:20.939> dogs<00:01:21.150> are<00:01:21.360> getting

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
getting kills your dogs are getting

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.600 
getting kills your dogs are getting
kills<00:01:21.810> your<00:01:22.020> swarm<00:01:22.350> doesn't<00:01:22.710> thing<00:01:22.920> though

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
kills your swarm doesn't thing though

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.760 
kills your swarm doesn't thing though
yeah<00:01:23.970> that's<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.420> guess<00:01:24.570> my<00:01:24.840> opinion<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
yeah that's I guess my opinion on the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.760 
yeah that's I guess my opinion on the
best<00:01:26.009> killstreak<00:01:26.640> setups<00:01:27.270> yeah<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:27.900> think<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
best killstreak setups yeah I think the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.469 
best killstreak setups yeah I think the
one<00:01:29.009> right<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.729> one<00:01:29.850> I'm<00:01:29.939> running<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.240> be

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
sat dogs and swarm is definitely the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.399

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.679 
everyone build towards an egg skill tree
but<00:01:44.070> like<00:01:44.220> if<00:01:44.340> you're<00:01:44.369> really<00:01:44.970> confident<00:01:45.509> I

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
but like if you're really confident I

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.940 
but like if you're really confident I
think<00:01:46.049> if<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.439> ran<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:47.420> Loadstar<00:01:48.470> dogs<00:01:49.470> and

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
think if you ran a Loadstar dogs and

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.190 
think if you ran a Loadstar dogs and
then<00:01:50.100> swarm<00:01:50.460> would<00:01:51.180> be<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.689> think<00:01:52.079> it'd<00:01:52.170> be

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
then swarm would be I think it'd be

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.630 
then swarm would be I think it'd be
pretty<00:01:52.470> good<00:01:52.710> because<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.950> have<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.159> lodestar

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
pretty good because I have the lodestar

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.730 
pretty good because I have the lodestar
does<00:01:53.850> do<00:01:54.360> pretty<00:01:54.540> good<00:01:54.630> like<00:01:55.320> iron<00:01:55.500> it's

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
does do pretty good like iron it's

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.990 
does do pretty good like iron it's
actually<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> really<00:01:56.189> good<00:01:56.280> kill<00:01:56.610> streak<00:01:56.850> but

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
actually a really good kill streak but

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.450 
actually a really good kill streak but
likely<00:01:57.689> said<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:59.100> can't<00:01:59.310> run

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
likely said it's just you can't run

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.580 
likely said it's just you can't run
around<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.759> get<00:01:59.880> kills<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:01.020> get<00:02:01.200> third

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
around and get kills and you get third

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.740 
around and get kills and you get third
only<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.130> 50<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.850> don't<00:02:03.270> even<00:02:03.329> know<00:02:03.479> how<00:02:03.600> many

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
only like 50 I don't even know how many

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.840 
only like 50 I don't even know how many
points<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.200> each<00:02:04.380> kill<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.460> look

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
points you get for each kill and look

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.969 
points you get for each kill and look
starting<00:02:06.270> at<00:02:06.360> s<00:02:06.479> 50<00:02:06.869> but<00:02:07.409> it's<00:02:07.530> not<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.829> men

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
starting at s 50 but it's not that men

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.499 
starting at s 50 but it's not that men
you<00:02:08.069> have<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.250> get<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.610> many<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.119> build

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
you have to get so many to build

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.880 
you have to get so many to build
I to<00:02:09.629> next<00:02:10.019> closest<00:02:10.409> are<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.590> know<00:02:10.709> I'm<00:02:10.799> a

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
I to next closest are you know I'm a

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.649 
I to next closest are you know I'm a
blackbird<00:02:11.370> up<00:02:11.549> you<00:02:11.730> can't<00:02:11.939> see<00:02:12.150> where<00:02:12.330> people

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:12.659 
blackbird up you can't see where people

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:16.580 
blackbird up you can't see where people
are<00:02:12.780> at<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:14.310> it's<00:02:14.760> true<00:02:14.970> um<00:02:15.360> but<00:02:16.079> it<00:02:16.290> like<00:02:16.470> if

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
are at so it's true um but it like if

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.509 
are at so it's true um but it like if
you<00:02:16.709> are<00:02:16.739> gonna<00:02:17.010> use<00:02:17.220> something<00:02:17.489> like

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
you are gonna use something like

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.729 
you are gonna use something like
lodestar<00:02:18.150> definitely<00:02:18.659> used<00:02:18.870> dogs<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.470> swarm

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
lodestar definitely used dogs and swarm

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.890 
lodestar definitely used dogs and swarm
as<00:02:19.920> well<00:02:20.099> because<00:02:20.790> your<00:02:21.000> dogs<00:02:21.239> and<00:02:21.510> your<00:02:21.599> swarm

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
as well because your dogs and your swarm

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.539 
as well because your dogs and your swarm
will<00:02:22.110> get<00:02:22.439> them<00:02:22.590> out<00:02:22.739> of<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.950> building<00:02:23.159> so<00:02:23.489> you

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
will get them out of the building so you

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.399 
will get them out of the building so you
can<00:02:23.790> kill<00:02:23.970> them<00:02:24.120> with<00:02:24.269> your<00:02:24.360> lodestar<00:02:24.870> just

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
can kill them with your lodestar just

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:26.930 
can kill them with your lodestar just
don't<00:02:25.590> use<00:02:25.769> kill<00:02:26.040> streaks<00:02:26.340> like<00:02:26.430> doing<00:02:26.879> these

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
don't use kill streaks like doing these

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.149 
don't use kill streaks like doing these
three<00:02:27.239> different<00:02:27.360> killstreaks<00:02:28.049> to<00:02:28.620> where<00:02:28.799> um

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
three different killstreaks to where um

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.149 
three different killstreaks to where um
you<00:02:30.150> know<00:02:30.269> you're<00:02:30.450> always<00:02:30.629> a<00:02:30.810> like<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.890> remote

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
you know you're always a like the remote

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.460 
you know you're always a like the remote
control<00:02:32.519> because<00:02:32.849> then<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.780> have<00:02:33.810> like<00:02:34.200> they

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
control because then you have like they

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.020 
control because then you have like they
can<00:02:34.650> just<00:02:34.829> sit<00:02:34.950> in<00:02:35.040> buildings<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.670> shoot<00:02:35.909> your

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
can just sit in buildings and shoot your

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.089 
can just sit in buildings and shoot your
stuff<00:02:36.359> down<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:36.870> don't<00:02:37.140> rely<00:02:37.470> completely<00:02:37.590> on

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
stuff down so don't rely completely on

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.550 
stuff down so don't rely completely on
those<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.790> guess<00:02:38.849> what<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.150> say<00:02:39.599> yeah<00:02:40.319> I'm

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
those I guess what I say yeah I'm

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.860 
those I guess what I say yeah I'm
Magadan<00:02:41.040> with<00:02:41.159> my<00:02:41.280> one<00:02:41.489> death<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.909> just<00:02:42.690> got

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
Magadan with my one death I just got

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.680 
Magadan with my one death I just got
dogs<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.530> think<00:02:43.859> I<00:02:43.920> was<00:02:44.040> near<00:02:44.250> swarm<00:02:45.180> been

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
dogs I think I was near swarm been

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.069 
dogs I think I was near swarm been
erased<00:02:45.930> okay<00:02:46.260> yeah<00:02:47.069> for<00:02:47.400> leveling<00:02:47.819> off<00:02:48.079> my

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
erased okay yeah for leveling off my

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.289 
erased okay yeah for leveling off my
opinion<00:02:49.680> on<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.340> fastest<00:02:50.790> loveland<00:02:51.180> would

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
opinion on the fastest loveland would

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.180 
opinion on the fastest loveland would
probably<00:02:51.659> be<00:02:51.780> some<00:02:52.079> advocate<00:02:52.829> now<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:52.980> know

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
probably be some advocate now I know

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.729 
probably be some advocate now I know
criminal<00:02:53.819> killstreaks<00:02:54.440> because<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.560> don't

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
criminal killstreaks because I don't

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.580 
criminal killstreaks because I don't
stage<00:02:56.209> but<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.870> would<00:02:58.019> say<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.290> would

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
stage but I would say that would

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.059 
stage but I would say that would
definitely<00:02:58.829> have<00:02:59.159> to<00:02:59.280> be<00:02:59.310> like<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.849> UAV

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
definitely have to be like the UAV

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.319 
definitely have to be like the UAV
probably<00:03:02.069> like<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.280> hundred<00:03:02.579> Hillerman<00:03:03.239> i

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
probably like a hundred Hillerman i

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.119 
probably like a hundred Hillerman i
would<00:03:03.480> say<00:03:03.690> an<00:03:03.750> attack<00:03:04.109> chopper<00:03:04.709> because<00:03:05.040> the

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
would say an attack chopper because the

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.640 
would say an attack chopper because the
tag<00:03:05.370> choppers<00:03:05.819> in<00:03:05.970> this<00:03:06.150> game<00:03:06.359> are<00:03:06.650> absolutely

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
tag choppers in this game are absolutely

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.750 
tag choppers in this game are absolutely
ridiculous<00:03:08.340> especially<00:03:09.269> when<00:03:09.329> nobody<00:03:09.629> she

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
ridiculous especially when nobody she

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.220 
ridiculous especially when nobody she
don't<00:03:11.760> tell<00:03:11.940> me<00:03:12.060> like<00:03:12.209> eight<00:03:12.450> times<00:03:12.780> if<00:03:13.079> you're

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
don't tell me like eight times if you're

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.689 
don't tell me like eight times if you're
in<00:03:13.319> first<00:03:13.470> place<00:03:13.650> because<00:03:13.889> I<00:03:14.040> do<00:03:14.099> though<00:03:14.400> it

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:14.699 
in first place because I do though it

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:15.830 
in first place because I do though it
goes<00:03:14.819> after<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.239> first<00:03:15.269> place<00:03:15.660> whatever

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
goes after the first place whatever

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.890 
goes after the first place whatever
still<00:03:16.290> so<00:03:17.069> 80<00:03:17.639> came<00:03:17.940> like<00:03:18.090> eight<00:03:18.299> times<00:03:18.480> before

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
still so 80 came like eight times before

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.390 
still so 80 came like eight times before
I<00:03:18.959> finally<00:03:19.230> or<00:03:19.530> if<00:03:19.620> we're<00:03:19.769> probably<00:03:19.980> get<00:03:20.160> shot

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
I finally or if we're probably get shot

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.479 
I finally or if we're probably get shot
down<00:03:20.430> however<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.180> hate<00:03:21.510> them<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:22.019> much<00:03:22.489> yeah
