the gravy in here now what we did is
just<00:03:34.100> we<00:03:34.370> put<00:03:34.550> a<00:03:34.580> little<00:03:34.790> heat<00:03:34.970> on<00:03:35.030> this<00:03:35.330> just

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
just we put a little heat on this just

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.150 
just we put a little heat on this just
to<00:03:35.960> help<00:03:36.110> dissolve<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.620> ingredients<00:03:36.830> we

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
to help dissolve the ingredients we

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.200 
to help dissolve the ingredients we
didn't<00:03:37.370> boil<00:03:37.580> it<00:03:37.760> or<00:03:37.880> anything

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
didn't boil it or anything
