00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
was the most quick boring most

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.920 
was the most quick boring most
entertaining<00:01:04.979> boring<00:01:05.610> game<00:01:06.330> I've<00:01:06.600> ever<00:01:06.689> been

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
entertaining boring game I've ever been

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.219 
entertaining boring game I've ever been
a<00:01:06.990> part<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:08.270> yeah<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.510> made<00:01:09.659> myself<00:01:09.840> a

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
a part of so yeah I made myself a

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.380 
a part of so yeah I made myself a
instant<00:01:10.799> starter<00:01:11.090> clearly<00:01:12.090> because

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
instant starter clearly because

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.630 
instant starter clearly because
otherwise<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.320> just<00:01:13.409> I'm<00:01:13.860> just<00:01:13.890> gonna<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.490> I

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
otherwise it's just I'm just gonna be I

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.859 
otherwise it's just I'm just gonna be I
thought<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.909> would<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.240> power<00:01:15.509> back

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
thought it would be like a power back

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.929 
thought it would be like a power back
but<00:01:16.229> they<00:01:16.350> never<00:01:17.009> play<00:01:17.310> me<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:17.580> I

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
but they never play me like I

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.490 
but they never play me like I
was<00:01:18.090> comfortable<00:01:18.360> being<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.930> power<00:01:19.110> back<00:01:19.350> i

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
was comfortable being a power back i

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.289 
was comfortable being a power back i
think<00:01:19.560> i<00:01:19.740> would<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:19.890> got<00:01:20.479> realistic<00:01:21.979> stats

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
think i would have got realistic stats

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.090 
think i would have got realistic stats
you<00:01:24.299> know<00:01:24.420> not<00:01:25.049> too<00:01:25.320> many<00:01:25.500> highlights<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.070> i

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
you know not too many highlights but i

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.990 
you know not too many highlights but i
think<00:01:26.250> i<00:01:26.310> would've<00:01:26.460> got<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> touchdown<00:01:26.790> here

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
think i would've got a touchdown here

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.700 
think i would've got a touchdown here
and<00:01:27.299> there<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.600> i<00:01:28.290> think<00:01:28.439> would<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.619> been

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
and there and i think would have been

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.990 
and there and i think would have been
more<00:01:28.829> realistic<00:01:29.130> if<00:01:29.400> i<00:01:29.430> was<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.579> power<00:01:29.820> back

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
more realistic if i was a power back

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.060 
more realistic if i was a power back
because<00:01:30.180> I'm<00:01:30.270> built<00:01:30.509> like<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.890> so<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.920> just

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
because I'm built like that so I just

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.460 
because I'm built like that so I just
made<00:01:32.159> myself<00:01:32.280> an<00:01:32.610> instant<00:01:32.939> starter<00:01:33.240> uh<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
made myself an instant starter uh the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.289 
made myself an instant starter uh the
quarter<00:01:35.100> length<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> little<00:01:35.790> bit<00:01:35.909> too<00:01:36.090> long

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
quarter length is a little bit too long

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.630 
quarter length is a little bit too long
it's<00:01:37.200> all<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.619> different<00:01:38.070> depending<00:01:38.220> on

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
it's all it's different depending on

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.030 
it's all it's different depending on
what<00:01:38.790> position<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.540> offense<00:01:40.229> or<00:01:40.380> defense<00:01:40.530> that

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
what position on offense or defense that

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.719 
what position on offense or defense that
I<00:01:41.100> play<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.970> set<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:43.729> quarter

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
I play that I have to set the quarter

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.920 
I play that I have to set the quarter
length<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.409> also<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.649> play<00:01:46.920> clock<00:01:47.930> limit

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
length and also the play clock limit

careers<00:01:55.979> are<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.899> seven<00:01:57.899> minutes<00:01:59.000> my<00:02:00.000> wide

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
careers are like seven minutes my wide

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.670 
careers are like seven minutes my wide
receiver<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.869> four<00:02:01.170> minutes<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.500> quarter

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
receiver is four minutes a quarter

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.860 
receiver is four minutes a quarter
because<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.070> get<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.280> much<00:02:02.579> stats<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.090> that

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
because I get so much stats in that

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.580 
because I get so much stats in that
uh<00:02:04.580> if<00:02:05.580> it<00:02:05.730> wasn't<00:02:06.000> for<00:02:06.060> no<00:02:06.750> chains<00:02:07.050> like<00:02:07.410> I

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
uh if it wasn't for no chains like I

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.719 
uh if it wasn't for no chains like I
wouldn't<00:02:07.830> have<00:02:07.920> known<00:02:07.980> that<00:02:08.130> because<00:02:08.490> i

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
wouldn't have known that because i

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.750 
wouldn't have known that because i
didn't<00:02:09.200> start<00:02:10.200> my<00:02:10.410> wide<00:02:10.830> receiver<00:02:10.860> connected

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
didn't start my wide receiver connected

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.490 
didn't start my wide receiver connected
careers<00:02:12.240> until<00:02:12.480> he<00:02:12.660> was<00:02:12.960> like<00:02:13.110> pretty<00:02:13.380> much

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
careers until he was like pretty much

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.400 
careers until he was like pretty much
half<00:02:13.860> way<00:02:14.010> through<00:02:14.220> his<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:15.050> just<00:02:16.050> he<00:02:16.260> was

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
half way through his and just he was

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.660 
half way through his and just he was
breaking<00:02:16.650> stat<00:02:17.070> there<00:02:17.280> he<00:02:17.460> was<00:02:17.550> breaking

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
breaking stat there he was breaking

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.860 
breaking stat there he was breaking
records<00:02:18.090> like<00:02:18.180> halfway<00:02:18.360> through<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.690> season

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
records like halfway through the season

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.210 
records like halfway through the season
so<00:02:19.350> i<00:02:20.340> changed<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.600> four<00:02:21.930> quarter<00:02:22.320> four

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
so i changed it to four quarter four

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.770 
so i changed it to four quarter four
minute<00:02:23.460> quarters<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.240> seemed<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.660> be

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
minute quarters and that seemed to be

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.080 
minute quarters and that seemed to be
working<00:02:24.900> out<00:02:25.170> pretty<00:02:25.320> well<00:02:25.440> but<00:02:26.030> I'm<00:02:27.030> a

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
working out pretty well but I'm a

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.570 
working out pretty well but I'm a
starter<00:02:27.390> now<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:28.160> so<00:02:29.160> this<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.340> week

control<00:02:42.060> at<00:02:42.330> least<00:02:42.540> it's<00:02:43.290> like<00:02:43.470> I'm<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.620> kicker

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
control at least it's like I'm a kicker

control at least it's like I'm a kicker
you<00:02:44.280> can't<00:02:44.460> be<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.610> kicker<00:02:44.850> in<00:02:45.060> connected

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
you can't be a kicker in connected

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.790 
you can't be a kicker in connected
careers<00:02:45.690> otherwise<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.230> probably<00:02:46.500> would<00:02:46.650> do

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
careers otherwise it probably would do

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.070 
careers otherwise it probably would do
it<00:02:46.830> connected<00:02:47.250> careers<00:02:47.460> to<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.790> not<00:02:48.750> I

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
it connected careers to that not I

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.020 
it connected careers to that not I
wouldn't<00:02:49.620> make<00:02:49.770> a<00:02:49.830> youtube<00:02:50.310> series<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.880> that

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
wouldn't make a youtube series of that

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.560 
wouldn't make a youtube series of that
but<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:51.990> always<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:53.400> don't<00:02:53.760> know<00:02:53.850> just<00:02:54.090> be<00:02:54.240> fun<00:02:54.450> to

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
but I always I don't know just be fun to

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.910 
but I always I don't know just be fun to
do<00:02:54.720> just<00:02:54.960> to<00:02:55.050> be<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.200> kicker<00:02:55.470> because<00:02:55.590> i<00:02:55.740> feel

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
do just to be a kicker because i feel

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.590 
do just to be a kicker because i feel
like<00:02:55.950> if<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.520> if<00:02:56.760> they<00:02:57.060> made<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.330> kicker

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
like if you if they made a kicker

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.170 
like if you if they made a kicker
connected<00:03:00.600> careers<00:03:00.980> then<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.070> feel<00:03:02.250> like<00:03:02.430> they

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
connected careers then I feel like they

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.550 
connected careers then I feel like they
could<00:03:03.240> make<00:03:03.510> scenarios<00:03:04.050> for<00:03:04.410> like

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
could make scenarios for like

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.990 
could make scenarios for like
game-winning<00:03:04.980> field<00:03:05.070> goals<00:03:05.460> and<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.730> Super

game-winning field goals and the Super

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.700 
game-winning field goals and the Super
Bowl<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.420> she'll<00:03:06.630> like<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.200> just<00:03:07.320> make

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
Bowl and she'll like that and just make

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.110 
Bowl and she'll like that and just make
it<00:03:07.740> intriguing<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:10.160> hopeful<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.370> think<00:03:12.060> it'd

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
it intriguing and hopeful I think it'd

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.660 
it intriguing and hopeful I think it'd
be<00:03:12.150> entertaining<00:03:12.600> but<00:03:13.320> that's<00:03:14.040> just<00:03:14.160> me<00:03:14.370> so

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
be entertaining but that's just me so

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.400 
be entertaining but that's just me so
like<00:03:14.880> if<00:03:15.060> you're<00:03:15.300> a<00:03:15.330> backup<00:03:15.810> in<00:03:15.989> any<00:03:16.170> position

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
like if you're a backup in any position

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.440 
like if you're a backup in any position
it's<00:03:16.800> like<00:03:16.950> you're<00:03:17.160> you<00:03:17.940> just<00:03:17.970> play<00:03:18.209> special
