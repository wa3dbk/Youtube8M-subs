want to do now well we've done our
fourth<00:00:14.190> course<00:00:15.059> correction<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.900> should

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
fourth course correction and it should

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.680 
fourth course correction and it should
only<00:00:16.289> take<00:00:16.410> one<00:00:16.770> more<00:00:17.150> it's<00:00:18.150> optionally

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
only take one more it's optionally

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.390 
only take one more it's optionally
perform<00:00:19.109> your<00:00:19.199> own<00:00:19.260> like<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.740> may<00:00:20.100> if<00:00:20.279> you

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
perform your own like you may if you

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.779 
perform your own like you may if you
like<00:00:20.580> but<00:00:21.060> no<00:00:21.300> burn<00:00:21.689> that's<00:00:22.260> over<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:23.220> less

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
like but no burn that's over this less

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.929 
like but no burn that's over this less
than<00:00:24.060> one<00:00:24.269> second<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.810> really<00:00:25.050> significant<00:00:25.949> so

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
than one second is really significant so

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.070 
than one second is really significant so
we're<00:00:27.060> going<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.240> fast<00:00:27.449> forward<00:00:27.599> for<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.960> little

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
we're going to fast forward for a little

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.480 
we're going to fast forward for a little
while<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.410> we'll<00:00:28.560> wait<00:00:28.680> till<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:28.980> BTW

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
while and we'll wait till this BTW

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:38.090 
while and we'll wait till this BTW
number<00:00:29.789> climbs<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.300> two<00:00:36.559> yet<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.770> we're<00:00:38.010> going

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
number climbs to two yet so we're going

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.740 
number climbs to two yet so we're going
to<00:00:38.190> perform<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.610> burn<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.210> if<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.540> find

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
to perform this burn but if you find

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.670 
to perform this burn but if you find
your<00:00:39.930> re-entry<00:00:40.079> angle<00:00:41.270> climbing<00:00:42.270> up<00:00:42.420> over<00:00:42.899> 6.5

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
your re-entry angle climbing up over 6.5

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.880 
your re-entry angle climbing up over 6.5
and<00:00:44.309> around<00:00:44.610> there<00:00:44.789> or<00:00:44.969> under<00:00:45.899> 6.5<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.770> may

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
and around there or under 6.5 you may

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.650 
and around there or under 6.5 you may
want<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.129> perform<00:00:47.430> another<00:00:47.670> burn<00:00:47.969> as<00:00:48.180> long<00:00:48.480> as

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
want to perform another burn as long as

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.860 
want to perform another burn as long as
it's<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:49.260> long<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:49.620> fuel<00:00:49.920> permits<00:00:50.719> so<00:00:51.719> we're

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
it's as long as fuel permits so we're

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.180 
it's as long as fuel permits so we're
going<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.050> keep<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.410> going<00:00:52.770> here<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.070> wait

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
going to keep on going here and wait

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.860 
going to keep on going here and wait
till<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.489> number<00:00:53.850> gets<00:00:54.300> up<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.539> little<00:00:54.750> bit

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
till this number gets up a little bit

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:03.590 
till this number gets up a little bit
higher<00:00:59.210> and<00:01:00.530> yet<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.730> your<00:01:02.730> reentry<00:01:03.180> angles

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
higher and yet if your reentry angles

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.899 
higher and yet if your reentry angles
you<00:01:04.170> no<00:01:04.290> good<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.799> don't<00:01:05.369> see<00:01:05.519> any<00:01:05.670> reason<00:01:05.939> why

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
you no good I don't see any reason why

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:15.530 
you no good I don't see any reason why
your<00:01:08.909> ship<00:01:09.150> should<00:01:09.299> survive<00:01:09.689> reentry<00:01:14.540> 1.6

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
your ship should survive reentry 1.6

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.840 
your ship should survive reentry 1.6
seconds<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.700> I'll<00:01:20.850> stop<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.360> right<00:01:21.479> there

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
seconds and I'll stop that right there

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.340 
seconds and I'll stop that right there
it's<00:01:23.850> going<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.060> adjust<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.420> attitude<00:01:25.020> you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
it's going to adjust the attitude you

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.789 
it's going to adjust the attitude you
won't<00:01:25.500> know<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.979> procedure<00:01:26.400> by<00:01:26.640> now<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
won't know that procedure by now and

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:37.730 
won't know that procedure by now and
we're<00:01:28.799> burning

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.850 

and<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.670> burn<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.939> down<00:01:39.320> okay<00:01:40.320> super<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:42.860> would

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
and the burn it down okay super I would

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.039 
and the burn it down okay super I would
just<00:01:44.040> adjusted<00:01:44.520> our<00:01:44.689> entry<00:01:45.689> angle<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:46.020> little

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
just adjusted our entry angle a little

00:01:46.049 --> 00:02:01.180 
just adjusted our entry angle a little
bit<00:01:47.149> and<00:01:48.149> keep<00:01:48.330> on<00:01:48.600> going<00:01:49.080> and<00:01:49.110> going<00:01:49.560> going
