00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
can't believe how close the match is

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.610 
can't believe how close the match is
like<00:04:52.340> in<00:04:53.150> the<00:04:53.330> bottom<00:04:53.870> you<00:04:53.990> can<00:04:54.110> kind<00:04:54.350> of<00:04:54.470> see

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
like in the bottom you can kind of see

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.080 
like in the bottom you can kind of see
like<00:04:54.650> it<00:04:54.950> doesn't<00:04:55.280> really<00:04:55.460> blend<00:04:55.730> very<00:04:55.880> well

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
like it doesn't really blend very well

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.820 
like it doesn't really blend very well
but<00:04:56.480> that's<00:04:56.780> okay<00:04:56.990> cuz<00:04:57.200> it<00:04:57.320> blends<00:04:57.560> with<00:04:57.680> my

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
but that's okay cuz it blends with my

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.090 
but that's okay cuz it blends with my
highlights<00:04:58.280> which<00:04:58.550> is<00:04:58.870> top-notch<00:04:59.870> I<00:05:00.410> mean<00:05:00.890> I

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
highlights which is top-notch I mean I

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.950 
highlights which is top-notch I mean I
actually<00:05:01.310> kind<00:05:01.880> of<00:05:01.970> think<00:05:02.030> that<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.600> amount

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
actually kind of think that the amount

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.720 
actually kind of think that the amount
of<00:05:03.020> pieces<00:05:03.320> that<00:05:03.500> they<00:05:03.950> gave<00:05:04.160> me<00:05:04.340> I<00:05:04.520> was
