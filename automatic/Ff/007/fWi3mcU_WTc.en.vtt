00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.250
 the biggest problem of life which is so it's definitely the use 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.409
 of it 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:15.969
 6 discovering a machine is well finished with good ergonomics decide 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.429
 interesting enough 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:21.469
 it's hard to have a little bit of what will serve all these gadgets 

00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:22.739
 who are installed 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:26.719
 on the issue we have a touch screen we have a fourth season very 

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:27.529
 homogeneous 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.529
 able to behave a bit like a big remote 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:32.350
 not really more 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.970
 that is to say that we will be able for example to drive 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.340
 playing a movie 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.340
 from another computer to a screen we will be able to restart 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.520
 applications can not use the machine as a keyboard% 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.710
 with built-in computer quite completely standard way 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.050
 now it's hard to see a little bit 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.940
 why we should invest in a machine of this type with a touch screen 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.170
 which is relatively expensive 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.700
 and that do not bring frankly% and many things to albert camus 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.860
 emergency 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.800
 why not a 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.180
 a machine that is 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.219
 relatively powerful serene 280 with whom 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:10.530
 a gigabyte of memory 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.600
 but that 16 gigas of data 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.700
 storage 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.290
 which is quite incomprehensible from an operational point of view which 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.750
 is a lot more gohard lasts autonomy and also the transport 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.700
 but it gives us speak frankly the top everything is ok a lot of 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.850
 data and therefore to use it as a portrait readers 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.299
 of film by plugging it anyway into wireless mode 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.960
 on 1 on a TV 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.250
 we must have sore in China a netbook a screen that loads with a 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.310
 dose 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.270
 the father of sinety software interface really remained a beta version of 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.120
 divers 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.120
 a small software interface that allows you to see a little bit 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.840
 to launch small and small applications to the drying of the tip 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.480
 fingers 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.580
 so we have two worlds that rub shoulders with the life of the little features 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.640
 additional 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.640
 first company ancelle battery volume management etc 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.390
 which is done with the fingertips it's not unpleasant now it's 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.630
 again enough these gadgets 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.450
 and it's a simple man completely what have you thought on the screen is coming to you 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.219
 in case of a little more advanced 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:14.669
 for that dance detailed version two active universe 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:18.100
 bathers who offers facilities once again 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.769
 these gadgets to ide 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.689
 first thing the wi-fi we do not work on this detail I have not 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.829
 could frankly was specific it can hurt so it's pretty weird 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.449
 mix a field that would explore women 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.220
 but this year a very small 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.049
 a tiny internet window 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.389
 which allows by no one smiles a share price or the weather 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:40.589
 it's once again man enough 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:42.749
 that's enough 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:44.839
 too small to be recruited 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:45.969
 we have not 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:49.309
 a clock an event like on all machines have we also a 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:50.609
 alarm 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.769
 with her in terms of reducing her weapon in a rotating way but still 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.999
 once it's not necessarily very simple 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:00.370
 and m6 exploits the touch side seedling exploits by 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.369
 necessarily 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.549
 all the positive side is that it's almost 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.649
 more complicated to use this type of 6 46 th 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.079
 on its operating system 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.299
 the Argentine is much more practical as it allows to lift more 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:15.889
 this world see a little bit 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.399
 confess mother in the month by cons impossible to open chassis because 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:21.869
 it's a beta but three types of players a date to take by 

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:24.869
 example rendez-vous our of this art capable 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.139
 the interactions between the different software tools that are integrated 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:30.549
 it's a bit of a pity again 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.909
 a calculator conclude 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.069
 its purpose 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.319
 the finger that can be done will be dropped his mouse for the ancestor so that's 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.219
 really good in an idea of 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:43.239
 remote control placed on the coffee table are not theirs to make a small calculation 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.449
 like that with his band does not necessarily 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.939
 the idea we have of use style 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:52.329
 a note-taking system that allows either 2 draws 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.399
 fingertip 

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:57.739
 a little cruz that again is not the touch side 7 '' 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.669
 not necessarily very useful 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:05.449
 the little citroen simply has with a de gaulle system the 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:08.349
 letters so here we will use the keyboard for 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.529
 can write a little word 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:12.799
 she knows it 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.780
 for now it's sure novatel very gadget very very very beautiful lots and 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.949
 eldest son materialize in the absolute really 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.949
 at first I thought it was enough 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.349
 on the screen we finally put in capacity and a keyboard so we do not have 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.830
 character recognition that's really why once these gadgets 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.830
 which is taking notes that we will have just as fast to use 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.029
 with M 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:38.469
 with a small paper draws a small pencil at hand 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:41.490
 percent or built-in features 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.120
 which his remaining side so 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.349
 especially the management of files 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.169
 because it is well done up close to be able to do a little sketch show and images 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:54.719
 ap touch attention really it's a shame again 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:58.399
 we have functions to navigate between the images are missing to do without 

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:00.589
 from one to another with a friend 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:04.059
 with the finger on the screen so it's really this something it's him who 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:05.830
 still has four tons and digital 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.439
 then other small income axa does not take up the full size of the screen with some 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:12.439
 nights profession of 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.210
 background of g7 rsf error 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.270
 it's nice enough but as for that it's not that that would make me buy 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.819
 the EeeKeyboard 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:24.099
 when the French patrol day come Martinique with this type of 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:24.990
 machine 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.940
 this is an amazing success simon beautiful technological feat better than this 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.719
 we will be able to make this money 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:33.460
 that's the big question 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.069
 other feature of which 15 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.210
 unexpected 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.319
 variety that ethics is waiting for it censors about duo manipulations 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.319
 of the machine 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:45.729
 so he invited his mp3 players so yes that's a little bit more 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:46.540
 nice 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.939
 we doubt we will be able to launch 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:52.749
 benji fall from three meters again does that bring a real plus 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:54.279
 in relation to them 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:55.990
 compared to the operation of a 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.909
 in the software on the screen 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:01.069
 will ensue lanta i'm really not sure 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:04.939
 and suddenly we ended up here manage playlists in addition to what we can 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:06.580
 already have with you 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.029
 with his usual mp3 employer 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:12.990
 who will be without care managed directly there 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.990
 the man by the machine and the lesson and not frankly terrible 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:19.779
 manage them by plugging 5% 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:22.449
 a system of more sophisticated speakers and the priori we have a 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.789
 screen and we will use rather the the the screen so we have in front of us for 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:27.960
 manage your software 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.759
 for these friendly again it's a good idea it's a fact 

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:34.150
 promises things 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.400
 but I find that their software suite is 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.389
 the performance of all compatibilities all that 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:43.389
 it does not give a product really very exceptional trèves 

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:49.449
 we then rushed to look for 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:51.369
 movies 

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:54.039
 % videos 

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:57.460
 so to pray then there the problem is always the same with this guy 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.439
 interface there 

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:02.919
 is that we have very few colleagues who are recognized 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:04.129
 Harlem 

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:06.469
 the software provided early against compiegne 

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:09.469
 we were reduced to throwing a dice of his heroes 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.080
 it is emphasized by oseo suiting the wind the functionality 

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:17.830
 the power management account and Croatians had once again got to 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.459
 because of him on the side of the heaps of the thing and blow under vlc here we have 

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:23.520
 enjoyed seeing a movie 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.569
 now it is necessary to love formation in these conditions 

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:29.159
 these fun five minutes but hey it's not much further
