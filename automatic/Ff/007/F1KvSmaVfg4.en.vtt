what we're looking at here is a door at
the<00:00:03.500> end<00:00:03.530> of<00:00:03.770> a<00:00:03.830> hallway<00:00:04.069> that<00:00:04.340> isn't

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:05.240 
the end of a hallway that isn't

the end of a hallway that isn't
perfectly<00:00:06.080> centered<00:00:06.650> and<00:00:06.950> realistically<00:00:07.819> it

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:07.940 
perfectly centered and realistically it

perfectly centered and realistically it
isn't<00:00:08.300> centered<00:00:08.690> at<00:00:08.900> all

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
isn't centered at all

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.870 
isn't centered at all
the<00:00:10.130> door<00:00:10.639> is<00:00:10.970> over<00:00:11.809> to<00:00:12.019> the<00:00:12.230> left<00:00:12.559> and<00:00:13.460> should

the door is over to the left and should

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.790 
the door is over to the left and should
have<00:00:14.000> been<00:00:14.030> moved<00:00:14.360> over<00:00:14.780> to<00:00:15.019> the<00:00:15.200> right<00:00:15.469> and

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
have been moved over to the right and

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.580 
have been moved over to the right and
this<00:00:15.920> actually<00:00:16.580> creates<00:00:16.789> problems<00:00:17.660> with<00:00:18.410> the

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
this actually creates problems with the

this actually creates problems with the
trim<00:00:18.980> sometimes<00:00:19.730> now<00:00:20.029> this<00:00:20.270> door<00:00:20.660> doesn't

trim sometimes now this door doesn't

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.179 
trim sometimes now this door doesn't
look<00:00:21.320> like<00:00:21.560> it's<00:00:22.720> got<00:00:23.720> that<00:00:23.990> problem<00:00:24.410> however

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
look like it's got that problem however

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.890 
look like it's got that problem however
you<00:00:25.580> can<00:00:25.789> see<00:00:26.090> that<00:00:26.350> the<00:00:27.490> trim<00:00:28.490> on<00:00:28.850> the<00:00:29.570> left

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
you can see that the trim on the left

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.799 
you can see that the trim on the left
and<00:00:30.289> the<00:00:30.380> picture<00:00:30.830> here<00:00:31.130> is<00:00:31.279> right<00:00:32.269> up<00:00:32.419> against

that's perfect we're we're done here and
maybe<00:00:57.319> they<00:00:57.530> even<00:00:57.559> figured<00:00:58.190> it<00:00:58.279> out<00:00:58.399> before

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
maybe they even figured it out before

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.340 
maybe they even figured it out before
you<00:00:58.999> know<00:00:59.119> we<00:00:59.299> are<00:00:59.420> gonna<00:00:59.600> have<00:00:59.839> enough<00:01:00.139> room

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
you know we are gonna have enough room

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.889 
you know we are gonna have enough room
to<00:01:00.379> put<00:01:00.679> the<00:01:00.709> trim<00:01:01.069> on<00:01:01.209> but<00:01:02.209> we<00:01:02.329> don't<00:01:02.569> want<00:01:02.809> to

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
to put the trim on but we don't want to

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.889 
to put the trim on but we don't want to
go<00:01:03.049> through<00:01:03.319> any<00:01:03.850> any<00:01:04.850> extra<00:01:05.269> hassles<00:01:05.810> you

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
go through any any extra hassles you

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.870 
go through any any extra hassles you
know<00:01:06.109> which<00:01:06.320> realistically<00:01:07.100> in<00:01:07.189> a<00:01:07.250> situation

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
know which realistically in a situation

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.389 
know which realistically in a situation
like<00:01:08.060> this<00:01:08.390> you<00:01:08.659> could<00:01:09.619> get<00:01:09.859> away<00:01:09.979> with

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
like this you could get away with

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.730 
like this you could get away with
putting<00:01:10.640> a<00:01:11.020> 2x4<00:01:12.020> on<00:01:13.270> each<00:01:14.270> side<00:01:14.780> and<00:01:15.289> then

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
putting a 2x4 on each side and then

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.599 
putting a 2x4 on each side and then
using<00:01:16.609> a<00:01:16.820> 3/4<00:01:17.780> inch<00:01:17.810> trimmer<00:01:18.380> if<00:01:19.100> of<00:01:19.369> course

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:19.609 
using a 3/4 inch trimmer if of course

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:22.599 
using a 3/4 inch trimmer if of course
it's<00:01:19.850> not<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:20.060> load-bearing<00:01:20.420> wall<00:01:21.369> which<00:01:22.369> I

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:22.609 
it's not a load-bearing wall which I

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:25.779 
it's not a load-bearing wall which I
doubt<00:01:22.909> if<00:01:23.179> this<00:01:23.450> is<00:01:24.130> and<00:01:25.130> of<00:01:25.250> course<00:01:25.280> there<00:01:25.609> are

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
doubt if this is and of course there are

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.389 
doubt if this is and of course there are
other<00:01:26.060> ways<00:01:26.210> to<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:26.899> could<00:01:27.079> always<00:01:27.320> run<00:01:27.829> the

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
other ways to you could always run the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.539 
other ways to you could always run the
header<00:01:28.850> into<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.450> other<00:01:29.749> two<00:01:30.020> walls<00:01:30.350> and<00:01:30.859> use

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
header into the other two walls and use

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.480 
header into the other two walls and use
full<00:01:32.179> trimmers<00:01:32.630> that<00:01:32.869> way<00:01:33.049> too<00:01:33.109> and<00:01:33.590> get<00:01:34.340> the

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
full trimmers that way too and get the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.039 
full trimmers that way too and get the
equal<00:01:34.820> spacing<00:01:35.299> again<00:01:35.420> I<00:01:35.570> don't<00:01:35.780> want<00:01:35.899> to<00:01:35.960> go

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
equal spacing again I don't want to go

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.660 
equal spacing again I don't want to go
into<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.289> details<00:01:36.710> of<00:01:36.890> how<00:01:37.009> to<00:01:37.039> frame<00:01:37.429> this

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
into the details of how to frame this

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.779 
into the details of how to frame this
thing<00:01:37.999> but<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.530> main<00:01:39.920> reason<00:01:40.280> why<00:01:40.369> I<00:01:40.399> made<00:01:40.670> the

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
thing but the main reason why I made the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.590 
thing but the main reason why I made the
video<00:01:41.090> is<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:41.390> point<00:01:41.689> out<00:01:41.929> the<00:01:42.109> importance<00:01:42.710> of

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
video is to point out the importance of

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.450 
video is to point out the importance of
problems<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:44.780> could<00:01:44.960> run<00:01:45.259> into<00:01:45.649> if<00:01:46.189> your

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
problems you could run into if your

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.249 
problems you could run into if your
doors<00:01:46.759> aren't<00:01:47.030> centered<00:01:47.479> it's<00:01:47.659> not<00:01:47.840> just

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
doors aren't centered it's not just

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.770 
doors aren't centered it's not just
aesthetics<00:01:48.950> I'm<00:01:49.579> talking<00:01:50.179> about<00:01:50.270> it's<00:01:50.630> not

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
aesthetics I'm talking about it's not

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.929 
aesthetics I'm talking about it's not
just<00:01:51.079> how<00:01:51.259> it<00:01:51.469> looks

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
just how it looks

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.880 
just how it looks
I've<00:01:53.210> ran<00:01:53.539> into<00:01:53.840> problems<00:01:54.289> before<00:01:54.439> where

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
I've ran into problems before where

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.879 
I've ran into problems before where
we've<00:01:55.069> needed<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.609> rip<00:01:55.939> the<00:01:56.149> trim<00:01:56.509> down<00:01:56.869> so<00:01:57.740> on

00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:57.889 
we've needed to rip the trim down so on

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:59.980 
we've needed to rip the trim down so on
one<00:01:58.130> side<00:01:58.369> you've<00:01:58.549> got<00:01:58.729> a<00:01:58.759> full<00:01:59.030> two-inch<00:01:59.509> trim

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
one side you've got a full two-inch trim
