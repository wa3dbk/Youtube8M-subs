that Lake Michigan has to offer so it

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.249 
that Lake Michigan has to offer so it
seems<00:00:06.089> like<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.480> good<00:00:06.660> time<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:07.049> talk<00:00:07.200> about

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
seems like a good time to talk about

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.240 
seems like a good time to talk about
near-drowning

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
near-drowning

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.040 
near-drowning
so<00:00:08.730> let's<00:00:08.880> start<00:00:09.090> off<00:00:09.210> with<00:00:09.360> how<00:00:09.510> it<00:00:09.660> happens

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
so let's start off with how it happens

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.200 
so let's start off with how it happens
generally<00:00:10.769> its<00:00:11.099> lack<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.490> adult<00:00:11.700> supervision

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
generally its lack of adult supervision

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.570 
generally its lack of adult supervision
usually<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.900> backyard<00:00:13.469> pool<00:00:13.710> possibly<00:00:14.460> the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
usually in a backyard pool possibly the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.849 
usually in a backyard pool possibly the
bathtub<00:00:15.089> also<00:00:15.870> an<00:00:15.960> overconfidence<00:00:16.710> in

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
bathtub also an overconfidence in

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.560 
bathtub also an overconfidence in
swimming<00:00:17.220> skills<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:17.820> especially<00:00:18.270> what

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
swimming skills this is especially what

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.480 
swimming skills this is especially what
we<00:00:18.690> see<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.020> Lake<00:00:19.199> Michigan<00:00:19.439> drownings<00:00:20.220> or

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
we see in Lake Michigan drownings or

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.580 
we see in Lake Michigan drownings or
near<00:00:20.640> drownings<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:22.080> can<00:00:22.230> also<00:00:22.350> have

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
near drownings you can also have

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.570 
near drownings you can also have
problems<00:00:22.769> with<00:00:23.100> children<00:00:23.279> who<00:00:23.550> have

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
problems with children who have

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.820 
problems with children who have
developmental<00:00:24.090> delay<00:00:24.600> or<00:00:24.840> seizure<00:00:25.170> disorders

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
developmental delay or seizure disorders

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.279 
developmental delay or seizure disorders
also<00:00:26.490> arrhythmias<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.599> occur<00:00:28.019> during

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
also arrhythmias that occur during

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.140 
also arrhythmias that occur during
swimming<00:00:28.680> can<00:00:29.010> cause<00:00:29.220> near<00:00:29.460> drownings<00:00:29.910> and

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
swimming can cause near drownings and

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.359 
swimming can cause near drownings and
also<00:00:30.660> just<00:00:30.779> secondary<00:00:31.289> injury<00:00:31.619> for<00:00:32.009> example

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
also just secondary injury for example

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.400 
also just secondary injury for example
and<00:00:32.489> head<00:00:32.730> trauma<00:00:33.059> while<00:00:33.329> diving<00:00:33.870> or<00:00:34.050> falling

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
and head trauma while diving or falling

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.380 
and head trauma while diving or falling
off<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> powerboat<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.340> example<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.300> when

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
off a powerboat for example so when

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.150 
off a powerboat for example so when
talking<00:00:36.600> about<00:00:36.780> pre-hospital<00:00:37.320> care<00:00:37.649> if<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
talking about pre-hospital care if the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.979 
talking about pre-hospital care if the
patient<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.489> unresponsive<00:00:38.640> one<00:00:39.510> thing<00:00:39.719> we<00:00:39.809> do

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
patient is unresponsive one thing we do

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.569 
patient is unresponsive one thing we do
want<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.200> mention<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> ABCs<00:00:41.399> are<00:00:41.550> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
want to mention is that the ABCs are a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.520 
want to mention is that the ABCs are a
little<00:00:41.700> different<00:00:41.969> usually<00:00:42.870> we<00:00:42.960> think<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.230> cab

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
little different usually we think of cab

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.619 
little different usually we think of cab
with<00:00:43.890> continuous<00:00:44.399> quality<00:00:44.640> CPR<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.390> still

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
with continuous quality CPR we still

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.049 
with continuous quality CPR we still
want<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.809> do<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.140> but<00:00:46.350> first<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.219> these<00:00:47.670> cases

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
want to do that but first in these cases

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.850 
want to do that but first in these cases
our<00:00:48.480> main<00:00:48.809> problem<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> ventilatory

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
our main problem is a ventilatory

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.770 
our main problem is a ventilatory
problem<00:00:50.399> meaning<00:00:50.969> we<00:00:51.090> want<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.390> give<00:00:51.480> two

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
problem meaning we want to give two

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.900 
problem meaning we want to give two
rescue<00:00:52.230> breaths<00:00:52.260> first<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.430> specific

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
rescue breaths first this is specific

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.729 
rescue breaths first this is specific
for<00:00:53.940> near-drowning<00:00:54.559> resuscitation

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
for near-drowning resuscitation

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.069 
for near-drowning resuscitation
since<00:00:56.160> hypoxia<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.850> such<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> major<00:00:57.329> injury<00:00:57.750> you

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
since hypoxia is such a major injury you

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.150 
since hypoxia is such a major injury you
want<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.289> make<00:00:58.469> sure<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:58.949> good

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
want to make sure you have good

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160 
want to make sure you have good
ventilation<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.910> intubate<00:01:00.300> early<00:01:00.629> also<00:01:01.079> you

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
ventilation and intubate early also you

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.389 
ventilation and intubate early also you
need<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.410> think<00:01:01.530> about<00:01:01.620> rewarming<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
need to think about rewarming the

need to think about rewarming the
patient<00:01:02.789> two<00:01:03.149> things<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.510> want<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.719> not<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:04.350> in

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
patient two things you want to not do in

what happens when you hit the water
there's<00:01:31.380> usually<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.860> lot<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.130> panic<00:01:32.549> breath

there's usually a lot of panic breath

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.420 
there's usually a lot of panic breath
holing<00:01:33.390> air<00:01:33.750> hunger<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.920> usually<00:01:35.220> leads

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.680 
and fresh water but the old hypothesis
was<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.010> aspirating<00:02:21.880> salt<00:02:22.180> water<00:02:22.390> in<00:02:22.570> the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
was that aspirating salt water in the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.050 
was that aspirating salt water in the
lungs<00:02:22.810> draws<00:02:23.320> fluid<00:02:23.770> into<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.460> lungs<00:02:24.670> causing

theory for fresh water in the lungs is

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.340 
theory for fresh water in the lungs is
that<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.580> rapidly<00:02:31.090> absorbs<00:02:31.510> into<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.110> lungs

that it rapidly absorbs into the lungs

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.530 
that it rapidly absorbs into the lungs

ARDS like syndrome also make sure you

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.300 
ARDS like syndrome also make sure you
get<00:04:37.810> that<00:04:37.930> o<00:04:38.080> G<00:04:38.290> tube<00:04:38.470> in<00:04:38.620> early<00:04:38.919> because<00:04:39.070> they

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
get that o G tube in early because they

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.890 
get that o G tube in early because they
probably<00:04:39.520> swallows<00:04:40.060> a<00:04:40.150> lot<00:04:40.330> of<00:04:40.450> water<00:04:40.630> and<00:04:40.810> you
