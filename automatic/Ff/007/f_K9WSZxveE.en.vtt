00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.160
 I'll show you the products today 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:27.590
 we currently use for mila so 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.720
 It is not really care 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.970
 a lot but I thought shows you 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.769
 Just what we have and what we do 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.320
 actually I am completely satisfied with you 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:39.350
 First with the wash so we like them 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:44.120
 we were using samoa 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:47.300
 somehow you can see that this quickly 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.110
 shampoo practically standing in what camp 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.080
 nou dream and it is free and parallel 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.290
 that's with olive oil and milk protein 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.960
 and i actually have this product 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.119
 just so happened we had 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.699
 before that also things of grace or 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:06.110
 dolls and the things were not 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.000
 bad but then I just have 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.570
 It is not expensive to use this 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.340
 I say 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.229
 and there is really a lot in it and what 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.390
 just has attracted me to this hire 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.770
 is actually the pump donor because we 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.240
 go for a baby swim and me her 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.710
 then try the arm and try too 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.110
 it is simply practical to wash 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.350
 I'm so excited about this stuff 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.359
 because your skin is totally soft and but 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.399
 somehow it is really kÃ¶lsch and 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:32.090
 I have the feeling somehow her skin 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:34.340
 to destroy and I am still enabled 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.619
 more than thrilled and the little one 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.329
 that's just fine and good 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.009
 not nice and what about that too 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.560
 the cool think that's the right way 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.999
 blabla bubbles and if they are a bit 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.060
 is older she will already we 

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:48.829
 volltoll find and is much in it and 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.509
 It is not expensive and I think so 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.670
 really good you are still as 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.399
 Unfortunately, I have the alternative 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.030
 calendula was already with shampoo 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.359
 intrigued and I find this this 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.920
 wash lotion really quite well the 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.649
 we did not use it so conspicuously once 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.319
 find that the other one smells better 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.240
 Furthermore , it is actually quite pleasant 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.280
 but it does not smell smells so new after 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.720
 baby and but otherwise I find the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.630
 really very good it just stops 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.760
 pretty great some of the products we have 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.330
 then use from the car and there 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.060
 I like to use 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.220
 this intensive care and I think 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.780
 this really nice that really nice 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.850
 and finally very nice 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.400
 distribute and do not leave such a 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.990
 extremely the fettFilm and you can 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.610
 Keep children fast again 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.030
 and I really think it's a lot 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.710
 nice and we have to come to 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.630
 baby oil care so how must use 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.550
 We are happy if we do not 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.920
 use we use of hefti with 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.750
 lodge and I use that myself too 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.360
 to us because I simply very good 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.790
 find and here smells very good and I 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.880
 I feel that the chemistry is simple 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.980
 on the skin nice times but the use 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.459
 I do not stop quite as often as the oil 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.959
 because I just think that kind of 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.470
 media and just not to help 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.180
 needed because that's what the baby skin thinks 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.070
 I still do pretty well on my own 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.800
 exactly but otherwise use with this 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.070
 yes what for and then I use now 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:21.420
 Unfortunately , we want to do it during winter time 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.490
 the white goods face cream and these 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.060
 Also perfume freed not really 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:29.910
 quite as nice so I find to you 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.480
 need to herbs and tea and so so 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.280
 not rock not baby but me 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.730
 think that's very good because we like it 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.340
 I also say it's vegetable and I'm from 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.080
 Such things actually for babies 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.800
 quite confident if as the whole 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.930
 Chemical stuff and I just think 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.970
 that their skin is as yet quite well 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.600
 Feels she moves in quickly and the 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.370
 we always used now in the winter time 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.630
 Before we go out, I'll do it too 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.970
 the cheeks a bit like that 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.980
 Skin and businessman's skin and children's cream 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.840
 On it has my husband unfortunately now with 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.150
 Little walk that would otherwise I have you 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.070
 the shown but you will find over 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.380
 everything is such a small dose and that 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.150
 I really think that's great for now 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.970
 how easy the skin really nice 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.489
 then we always use if you protect 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.450
 Pushing a bit red is the vileda 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.340
 calendula baby cream and i believe i 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.970
 also often shown the find 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.280
 I am very good 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.010
 and that lasts a long time is a bit 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.830
 expensive but worth it because she has 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.680
 of course, and she is really on duty 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.190
 Well, I do not have it 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.710
 problems 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.530
 which always helps with red and at 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.540
 is alert and yes that I can really 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.230
 Also recommend what else to 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.780
 bottom are cotton swabs and these 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.240
 has extra for babies and I have it 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.280
 from baby that's just the ones here 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.700
 and critics are bit up here 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.160
 narrower and we have this pack 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.900
 since her birth and we need 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.210
 just not so many you have probably 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.100
 not so dirty are all already 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.470
 sometimes something puzzles so small 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.860
 I baby him comes out and which are 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:17.630
 really good and besides have themselves 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:20.280
 of course through all wet wipes 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.130
 tried and we are now in the 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.490
 pampers sensitive series stayed behind 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:32.460
 because I just think they are 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:37.130
 best for us everything else is either 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:40.620
 too piggy or it too wet or too 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.840
 depressed to the po or just not 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.690
 So convince and then I just have 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.620
 times the pampers tried and was from 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:52.380
 enthusiastic now I believe there is 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:55.200
 here too with the fragrance of the but 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.870
 must judge scant teeth 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:02.310
 but I'm aware of the sensitive because 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:03.510
 I find everything clean and it is 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.160
 just a little bit 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.969
 and i think they are good and i am now 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.860
 not that they are so stuck 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.959
 So the rites are pretty good 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.149
 what we still have is one 

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:16.699
 small hairbrush and came use 

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:18.619
 We do not but this hairbrush and 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:20.689
 we would have to take a bath after that 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:23.539
 sometimes the hair if this German 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:25.489
 are troops and in between, however 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:26.749
 Often they did not use them but they did 

00:06:25.489 --> 00:06:31.249
 I think it's really nice if you can 

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:32.449
 knows her years and that's why it was 

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:34.759
 so far 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:36.379
 the care article she owns 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:38.269
 and they are so good if you are 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:41.599
 Soon there will be an update 

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:45.439
 on the subject of baby care if I have something 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:51.009
 new exciting colors and button 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:51.009
 Have fun with creaming and
