they're also learning you know that's
like<00:00:26.420> chemistry<00:00:26.810> because<00:00:27.050> they're<00:00:27.230> mixing

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:27.530 
like chemistry because they're mixing

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
is the format I'm using I'm just using

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.689 
is the format I'm using I'm just using
paper<00:00:52.730> plates<00:00:52.879> and<00:00:54.069> acrylic<00:00:55.069> paint<00:00:55.100> or<00:00:55.579> you

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
paper plates and acrylic paint or you

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.669 
paper plates and acrylic paint or you
can<00:00:55.819> use<00:00:55.999> finger<00:00:56.749> paint<00:00:57.019> that<00:00:57.260> we've<00:00:57.469> made

00:00:57.669 --> 00:00:57.679 
can use finger paint that we've made

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:00.700 
can use finger paint that we've made
before<00:00:58.100> so<00:00:58.929> what<00:00:59.929> you<00:01:00.019> can<00:01:00.170> ask<00:01:00.350> your<00:01:00.589> children

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
before so what you can ask your children

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.469 
before so what you can ask your children
is<00:01:00.979> what<00:01:01.129> would<00:01:01.249> happen<00:01:01.460> when<00:01:01.789> you<00:01:01.879> mix<00:01:02.120> yellow

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:02.479 
is what would happen when you mix yellow

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.950 
is what would happen when you mix yellow
and<00:01:02.629> blue<00:01:03.129> so<00:01:04.129> you'll<00:01:04.280> just<00:01:04.390> take<00:01:05.390> some<00:01:05.690> yellow

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
and blue so you'll just take some yellow

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.840 
and blue so you'll just take some yellow
and<00:01:06.770> some<00:01:07.600> blue<00:01:08.979> and<00:01:09.979> you<00:01:10.070> can<00:01:10.100> have<00:01:10.369> a<00:01:10.399> mix<00:01:10.729> it

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
and some blue and you can have a mix it

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.530 
and some blue and you can have a mix it
together<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:12.460> obviously<00:01:13.460> we<00:01:14.119> kind<00:01:14.329> of<00:01:14.390> know

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
together and obviously we kind of know

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.100 
together and obviously we kind of know
what<00:01:15.460> color<00:01:16.460> that<00:01:16.729> makes<00:01:17.619> looks<00:01:18.619> more<00:01:18.860> of<00:01:18.890> a

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
what color that makes looks more of a

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.279 
what color that makes looks more of a
movie<00:01:21.110> screen<00:01:21.530> there<00:01:21.860> so<00:01:22.960> you<00:01:23.960> can<00:01:24.110> talk<00:01:24.259> about

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
movie screen there so you can talk about

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.920 
movie screen there so you can talk about
how<00:01:26.500> yellow<00:01:27.500> and<00:01:27.740> blue<00:01:27.890> make<00:01:27.920> screen<00:01:28.659> so<00:01:29.659> here

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
how yellow and blue make screen so here

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.620 
how yellow and blue make screen so here
are<00:01:30.020> some<00:01:30.259> more<00:01:30.409> combinations<00:01:31.009> here<00:01:31.759> the

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
are some more combinations here the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.630 
are some more combinations here the
light<00:01:32.780> blue<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.320> pink<00:01:33.530> and<00:01:33.890> I<00:01:34.340> mixed<00:01:34.549> in

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
light blue and the pink and I mixed in

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.969 
light blue and the pink and I mixed in
the<00:01:34.759> white<00:01:34.939> so<00:01:35.659> your<00:01:36.439> children<00:01:36.590> can<00:01:36.859> make

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
the white so your children can make

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.279 
the white so your children can make
their<00:01:37.130> own<00:01:37.159> colors<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.450> they<00:01:38.780> can<00:01:38.930> use<00:01:39.079> these

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
their own colors and they can use these

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.999 
their own colors and they can use these
to<00:01:39.500> paint<00:01:41.049> well<00:01:42.049> I<00:01:42.079> hope<00:01:42.289> that<00:01:42.439> you<00:01:42.530> guys<00:01:42.649> enjoy

to paint well I hope that you guys enjoy
this<00:01:43.159> idea<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:43.880> learn<00:01:44.060> to<00:01:44.240> grow<00:01:44.390> so<00:01:45.350> it's<00:01:45.920> just

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
this idea and learn to grow so it's just

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.179 
this idea and learn to grow so it's just
a<00:01:46.159> simple<00:01:46.670> way<00:01:46.909> to<00:01:46.939> teach<00:01:47.299> children<00:01:47.979> of<00:01:48.979> other

a simple way to teach children of other
colors<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:50.590> then<00:01:51.590> they<00:01:51.679> can<00:01:51.829> use<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.070> paint

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
colors and then they can use the paint

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.840 
colors and then they can use the paint
after<00:01:52.670> they<00:01:53.119> mix<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.659> colors<00:01:53.899> together
