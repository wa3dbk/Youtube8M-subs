00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
got the battery box and the motor on the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.290 
got the battery box and the motor on the
top<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.660> close<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.950> call<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.610> medium<00:00:44.850> motor

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
top and close the call a medium motor

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.479 
top and close the call a medium motor
and<00:00:45.660> also<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.770> can<00:00:46.920> call<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.309> as<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:49.010> motor<00:00:50.010> as<00:00:50.250> a

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
and also you can call it as a motor as a

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.299 
and also you can call it as a motor as a
initial<00:00:51.329> or<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> short<00:00:52.020> version<00:00:52.590> or<00:00:52.860> something

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
initial or a short version or something

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.330 
initial or a short version or something
like<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:55.670> so<00:00:56.670> hard<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.390> do<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.559> turn<00:00:59.010> up

like that but so hard to do this turn up
and<00:00:59.579> down<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.829> pushing<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.949> switch

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.429 

and<00:01:06.939> goes<00:01:07.180> down<00:01:09.180> some<00:01:10.180> and<00:01:10.450> sometimes<00:01:11.200> have

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
that kind of annoying stem from here it

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.649 
that kind of annoying stem from here it
isn't<00:01:15.960> tight<00:01:16.960> enough<00:01:16.990> it's<00:01:17.530> kind<00:01:17.860> of<00:01:17.920> loose

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
you how does it works from the mechanism

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.820 
you how does it works from the mechanism
so<00:01:31.590> here's<00:01:32.590> here's<00:01:33.369> it<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:34.240> got<00:01:34.929> four<00:01:35.470> gears

a<00:03:38.480> plot<00:03:39.140> from<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:39.440> motor<00:03:39.830> has<00:03:40.130> good<00:03:40.490> cold<00:03:41.030> brew

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
a plot from the motor has good cold brew

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.960 
a plot from the motor has good cold brew
do<00:03:41.480> is<00:03:42.050> he<00:03:42.200> going<00:03:42.410> to<00:03:42.530> plug<00:03:43.100> it<00:03:43.280> right<00:03:43.400> here

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
do is he going to plug it right here

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:54.280 
do is he going to plug it right here
so<00:03:44.720> he's<00:03:44.900> going<00:03:45.110> to<00:03:45.200> put<00:03:45.560> it<00:03:45.980> right<00:03:46.160> here<00:03:53.290> like

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
so he's going to put it right here like

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.910 
so he's going to put it right here like
that

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
that

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.750 
that
and<00:03:55.310> then<00:03:56.080> from<00:03:57.080> there<00:03:57.350> there's<00:03:57.680> Ito's<00:03:58.190> either

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
and then from there there's Ito's either

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.990 
and then from there there's Ito's either
ways<00:03:59.180> to<00:03:59.660> put<00:04:00.050> it<00:04:01.450> put<00:04:02.450> out<00:04:02.780> blue<00:04:03.500> instead

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
ways to put it put out blue instead

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.410 
ways to put it put out blue instead
first<00:04:05.000> it<00:04:05.870> doesn't<00:04:06.080> matter<00:04:06.410> what<00:04:06.740> color<00:04:07.070> is<00:04:08.060> it

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
it there's a green flash nitrate the the

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.660 
it there's a green flash nitrate the the
our<00:04:25.220> receiver<00:04:26.180> also<00:04:26.630> have<00:04:26.900> it<00:04:27.140> so<00:04:28.040> I<00:04:28.070> should

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
our receiver also have it so I should

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.969 
our receiver also have it so I should
demonstrate<00:04:28.910> that

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:39.330 

see<00:04:34.949> this<00:04:35.949> kind<00:04:36.280> of<00:04:36.370> weight<00:04:36.789> here<00:04:37.270> has<00:04:37.680> st<00:04:38.680> kind

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
see this kind of weight here has st kind

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.529 
see this kind of weight here has st kind
of<00:04:39.460> blocking<00:04:40.300> it<00:04:41.310> and<00:04:42.310> it<00:04:43.060> doesn't<00:04:43.240> really

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
of blocking it and it doesn't really

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:49.770 
of blocking it and it doesn't really
matters<00:04:44.050> but<00:04:46.229> thanks<00:04:47.229> for<00:04:47.380> watching
