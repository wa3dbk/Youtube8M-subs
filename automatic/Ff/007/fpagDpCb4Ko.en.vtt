00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.379
 Hello everyone, Sergey, and this 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.119
 fourth issue transfer notes 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.080
 collector and today I want 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.770
 talk about 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.050
 in the final part of the batman trilogy 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.650
 from rokstedi of course it's nominally 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:31.310
 the fourth part but we know something with you 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:33.230
 2 years ago 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.410
 various European collectibles 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.550
 another American only for consoles 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.220
 for the company will 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.980
 appeared on my radar for another month 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.079
 four ago did in english amazon 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.559
 pre-order on the x-box because there 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:52.850
 was coming out at around 5,800 from playstation 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.670
 about 8000 is the same and now it's over 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.489
 so much time and suddenly russian 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.530
 stores like video games. but this 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.199
 is made interest exposed for 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.050
 pre-order both at once and American and 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.600
 european version on after on 4 and on 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.560
 x-box and what was my surprise that 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.619
 price in Russia 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.270
 but also a building with a figure that I ordered 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.460
 It costs 6 thousand rubles, that is, it is 100 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.340
 rubles more expensive but in general it comes out and 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.659
 cheaper considering that we have no delivery 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.060
 can pick up from England delivery yet 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:29.590
 pounds ten will come out here now 2 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.329
 the publication in both the same steelbook 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.189
 artbook 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:38.380
 comics and character skins 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.600
 they differ only 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.049
 figures cheaper edition for 6000 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.049
 rubles goes a 12-inch statue of batman 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.950
 looks very nice he stands over 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.950
 city ​​a 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.229
 and not like the Batman monument 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.969
 probably plastic but it seems like 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.009
 as if made of metal right on 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.270
 the illusion is created by looking at the picture 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.939
 very cool 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.840
 and the second edition is 4 thousand more for 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:08.690
 10,000 Batmobile figure in the house from the game and 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.030
 and the trick is that it is not just a statue 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.160
 it is completely transformed in the same way 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.600
 how machines transforms in the game then 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.110
 there are not many moving parts 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.540
 for fidelity pre-order both editions but 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.720
 I will take of course what is the only one 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.120
 still leaning towards the version with the statuette 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.280
 Batman can put it steel 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.400
 the figure will look beautiful yes and 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.370
 cheaper but what about the batmobile? 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.490
 I'll play it I'll take off the boxing and then he 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.770
 as other figures will also stand well 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.610
 and not so he looks spectacular 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.380
 how does the batman himself write on this 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.200
 comments are you going to play 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.020
 batman on what platform if you 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.900
 take a ring what are you going to take 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.470
 It will be very interesting to discuss all the pros and 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.810
 vs 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.290
 was with you, sergey, we will see you in 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.290
