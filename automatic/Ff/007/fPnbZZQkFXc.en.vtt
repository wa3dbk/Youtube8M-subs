no one can really blame me directly
we'll<00:00:58.030> probably<00:00:58.239> get<00:00:58.690> everything<00:00:59.649> wrong<00:01:00.010> I

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
we'll probably get everything wrong I

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.369 
we'll probably get everything wrong I
think<00:01:00.820> it's<00:01:00.940> going<00:01:01.090> to<00:01:01.120> take<00:01:01.360> 10,000<00:01:02.079> years<00:01:02.320> of

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
think it's going to take 10,000 years of

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.009 
think it's going to take 10,000 years of
bracketing<00:01:03.129> maybe<00:01:03.370> more<00:01:03.699> to<00:01:03.909> get<00:01:04.180> a<00:01:04.420> really

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
bracketing maybe more to get a really

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.499 
bracketing maybe more to get a really
good<00:01:05.320> image<00:01:05.649> having<00:01:06.340> a<00:01:06.520> camera<00:01:07.000> that<00:01:07.149> provides

everything that we do by every decision

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.870 
everything that we do by every decision
that<00:01:28.750> we<00:01:28.960> make<00:01:29.140> it<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.619> most<00:01:29.770> powerless<00:01:30.250> so

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
that we make it the most powerless so

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.669 
that we make it the most powerless so
deep<00:01:31.119> time<00:01:31.330> has<00:01:31.479> become<00:01:31.630> incredibly<00:01:32.289> relevant

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
deep time has become incredibly relevant

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:34.940 
deep time has become incredibly relevant
to<00:01:33.340> us<00:01:33.490> even<00:01:33.820> as<00:01:34.179> it<00:01:34.330> has<00:01:34.479> remained

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
to us even as it has remained

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:51.140 
to us even as it has remained
effectively<00:01:35.950> on<00:01:36.130> patent

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.250 

so<00:01:52.150> this<00:01:52.870> is<00:01:53.230> a<00:01:53.970> hundred-year<00:01:54.970> camera<00:01:55.840> doesn't

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
so this is a hundred-year camera doesn't

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.719 
so this is a hundred-year camera doesn't
look<00:01:56.410> like<00:01:56.620> it<00:01:56.830> I<00:01:56.860> know<00:01:56.979> it<00:01:57.340> looks<00:01:57.580> like<00:01:57.640> a

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
look like it I know it looks like a

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.810 
look like it I know it looks like a
piece<00:01:58.150> of<00:01:58.180> paper<00:01:58.750> and<00:01:59.229> it<00:01:59.500> is<00:01:59.650> ordinary<00:02:00.040> black

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
piece of paper and it is ordinary black

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.270 
piece of paper and it is ordinary black
paper<00:02:01.510> that<00:02:02.110> will<00:02:02.229> fade<00:02:02.440> in<00:02:02.590> sunlight<00:02:03.010> so<00:02:03.220> the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
paper that will fade in sunlight so the

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.350 
paper that will fade in sunlight so the
idea<00:02:03.490> basically<00:02:03.610> is<00:02:03.880> you're<00:02:03.970> trying<00:02:04.060> to<00:02:04.150> make

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
idea basically is you're trying to make

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.530 
idea basically is you're trying to make
it<00:02:04.479> into<00:02:04.690> a<00:02:04.720> box<00:02:05.080> into<00:02:05.800> a<00:02:05.950> camera<00:02:06.310> by<00:02:06.910> piercing

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
it into a box into a camera by piercing

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.109 
it into a box into a camera by piercing
a<00:02:07.630> pinhole<00:02:08.050> through<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.530> front<00:02:08.830> my<00:02:09.789> deep<00:02:09.940> time

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
a pinhole through the front my deep time

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.290 
a pinhole through the front my deep time
photography<00:02:10.300> project<00:02:11.260> began<00:02:11.620> with<00:02:12.040> a<00:02:12.670> camera

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
photography project began with a camera

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.930 
photography project began with a camera
that<00:02:13.450> has<00:02:13.600> a<00:02:13.630> hundred<00:02:13.870> year<00:02:14.550> exposure<00:02:15.550> time

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
that has a hundred year exposure time

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.970 
that has a hundred year exposure time
and<00:02:16.270> I<00:02:16.360> put<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.570> hundred<00:02:16.959> of<00:02:17.080> these<00:02:17.170> out<00:02:17.560> in

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
and I put a hundred of these out in

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.160 
and I put a hundred of these out in
Berlin<00:02:18.430> working<00:02:19.150> in<00:02:19.360> collaboration<00:02:19.930> with

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
locals there and that effectively is

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.430 
locals there and that effectively is
what<00:02:22.209> I'm<00:02:22.360> now<00:02:22.510> bringing<00:02:22.690> in<00:02:22.959> too<00:02:23.050> tempting

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
what I'm now bringing in too tempting

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.720 
what I'm now bringing in too tempting
and<00:02:23.500> we'll<00:02:23.620> be<00:02:23.739> bringing<00:02:23.920> also<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:24.550> other

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
indoors rather than out but then you

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.220 
indoors rather than out but then you
have<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.030> problem<00:03:09.390> of<00:03:09.480> whether<00:03:09.600> that<00:03:09.780> indoors

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
have the problem of whether that indoors

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.010 
have the problem of whether that indoors
will<00:03:10.440> survive<00:03:10.740> for<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.130> long<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:12.060> really<00:03:12.660> at

will survive for that long it really at
some<00:03:13.320> level<00:03:13.590> is<00:03:13.740> about<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.190> leap<00:03:14.400> of<00:03:14.520> faith

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990

some level is about that leap of faith
all<00:03:15.990> of<00:03:16.050> this<00:03:16.440> can<00:03:17.160> provide<00:03:17.850> a<00:03:17.910> sort<00:03:18.330> of<00:03:18.420> a
