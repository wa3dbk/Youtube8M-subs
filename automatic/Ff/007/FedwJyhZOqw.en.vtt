once<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.670> get<00:01:50.789> more<00:01:50.909> experience<00:01:51.709> you'll

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:52.709 
once you get more experience you'll

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:53.809 
once you get more experience you'll
probably<00:01:52.889> get<00:01:53.069> more<00:01:53.219> pop<00:01:53.429> to<00:01:53.609> it<00:01:53.639> but<00:01:53.789> the

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
probably get more pop to it but the

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:55.219 
probably get more pop to it but the
first<00:01:54.030> couple<00:01:54.209> of<00:01:54.299> times<00:01:54.359> it's<00:01:54.929> just<00:01:55.049> going<00:01:55.200> to

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
first couple of times it's just going to

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.309 
first couple of times it's just going to
spin<00:01:55.469> real<00:01:55.649> close<00:01:55.859> to<00:01:56.039> the<00:01:56.130> ground<00:01:56.219> like<00:01:56.490> that

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
spin real close to the ground like that

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.949 
spin real close to the ground like that
anyways<00:01:58.319> you're<00:01:58.889> going<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.069> pop<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.959> role

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
anyways you're going to pop this role

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:02.269 
anyways you're going to pop this role
this<00:02:01.109> off<00:02:01.289> I<00:02:01.469> don't<00:02:01.649> know<00:02:01.709> if<00:02:01.799> y'all<00:02:01.950> can<00:02:02.100> see

this off I don't know if y'all can see

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:04.660 
this off I don't know if y'all can see
but<00:02:02.520> roll<00:02:03.209> it<00:02:03.329> off<00:02:03.450> about<00:02:03.719> right<00:02:03.990> there<00:02:04.229> and

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
but roll it off about right there and

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.919 
but roll it off about right there and
then<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:05.850> going<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.029> start<00:02:06.359> the<00:02:06.509> roll<00:02:06.689> like

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
then it's going to start the roll like

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:08.359 
then it's going to start the roll like
that

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.770 
this is a real frustrating trick and it
takes<00:04:11.040> forever<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.400> learn<00:04:11.610> just<00:04:12.330> keep<00:04:12.510> trying

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
takes forever to learn just keep trying

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.009 
takes forever to learn just keep trying
and<00:04:13.790> I'm<00:04:14.790> going<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:14.970> put<00:04:15.330> some<00:04:15.360> bloopers<00:04:15.750> in<00:04:15.900> at

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
and I'm going to put some bloopers in at

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.039 
and I'm going to put some bloopers in at
the<00:04:16.140> end<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:17.150> show<00:04:18.150> you<00:04:18.209> some<00:04:18.299> extras<00:04:18.810> and

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
the end and show you some extras and

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.580 
the end and show you some extras and
show<00:04:19.560> you<00:04:19.650> what's<00:04:19.830> going<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.040> happen<00:04:20.370> because

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
show you what's going to happen because

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.740 
show you what's going to happen because
it's<00:04:22.590> not<00:04:22.800> a<00:04:22.860> thing<00:04:23.100> that<00:04:23.270> you<00:04:24.270> can<00:04:24.420> get<00:04:24.570> real

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
it's not a thing that you can get real

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.810 
it's not a thing that you can get real
consistent<00:04:25.290> of<00:04:25.350> I<00:04:25.530> mean<00:04:25.680> even<00:04:26.400> some<00:04:26.670> of<00:04:26.760> my

friends take a you know takes them a
couple<00:04:29.880> times<00:04:30.120> because<00:04:30.900> it's<00:04:31.170> a<00:04:31.290> pretty

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
couple times because it's a pretty

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.920 
couple times because it's a pretty
difficult<00:04:31.800> trick<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.480> it's<00:04:33.480> just<00:04:33.630> something

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930

difficult trick and it's just something
you<00:04:34.110> have<00:04:34.500> to<00:04:34.530> develop<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:37.250> that's<00:04:38.250> pretty

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
you have to develop and that's pretty

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.430 
you have to develop and that's pretty
much<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:39.350> p<00:04:40.350> is<00:04:41.270> you're<00:04:42.270> going<00:04:42.390> to<00:04:42.450> kick<00:04:43.170> this<00:04:43.380> a

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:12.570 
transition it's going to flip nice it's
going<00:06:10.659> to<00:06:10.690> be<00:06:10.870> easier<00:06:11.050> to<00:06:11.289> land<00:06:11.440> all<00:06:12.340> you<00:06:12.460> need

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
going to be easier to land all you need

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.809 
going to be easier to land all you need
to<00:06:12.669> do<00:06:12.819> and<00:06:14.280> you<00:06:15.280> might<00:06:15.430> want<00:06:15.520> to<00:06:15.669> try<00:06:15.729> the

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:15.819 
to do and you might want to try the

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:19.080 
to do and you might want to try the
stationary<00:06:16.419> first<00:06:16.659> because<00:06:17.940> while<00:06:18.940> you're

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
stationary first because while you're

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.059 
stationary first because while you're
moving<00:06:19.180> it<00:06:19.569> gets<00:06:19.780> harder<00:06:20.139> you<00:06:20.530> need<00:06:20.710> more<00:06:20.860> pop

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:21.069 
moving it gets harder you need more pop

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:23.730 
moving it gets harder you need more pop
and<00:06:21.479> it's<00:06:22.479> hard<00:06:22.629> to<00:06:22.659> land<00:06:22.930> because<00:06:23.560> you're

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
and it's hard to land because you're

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.249 
and it's hard to land because you're
moving<00:06:24.639> with<00:06:25.090> the<00:06:25.210> board<00:06:25.419> and<00:06:25.720> you're<00:06:26.169> going

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:26.259 
moving with the board and you're going

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:28.619 
moving with the board and you're going
to<00:06:26.319> have<00:06:26.470> to<00:06:26.590> land<00:06:27.340> it<00:06:27.610> plus<00:06:28.180> have<00:06:28.479> that

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:28.629 
to have to land it plus have that

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:30.320 
to have to land it plus have that
momentum<00:06:29.110> going<00:06:29.139> forward<00:06:29.590> still<00:06:30.009> and<00:06:30.250> all

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
momentum going forward still and all

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.550 
momentum going forward still and all
your<00:06:31.330> stationary<00:06:31.840> you're<00:06:31.990> just<00:06:32.139> jumping<00:06:32.349> up

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
your stationary you're just jumping up

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.610 
your stationary you're just jumping up
and<00:06:32.650> down<00:06:32.770> that's<00:06:33.250> pretty<00:06:33.400> much<00:06:33.550> it
