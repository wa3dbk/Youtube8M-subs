this video I'm going to show you a
couple<00:00:04.200> of<00:00:04.230> different<00:00:04.560> concepts<00:00:05.069> for

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
couple of different concepts for

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.270 
couple of different concepts for
creating<00:00:05.970> original<00:00:06.540> blow<00:00:07.080> ups<00:00:07.290> with<00:00:07.740> basic

moves first concept I want to show you
is<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.410> macro<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.070> micro<00:00:11.610> tricks<00:00:11.910> now<00:00:12.389> macro

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
is the macro and micro tricks now macro

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.680 
is the macro and micro tricks now macro
tricks<00:00:13.349> are<00:00:13.530> bigger<00:00:14.009> tricks<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.730> micro

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
tricks are bigger tricks and micro

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.620 
tricks are bigger tricks and micro
tricks<00:00:15.990> are<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.980> smaller<00:00:17.430> more<00:00:17.880> detailed<00:00:18.390> and

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
tricks are the smaller more detailed and

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.290 
tricks are the smaller more detailed and
more<00:00:19.050> intricate<00:00:19.710> tricks<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.640> macro<00:00:21.000> trick

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
more intricate tricks a macro trick

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.090 
more intricate tricks a macro trick
which<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.539> something<00:00:22.170> that's<00:00:22.410> bigger<00:00:22.740> that's

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
which is something that's bigger that's

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.560 
which is something that's bigger that's
bigger<00:00:23.400> trick<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.090> looks<00:00:24.240> something<00:00:24.420> like

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
bigger trick and looks something like

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.099 
bigger trick and looks something like
this

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
this

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.339 
this
yeah<00:00:25.410> by<00:00:25.710> my<00:00:25.920> socks<00:00:28.699> ok<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.539> micro<00:00:31.080> trick

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
yeah by my socks ok so a micro trick

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.190 
yeah by my socks ok so a micro trick
something<00:00:31.920> smaller<00:00:32.579> can<00:00:33.059> be<00:00:33.210> something<00:00:33.870> like

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
something smaller can be something like

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:44.240 
something smaller can be something like
this<00:00:42.469> alright<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.739> see<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.100> difference

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
this alright so you see the difference

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.020 
this alright so you see the difference
the<00:00:45.059> macro<00:00:45.750> trick<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.260> more<00:00:46.739> defined<00:00:47.610> as<00:00:47.850> i

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
the macro trick is more defined as i

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.360 
the macro trick is more defined as i
zoom<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.870> bit<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.739> micro<00:00:50.129> trick

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
zoom and it's bit in the micro trick

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.720 
zoom and it's bit in the micro trick
it's<00:00:50.550> like<00:00:50.700> more<00:00:51.480> intricate<00:00:52.020> more<00:00:52.350> detail<00:00:52.730> ok

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
it's like more intricate more detail ok

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.119 
it's like more intricate more detail ok
so<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> concept<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.989> by<00:00:55.260> combining<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
so the concept is this by combining the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.299 
so the concept is this by combining the
macro<00:00:56.550> trick<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.719> micro<00:00:58.140> trick<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.949> begin

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
macro trick with a micro trick you begin

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.270 
macro trick with a micro trick you begin
to<00:00:59.489> create<00:00:59.760> something<00:01:00.030> that's<00:01:00.210> more

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
to create something that's more

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.189 
to create something that's more
explosive<00:01:02.280> because<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:03.180> got<00:01:03.750> different

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
explosive because it's got different

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.260 
explosive because it's got different
levels<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:05.010> metaphor<00:01:05.489> here<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.850> kind<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.210> like

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
levels the metaphor here is kind of like

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.260 
levels the metaphor here is kind of like
the<00:01:06.630> heart<00:01:06.990> monitor<00:01:07.170> where<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.130> jumps<00:01:08.490> up<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
the heart monitor where it jumps up and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.000 
the heart monitor where it jumps up and
up

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
up

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.640 
up
instead<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.580> going<00:01:11.729> flatline<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:13.080> when<00:01:13.470> you

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
instead of going flatline so when you

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.460 
instead of going flatline so when you
have<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.280> big<00:01:15.090> motion<00:01:15.390> combined<00:01:16.140> with<00:01:16.320> this

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
have that big motion combined with this

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.620 
have that big motion combined with this
small<00:01:16.740> motion<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.460> macro<00:01:17.909> combined<00:01:18.299> with<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
small motion the macro combined with the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.460 
small motion the macro combined with the
micro<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.560> start<00:01:19.860> creating<00:01:20.220> more<00:01:20.580> dynamic<00:01:21.470> we

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
micro you start creating more dynamic we

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.560 
micro you start creating more dynamic we
can<00:01:22.740> do<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.310> if<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:23.820> smaller<00:01:24.240> more

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
can do that is if you have smaller more

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.359 
can do that is if you have smaller more
intricate<00:01:25.049> tricks<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.770> want<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.979> see<00:01:26.159> how<00:01:26.310> you

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
intricate tricks you want to see how you

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.580 
intricate tricks you want to see how you
can<00:01:26.670> combine<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.299> with<00:01:27.509> your<00:01:27.869> bigger<00:01:28.200> tricks

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
can combine that with your bigger tricks

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.490 
can combine that with your bigger tricks
or<00:01:28.979> vice<00:01:29.340> versa<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.030> example<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.780> combining<00:01:31.020> a

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
or vice versa so example of combining a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.740 
or vice versa so example of combining a
macro<00:01:31.979> trick<00:01:32.250> with<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> micro<00:01:32.970> trick<00:01:33.210> will

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
macro trick with the micro trick will

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.870 
macro trick with the micro trick will
look<00:01:33.930> something<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.290> this

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.219 

I<00:01:43.400> went<00:01:44.400> from<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.820> big<00:01:45.030> movement<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:46.200> a

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
I went from the big movement to a

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.649 
I went from the big movement to a
smaller<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.520> that's<00:01:47.670> closer<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.509> ground

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
smaller and that's closer to the ground

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.140 
smaller and that's closer to the ground
that<00:01:49.440> brings<00:01:49.680> us<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.159> next<00:01:50.310> concept<00:01:50.909> of

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
that brings us to the next concept of

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.990 
that brings us to the next concept of
creating<00:01:51.600> levels<00:01:52.229> from<00:01:52.530> high<00:01:52.830> level<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.759> low

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
creating levels from high level to low

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.510 
creating levels from high level to low
level<00:01:54.420> now<00:01:54.930> what<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.170> mean<00:01:55.409> by<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:56.070> high

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
level now what I mean by that a high

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.350 
level now what I mean by that a high
level<00:01:56.909> trick<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.720> something<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:59.360> all

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
level trick is something like this all

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.760 
level trick is something like this all
right<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.659> little<00:02:00.899> level<00:02:01.229> trick<00:02:01.440> can<00:02:01.649> be

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
right a little level trick can be

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.539 
right a little level trick can be
something<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:03.920> when<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:04.950> combine<00:02:05.399> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
something like this when you combine the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.510 
something like this when you combine the
two<00:02:05.580> together<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.899> put<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.380> high<00:02:07.619> with<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.190> low

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
two together you put a high with a low

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.880 
two together you put a high with a low
you<00:02:09.179> get<00:02:09.479> something<00:02:09.869> that's<00:02:10.110> more<00:02:10.319> dynamic

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
you get something that's more dynamic

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.170 
you get something that's more dynamic
even<00:02:11.280> though<00:02:11.400> if<00:02:11.580> you're<00:02:11.730> not<00:02:11.880> doing

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
even though if you're not doing

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.420 
even though if you're not doing
something<00:02:12.360> that's<00:02:12.780> super<00:02:13.200> difficult<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.010> do

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
something that's super difficult to do

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.430 
something that's super difficult to do
there<00:02:14.730> still<00:02:14.940> creates<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.630> really<00:02:16.230> dynamic

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
there still creates that really dynamic

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.800 
there still creates that really dynamic
skill<00:02:17.100> in<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.970> example<00:02:18.390> would<00:02:18.450> be<00:02:18.510> something

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
skill in the example would be something

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:29.900 
skill in the example would be something
like<00:02:18.959> this<00:02:27.319> so<00:02:28.319> I<00:02:28.350> went<00:02:28.739> from<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.220> high<00:02:29.580> movement

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
like this so I went from a high movement

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.449 
like this so I went from a high movement
where<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:30.750> jump<00:02:31.049> all<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.290> way<00:02:31.440> up<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.950> then<00:02:32.220> I

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
where I jump all the way up and then I

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.330 
where I jump all the way up and then I
did<00:02:32.670> these<00:02:33.180> get<00:02:33.420> down<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.110> freeze<00:02:34.470> low<00:02:35.010> to

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
did these get down to a freeze low to

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.900 
did these get down to a freeze low to
the<00:02:35.370> ground

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
the ground

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.210 
the ground
so<00:02:36.269> it<00:02:36.390> creates<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.840> dynamic<00:02:37.590> movement<00:02:38.010> even

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
so it creates that dynamic movement even

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.699 
so it creates that dynamic movement even
though<00:02:38.400> it's<00:02:38.819> a<00:02:39.030> simple<00:02:39.480> move<00:02:39.720> or<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.260> simple

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
though it's a simple move or a simple

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.520 
though it's a simple move or a simple
combo<00:02:41.130> actually<00:02:41.730> quite<00:02:42.000> an<00:02:42.209> easy<00:02:42.450> combo<00:02:43.019> it's

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
combo actually quite an easy combo it's

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.729 
combo actually quite an easy combo it's
more<00:02:43.860> dynamic<00:02:44.100> then<00:02:44.970> if<00:02:45.269> I<00:02:45.420> was<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:46.230> stay

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
more dynamic then if I was to just stay

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.039 
more dynamic then if I was to just stay
on<00:02:47.010> one<00:02:47.100> level<00:02:47.670> bottom<00:02:48.420> line<00:02:48.570> you<00:02:48.750> want<00:02:48.959> to

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
on one level bottom line you want to

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.280 
on one level bottom line you want to
create<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.620> contrast<00:02:50.310> or<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:51.090> up-and-down<00:02:51.870> for

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
create a contrast or the up-and-down for

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.250 
create a contrast or the up-and-down for
your<00:02:52.500> mousse<00:02:52.890> for<00:02:53.430> your<00:02:53.549> tricks<00:02:53.850> for<00:02:54.209> when<00:02:55.170> you

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
your mousse for your tricks for when you

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.050 
your mousse for your tricks for when you
put<00:02:55.500> two<00:02:55.709> things<00:02:55.920> together<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.790> way<00:02:57.000> you

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
put two things together this way you

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.560 
put two things together this way you
make<00:02:57.420> your<00:02:57.450> trace<00:02:58.019> more<00:02:58.320> dynamic<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.420> hope<00:03:00.420> you

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570
