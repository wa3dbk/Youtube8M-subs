okay<00:00:02.370> so<00:00:02.429> if<00:00:02.639> you've<00:00:02.760> come<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:03.060> this<00:00:03.149> video

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
okay so if you've come to this video

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.610 
okay so if you've come to this video
you've<00:00:03.689> come<00:00:03.870> here<00:00:04.049> because<00:00:04.170> you<00:00:04.440> have<00:00:04.529> an

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
you've come here because you have an

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.000 
you've come here because you have an
iMac<00:00:05.009> and<00:00:05.270> a<00:00:06.270> power<00:00:06.420> supply<00:00:06.600> and<00:00:07.230> you<00:00:07.890> either

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
iMac and a power supply and you either

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.799 
iMac and a power supply and you either
want<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.340> test<00:00:08.550> it<00:00:08.730> or<00:00:08.910> replace<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.300> or<00:00:09.599> whatnot

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
want to test it or replace it or whatnot

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:10.970 
want to test it or replace it or whatnot
I'm<00:00:10.139> not<00:00:10.320> going<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.500> go<00:00:10.620> over<00:00:10.800> how<00:00:10.920> to

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
I'm not going to go over how to

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.560 
I'm not going to go over how to
disassemble<00:00:11.309> your<00:00:11.700> iMac<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.150> can<00:00:12.269> find<00:00:12.480> that

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
disassemble your iMac you can find that

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.289 
disassemble your iMac you can find that
on<00:00:12.719> another<00:00:12.960> video<00:00:13.549> I'm<00:00:14.549> basically<00:00:15.030> going<00:00:15.240> to

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
on another video I'm basically going to

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.550 
on another video I'm basically going to
go<00:00:15.420> over<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.690> testing<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.139> power<00:00:16.289> supply

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
go over the testing of the power supply

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.890 
go over the testing of the power supply
these<00:00:17.010> power<00:00:17.310> supplies<00:00:17.670> are<00:00:17.699> about<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.660> hundred

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
these power supplies are about a hundred

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.990 
these power supplies are about a hundred
and<00:00:19.109> forty<00:00:19.380> dollars<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.100> going<00:00:20.400> rate<00:00:20.609> and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
and forty dollars is the going rate and

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.090 
and forty dollars is the going rate and
so<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:22.109> kind<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.350> nice<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.529> get<00:00:22.710> an<00:00:22.830> idea<00:00:23.039> of

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
so it's kind of nice to get an idea of

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.250 
so it's kind of nice to get an idea of
whether<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.460> should<00:00:23.609> be<00:00:23.670> replacing<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.260> the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
whether you should be replacing it the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.470 
whether you should be replacing it the
one<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:25.859> has<00:00:26.130> no<00:00:26.460> blown<00:00:26.760> capacitors

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
one that I have has no blown capacitors

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.810 
one that I have has no blown capacitors
and<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:29.070> one<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.279> those<00:00:29.429> things<00:00:29.609> where

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
and so it's one of those things where

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.250 
and so it's one of those things where
I'm<00:00:29.970> really<00:00:30.359> not<00:00:30.480> certain<00:00:30.869> if<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:31.050> should<00:00:31.199> be

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
I'm really not certain if I should be

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.410 
I'm really not certain if I should be
over<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.619> there<00:00:31.740> or<00:00:31.859> not<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.340> I've<00:00:33.090> really

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
over in there or not but I've really

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.380 
over in there or not but I've really
come<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.809> difficult<00:00:34.440> point<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.550> what<00:00:36.300> I'm

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
come to a difficult point so what I'm

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.610 
come to a difficult point so what I'm
going<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.570> show<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.290> was<00:00:37.380> very

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
going to show you is it was very

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.260 
going to show you is it was very
difficult<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.040> find<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.640> diagram<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
difficult to find a diagram of the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.780 
difficult to find a diagram of the
pinout<00:00:39.860> as<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> matter<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.100> fact<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.399> still<00:00:41.640> have

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
pinout as a matter of fact I still have

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.850 
pinout as a matter of fact I still have
not<00:00:41.940> found<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.420> great<00:00:42.809> diagram<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> panel

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
not found a great diagram of the panel

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.950 
not found a great diagram of the panel
for<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.160> power<00:00:44.309> supply<00:00:44.460> test<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.809> is

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
for the power supply test this is

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.420 
for the power supply test this is
probably<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.410> closest<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.980> accurate

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
probably the closest to accurate

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.869 
probably the closest to accurate
considering<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.180> it's<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.420> fourteen<00:00:48.870> pin

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
considering that it's a fourteen pin

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.660 
considering that it's a fourteen pin
power<00:00:50.879> plug<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:52.710> one<00:00:52.949> main<00:00:53.250> thing<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.640> I

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
power plug the one main thing that I

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.590 
power plug the one main thing that I
have<00:00:53.910> determined<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:55.520> the<00:00:56.520> ground<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.360> in

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
have determined is that the ground is in

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.450 
have determined is that the ground is in
this<00:00:57.780> lower<00:00:58.020> left<00:00:58.320> hand<00:00:58.469> corner<00:00:58.590> relative<00:00:59.280> to

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
this lower left hand corner relative to

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.420 
this lower left hand corner relative to
the<00:00:59.550> clip<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.780> coming<00:01:01.260> back<00:01:01.289> over<00:01:01.440> here<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:01.949> I

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
the clip so coming back over here and I

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.709 
the clip so coming back over here and I
don't<00:01:02.489> think<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.120> rest<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.510> pin

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
don't think that the rest of that pin

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.990 
don't think that the rest of that pin
out<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:03.989> necessarily<00:01:04.650> accurate<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.850> one

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
out is necessarily accurate the one

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.520 
out is necessarily accurate the one
thing<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.420> wanted<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.780> point<00:01:07.049> out<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.470> do

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
thing that I wanted to point out is I do

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.039 
thing that I wanted to point out is I do
believe<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.549> ground<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.299> accurate<00:01:09.869> on

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
believe that the ground is accurate on

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.170 
believe that the ground is accurate on
there<00:01:11.960> so<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:12.990> plug<00:01:13.350> my<00:01:13.560> am<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.060> you

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
there so I plug my am so just if you

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.690 
there so I plug my am so just if you
have<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> multimeter<00:01:15.950> just<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.040> heads<00:01:17.189> up<00:01:17.369> you're

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
have a multimeter just a heads up you're

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.550 
have a multimeter just a heads up you're
going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.880> want<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.060> set<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.689> DC<00:01:19.049> voltage

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
going to want to set it to DC voltage

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.050 
going to want to set it to DC voltage
because<00:01:19.950> your<00:01:20.100> power<00:01:20.280> supply<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.610> outputting

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
because your power supply is outputting

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.760 
because your power supply is outputting
DC<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.570> you're<00:01:22.080> going<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.290> want<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.439> set<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.740> to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
DC and you're going to want to set it to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.490 
DC and you're going to want to set it to
20<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.450> don't<00:01:24.600> fry<00:01:24.810> your<00:01:24.990> multimeter

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
20 so that you don't fry your multimeter

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.050 
20 so that you don't fry your multimeter
if<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.830> set<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> lower<00:01:26.580> number<00:01:26.700> you

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
if you set it to a lower number you

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.270 
if you set it to a lower number you
could<00:01:27.180> actually<00:01:27.299> cook<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.290> anyway<00:01:28.560> once

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
could actually cook it so anyway once

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.600 
could actually cook it so anyway once
you<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.430> your<00:01:29.490> multimeter<00:01:31.400> I'm<00:01:32.400> going<00:01:32.549> to

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
you have your multimeter I'm going to

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.310 
you have your multimeter I'm going to
try<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.820> get<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.060> all<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.450> camera<00:01:33.930> it's<00:01:34.259> not

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
try and get this all on camera it's not

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.289 
try and get this all on camera it's not
going<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> easiest<00:01:35.130> you're<00:01:36.119> going<00:01:36.240> to

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
going to be the easiest you're going to

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
relative to the clip and I'm getting 12

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.499 
relative to the clip and I'm getting 12
volts<00:02:01.640> off<00:02:01.790> that<00:02:02.229> now<00:02:03.729> if<00:02:04.729> you<00:02:04.940> look<00:02:05.180> on<00:02:05.360> the

volts off that now if you look on the

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.800 
volts off that now if you look on the

power supply itself it has listed that
it's<00:02:08.959> supposed<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.289> be<00:02:09.380> outputting<00:02:09.950> 12<00:02:10.310> volts

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
it's supposed to be outputting 12 volts

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.930 

in<00:02:13.790> various<00:02:14.330> locations<00:02:15.019> and<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:16.310> don't<00:02:16.459> get<00:02:16.640> 12

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
in various locations and I don't get 12

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.970 
in various locations and I don't get 12
volts<00:02:17.209> at<00:02:17.330> any<00:02:17.480> other<00:02:17.599> location<00:02:17.840> so<00:02:18.440> I<00:02:18.650> do

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
volts at any other location so I do

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.809 
volts at any other location so I do
believe<00:02:19.340> it's<00:02:19.459> wrong

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
believe it's wrong

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.210 
believe it's wrong
I'm<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:21.230> do<00:02:21.290> believe<00:02:21.590> that<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.830> power<00:02:21.980> supply

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
I'm I do believe that the power supply

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.340 
I'm I do believe that the power supply
is<00:02:22.280> failed<00:02:22.550> but<00:02:23.360> don't<00:02:23.660> take<00:02:23.840> that<00:02:24.050> for

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
is failed but don't take that for

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.259 
is failed but don't take that for
