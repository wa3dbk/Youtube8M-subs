an<00:02:17.500> antenna<00:02:17.830> on<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.160> back<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.550> if<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.640> were

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
an antenna on the back and if you were

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.010 
an antenna on the back and if you were
going<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:18.970> take<00:02:19.120> us<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.540> beach<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.900> most

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020

Beach just do mandate that you have an

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.410 
Beach just do mandate that you have an
antenna<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:23.830> there's<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.490> set<00:02:24.760> up<00:02:24.880> there<00:02:25.060> for

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
good one to shift differential wise

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.460 
good one to shift differential wise
since<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.130> 74<00:02:51.610> has<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.790> Dana<00:02:52.090> 44<00:02:52.420> in<00:02:52.870> front<00:02:53.200> and

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
since the 74 has a Dana 44 in front and

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.560 
since the 74 has a Dana 44 in front and
a<00:02:53.590> nine-inch<00:02:54.010> in<00:02:54.160> back<00:02:54.370> now<00:02:55.090> when<00:02:55.240> this<00:02:55.360> one

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
a nine-inch in back now when this one

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.980 
a nine-inch in back now when this one
came<00:02:55.600> in

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
came in

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.270 
came in
everything's<00:02:56.710> appeared<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.070> be<00:02:57.160> in<00:02:57.250> good

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
everything's appeared to be in good

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.920 
everything's appeared to be in good
shape<00:02:57.430> but<00:02:57.850> when<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.330> know<00:02:58.420> we<00:02:58.510> try<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:58.750> do<00:02:58.840> an

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
shape but when you know we try and do an

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.750 
shape but when you know we try and do an
inspection<00:02:59.020> on<00:02:59.410> everything<00:02:59.680> sure<00:03:00.430> enough

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
inspection on everything sure enough

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.610 
inspection on everything sure enough
there<00:03:00.940> was<00:03:01.060> somewhere<00:03:01.420> in<00:03:01.570> that<00:03:01.600> Dana<00:03:01.900> 44<00:03:02.200> we

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
there was somewhere in that Dana 44 we

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.290 
there was somewhere in that Dana 44 we
actually<00:03:02.890> had<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.070> replace<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.700> ring<00:03:04.180> and

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
actually had to replace the ring and

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.730 
actually had to replace the ring and
pinion<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:04.900> we<00:03:05.050> went<00:03:05.230> in<00:03:05.290> there<00:03:05.440> so<00:03:05.470> it's

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
pinion and so we went in there so it's

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.010 
pinion and so we went in there so it's
got<00:03:05.860> new<00:03:05.980> bearings<00:03:06.400> in<00:03:06.460> the<00:03:06.520> ring<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:06.730> pinion

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
got new bearings in the ring and pinion

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.630 
got new bearings in the ring and pinion
turnaround<00:03:08.020> same<00:03:08.350> thing<00:03:08.590> on<00:03:08.740> the<00:03:08.860> 9-inch<00:03:09.040> so

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
turnaround same thing on the 9-inch so

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.520 
turnaround same thing on the 9-inch so
it's<00:03:09.940> got<00:03:10.090> new<00:03:10.360> ring<00:03:10.570> and<00:03:10.630> pinion<00:03:10.900> both<00:03:11.140> front

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
it's got new ring and pinion both front

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.220 
it's got new ring and pinion both front
and<00:03:11.740> rear<00:03:12.180> driveshaft<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:13.840> little<00:03:14.050> bit<00:03:14.140> of

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
and rear driveshaft and a little bit of

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.470 
and rear driveshaft and a little bit of
a<00:03:14.320> wobble<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.830> it<00:03:14.880> so<00:03:15.880> we<00:03:15.970> went<00:03:16.090> ahead<00:03:16.210> and<00:03:16.330> put

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
a wobble to it so we went ahead and put

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.890 
a wobble to it so we went ahead and put
a<00:03:16.570> brand<00:03:16.900> new<00:03:17.080> one<00:03:17.260> in<00:03:17.410> from<00:03:17.620> Tom's<00:03:17.860> so

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
a brand new one in from Tom's so

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.410 
a brand new one in from Tom's so
transfer<00:03:19.900> case<00:03:20.080> just<00:03:20.350> serviced<00:03:20.710> that<00:03:20.920> one<00:03:21.100> so

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
transfer case just serviced that one so

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
transfer case just serviced that one so
drivetrain<00:03:22.420> wise<00:03:22.630> you're<00:03:22.870> looking<00:03:23.110> pretty

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
drivetrain wise you're looking pretty

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.370 
drivetrain wise you're looking pretty
darn<00:03:23.770> good<00:03:24.300> four<00:03:25.300> inch<00:03:25.450> lifts<00:03:25.780> on<00:03:25.930> this<00:03:26.170> one

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
darn good four inch lifts on this one

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.620 
darn good four inch lifts on this one
that's<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.680> suspension<00:03:27.190> lift<00:03:27.580> no<00:03:27.910> body<00:03:28.150> and

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
that's a suspension lift no body and

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.870 
that's a suspension lift no body and
when<00:03:29.350> they<00:03:29.470> did<00:03:29.680> that<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:30.160> big<00:03:30.370> deal<00:03:30.580> is<00:03:30.730> if

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
when they did that the big deal is if

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.250 
when they did that the big deal is if
you<00:03:31.000> do<00:03:31.120> a<00:03:31.150> four<00:03:31.420> inch<00:03:31.570> suspension<00:03:32.080> lift

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
you do a four inch suspension lift

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.540 
you do a four inch suspension lift
basically<00:03:32.740> anything<00:03:32.950> more<00:03:33.100> than<00:03:33.190> a<00:03:33.220> two<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:33.490> a

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
basically anything more than a two and a

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.520 
basically anything more than a two and a
half<00:03:33.700> you<00:03:33.880> have<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.330> relocate<00:03:34.690> those<00:03:35.110> radius

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
half you have to relocate those radius

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.699 
half you have to relocate those radius
arms<00:03:35.800> that<00:03:36.280> has<00:03:36.430> been<00:03:36.580> done<00:03:36.820> in<00:03:36.970> here<00:03:37.380> we<00:03:38.380> did

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
there as far as alignment so I think

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.729 
there as far as alignment so I think
really<00:04:06.580> makes<00:04:06.730> our<00:04:06.940> trucks<00:04:07.180> drive<00:04:07.390> nice<00:04:07.739> but
