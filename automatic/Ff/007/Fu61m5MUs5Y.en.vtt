now you'll have to see
here's<00:01:25.130> another<00:01:25.220> secret<00:01:25.700> about<00:01:25.910> recipes<00:01:26.620> even

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
here's another secret about recipes even

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.580 
here's another secret about recipes even
though<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:28.370> recipe<00:01:28.910> may<00:01:29.060> call<00:01:29.330> for<00:01:29.690> butter<00:01:30.110> for

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
though a recipe may call for butter for

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.820 
though a recipe may call for butter for
flour<00:01:30.830> for<00:01:31.310> sugar<00:01:31.580> for<00:01:31.970> buttermilk<00:01:32.210> whatever

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
flour for sugar for buttermilk whatever

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.990 
flour for sugar for buttermilk whatever
and<00:01:33.830> says<00:01:34.220> that<00:01:34.400> you<00:01:34.460> can<00:01:34.610> mix<00:01:34.760> it<00:01:34.910> all

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
and says that you can mix it all

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.120 
and says that you can mix it all
together<00:01:35.290> it's<00:01:36.290> better<00:01:36.500> to<00:01:36.710> put<00:01:36.890> them<00:01:37.010> in

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
together it's better to put them in

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.400 
together it's better to put them in
steps<00:01:37.460> with<00:01:38.000> them<00:01:38.120> in<00:01:38.240> one<00:01:38.420> at<00:01:38.450> a<00:01:38.570> time<00:01:38.840> mix

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
steps with them in one at a time mix

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.280 
steps with them in one at a time mix
well<00:01:39.650> add<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.310> next<00:01:40.580> thing<00:01:40.750> if<00:01:41.750> you<00:01:41.930> ever<00:01:41.960> have

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
well add the next thing if you ever have

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.800 
well add the next thing if you ever have
to<00:01:42.440> do<00:01:42.560> a<00:01:42.590> butter<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:43.340> flat<00:01:44.060> side<00:01:44.390> a<00:01:44.570> flour

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
to do a butter a flat side a flour

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.200 
to do a butter a flat side a flour
mixture<00:01:45.290> and<00:01:45.620> a<00:01:46.100> milk<00:01:46.340> mixture<00:01:46.700> or<00:01:46.940> a<00:01:47.000> liquid

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
mixture and a milk mixture or a liquid

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.180 
mixture and a milk mixture or a liquid
mixture<00:01:47.690> it's<00:01:48.260> better<00:01:48.470> if<00:01:48.620> you<00:01:48.680> alternate

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
mixture it's better if you alternate

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.340 
mixture it's better if you alternate
them<00:01:49.370> using<00:01:50.120> some<00:01:50.330> flour<00:01:50.540> first<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.140> then

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
them using some flour first and then

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.420 
them using some flour first and then
some<00:01:51.590> leeway

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.450 

it<00:01:56.430> makes<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.909> more<00:01:57.300> even<00:01:57.540> more<00:01:58.470> homogenous<00:01:59.250> if

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
it makes it more even more homogenous if

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.750 
it makes it more even more homogenous if
I<00:01:59.580> wanted<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.880> do<00:01:59.940> scientific<00:02:01.280> it<00:02:02.280> looks<00:02:02.520> kind

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
I wanted to do scientific it looks kind

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.380 
I wanted to do scientific it looks kind
of<00:02:02.820> weird<00:02:02.880> when<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.450> happening<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:06.210> by

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
of weird when it's happening so by

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.840 
of weird when it's happening so by
alternating<00:02:06.900> them<00:02:07.200> they<00:02:08.130> taste<00:02:08.369> better<00:02:08.550> Leon

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
alternating them they taste better Leon

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.110 
alternating them they taste better Leon
you<00:02:09.149> really<00:02:09.479> can<00:02:09.630> taste<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.929> difference<00:02:11.120> this

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120

oven but you always want to be careful
to<00:04:34.520> make<00:04:34.639> sure<00:04:34.669> that<00:04:34.970> the<00:04:35.090> cakes<00:04:35.300> are<00:04:35.449> centered

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
to make sure that the cakes are centered

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.270 
to make sure that the cakes are centered
in<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.110> middle<00:04:36.349> of<00:04:36.440> the<00:04:36.500> oven<00:04:36.680> as<00:04:36.919> you<00:04:37.009> can

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
in the middle of the oven as you can

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.610 
in the middle of the oven as you can
however<00:04:38.180> because<00:04:38.569> this<00:04:38.720> evan<00:04:39.020> is<00:04:39.110> so<00:04:39.289> small

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
however because this evan is so small

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.920 
however because this evan is so small
I'm<00:04:39.860> going<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:40.460> have<00:04:40.669> to<00:04:40.699> put<00:04:41.120> some<00:04:41.720> on<00:04:41.840> the

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
I'm going to have to put some on the

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.960 
I'm going to have to put some on the
bottom<00:04:42.289> some<00:04:42.740> on<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:42.979> top<00:04:43.190> and<00:04:43.430> then<00:04:43.639> broke

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
bottom some on the top and then broke

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.730 
bottom some on the top and then broke
take<00:04:44.270> them<00:04:44.479> when<00:04:44.930> they're<00:04:45.110> half<00:04:45.289> done<00:04:45.530> baking

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
take them when they're half done baking

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.439 
take them when they're half done baking
so<00:04:46.069> they<00:04:46.190> don't<00:04:46.340> get<00:04:46.430> to<00:04:46.669> bend<00:04:46.910> on<00:04:47.060> the<00:04:47.150> bottom

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
so they don't get to bend on the bottom

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.330 
so they don't get to bend on the bottom
or<00:04:47.569> two<00:04:47.720> right<00:04:47.870> on<00:04:48.080> the<00:04:48.169> top<00:04:48.349> so<00:04:48.860> cook<00:04:49.069> all<00:04:49.220> the

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
or two right on the top so cook all the

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:56.140 
or two right on the top so cook all the
way<00:04:49.370> through<00:04:51.849> so<00:04:52.849> in<00:04:53.150> 10<00:04:53.509> minutes<00:04:53.750> I<00:04:55.030> have<00:04:56.030> to

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
way through so in 10 minutes I have to

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.749 
way through so in 10 minutes I have to
turn<00:04:56.360> them<00:04:56.680> as<00:04:57.680> soon<00:04:57.949> as<00:04:58.009> I<00:04:58.160> got<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.400> cakes<00:04:58.610> in

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759
