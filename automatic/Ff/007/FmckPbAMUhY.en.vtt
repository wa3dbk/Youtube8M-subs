00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
okay Hayes has requested a dice stacking

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.000 
okay Hayes has requested a dice stacking
tutorial<00:00:07.080> so<00:00:07.799> I<00:00:08.040> figured<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:08.910> make<00:00:09.510> one<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:10.019> put

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
tutorial so I figured I make one and put

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.400 
tutorial so I figured I make one and put
it<00:00:11.040> up<00:00:11.219> for<00:00:11.490> him<00:00:11.550> so<00:00:12.150> here's<00:00:12.480> basically<00:00:12.990> what

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
it up for him so here's basically what

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.860 
it up for him so here's basically what
it'll<00:00:14.250> look<00:00:14.370> like<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:15.030> what<00:00:15.269> you'll<00:00:15.599> be<00:00:15.660> able

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
it'll look like and what you'll be able

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:26.029 
it'll look like and what you'll be able
to<00:00:16.080> do<00:00:16.199> after<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.590> few<00:00:16.949> hours<00:00:17.029> practicing<00:00:25.039> their

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
to do after a few hours practicing their

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.420 
to do after a few hours practicing their
this<00:00:26.220> all<00:00:26.849> for<00:00:29.599> now<00:00:30.800> I'm<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.340> show

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
this all for now I'm just going to show

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.830 
this all for now I'm just going to show
the<00:00:32.669> basics<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.780> basic<00:00:34.670> stacking<00:00:35.670> up<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.660> can

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
the basics the basic stacking up you can

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.049 
the basics the basic stacking up you can
learn<00:00:36.989> down<00:00:37.290> stacking<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.399> bunch<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.879> other

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
learn down stacking and a bunch of other

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.530 
learn down stacking and a bunch of other
tricks<00:00:39.329> afterwards<00:00:40.550> okay<00:00:41.550> when<00:00:42.420> you're

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
tricks afterwards okay when you're

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.459 
tricks afterwards okay when you're
starting<00:00:43.280> you<00:00:44.280> want<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:45.020> have<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.770> cup<00:00:47.120> with

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
starting you want to have the cup with

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.350 
starting you want to have the cup with
two<00:00:49.469> fingers<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:50.160> your<00:00:50.640> thumb<00:00:50.879> here<00:00:51.180> and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
two fingers here your thumb here and

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.580 
two fingers here your thumb here and
your<00:00:51.660> pointer<00:00:51.989> finger<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:52.530> top<00:00:53.449> then<00:00:54.590> you're

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
your pointer finger on top then you're

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.389 
your pointer finger on top then you're
going<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:56.000> scoop<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.239> scoop<00:00:57.480> up<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.289> dice<00:00:58.710> like

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
going to scoop it scoop up the dice like

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.430 
going to scoop it scoop up the dice like
this<00:00:59.730> you're<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.449> going<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.870> slide<00:01:01.199> across

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
this you're just going to slide across

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.109 
this you're just going to slide across
the<00:01:01.770> table<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:03.619> it'll<00:01:04.619> actually<00:01:04.970> when<00:01:05.970> you're

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
the table so it'll actually when you're

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.410 
the table so it'll actually when you're
sliding<00:01:06.299> across<00:01:06.659> pop<00:01:07.260> up<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.280> it'll<00:01:09.180> go

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
sliding across pop up in and it'll go

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.039 
sliding across pop up in and it'll go
straight<00:01:09.810> back<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.689> each<00:01:12.689> time

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
straight back like that and each time

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.590 
straight back like that and each time
that<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.409> pick<00:01:13.619> one<00:01:13.860> up<00:01:14.040> it'll<00:01:15.030> fall<00:01:15.270> straight

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
that you pick one up it'll fall straight

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.510 
that you pick one up it'll fall straight
back<00:01:15.930> onto<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.799> other<00:01:16.830> one<00:01:18.200> but<00:01:19.200> when<00:01:20.189> dice

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
back onto the other one but when dice

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.789 
back onto the other one but when dice
are<00:01:20.790> actually<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.450> there<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:22.290> want<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.590> tilt

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
are actually in there you want to tilt

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.300 
are actually in there you want to tilt
the<00:01:22.920> top<00:01:23.220> four<00:01:23.610> words<00:01:23.850> sung<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.710> go<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:26.009> kind

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the top four words sung and go in kind

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.700 
the top four words sung and go in kind
of<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.689> windshield<00:01:27.689> wiper<00:01:28.970> direction<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.710> it'd

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
of a windshield wiper direction and it'd

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.550 
of a windshield wiper direction and it'd
be<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.909> way<00:01:33.119> at<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.360> dice<00:01:33.570> they

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
be like that that way at the dice they

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.010 
be like that that way at the dice they
can<00:01:34.770> actually<00:01:34.979> put<00:01:35.520> themselves<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.840> right

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
can actually put themselves in the right

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.069 
can actually put themselves in the right
order<00:01:37.290> if<00:01:38.040> they're<00:01:38.640> not<00:01:38.670> or<00:01:39.210> that'll<00:01:39.900> keep

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
order if they're not or that'll keep

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.569 
order if they're not or that'll keep
them<00:01:40.259> there<00:01:40.470> until<00:01:40.500> you're<00:01:40.920> ready<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.159> pick<00:01:41.400> up

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
them there until you're ready to pick up

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.050 
them there until you're ready to pick up
the<00:01:41.700> next<00:01:41.939> one<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:43.439> when<00:01:44.070> you're<00:01:44.220> starting<00:01:44.520> I'd

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
the next one so when you're starting I'd

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.630 
the next one so when you're starting I'd
suggest<00:01:45.810> starting<00:01:46.200> with<00:01:46.290> till<00:01:46.710> then<00:01:47.430> move

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
suggest starting with till then move

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.569 
suggest starting with till then move
into<00:01:47.880> three<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.420> four<00:01:48.720> for<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.829> basically

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
into three and four for is basically

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.300 
into three and four for is basically
what<00:01:50.729> most<00:01:50.970> people<00:01:51.420> use<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.990> they<00:01:52.740> use<00:01:52.950> more

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
what most people use and they use more

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.959 
what most people use and they use more
for<00:01:53.579> different<00:01:54.390> tricks<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.960> on<00:01:55.259> one<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.560> this

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
for different tricks and on one of this

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.030 
for different tricks and on one of this
but<00:01:56.969> when<00:01:57.240> you're<00:01:57.390> first<00:01:57.570> starting<00:01:57.750> out<00:01:58.200> I'd

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
but when you're first starting out I'd

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.959 
but when you're first starting out I'd
recommend<00:01:59.490> picking<00:02:00.149> one<00:02:00.869> up<00:02:01.549> hold<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.670> for<00:02:02.909> a

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
recommend picking one up hold it for a

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.749 
recommend picking one up hold it for a
minute<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.570> then<00:02:03.710> go<00:02:04.710> down<00:02:04.890> back<00:02:05.219> up<00:02:05.399> another

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
minute and then go down back up another

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.809 
minute and then go down back up another
and<00:02:06.740> just<00:02:07.740> take<00:02:08.009> it

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
and just take it

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.830 
and just take it
and<00:02:09.890> when<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.009> take<00:02:11.249> it<00:02:11.400> slowly<00:02:11.730> it'll<00:02:12.599> be

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
and when you take it slowly it'll be

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.619 
and when you take it slowly it'll be
much<00:02:13.139> easier<00:02:13.170> for<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.599> okay<00:02:15.599> now<00:02:17.060> when<00:02:18.060> you're

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
much easier for you okay now when you're

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.530 
much easier for you okay now when you're
going<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.200> actually<00:02:19.409> put<00:02:20.249> them<00:02:20.459> down<00:02:21.030> so

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
going to actually put them down so

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.379 
going to actually put them down so
they'll<00:02:21.780> stay<00:02:22.109> stacked<00:02:22.499> on<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:23.069> table<00:02:23.489> you're

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:24.389 
they'll stay stacked on the table you're

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:27.890 
they'll stay stacked on the table you're
going<00:02:24.629> to<00:02:24.840> want<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:25.139> put<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.310> front<00:02:26.730> side<00:02:27.599> on

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
going to want to put the front side on

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.379 
going to want to put the front side on
say<00:02:28.409> you're<00:02:28.560> still<00:02:28.829> tilting<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.370> forward<00:02:29.879> but

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:30.389 
say you're still tilting it forward but

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:32.080 
say you're still tilting it forward but
the<00:02:30.510> front<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:30.870> going<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.139> be<00:02:31.260> on<00:02:31.469> the<00:02:31.620> table

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
the front is going to be on the table

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.470 
the front is going to be on the table
slide<00:02:33.090> back<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.450> forth<00:02:33.719> and<00:02:35.209> gently<00:02:36.209> move

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
slide back and forth and gently move

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.149 
slide back and forth and gently move
down<00:02:36.810> until<00:02:37.590> it's<00:02:37.739> flat<00:02:38.069> and<00:02:38.099> stop<00:02:38.819> fast<00:02:40.159> pick

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
down until it's flat and stop fast pick
