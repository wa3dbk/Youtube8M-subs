00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.289 

okay<00:00:03.240> so<00:00:03.300> what<00:00:03.600> I'm<00:00:03.720> trying<00:00:03.990> to<00:00:04.020> figure<00:00:04.230> out<00:00:04.380> is

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:05.299 
okay so what I'm trying to figure out is

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.379 
okay so what I'm trying to figure out is
once<00:00:06.299> I<00:00:06.420> start<00:00:06.750> this<00:00:06.960> engine<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:08.130> it<00:00:08.940> warms<00:00:09.150> up

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
once I start this engine and it warms up

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.410 
once I start this engine and it warms up
a<00:00:09.540> little<00:00:09.750> bit<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.080> throttle<00:00:10.500> plate<00:00:11.240> on<00:00:12.240> the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
a little bit the throttle plate on the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.289 
a little bit the throttle plate on the
carburetor<00:00:12.929> there<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.500> ends<00:00:14.460> up<00:00:14.549> pinned<00:00:14.940> wide

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
carburetor there it ends up pinned wide

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.200 
carburetor there it ends up pinned wide
open<00:00:16.820> and<00:00:17.820> completely<00:00:18.390> open<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:20.180> I<00:00:21.180> don't

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
open and completely open and I don't

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.170 
open and completely open and I don't
know<00:00:21.570> if<00:00:21.960> that's<00:00:22.680> supposed<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.160> be<00:00:23.250> like<00:00:23.670> that

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
know if that's supposed to be like that

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.460 
know if that's supposed to be like that
or<00:00:24.449> if<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.380> should<00:00:25.529> be<00:00:25.680> partially<00:00:26.189> closed<00:00:27.470> when

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
or if it should be partially closed when

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.769 
or if it should be partially closed when
I<00:00:28.500> start<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.369> once<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.880> starts<00:00:30.150> running<00:00:30.359> rough

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
I start it once it starts running rough

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.799 
I start it once it starts running rough
with<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.320> wide<00:00:32.040> open<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.610> if<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.600> take

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
with it wide open like that if I take

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.220 
with it wide open like that if I take
the<00:00:33.930> screwdriver<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:35.690> manually<00:00:36.690> close<00:00:36.989> this

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
the screwdriver and manually close this

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.190 
the screwdriver and manually close this
throttle<00:00:37.559> plate<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.129> little<00:00:38.520> bit<00:00:38.899> the<00:00:39.899> engine

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
throttle plate a little bit the engine

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.069 
throttle plate a little bit the engine
starts<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.649> run<00:00:40.800> perfectly<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.809> on<00:00:43.050> a

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
starts to run perfectly and this is on a

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.060 
starts to run perfectly and this is on a
pressure<00:00:43.350> washer<00:00:44.059> and<00:00:45.059> when<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.079> do<00:00:46.200> close<00:00:46.710> that

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
pressure washer and when I do close that

pressure washer and when I do close that
which<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.610> can't<00:00:47.850> I'm<00:00:48.120> not<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.600> be<00:00:48.660> able

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
which I can't I'm not going to be able

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.450 
which I can't I'm not going to be able
to<00:00:48.840> hold<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.110> camera<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.620> manipulate<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
to hold the camera and manipulate the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.810 
to hold the camera and manipulate the
throttle<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:52.039> pull<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.190> handle<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.699> the

throttle and pull the handle on the
pressure<00:00:54.059> washer<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.840> show<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:56.430> runs

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
pressure washer to show you that it runs

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.020 
pressure washer to show you that it runs
great<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.829> it<00:00:58.829> runs<00:00:59.100> exactly<00:00:59.309> like<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> way

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
great but it runs exactly like the way

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.260 
great but it runs exactly like the way
it<00:01:00.180> should<00:01:00.559> when<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.680> was<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.489> runs<00:01:02.730> like<00:01:02.879> it

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
it should when it was it runs like it

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.479 
it should when it was it runs like it
did<00:01:03.420> when<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.600> was<00:01:03.719> brand-new<00:01:03.830> when<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.860> closed

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
did when it was brand-new when I closed

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.149 
did when it was brand-new when I closed
this<00:01:05.729> throttle<00:01:06.060> plate<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> little<00:01:06.750> bit<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.799> I'm

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
this throttle plate a little bit so I'm

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.260 
this throttle plate a little bit so I'm
going<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.610> start<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.360> up<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.659> see<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.229> can

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
going to start it up and see if I can

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.149 
going to start it up and see if I can
demonstrate<00:01:12.270> for<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.470> difference<00:01:13.860> in

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
demonstrate for you the difference in

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.460 
demonstrate for you the difference in
the<00:01:14.250> way<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.850> runs<00:01:15.119> when<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:15.600> pinned

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
the way that it runs when it's pinned

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.219 
the way that it runs when it's pinned
wide<00:01:16.680> open<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.280> it's<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.330> thermostat<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
wide open and it's the thermostat on the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.820 
wide open and it's the thermostat on the
other<00:01:20.159> side<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:21.119> when<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.390> heats<00:01:21.600> up<00:01:21.900> it's

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
other side that when it heats up it's

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.920 
other side that when it heats up it's
rotating<00:01:23.490> forward<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.299> opening<00:01:24.750> this

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
rotating forward and it's opening this

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.719 
rotating forward and it's opening this
throttle<00:01:25.320> completely<00:01:27.890> but<00:01:28.890> when<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> close<00:01:29.670> it

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
throttle completely but when I close it

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.660 
throttle completely but when I close it
up<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.420> little<00:01:30.450> bit<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:32.040> engine<00:01:32.369> begins

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
up just a little bit the engine begins

00:01:32.670 --> 00:02:02.929 
up just a little bit the engine begins
to<00:01:33.000> run<00:01:33.180> exactly<00:01:33.689> like<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.020> should

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:49.959 

right

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:49.969 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:54.020 

so<00:02:50.969> the<00:02:51.120> question<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.780> is<00:02:52.310> that<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.849> Rotter

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
so the question is is that the Rotter

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.179 
so the question is is that the Rotter
plates<00:02:54.390> supposed<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.200> be<00:02:55.319> pinned<00:02:55.620> wide<00:02:55.859> open

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
plates supposed to be pinned wide open

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.630 
plates supposed to be pinned wide open
this<00:02:56.340> time<00:02:57.560> right<00:02:58.560> when<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.739> started<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.430> it

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
this time right when I started it it

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.270 
this time right when I started it it
completely<00:02:59.909> opened<00:03:00.870> wide<00:03:01.260> open<00:03:01.650> for<00:03:02.040> some

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
completely opened wide open for some

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.759 
completely opened wide open for some
reason<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:02.849> I'm<00:03:03.719> assuming<00:03:03.989> that<00:03:04.230> it's<00:03:04.590> only

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
reason and I'm assuming that it's only

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.959 
reason and I'm assuming that it's only
supposed<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.489> begin<00:03:05.819> to<00:03:06.090> open<00:03:06.299> gradually<00:03:07.290> as

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:07.969 
supposed to begin to open gradually as

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:11.059 
supposed to begin to open gradually as
that<00:03:08.969> thermostat<00:03:09.450> heats<00:03:09.930> up<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.439> gradually

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
that thermostat heats up and gradually

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.339 
that thermostat heats up and gradually
opens<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:11.639> but<00:03:11.819> this<00:03:12.239> engines<00:03:12.659> been<00:03:12.930> sitting

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
opens it but this engines been sitting

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.259 
opens it but this engines been sitting
for<00:03:13.379> about<00:03:13.799> two<00:03:14.069> hours<00:03:14.099> since<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.909> last<00:03:15.090> time

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
for about two hours since the last time

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.720 
for about two hours since the last time
I<00:03:15.299> started<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.250> this<00:03:17.250> time<00:03:17.310> when<00:03:17.700> I

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
I started it and this time when I

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.759 
I started it and this time when I
started<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.359> it<00:03:18.540> instantly<00:03:19.170> opened<00:03:19.680> that

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
started it it instantly opened that

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.119 
started it it instantly opened that
throttle<00:03:20.220> plate<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:20.939> wide<00:03:21.450> open<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.230> you

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
throttle plate to wide open and you

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.190 
throttle plate to wide open and you
could<00:03:23.280> tell<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.639> difference<00:03:23.790> between<00:03:24.269> when

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
could tell the difference between when

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.750 
could tell the difference between when
it<00:03:25.290> was<00:03:25.439> wide<00:03:25.680> open<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:26.310> it<00:03:26.400> was<00:03:26.489> running

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
it was wide open and it was running

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.610 
it was wide open and it was running
choppy<00:03:27.150> if<00:03:28.109> I<00:03:28.319> was<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.680> try<00:03:28.889> to<00:03:29.269> I<00:03:30.590> was<00:03:31.590> trying

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
choppy if I was to try to I was trying

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.729 
choppy if I was to try to I was trying
to<00:03:31.859> use<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.340> power<00:03:32.459> washer<00:03:33.049> it<00:03:34.049> would<00:03:34.530> just

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
to use the power washer it would just

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.039 
to use the power washer it would just
stall<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.819> engine<00:03:35.939> would<00:03:36.329> not<00:03:36.359> continue<00:03:36.870> to

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
stall the engine would not continue to

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.059 
stall the engine would not continue to
run<00:03:37.469> when<00:03:38.159> place<00:03:38.400> under<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:38.879> load<00:03:39.230> so<00:03:40.230> if<00:03:40.709> I

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
run when place under that load so if I

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.619 
run when place under that load so if I
manually<00:03:41.969> closed<00:03:42.419> that<00:03:42.719> throttle<00:03:43.049> plate<00:03:43.409> and

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
manually closed that throttle plate and

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.349 
manually closed that throttle plate and
I<00:03:45.629> do<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:47.040> pull<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.609> handle<00:03:47.969> on<00:03:48.180> the

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
I do that and I pull the handle on the

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.379 
I do that and I pull the handle on the
power<00:03:48.689> washer<00:03:48.959> it<00:03:49.859> runs<00:03:50.219> exactly<00:03:50.579> as<00:03:51.150> it's

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
power washer it runs exactly as it's

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.619 
power washer it runs exactly as it's
supposed<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.900> so<00:03:52.760> either<00:03:53.760> it's<00:03:54.120> not<00:03:54.209> getting

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
supposed to so either it's not getting

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.140 
supposed to so either it's not getting
enough<00:03:54.900> fuel<00:03:55.250> for<00:03:56.250> that<00:03:56.370> throttle<00:03:56.669> plate<00:03:56.970> to

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
enough fuel for that throttle plate to

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.990 
enough fuel for that throttle plate to
be<00:03:57.299> wide<00:03:57.479> open<00:03:57.840> like<00:03:57.959> that<00:03:58.019> or<00:03:58.790> for<00:03:59.790> some

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
be wide open like that or for some

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.610 
be wide open like that or for some
reason<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:03.209> throttle<00:04:03.569> plate<00:04:03.659> is<00:04:03.930> wide<00:04:04.590> open

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
reason the throttle plate is wide open

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.770 
reason the throttle plate is wide open
and<00:04:05.069> shouldn't<00:04:05.430> be<00:04:05.549> but<00:04:05.819> I<00:04:05.879> don't<00:04:06.000> know<00:04:06.299> I<00:04:06.659> took

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
and shouldn't be but I don't know I took

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.539 
and shouldn't be but I don't know I took
the<00:04:07.109> whole<00:04:07.229> thing<00:04:07.290> apart<00:04:07.530> I<00:04:08.069> took<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.430> whole

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
the whole thing apart I took the whole

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:13.460 
the whole thing apart I took the whole
damn<00:04:08.790> thing<00:04:09.060> apart<00:04:09.949> took<00:04:10.949> the<00:04:11.209> the<00:04:12.229> all<00:04:13.229> the

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
damn thing apart took the the all the

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.710 
damn thing apart took the the all the
covers<00:04:13.859> off<00:04:14.069> I<00:04:14.400> took<00:04:14.609> the<00:04:14.760> metal<00:04:15.000> cover<00:04:15.389> off

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
covers off I took the metal cover off

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.560 
covers off I took the metal cover off
the<00:04:15.930> engine<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.949> got<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.519> that<00:04:17.699> throttle

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
the engine and got to that throttle

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.999 
the engine and got to that throttle
plate<00:04:18.780> on<00:04:18.959> that<00:04:18.989> other<00:04:19.289> side<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.889> there<00:04:19.979> was

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:20.009 
plate on that other side and there was

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:21.800 
plate on that other side and there was
nothing<00:04:20.519> on<00:04:20.669> it<00:04:20.729> there's<00:04:21.060> no<00:04:21.209> dirt<00:04:21.539> or

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
nothing on it there's no dirt or

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.390 
nothing on it there's no dirt or
anything<00:04:22.079> on<00:04:22.409> it<00:04:22.560> there's<00:04:22.800> nothing<00:04:23.190> on<00:04:23.370> it

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
anything on it there's nothing on it

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.230 
anything on it there's nothing on it
that<00:04:24.289> would<00:04:25.289> keep<00:04:25.560> it<00:04:25.770> pinned<00:04:26.460> wide<00:04:26.759> open<00:04:27.120> like

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
that would keep it pinned wide open like

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.749 
that would keep it pinned wide open like
that<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.659> as<00:04:27.840> you<00:04:27.870> can<00:04:28.139> see<00:04:28.199> engines<00:04:29.130> off

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 
that and as you can see engines off

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:34.520 
that and as you can see engines off
the<00:04:30.270> thing<00:04:30.479> is<00:04:30.630> still<00:04:30.990> I<00:04:32.090> mean<00:04:33.090> it's<00:04:33.270> just

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
the thing is still I mean it's just

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.310 
the thing is still I mean it's just
and<00:04:35.100> wide<00:04:35.430> open<00:04:35.460> so<00:04:36.030> it<00:04:36.390> just<00:04:36.870> doesn't<00:04:37.140> seem

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
and wide open so it just doesn't seem

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.360 
and wide open so it just doesn't seem
like<00:04:37.410> it<00:04:37.620> should<00:04:37.650> be<00:04:37.920> like<00:04:38.100> that

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
like it should be like that

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.930 
like it should be like that
so<00:04:39.920> any<00:04:40.920> advice<00:04:41.190> would<00:04:41.670> be<00:04:41.730> helpful<00:04:42.060> thank<00:04:42.780> you
