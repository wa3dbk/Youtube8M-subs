00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
to change how it looks and protect at

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.630 
to change how it looks and protect at
the<00:01:16.500> same<00:01:16.650> time<00:01:16.799> you're<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.310> get<00:01:17.400> one<00:01:17.549> of

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
the same time you're going to get one of

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.289 
the same time you're going to get one of
these<00:01:18.049> rubberized<00:01:19.049> plastic<00:01:19.170> cases<00:01:20.040> now<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
these rubberized plastic cases now the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.140 
these rubberized plastic cases now the
finish<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.750> these<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.280> on<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> matte

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
finish on these is on like a matte

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.140 
finish on these is on like a matte
finish<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:26.549> reason<00:01:26.759> why<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:26.970> call

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
finish and the reason why we call

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.460 
finish and the reason why we call
rubberized<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.689> because<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.930> back<00:01:28.080> does<00:01:28.290> for

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
rubberized is because the back does for

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.600 
rubberized is because the back does for
like<00:01:28.590> rubber<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.130> actually<00:01:29.579> a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
like rubber but it's actually a

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.330 
like rubber but it's actually a
constructor<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.689> plastic<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.320> then<00:01:32.100> come<00:01:32.250> in

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
constructor of plastic and then come in

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.300 
constructor of plastic and then come in
two<00:01:32.460> pieces<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.390> back<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.259> front<00:01:34.310> you

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
two pieces the back and the front you

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.810 
two pieces the back and the front you
have<00:01:35.460> all<00:01:35.670> your<00:01:35.850> cutouts<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.509> one's<00:01:36.720> for<00:01:37.110> the

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
have all your cutouts this one's for the

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.679 
have all your cutouts this one's for the
trackpad<00:01:39.829> you<00:01:40.829> have<00:01:41.009> your<00:01:41.340> cameras<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
trackpad you have your cameras in the

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.020 
trackpad you have your cameras in the
back<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.409> dilly<00:01:43.710> d<00:01:43.860> flash<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.939> I

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
back with the dilly d flash and I

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.230 
back with the dilly d flash and I
believe<00:01:45.270> that's<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.570> speakerphone<00:01:45.990> and

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
believe that's the speakerphone and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.240 
believe that's the speakerphone and
that's<00:01:48.240> pretty<00:01:48.390> much<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:49.409> USB<00:01:49.770> ports<00:01:50.100> not

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
that's pretty much it the USB ports not

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.069 
that's pretty much it the USB ports not
going<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.430> be<00:01:50.520> blocked<00:01:50.759> on<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.600> side<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.020> you

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
going to be blocked on the side so you

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.660 
going to be blocked on the side so you
don't<00:01:52.380> have<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.530> worry<00:01:52.649> about<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
don't have to worry about that and the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.910 
don't have to worry about that and the
way<00:01:53.790> these<00:01:53.970> cases<00:01:54.390> work<00:01:54.630> for<00:01:55.259> slider<00:01:55.590> phones

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
way these cases work for slider phones

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.120 
way these cases work for slider phones
is<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.360> latches<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.799> sides<00:01:58.979> of

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
is that it latches on to the sides of

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.410 
is that it latches on to the sides of
the<00:01:59.219> phone<00:01:59.430> not<00:01:59.790> sure<00:01:59.969> if<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:00.180> see<00:02:00.299> that

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
the phone not sure if you can see that
