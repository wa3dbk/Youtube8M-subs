00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.470 

you

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:05.480 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.880 

I<00:00:05.509> think<00:00:06.080> the<00:00:06.140> outer<00:00:06.259> training<00:00:06.649> is<00:00:06.710> really

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:06.890 
I think the outer training is really

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.470 
I think the outer training is really
important<00:00:07.250> you<00:00:07.279> look<00:00:07.609> at<00:00:07.759> any<00:00:08.059> of<00:00:08.210> the<00:00:08.299> top

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
important you look at any of the top

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.879 
important you look at any of the top
distance<00:00:09.049> earners<00:00:09.320> in<00:00:09.380> the<00:00:09.469> world<00:00:09.650> they're

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
distance earners in the world they're

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:10.990 
distance earners in the world they're
all<00:00:09.980> doing<00:00:10.190> it<00:00:10.400> I<00:00:10.490> mean<00:00:10.610> there's<00:00:10.820> no

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
all doing it I mean there's no

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.689 
all doing it I mean there's no
exceptions<00:00:11.750> to<00:00:11.900> that<00:00:12.080> I<00:00:12.110> think<00:00:12.490> so<00:00:13.490> you<00:00:13.549> know

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:13.699 
exceptions to that I think so you know

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:14.799 
exceptions to that I think so you know
it's<00:00:13.850> always<00:00:14.059> really<00:00:14.209> important<00:00:14.570> for<00:00:14.629> us<00:00:14.750> to

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
it's always really important for us to

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.500 
it's always really important for us to
come<00:00:14.959> up<00:00:15.109> here<00:00:15.350> and<00:00:15.650> it<00:00:16.460> sucks<00:00:16.820> at<00:00:17.000> first<00:00:17.270> you

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
come up here and it sucks at first you

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.609 
come up here and it sucks at first you
know<00:00:17.630> just<00:00:17.840> because<00:00:17.960> it's<00:00:18.170> get<00:00:18.320> your<00:00:18.350> body

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
know just because it's get your body

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.200 
know just because it's get your body
getting<00:00:18.830> used<00:00:19.070> to<00:00:19.160> it<00:00:19.340> and<00:00:19.609> obviously<00:00:19.850> it's<00:00:20.180> a

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
getting used to it and obviously it's a

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.329 
getting used to it and obviously it's a
lot<00:00:20.359> harder<00:00:20.539> running<00:00:20.990> up<00:00:21.140> here<00:00:21.350> but<00:00:21.650> you<00:00:22.249> know

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:22.339 
lot harder running up here but you know

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.519 
lot harder running up here but you know
we<00:00:22.460> adjust<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:22.789> times<00:00:23.089> accordingly<00:00:23.630> and<00:00:23.960> work

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
we adjust the times accordingly and work

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.349 
we adjust the times accordingly and work
our<00:00:24.679> way<00:00:24.710> into<00:00:25.130> it<00:00:25.279> and<00:00:25.490> then<00:00:25.640> we<00:00:25.880> go<00:00:25.999> back<00:00:26.179> down

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
our way into it and then we go back down

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.609 
our way into it and then we go back down
the<00:00:26.449> sea<00:00:26.630> level<00:00:26.929> usually<00:00:27.169> it<00:00:27.230> feels<00:00:27.439> pretty

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
the sea level usually it feels pretty

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:28.540 
the sea level usually it feels pretty
good<00:00:27.800> because<00:00:27.980> we've<00:00:28.099> got<00:00:28.249> all<00:00:28.339> that<00:00:28.429> extra

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
good because we've got all that extra

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.300 
good because we've got all that extra
oxygen<00:00:28.880> here<00:00:29.740> we've<00:00:30.740> been<00:00:30.769> here<00:00:31.039> since<00:00:31.189> the

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
oxygen here we've been here since the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.790 
oxygen here we've been here since the
beginning<00:00:31.429> of<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:31.909> month<00:00:32.119> and<00:00:32.509> a<00:00:32.900> period<00:00:33.590> I

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
beginning of the month and a period I

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.220 
beginning of the month and a period I
think<00:00:33.980> is<00:00:34.040> around<00:00:34.250> 7,000<00:00:35.000> feet<00:00:35.150> yeah<00:00:35.870> it<00:00:36.020> just

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
think is around 7,000 feet yeah it just

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.260 
think is around 7,000 feet yeah it just
whips<00:00:36.860> our<00:00:37.040> butt<00:00:37.220> into<00:00:37.430> shape<00:00:37.640> quick<00:00:37.910> run<00:00:38.149> it

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
whips our butt into shape quick run it

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.819 
whips our butt into shape quick run it
out<00:00:38.359> sit<00:00:38.539> up<00:00:38.719> here<00:00:38.930> it's<00:00:39.289> pretty<00:00:39.440> tough<00:00:39.649> for

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
out sit up here it's pretty tough for

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.260 
out sit up here it's pretty tough for
the<00:00:39.890> first<00:00:40.070> couple<00:00:40.340> weeks<00:00:40.370> but<00:00:40.789> I<00:00:40.820> think

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
the first couple weeks but I think

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.880 
the first couple weeks but I think
everybody's<00:00:41.690> starting<00:00:41.930> to<00:00:42.079> adapt<00:00:42.379> now<00:00:42.620> and

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
everybody's starting to adapt now and

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:43.959 
everybody's starting to adapt now and
we're<00:00:43.250> getting<00:00:43.309> some<00:00:43.519> really<00:00:43.670> good<00:00:43.760> training

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
we're getting some really good training

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.779 
we're getting some really good training

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
at the end and just kind of simulating a

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.460 
at the end and just kind of simulating a
race<00:01:13.340> effort<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.090> no<00:01:14.540> week<00:01:14.750> out<00:01:14.930> is<00:01:15.079> about<00:01:15.320> is

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
race effort and no week out is about is

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.230 
race effort and no week out is about is
you<00:01:16.009> know<00:01:16.070> it's<00:01:16.310> close<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.520> races<00:01:16.939> you<00:01:17.000> can<00:01:17.060> do

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
you know it's close to races you can do

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.120 
you know it's close to races you can do
it<00:01:17.329> really<00:01:17.450> something<00:01:17.990> really<00:01:18.200> hard<00:01:18.409> so<00:01:18.740> it

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
it really something really hard so it

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.530 
it really something really hard so it
was<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.310> last<00:01:19.490> big<00:01:19.700> effort<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:20.240> now<00:01:20.390> we're

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
was the last big effort and now we're

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.149 
was the last big effort and now we're
just<00:01:20.600> going<00:01:20.750> to<00:01:20.810> rest<00:01:21.049> up<00:01:21.259> and<00:01:21.500> feel<00:01:22.009> good

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
just going to rest up and feel good

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.010 
just going to rest up and feel good
hopefully<00:01:22.399> in<00:01:22.670> a<00:01:22.700> week<00:01:22.909> today<00:01:23.570> was<00:01:23.810> good<00:01:23.990> I

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
hopefully in a week today was good I

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.870 
hopefully in a week today was good I
mean<00:01:24.229> obviously<00:01:24.770> we<00:01:25.070> ran<00:01:25.220> hard<00:01:25.430> yesterday<00:01:25.610> so
