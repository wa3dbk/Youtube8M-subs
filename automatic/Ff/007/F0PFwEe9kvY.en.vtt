00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.100 
glue in there so it's drained but I
added<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.260> lot<00:02:12.410> more<00:02:12.440> trees<00:02:13.569> so<00:02:14.569> I<00:02:14.600> think<00:02:14.750> this

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
added a lot more trees so I think this

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.520 
added a lot more trees so I think this
looks<00:02:15.770> much<00:02:16.040> better<00:02:16.370> I'm<00:02:17.020> I'm<00:02:18.020> really<00:02:18.319> happy

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
looks much better I'm I'm really happy

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.550 
looks much better I'm I'm really happy
with<00:02:18.890> this<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.870> want<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:20.930> add<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.050> couple<00:02:21.319> of<00:02:21.500> more

with this I want to add a couple of more

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.890 
with this I want to add a couple of more
trees<00:02:22.010> but<00:02:22.430> for<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.730> most<00:02:22.940> part<00:02:23.209> this<00:02:23.420> area<00:02:23.780> is

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
trees but for the most part this area is

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.640 
trees but for the most part this area is
complete

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
complete

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.619

and as you can see here I added some
more<00:02:27.659> grass<00:02:28.609> this<00:02:29.609> is<00:02:29.790> really<00:02:30.060> cool<00:02:30.269> stuff<00:02:31.099> if

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
more grass this is really cool stuff if

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.170 
more grass this is really cool stuff if
you<00:02:32.219> can<00:02:32.430> get<00:02:32.549> down<00:02:32.579> and<00:02:32.760> see<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:34.819> it's<00:02:35.819> like

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
you can get down and see that it's like

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.059 
you can get down and see that it's like
I<00:02:36.510> said<00:02:36.569> it<00:02:36.810> comes<00:02:36.959> in<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.230> sheet<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.709> just<00:02:37.890> cut

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
I said it comes in a sheet you just cut

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.020 
I said it comes in a sheet you just cut
out<00:02:38.219> what<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.549> need

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
out what you need

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.470 
out what you need
I<00:02:40.069> just<00:02:41.069> wanted<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.370> pass<00:02:41.519> that<00:02:41.579> along<00:02:41.879> I'm<00:02:42.299> not

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
I just wanted to pass that along I'm not

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.089 
I just wanted to pass that along I'm not
dead<00:02:42.720> or<00:02:42.959> anything<00:02:43.049> I<00:02:43.409> have<00:02:43.560> been<00:02:43.769> actually

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
dead or anything I have been actually

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.270 
dead or anything I have been actually
working<00:02:44.250> on<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.609> railroad<00:02:45.769> but<00:02:46.769> this<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.129> just

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
working on the railroad but this is just

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.670 
working on the railroad but this is just
one<00:02:47.519> scene<00:02:47.819> that<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.180> always<00:02:48.959> wanted<00:02:49.439> to<00:02:49.500> work

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
one scene that I always wanted to work

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.589 
one scene that I always wanted to work
on<00:02:49.859> and<00:02:50.069> I<00:02:50.129> think<00:02:50.340> now<00:02:50.549> that<00:02:50.819> I<00:02:50.879> get<00:02:50.939> my<00:02:51.180> tripod

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
on and I think now that I get my tripod

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.899 
on and I think now that I get my tripod
down<00:02:51.950> it'll<00:02:52.950> look<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.159> little<00:02:53.310> bit<00:02:53.489> more<00:02:53.670> real

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
down it'll look a little bit more real

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.839 
down it'll look a little bit more real
instead<00:02:54.269> of<00:02:54.389> just<00:02:54.569> a<00:02:54.689> flat<00:02:54.870> piece<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.409> grass

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
instead of just a flat piece of grass

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.599 
instead of just a flat piece of grass
because<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:56.879> world<00:02:57.329> is<00:02:57.569> not<00:02:57.750> flat<00:02:58.280> has<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.310> lot

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
because the world is not flat has a lot

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.819 
because the world is not flat has a lot
of<00:02:59.639> undulations<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.720> ditches<00:03:01.680> and

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
of undulations and ditches and

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.390 
of undulations and ditches and
everything<00:03:02.220> in<00:03:02.370> there<00:03:02.579> so<00:03:03.980> but<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.010> wanted<00:03:05.310> to

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
everything in there so but I wanted to

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.720 
everything in there so but I wanted to
pass<00:03:05.579> that<00:03:05.609> along<00:03:06.409> and<00:03:07.409> I<00:03:07.530> do<00:03:07.590> have<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.010> sign<00:03:08.340> for

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
pass that along and I do have a sign for

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.039 
pass that along and I do have a sign for
this<00:03:08.849> building<00:03:09.239> here<00:03:09.510> I'm<00:03:09.569> not<00:03:09.689> gonna<00:03:09.840> tell

expensive and as you can tell my layout

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:14.479 
expensive and as you can tell my layout
is<00:04:12.599> quite<00:04:12.930> big<00:04:13.199> it's<00:04:13.530> not<00:04:13.680> just<00:04:13.949> a<00:04:14.069> four<00:04:14.280> byte

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489
