 we will introduce you to the implementation 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.019
 of our products and the quality of 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.130
 our services 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.170
 today the houses are built 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.990
 to be airtight is fine 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.520
 isolated good ventilation is so 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.590
 become essential to the life of your 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.840
 House 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.340
 ALDES French manufacturer expert in 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.829
 efficient ventilation systems 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.960
 and thermal comfort presents you 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.410
 the appropriate solutions that save money 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.480
 energy efficient ventilation allows 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.140
 the evacuation of pollutants often not 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.370
 noticeable but harmful to health 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.460
 it also prevents the appearance of 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.530
 mold that degrades the house this 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.180
 first ventilation solution is a 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.070
 vmc simple humidity sensitive flow lease to 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.540
 the supply of fresh air in the house is 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.270
 then ensured by air inlets 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.820
 humidity controlled at the top of the windows 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.180
 that is, the airflow varies 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.380
 according to the humidity prevailing in the room 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.420
 these air inlets are usually 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.610
 installed on windows bay windows 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.590
 or shutter boxes in the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.720
 living rooms such as living room or 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.250
 bedrooms 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.170
 it contributes to comfort as well as 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.850
 energy saving by modulating 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.130
 automatically the amount of air 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.280
 entering according to the occupation of the house 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.210
 pollutant- laden air is entrained 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.310
 to the wet rooms 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.890
 Eriq the bathroom and the storeroom 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.899
 toilet or the kitchen is stale air 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.409
 is exhaled by the extraction mouths 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.979
 humidity sensitive bahia curve positioned at 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.770
 ceiling or omitted the extraction vents 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.570
 are connected to the extraction end by 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.670
 rigid ducts or sheaths 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.350
 flexible which are isolated outside the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.460
 heated parts of the house for 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.799
 avoid condensation 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.969
 the extraction group are found the 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.450
 mostly in the attic 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.770
 hanging on the working framing of 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.690
 permanently 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.940
 its bi-croatian technology allows for 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.640
 consume little energy less than 10 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.050
 watts the evacuation of stale air must 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.510
 must be done outside 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.120
 from the house either through a roof exit 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.950
 either by a grid in front of it is 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.370
 important to plan at least once 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.140
 per year an interview of your vnc in order to 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.379
 ensure its operation 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.120
 performance as well as longevity aldes 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.330
 also offers multi solutions 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.040
 functions like tiff hydro water 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.200
 this solution combines a vmc 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.239
 humidity-sensitive with a water balloon 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.959
 hot thermodynamic equipped with a 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.450
 heat pump 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.519
 the tiff the i grow allows evacuation 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.099
 pollutants but also recover 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.040
 the heat of the house before rejecting 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.750
 the stale air outside this energy 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.360
 will be recovered by the heat pump 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.670
 on the hot water balloon and allows for 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.819
 heat water up to 55 degrees in 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.170
 a reservoir of 200 beds 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.239
 this very quiet solution and 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.700
 energy efficient meets the 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.239
 2012 thermal regulations and 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.519
 essential needs of your home 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.680
 last solution the dual flow vmc says 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.260
 high-performance flight cube and 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.819
 motorization microwatts this one you 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.340
 recovers heat from the air 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.310
 stale by transferring it to fresh air 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.540
 outside introduced into the house 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.819
 this installation brings you a 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.319
 true comfort by protecting you from 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.900
 external aggressions such as 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.480
 low temperatures the pollutants as well 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.560
 that noise nuisance 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.790
 it also helps to recover 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.470
 up to 90% of the heat of the vmc 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.150
 unlike the simple flow the double 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.340
 stream is not going to use air intake 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.280
 in the living rooms but leads to 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.680
 blowing connected to the exchanger by 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.049
 ventilation ducts the company aldes 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.569
 through its expertise and mastery of 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.180
 industrialized call solutions 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.680
 contribute to the comfort of life and 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.079
 health of your entire family in the 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.530
 home by saving systems 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.530
 energy 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.230
 and
