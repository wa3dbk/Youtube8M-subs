the<00:05:01.229> pronunciation<00:05:02.009> is<00:05:02.159> you<00:05:02.820> can<00:05:03.000> guess<00:05:03.180> but

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
the pronunciation is you can guess but

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:04.460 
the pronunciation is you can guess but
when<00:05:03.599> you're<00:05:03.720> reading<00:05:03.930> something<00:05:04.050> that's

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
when you're reading something that's

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.510 
when you're reading something that's
just<00:05:04.650> black<00:05:04.860> and<00:05:04.889> white<00:05:05.130> it's<00:05:05.370> just

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
just black and white it's just

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.850 
just black and white it's just
characters<00:05:05.940> then<00:05:06.360> you<00:05:06.960> know<00:05:07.110> it<00:05:07.320> becomes<00:05:07.650> a

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
characters then you know it becomes a

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.800 
characters then you know it becomes a
little<00:05:07.979> bit<00:05:08.159> more<00:05:08.280> difficult<00:05:08.460> so<00:05:08.940> what<00:05:09.780> I

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
little bit more difficult so what I

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.350 
little bit more difficult so what I
typically<00:05:10.320> do<00:05:10.729> when<00:05:11.729> I<00:05:11.759> read<00:05:12.000> these<00:05:12.150> book

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
typically do when I read these book
