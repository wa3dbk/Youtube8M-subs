00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
a minute look and see see that's green

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.170 
a minute look and see see that's green
streak<00:02:58.980> right<00:02:59.220> above<00:02:59.400> my<00:02:59.580> left<00:02:59.820> hand<00:03:00.030> right

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
streak right above my left hand right

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.500 
streak right above my left hand right
there

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
there

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.950 
there
go<00:03:01.230> back<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.740> look<00:03:02.010> at<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.760> series<00:03:03.630> of<00:03:05.960> slides

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
go back and look at the series of slides

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.300 
go back and look at the series of slides
that<00:03:07.230> get<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.710> very<00:03:07.890> beginning<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.220> this

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
that get the very beginning of this

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.760 
that get the very beginning of this
video<00:03:08.520> right<00:03:08.850> so<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.180> phase<00:03:09.600> 1<00:03:09.900> 2<00:03:10.110> 3<00:03:10.290> 4<00:03:10.590> &amp;<00:03:10.710> 5

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
video right so it's phase 1 2 3 4 &amp; 5

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.710 
video right so it's phase 1 2 3 4 &amp; 5
and<00:03:11.490> you'll<00:03:11.610> see<00:03:11.820> where<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.090> streak<00:03:12.480> comes

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
and you'll see where that streak comes

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.740 
and you'll see where that streak comes
from<00:03:13.020> and<00:03:13.590> it's<00:03:14.580> pretty<00:03:14.790> surprising<00:03:15.240> there<00:03:15.660> it

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
from and it's pretty surprising there it

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.750 
from and it's pretty surprising there it
is<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:16.050> shows<00:03:16.080> up<00:03:16.560> very<00:03:16.680> much<00:03:16.980> in<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.460> final

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
is it shows up very much in the final

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.550 
is it shows up very much in the final
painting<00:03:17.970> but<00:03:18.210> it<00:03:18.300> was<00:03:18.420> very<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:18.960> was<00:03:19.080> one<00:03:19.470> of

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
painting but it was very it was one of

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.770 
painting but it was very it was one of
the<00:03:19.620> first<00:03:19.890> strokes<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.700> put<00:03:21.030> on<00:03:21.240> the

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
the first strokes that I put on the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.110 
the first strokes that I put on the
canvas<00:03:22.020> in<00:03:22.350> there<00:03:22.470> lo<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.340> behold<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.820> still

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
canvas in there lo and behold it still

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.230 
canvas in there lo and behold it still
shows<00:03:24.570> up<00:03:24.750> at<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:24.990> very<00:03:25.230> end<00:03:25.970> that's<00:03:26.970> a<00:03:27.090> good

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
shows up at the very end that's a good

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.210 
shows up at the very end that's a good
example<00:03:27.330> what<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:27.870> mean<00:03:28.050> is<00:03:28.200> I'm<00:03:28.440> not<00:03:28.620> I'm<00:03:28.890> not

smart enough to to leave good painting
well<00:03:33.180> enough<00:03:33.360> alone<00:03:33.510> when<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:33.840> see<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.790> I

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
well enough alone when I see it I I

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.370 
well enough alone when I see it I I
