okay let's do it together so the trick
is<00:03:07.160> this<00:03:07.520> is<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:07.700> lot<00:03:07.910> like<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.120> puzzle<00:03:08.630> you<00:03:08.660> have

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
is this is a lot like a puzzle you have

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.710 
is this is a lot like a puzzle you have
to<00:03:08.990> angle<00:03:09.530> it<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.740> same<00:03:10.010> way<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.370> is<00:03:10.550> to<00:03:11.420> see

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
to angle it the same way it is to see

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.510 
to angle it the same way it is to see
where<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:11.990> pieces<00:03:12.200> are<00:03:12.380> supposed<00:03:12.740> to<00:03:12.860> go<00:03:12.980> see

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
where the pieces are supposed to go see

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.550 
where the pieces are supposed to go see
this<00:03:13.640> bottom<00:03:14.030> foot<00:03:14.300> it<00:03:14.840> comes<00:03:15.140> off<00:03:15.320> at<00:03:15.470> an
