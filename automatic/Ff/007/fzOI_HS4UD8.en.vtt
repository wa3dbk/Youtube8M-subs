00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.390
 document 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.939
 for example if you live for rent and 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.670
 your water bill comes from the owner's name 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.040
 from the house you ask him so that he 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.130
 make a document saying that you 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.450

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.379
 from your account 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.300
 after I've already sent mine 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.030
 documents 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.990
 I came back here on the homepage I still 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.930
 I can not apply for my card because 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.150
 because I have to wait for it to be 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.270
 documents like me are approved 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.910
 I just sent it and it will be there on time. 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.770
 usually when it is approved 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.510
 disapproved send an email to us 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.580
 so as soon as I receive this same 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.690
 warning, look how much was approved was 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.750
 disapproved 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.660
 I'm going to have to go back here and then I will 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.490
 I can quote my're card 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.920

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.760
 I'll show you to you here or 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.970
 clicking here 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.640
 they treat cards in the others you can 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.900
 check here that the first option that 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:01.380
 was to put money I already made the option 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.820
 to confirm that in a great moment 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.860
 so just wait 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:10.500
 and so does that gray also to that and 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.370

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.530

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.890

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.560
