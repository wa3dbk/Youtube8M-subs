00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
do my filming during the day so I have a

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.519 
do my filming during the day so I have a
nice<00:00:13.200> backdrop<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:14.190> lots<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.790> natural<00:00:15.000> light

camera videos and they're just so much

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.149 
camera videos and they're just so much
easy<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.509> film<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:01.989> edit<00:02:02.140> unlike<00:02:02.679> makeup

tutorials<00:02:03.670> which<00:02:03.849> are<00:02:04.149> painful<00:02:04.689> in

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:04.989 
tutorials which are painful in

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:06.809 
tutorials which are painful in
themselves<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:05.770> then<00:02:05.890> when<00:02:06.009> you<00:02:06.099> try<00:02:06.369> and<00:02:06.700> be

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
themselves and then when you try and be

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.449 
themselves and then when you try and be
creative<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.989> make<00:02:08.049> the<00:02:08.319> costume<00:02:08.829> and<00:02:09.280> think

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
creative and make the costume and think

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.130 
creative and make the costume and think
of<00:02:09.549> looks<00:02:09.880> and<00:02:10.179> then<00:02:10.269> shoot<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.599> location

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
of looks and then shoot the location

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.559 
of looks and then shoot the location
it's<00:02:11.890> actually<00:02:12.370> quite<00:02:12.700> time-consuming<00:02:12.940> so<00:02:13.510> I

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
it's actually quite time-consuming so I

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.970 
it's actually quite time-consuming so I
really<00:02:13.840> wanted<00:02:14.079> to<00:02:14.140> start<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.680> separate

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
really wanted to start a separate

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.160 
really wanted to start a separate
channel<00:02:15.340> which<00:02:15.700> was<00:02:16.090> still<00:02:16.450> beauty<00:02:16.870> related

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
channel which was still beauty related

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.550 
channel which was still beauty related
but<00:02:17.829> more<00:02:18.540> talking<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.780> camera<00:02:20.049> sort<00:02:20.500> of

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
but more talking to the camera sort of

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.319 
but more talking to the camera sort of
beauty<00:02:20.829> related<00:02:21.220> stuff<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:21.760> think<00:02:21.819> I'm

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
beauty related stuff and I think I'm

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.660 
beauty related stuff and I think I'm
going<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:22.959> make<00:02:23.230> it<00:02:23.410> more<00:02:23.709> natural<00:02:23.769> beauty

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
going to make it more natural beauty

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.229 
going to make it more natural beauty
because<00:02:25.230> five<00:02:26.230> days<00:02:26.440> of<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.739> week<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:27.190> am<00:02:27.879> quite

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
because five days of the week I am quite

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.449 
because five days of the week I am quite
a<00:02:28.269> natural<00:02:28.750> sort<00:02:29.019> of<00:02:29.079> person<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.709> don't<00:02:30.280> wear

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
a natural sort of person I don't wear

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.170 
a natural sort of person I don't wear
heavy<00:02:30.700> makeup

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
heavy makeup

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.900 
heavy makeup
in<00:02:31.359> fact<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:31.630> hardly<00:02:31.840> wear<00:02:32.230> any<00:02:32.440> makeup<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:33.190> I

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
in fact I hardly wear any makeup and I

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.559 
in fact I hardly wear any makeup and I
much<00:02:34.510> more<00:02:34.540> into<00:02:35.019> skinny<00:02:35.350> hair<00:02:35.620> so<00:02:36.579> I<00:02:36.970> thought

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
much more into skinny hair so I thought

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.270 
much more into skinny hair so I thought
maybe<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:38.230> would<00:02:38.350> be<00:02:38.380> good<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:38.739> have<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:38.980> channel

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
maybe it would be good to have a channel

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.129 
maybe it would be good to have a channel
that<00:02:39.609> is<00:02:39.850> targeted<00:02:40.359> towards<00:02:40.750> those<00:02:40.870> sort<00:02:41.109> of

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:41.139 
that is targeted towards those sort of

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.229 
that is targeted towards those sort of
people<00:02:41.319> because<00:02:41.829> then<00:02:42.100> at<00:02:42.220> least<00:02:42.250> those

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
people because then at least those

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.370 
people because then at least those
people<00:02:43.299> don't<00:02:44.290> have<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.889> watch<00:02:45.370> my<00:02:46.380> unwearable

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
people don't have to watch my unwearable

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.379 
people don't have to watch my unwearable
of<00:02:47.680> theatrical<00:02:48.250> makeup<00:02:48.400> charms<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.090> they<00:02:49.180> can

of theatrical makeup charms and they can

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.720 
of theatrical makeup charms and they can
maybe<00:02:49.630> they<00:02:50.380> might<00:02:50.530> find<00:02:50.799> my<00:02:50.980> more<00:02:51.220> normal

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
maybe they might find my more normal

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.259 
maybe they might find my more normal
everyday<00:02:52.090> makeup<00:02:53.220> opinions<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.579> thoughts<00:02:54.910> or

off two groups people so I thought I

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.050 
off two groups people so I thought I

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
will just separate it out and so both

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.210 
will just separate it out and so both
