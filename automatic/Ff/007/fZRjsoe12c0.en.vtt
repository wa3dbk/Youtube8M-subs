into<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.460> display<00:01:16.850> as<00:01:17.240> in<00:01:17.510> you're<00:01:17.810> going<00:01:17.900> to

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
into the display as in you're going to

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.730 
into the display as in you're going to
display<00:01:18.290> here<00:01:18.770> in<00:01:18.950> here<00:01:19.520> so<00:01:20.320> from<00:01:21.320> a<00:01:21.350> safety

display here in here so from a safety

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.590 
display here in here so from a safety
standpoint<00:01:22.310> you're<00:01:22.940> not<00:01:23.090> going<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.270> have<00:01:23.360> any

standpoint you're not going to have any

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.149 
standpoint you're not going to have any
problem<00:01:24.080> at<00:01:24.140> all<00:01:24.229> but<00:01:24.620> he's<00:01:24.740> worried<00:01:25.130> about

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
problem at all but he's worried about

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.990 
problem at all but he's worried about
lithium-ion<00:01:25.850> batteries<00:01:26.479> not<00:01:27.580> sore<00:01:28.580> having

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
lithium-ion batteries not sore having

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.240 
lithium-ion batteries not sore having
probably<00:01:29.300> blowing<00:01:29.930> up<00:01:30.260> that<00:01:30.590> is<00:01:30.740> not<00:01:30.980> going<00:01:31.190> to

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
probably blowing up that is not going to

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.120 
probably blowing up that is not going to
happen<00:01:33.700> all<00:01:34.700> right<00:01:34.970> now<00:01:35.300> this<00:01:35.540> is<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:36.130> output

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
happen all right now this is the output

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.150 
happen all right now this is the output
of<00:01:37.430> the<00:01:37.610> inverter<00:01:37.960> there's<00:01:38.960> two<00:01:39.230> water<00:01:39.740> 20

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
of the inverter there's two water 20

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.440 
of the inverter there's two water 20
volt<00:01:40.400> a<00:01:40.640> city's<00:01:42.370> doubtless

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.670 

ok<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.390> wall<00:01:48.390> charger<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.960> we're

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
ok this is the wall charger so we're

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:01.000 
ok this is the wall charger so we're
going<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.890> plug<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.549> right<00:01:54.649> here

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.690 

and<00:02:01.490> you'll<00:02:01.790> see<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:03.110> indicator<00:02:03.350> comes<00:02:03.890> on<00:02:04.190> so

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
and you'll see the indicator comes on so

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.450 
and you'll see the indicator comes on so
in<00:02:04.820> that<00:02:04.940> is<00:02:05.090> charging<00:02:05.660> at<00:02:05.810> that<00:02:05.990> point<00:02:06.430> so<00:02:07.430> now

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
in that is charging at that point so now

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.700 
in that is charging at that point so now
it's<00:02:07.940> charging<00:02:08.770> voltage<00:02:09.770> will<00:02:10.160> go<00:02:10.310> up<00:02:11.710> at

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
it's charging voltage will go up at

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:29.190 
it's charging voltage will go up at
about<00:02:13.550> 1.2<00:02:14.390> amps<00:02:14.930> per<00:02:14.960> hour

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.070 

and<00:02:30.099> this<00:02:30.520> is<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:31.080> car<00:02:32.080> charger<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:34.180> it'll

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
and this is the car charger so it'll

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.850 
and this is the car charger so it'll
charge<00:02:35.650> at<00:02:35.920> about<00:02:36.190> two<00:02:36.700> planes<00:02:37.530> three<00:02:38.530> or<00:02:38.620> four

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
charge at about two planes three or four

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.160 
charge at about two planes three or four
amps<00:02:39.810> when<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:40.900> charge<00:02:41.170> up<00:02:41.319> in<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.890> car
