00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.840
 schwarzenegger stallone jesus i have 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.809
 seen escape plan 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.130
 grÃ¤sslin is a security expert 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.710
 means he is in prisons 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.910
 lock up and then break out of the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.859
 to show prison where his 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.980
 weak spots are more successful 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:31.230
 Outbreak depends on three things the thing 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.120
 our know the processes understand 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.460
 and you need help from the outside or 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.110
 inside this is a business in which 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.930
 he pressed himself many years and he is 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.920
 something like the absolute crack of the 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.440
 security expert breslin is in the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.760
 able to break out of each of 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.500
 man- made prison now 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.180
 would one day become a prison 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.350
 called by the said will come 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.300
 Never get out of it, that's the best 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.400
 latest safest high-tech fair 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.050
 prison is called the tomb of 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.280
 war on such a security code if 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.710
 he wants to avenge in advance and so on and 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.879
 so being is is a prototype 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.290
 facility for prisoners of the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.650
 all government depreciated 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.899
 been 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.700
 the investors want to make sure that 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.460
 These facilities are escape-proof 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.410
 The director thomas he rolls 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.570
 comes along with that a bit 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.830
 shit runs and thinks this is here 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.759
 a dangerous situation 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.509
 I'd rather say mine 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:20.550
 security code but the sadistic one 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:26.550
 jailor hobbs played by jim 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:28.979
 kerr seven casinos played by jason 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.140
 you know you i mean jesus the 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.759
 is this sadistic prisoner 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.170
 He says what the security code I know 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.350
 nothing yet we come in your new one 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.350
 At home 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.189
 I'm director Horst where it's director 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.539
 like 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:50.369
 there is no director like that he can 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.740
 not fallen for a long time and closes 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.560
 get together with another occupant 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.149
 emil rottmeier a german 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.360
 Austrian inmate this 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.429
 , prison, the reticent and 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.009
 decide to flee together with 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.450
 her wonderful escape plan you 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.519
 to come up with clever and so did 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.220
 do not feel that is not your concern 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:13.739
 breslin is played by sylvester 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.739
 stallone and irak meyer 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.700
 he plays the ball properly arnold 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.349
 Schwarzenegger 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.720
 it was a case somebody wanted me 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.989
 Buried alive and I will 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.260
 find out who and why we go there 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.709
 on 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.480
 I do not know how exhausting and hard 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.640
 it is in politics I work 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.190
 do not know what it means governor 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.870
 to be this state 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.810
 I do not know how exhausting that is 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.590
 but one thing is for sure when you are one 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.560
 a little bit of acting could and 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.190
 then this job takes over then loses 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.590
 obviously all ability to do so 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.630
 So I do not even have half in 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.000
 New York was played as bad as 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.459
 escape plan by Mr. Schwarzeegger 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.650
 that's pretty crass like that 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.700
 By doing so I maneuvered the movie 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.209
 need a distraction maneuver 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.209
 OK 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.640
 do you strike like a vegetarian? 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.659
 not bad that hurts a bit 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.099
 I must say in all honesty actually 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.989
 the whole number is clear 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.790
 i like such selection movie i want that 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.409
 cool times I like such film must always 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.569
 that's why a big coup is planned 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.040
 so and that is escape plan too and 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.290
 That's why he also bock I like too 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:32.459
 prison break movies for that too 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:35.280
 exciting what to close the rats 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.769
 back to your church so i like me 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.120
 it may of rewarding now there are times 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.530
 things make him ill but I think that 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.090
 So film always worked and now 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.920
 of course it's about the most amazing thing 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.769
 and black finally together as 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.329
 old gentlemen but the schwarzenegger is 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.290
 unfortunately just super bad as 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:54.959
 I will not get him out 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:57.450
 i kill you is clear jim is in that 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.160
 film but insanely good and a good one 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.019
 as a villain rather can often 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.019
 save it is so in this case the 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.060
 is so asi and so evil that works 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.849
 and that is how it holds the tension of the 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.260
 films at all that leaves that up 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.150
 a working spectator somehow 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.890
 stay who paid for them 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.859
 here are 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.570
 Of course, that's old 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.570
 Men's action is similar to 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.440
 Expendables you can see super articulated 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.970
 yes, all are not anymore 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.440
 That's why you have to be with others 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.270
 Think about tricks like that somehow 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.070
 as coo was quick to come off but the 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.080
 usually work and that is 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.940
 somehow so I find the book full 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.380
 All right, that makes you buck if you are 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.250
 it would have to have occupied younger 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.740
 probably even a tick 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.510
 exciting action has become richer so 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.250
 but of course it's the gag too 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.110
 the best salary and schwarzenegger 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.640
 are then still 50 cent in 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.580
 the movie on so it's a bit like that 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.470
 everyone was allowed to play in this way again 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.480
 The grave was somewhere then there 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.740
 knew there are no big ones 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.040
 Surprises movie so you can do it 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.690
 Not 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.400
 expect a new invention of the song 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.400
 or so is is 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.100
 who should watch this movie? 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:07.780
 stallone fans in any case 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.940
 schwarzenegger windows on which 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.900
 better not give and all the 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.550
 somehow I want to say that 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.139
 Sunday afternoon not with a dvd 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.360
 on the couch in his cinema 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.599
 they could also watch everyone else 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.080
 Can we wait for the advance 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:31.330
 escape plan gets from me 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:39.520
 Solid three out of five hurry in bread 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:41.560
 you have to do it 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.160
 but not so he that me 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.320
 has brought 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:49.240
 I like the place here if now 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.440
 in the trailer to see escape plan 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.300
 then you click around him and if you 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.949
 One wanted to see a criticism 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.669
 film in which it's about the tube 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:56.669
 to file 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.860
 then you click down on the criticism 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.860
 Don John 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:21.920
 I think because no one by the 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:24.970
 Ventilation shaft probably the rotary 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.970
 dismantle spectacular 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:33.830
 who of you has let him out?
