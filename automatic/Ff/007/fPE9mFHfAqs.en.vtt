 We come friends to the pay news today 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.390
 It's about watchers ssb, among other things 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.300
 unity state of the border lens and running 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.530
 resin excelled much fun I have so 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.090
 a little bit that feeling 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.719
 ubisoft tries to get into my news too 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.280
 to sneak 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.440
 I have another news too 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.270
 Assassin's creed unity is there 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.640
 currently still quite massive 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.560
 problems playing the game smoothly 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.300
 or to enjoy what, of course, the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.670
 Game fun influenced a bit 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.130
 and today for the xbox ran and the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.070
 ps4 a new patch appeared after 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.230
 the homepage and the patch 1.2 today that 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.270
 third update for the pc should be loud 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.899
 ubisoft then the update still in progress 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.399
 Follow the week and fix the update 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.829
 mainly or in focus are the 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.110
 performance slumps and not 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.460
 really constant framerate there 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.200
 Everything will be fixed of course 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.440
 then also more glitches and bugs 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.390
 Overall, the talk is about 300 bugfixes 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.890
 content of this patch so completely 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.750
 Neat, I'm curious if 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.039
 this patch really brings what you bring 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.940
 Of course, as always in the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.070
 Write comments 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.439
 I would be interested and I would 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.500
 let's go to the next ubisoft 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.330
 news or and we are back to the topic 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.610
 ubisoft at the open world 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.820
 title hot dogs already half a year ago 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.080
 for pc ps3 and xbox 360 has appeared 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.210
 The title now surprisingly 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.140
 also published for nintendo's review 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.970
 been 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.890
 and surprisingly , the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.200
 sales figures worse than expected 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.540
 according to current extrapolation in gfk 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.020
 chart track are the sales in 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.799
 Britain really really bad 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.479
 Overall, the title is in the 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.979
 weekly software charts on place 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.409
 14 entered 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.600
 and yes ubisoft heart already yes before 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.450
 let some time that one 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.509
 probably no titles no more 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.040
 will publish the title more 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.110
 adult players are directed and 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.970
 I would say that he is relative 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.130
 Bad sales are concrete numbers 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.299
 it does not exist yet 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.299
 then simply reaffirm this again 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.439
 opinion and support the whole me 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.700
 can not quite help me but i have 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.829
 somehow the feeling that today's 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.990
 day is totally in the sign of ubisoft 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.240
 because now comes the third news 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.100
 to 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.709
 ubisoft and that is now known 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.380
 given that the action adventure rabbit 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.090
 heart the great wall also for android 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.650
 equipment is available or you 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.060
 you can get the titles now in google 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.830
 download places 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.370
 so far you could only title 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.890
 or only on pc and ios 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.150

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.890
 was the way when her ios version 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.200
 or the android version is then suitable 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.360
 you will get a comic for free 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.769
 I think a cool thing just times 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.690
 buy is definitely cool game 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.340
 Well, I will still be the one 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.870

 the whole costs 22 euro 99 at steam 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.340

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.380
