the different styles of goose calls to

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.410 
the different styles of goose calls to
different<00:00:55.980> calls<00:00:56.429> that<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:56.969> carry<00:00:57.269> at

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
different calls that we carry at

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.419 
different calls that we carry at
field-proven<00:00:57.809> calls<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.859> aftershocks

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
field-proven calls is the aftershocks

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:01.790 
field-proven calls is the aftershocks
and<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.789> adrenaline<00:01:00.269> as<00:01:00.929> you<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.379> see<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
and the adrenaline as you can see the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.559 
and the adrenaline as you can see the
aftershock<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.640> lot<00:01:02.879> longer<00:01:03.120> than<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:03.569 
aftershock is a lot longer than the

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:05.540 
aftershock is a lot longer than the
adrenaline<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.710> reason<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.489> is

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
adrenaline the reason for this is

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.250 
adrenaline the reason for this is
because<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.120> extra<00:01:06.390> shock<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.810> designed<00:01:07.140> to

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
because the extra shock is designed to

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.969 
because the extra shock is designed to
be<00:01:07.380> very<00:01:07.409> deep<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.280> toned<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.850> tolerant<00:01:09.979> some

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
be very deep and toned and tolerant some

be very deep and toned and tolerant some
of<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.220> some<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.390> situations<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.170> I

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
of the some of the situations that I
