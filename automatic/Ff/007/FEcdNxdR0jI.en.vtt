 This person is a player who has entered the hall of fame 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.930
 So yesterday yesterday just yesterday 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.730
 If you try to get my village attacked, you're Bill Polly 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.990
 Attacked by 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.340
 In dv Ruporu's cat down dr house house etc 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:04.809
 Houseton return 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.940
 I am a member of Um , I'm not Times web now 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.260

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.730
 Real House Tonne Now I have returned to Times web 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:18.010
 It was the same player 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:21.340
 That I I in how to do this it a Why 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:27.230
 It is said that this person is saying this person 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:34.610
 Nde probably thinks that it is one of the also ne top players in the world 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:37.940
 I think kana if it Hey seen the person is hit Geumchon with what tactics I 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:44.000
 I am, for example, did you think and I'll give this video 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:45.390
 You can see the player's Nemura by ranking and you can see the first place person and for example 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.100
 We look 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.210
 You can see the world's number one villager village now 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.690
 this 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.720
 That training area There are no soldiers in the training area 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.320
 This is a crash of clan that 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:09.369
 Murao Ne- I saw the world ranker village 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:11.440
 A soldier is stopped at that campsite and the person usually uses what soldier and other villages 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:16.030
 But the one seen'm blame 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.740
 This is because it does not appear in that Samurai Tiger game 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:24.050
 Is the tactics of this time popular? 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:28.550
 I'm there is I Well interesting Toko there is a need to devise tactics it is their own 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:31.060
 So how does the top player attack? 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.580
 I wonder if this will be helpful 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.990
 Let's see right now 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:41.430
 Evil Polly Real House from the match record in 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.430
 I'm watching this replay 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.690
 Yes 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:53.590
 The Mongolian soldier and the situation is getting cold from the lower right 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.590
 And then Sennin and this one was introduced 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:02.939
 Nde my village I Well weakness I had still thought that Shimoda 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.939
 After all it is quite hard to be attacked from below 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:14.880
 It seems like the top player is coming to you like this 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:18.910
 Te I'd have come up with that reinforcements now from my sound the same name of a person 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:23.520
 Everyone is an archer, but it's from level 4 to level 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:26.780
 After all, if you can sit in a powerful soldier 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.780
 You were done at once 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:35.840
 Sometimes I think I can see that kind of thunder like this, but this is 1000 people 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.709
 It's a running beam 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.700
 This is the whole attack from building to building 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:48.640
 Has a lotus like some thunder 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.640
 It's pretty strong, it's like lightning 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.830
 It is full- 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.260
 The enemy's military power can not be almost cut off 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:03.480
 It means that you lost 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.480
 But it is quite valuable video 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.300
 I think the way you attack is also considered after all 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.329
 After completing the replay 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:21.410
 8 I think 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:29.830
 It was this e-Virupori's hey turned on 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:34.390
 Good state of 19 soldiers 1 Mongolian soldiers 381,000 people it is similar to the kimono of the old and freezing 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.900
 Each one on top of the pot all the way up to the highest level 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:40.320
 Hmm 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:43.530
 The stolen resources 344,000 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:49.300
 Yeosu has 23,233 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:53.840
 But the resources themselves are no longer eaten by me, but the resources taken away are small 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:59.470
 Well the top player is also a resource with few cats 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.470
 Yeah it is kind of that professional crushing hit it a serious 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.830
 I think this may be helpful 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.900
 More than tea 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:15.340
 Today's report was over 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:18.240
 In addition, please keep in mind that the price increase animation will keep on increasing 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.240
 car
