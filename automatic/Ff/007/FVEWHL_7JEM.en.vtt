 can do normalitos in tortilla 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.180
 freshly made corn imagine how delicious 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.580
 ingredient on screen requires a 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.980
 tongue water to cover half onion 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.529
 four cloves of garlic two leaves of 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.050
 laurel and for the tacos meats of losada 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.050
 half tongue medium chopped onion 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.989
 cup of chopped cilantro delicious sauce 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.360
 green tomatoes 43 serrano peppers a 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.250
 garlic clove a quarter cup 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.980
 cilantro a quarter cup of broth 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.219
 chicken and to serve corn tortillas 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.100
 tak heras and banana leaves that are the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.770
 little girls then let's start look 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.600
 here we have the language I was 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.699
 telling marta a very experience 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.340
 funny happened with my tongue 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.890
 you say it's giant and it's the wife and 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.700
 so that's how big it is and yes it has 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.020
 this part 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.670
 where good the animal used to eat and 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.520
 drink water then that's why it's the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.290
 Little girl is like a cat then 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.120
 can not be removed is a bit difficult 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.190
 Remove it before you know it 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.800
 so I recommend that you cook it like this 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.950
 complete at the time of cooking the already 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.410
 superficial skin comes out easily or with 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.240
 a knife can remove it then 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.810
 because the language does not look very good 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.830
 but if it tastes great then 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.540
 let's put it to cook to give it good 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.490
 flavor is important that you the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.550
 infusion that you put onion garlic laurel 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.310
 put all the flavors for 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.229
 infuse your language we are going to put you 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.990
 It also comes out to be able to put grain 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.140
 pepper can put some skin 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.300
 of lemon everything to take away maybe that 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.210
 aroma that is not unpleasant but if it is 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.190
 a little different to the meat other cut 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.070
 of beef then there is going to leave 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.930
 cook approximately two hours and 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.289
 half to three 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.020
 depends on the size of the animal of the age 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.300
 of the animal and the size of the tongue but 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.030
 he knows how to make it faster in pot 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.860
 express in the express pot in one hour 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.980
 it will be soft and it will stay 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.709
 the meat in this way can 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.730
 crumble or it can sting very very very 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.620
 finite then the meat is delicious 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.530
 I assure you that if you have never tried it 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.920
 will love it then let's move it to 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.459
 a pan already has enough fat not 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.380
 it requires you to put oil on us 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.590
 I recommend it 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.630
 well alone we are going to put him in the 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.720
 hot pan and here will start to 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.540
 take very good color and all the fat that 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.390
 you can see it's going to melt and it's going 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.390
 to serve to give flavor and look 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.450
 that yesterday I had a dinner with 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.790
 some friends and they were tacos de riba there I did 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.830
 shrimp tacos and tongue tacos 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.989
 imagine that they were the most successful 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.060
 all very great language cue no longer 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.190
 it was baked tongue already flew why not 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.430
 a lot that's always a small amount 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.550
 then we will make our green sauce the 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.190
 tomato chile serrano cilantro garlic and 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.370
 we liquefy in this appointment 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.550
 we'll try 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.500
 flavor 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.500
 to our delicious meat 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.860
 As you release fat, it releases the 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.590
 grease 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.590
 they have we are going to add the onion 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.989
 onions that is typical with tacos 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.989
 of language 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.819
 let's add cilantro 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.710
 so it smells delicious like that already can 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.110
 to serve 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.440
 I really like the taste of salsa 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.660
 raw with this meat with this meat is 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.450
 of language that is delicious and for the purpose 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.990
 week old lady surprise her husband 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.120
 with a couple of beers imagine nothing 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.310
 plus a very cold beer with the 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.600
 language tacos today you will remember 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.760
 me when I do them then here we go to 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:31.040
 leave it about five minutes for it to take 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:33.560
 all the flavor of the green sauce and what 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.030
 we're going to do is take the tortillas that 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.360
 this time they are tag heras that are a 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.970
 little bit smaller are easier to 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.280
 manipulate we pass them by oil as 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.480
 if you were to make enchiladas 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.660
 quickly passes them through the oil and 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.930
 they stay that way very soft if they give it very 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.210
 good taste to the taquitos then already 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.880
 the time that we were 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:59.030
 waiting for five minutes and we're going to 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.200
