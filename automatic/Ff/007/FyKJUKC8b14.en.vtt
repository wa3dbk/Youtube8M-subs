for this skirt the e loop cast on is

for this skirt the e loop cast on is
probably<00:00:22.170> one<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.859> earliest<00:00:23.250> casts<00:00:23.850> on

called the simple cast on and all it is

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.580 
called the simple cast on and all it is
is<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.039> series<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.640> twisted<00:00:30.359> loops<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:31.230> get

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
the e loop cast on was the one that I

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.160 
the e loop cast on was the one that I
chose<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.760> see<00:00:50.789> when<00:00:51.420> we<00:00:51.600> zoom<00:00:51.629> in

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
chose and as you can see when we zoom in

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.610 
chose and as you can see when we zoom in
all<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> series<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.449> twisted<00:00:55.320> loops

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
all it is is a series of twisted loops

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.220 
all it is is a series of twisted loops
that<00:00:55.980> go<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.430> over<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.000> needle<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.629> it's

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
that go on over the needle and it's

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.470 
that go on over the needle and it's
called<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.800> e<00:00:58.829> loop<00:00:59.280> because<00:00:59.579> they<00:01:00.000> look<00:01:00.239> like

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
called the e loop because they look like

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.750 
called the e loop because they look like
little<00:01:00.719> cursive<00:01:01.440> ease<00:01:01.800> when<00:01:02.070> they're<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.489> your

stitches and you knit your first row you

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.390 
stitches and you knit your first row you
have<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.510> be<00:01:09.659> very<00:01:09.689> careful<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.130> first

to<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.180> very<00:01:15.210> careful<00:01:15.750> with<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> first<00:01:16.530> row

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
to be very careful with the first row

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.219 
to be very careful with the first row
because<00:01:17.250> these<00:01:17.490> loops<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.780> between

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
because these loops in here in between

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.980 
because these loops in here in between
the<00:01:19.380> stitches<00:01:19.680> tend<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.729> get<00:01:20.939> all<00:01:21.180> long<00:01:21.600> and

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
the stitches tend to get all long and

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.200 
the stitches tend to get all long and
stretched<00:01:22.439> out<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.280> easy<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.909> drop<00:01:24.150> a

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
stretched out and it's easy to drop a

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.690 
stretched out and it's easy to drop a
stitch<00:01:24.659> off<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.229> needle<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.280> when<00:01:26.490> knitting

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
stitch off the needle so when knitting

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.480 
stitch off the needle so when knitting
your<00:01:27.000> first<00:01:27.299> row<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:28.020> very<00:01:28.290> careful<00:01:28.920> these<00:01:29.250> are

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
your first row be very careful these are

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.370 
your first row be very careful these are
the<00:01:29.579> loops<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.090> I'm<00:01:30.240> talking<00:01:30.720> about<00:01:30.810> their

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
the loops that I'm talking about their

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.580 
the loops that I'm talking about their
the<00:01:31.560> strings<00:01:32.070> between<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.060> stitches<00:01:33.590> but

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
the strings between the stitches but

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.010 
the strings between the stitches but
once<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.369> your<00:01:35.549> first<00:01:35.850> row<00:01:36.240> completed

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
once you have your first row completed

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.370 
once you have your first row completed
you<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.829> see<00:01:38.100> how<00:01:38.340> totally<00:01:39.030> flat<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:40.049> that

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
you can see how totally flat that that

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.780 
you can see how totally flat that that
cast<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:42.030> for<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.570> top<00:01:42.840> because<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:44.520> is

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
cast on is for the top because this is

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.880 
cast on is for the top because this is
important<00:01:45.450> when<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:46.020> sew<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
important when we sew it to the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.370 
important when we sew it to the
waistband<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.880> skirt<00:01:48.270> which<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.229> will

see<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.680> another<00:01:49.950> video<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:51.000> we<00:01:51.630> want<00:01:51.899> to

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
see in another video that we want to

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.149 
see in another video that we want to
have<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.500> as<00:01:52.680> smooth<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.460> flat<00:01:54.030> as<00:01:54.329> possible

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
have it as smooth and flat as possible

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.539 
have it as smooth and flat as possible
