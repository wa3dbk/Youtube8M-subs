amazingly<00:00:26.580> well<00:00:26.820> done<00:00:27.119> mod<00:00:27.420> I've<00:00:27.930> never<00:00:28.109> seen

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
amazingly well done mod I've never seen

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.380 
amazingly well done mod I've never seen
anything<00:00:28.500> like<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.760> what<00:00:29.849> we<00:00:29.970> do<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.119> take

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
anything like this so what we do is take

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.209 
anything like this so what we do is take
some<00:00:30.510> coal<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.019> we<00:00:31.140> right-click<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.529> block<00:00:31.830> and

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
some coal and we right-click a block and

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.979 
some coal and we right-click a block and
you<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.399> see<00:00:32.520> their<00:00:32.700> crib<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.210> block<00:00:33.510> entity

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
you can see their crib the block entity

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.920 
you can see their crib the block entity
and<00:00:34.340> we<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.460> actually<00:00:35.700> push<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.390> block

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
and we can actually push this block

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.590 
and we can actually push this block
around<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.370> knows<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.700> when<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.120> collides

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
around so it knows that when it collides

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.119 
around so it knows that when it collides
into<00:00:39.750> other<00:00:40.050> things<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.530> guys<00:00:40.649> could<00:00:40.890> see<00:00:41.040> it

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
into other things you guys could see it

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.229 
into other things you guys could see it
right<00:00:41.250> there's<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.520> little<00:00:41.730> glitch<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.120> only

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
right there's a little glitch it only

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.630 
right there's a little glitch it only
moves<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:42.750> block<00:00:42.960> at<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.200> time<00:00:43.230> but<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.219> slides

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
moves one block at a time but it slides

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.430 
moves one block at a time but it slides
a<00:00:44.789> little<00:00:44.879> further<00:00:45.239> than<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.960> one<00:00:46.170> block

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
a little further than that one block

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.869 
a little further than that one block
it's<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.070> little<00:00:47.280> glitch<00:00:47.460> doesn't<00:00:47.760> really

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
it's a little glitch doesn't really

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.119 
it's a little glitch doesn't really
matter<00:00:48.120> cuz<00:00:48.420> I'm<00:00:48.750> sure<00:00:49.170> it'll<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.649> fixed<00:00:50.010> out

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
matter cuz I'm sure it'll be fixed out

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
in future versions of the mod but as of

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.920 
in future versions of the mod but as of
now<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.620> fantastic<00:00:53.480> mod<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.510> can't

there<00:01:01.770> are<00:01:01.890> not<00:01:02.250> many<00:01:02.460> supported<00:01:03.090> blocks<00:01:03.449> but

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
there are not many supported blocks but

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.440 
there are not many supported blocks but
they<00:01:03.989> are<00:01:04.110> slowly<00:01:04.949> becoming<00:01:05.189> more<00:01:05.909> supported

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
they are slowly becoming more supported

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.899 
they are slowly becoming more supported
and<00:01:06.600> we'll<00:01:07.470> go<00:01:07.560> through<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.860> bunch<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.400> them<00:01:08.520> but

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
and we'll go through a bunch of them but

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.609 
and we'll go through a bunch of them but
once<00:01:09.150> we<00:01:09.299> want<00:01:09.510> we're<00:01:09.810> done<00:01:09.990> adjusting<00:01:10.290> this

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
once we want we're done adjusting this

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.960 
once we want we're done adjusting this
block<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:11.100> can<00:01:11.220> actually<00:01:11.369> right<00:01:11.729> click<00:01:11.880> it

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
block we can actually right click it

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.310 
block we can actually right click it
again<00:01:12.060> with<00:01:12.240> coal<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.750> we'll<00:01:12.840> place<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.080> down

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
again with coal and we'll place it down

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.679 
again with coal and we'll place it down
and<00:01:13.530> make<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.799> regular<00:01:13.920> block<00:01:14.490> now<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.420> works

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
and make it a regular block now it works

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.100 
and make it a regular block now it works
with<00:01:15.960> your<00:01:16.920> logs<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.990> can

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
with your logs like so and you can

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.359 
with your logs like so and you can
actually<00:01:19.229> break<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.590> blocks<00:01:19.920> which<00:01:20.220> is

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
actually break the blocks which is

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.590 
actually break the blocks which is
something<00:01:20.520> cool<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.970> can't<00:01:21.150> usually<00:01:21.299> do

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
something cool that you can't usually do

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.020 
something cool that you can't usually do
with<00:01:21.720> entities<00:01:22.009> now<00:01:23.009> let's<00:01:23.189> see<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.759> can<00:01:23.880> see

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
with entities now let's see you can see

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.460 
with entities now let's see you can see
there<00:01:24.210> when<00:01:24.479> blocks<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.990> don't<00:01:25.350> actually

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
there when blocks that don't actually

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.780 
there when blocks that don't actually
allow<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.860> push<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.189> as<00:01:26.280> i<00:01:26.400> started<00:01:26.700> this

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
let's say like there we created that

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.259 
let's say like there we created that
there<00:02:44.650> we<00:02:44.889> can<00:02:45.010> push<00:02:45.189> that<00:02:45.400> right<00:02:45.939> click<00:02:46.150> it

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
there we can push that right click it

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.759 
there we can push that right click it
again<00:02:46.359> and<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:46.840> becomes<00:02:47.079> a<00:02:47.200> block<00:02:47.469> right<00:02:47.739> there

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
again and it becomes a block right there
