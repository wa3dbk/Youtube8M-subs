00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
I've only played about 55 games with

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.560 
I've only played about 55 games with
this<00:00:16.190> by<00:00:17.190> played<00:00:17.430> extensively<00:00:17.820> with<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
this by played extensively with the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.679 
this by played extensively with the
Matilda<00:00:19.439> then<00:00:19.770> lease<00:00:20.010> they're<00:00:20.820> basically<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
Matilda then lease they're basically the

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.250 
Matilda then lease they're basically the
same<00:00:21.960> arm<00:00:22.590> wise<00:00:22.920> almost<00:00:23.400> identical<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.720> I've

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
same arm wise almost identical so I've

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.170 
same arm wise almost identical so I've
got<00:00:25.439> quite<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.859> bit<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.070> knowledge<00:00:26.730> with<00:00:27.000> that

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
got quite a bit of knowledge with that

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.990 
got quite a bit of knowledge with that
but<00:00:28.050> let's<00:00:28.289> get<00:00:28.439> into<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.680> okay<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.970> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
but let's get into it okay so on the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.970 
but let's get into it okay so on the
front<00:00:30.390> Armour<00:00:30.750> you've<00:00:30.900> got<00:00:30.990> 75<00:00:31.230> millimetres

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
front Armour you've got 75 millimetres

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.560 
front Armour you've got 75 millimetres
this<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.430> pretty<00:00:32.669> good<00:00:32.940> we'll<00:00:33.149> bounce<00:00:33.270> off

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
this is pretty good we'll bounce off

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.680 
this is pretty good we'll bounce off
every<00:00:33.960> tier<00:00:34.170> free<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:35.130> lot<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.730> tier<00:00:35.910> fours<00:00:36.239> and

above 23 you're going to want to have it

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.900 
above 23 you're going to want to have it
head-on<00:00:54.710> really<00:00:55.710> do<00:00:55.860> not<00:00:56.039> expose<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.489> sidearm

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
unless you wanna be pounded even if it's

unless you wanna be pounded even if it's
sort<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.789> spaced<00:01:00.149> armor<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.690> doesn't<00:01:01.170> really

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
sort of spaced armor it doesn't really

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
do much there's only four elite it frees

do much there's only four elite it frees
you're<00:01:03.660> going<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.840> notice<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.460> so<00:01:06.320> now<00:01:07.320> onto

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
you're going to notice on so now onto

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.270 
you're going to notice on so now onto
the<00:01:07.619> rear<00:01:08.070> armor<00:01:08.720> 55<00:01:09.720> again<00:01:10.140> but<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.159> is

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
the rear armor 55 again but this is

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.670 
the rear armor 55 again but this is
actually<00:01:11.400> pretty<00:01:11.729> decent<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.780> lower<00:01:13.380> portion

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
actually pretty decent the lower portion

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.100 
actually pretty decent the lower portion
is<00:01:14.220> obviously<00:01:14.549> pendelshape<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.810> actual

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
is obviously pendelshape for the actual

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.980 
is obviously pendelshape for the actual
engine<00:01:16.650> deck<00:01:16.799> itself<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.549> bit<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.390> kv-1

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
engine deck itself a bit like the kv-1

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.780 
engine deck itself a bit like the kv-1
is<00:01:19.200> actually<00:01:19.500> pretty<00:01:19.710> bouncy<00:01:19.979> will<00:01:20.490> balance

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
is actually pretty bouncy will balance

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.690 
is actually pretty bouncy will balance
quite<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> few<00:01:21.180> tier<00:01:21.390> fries<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.960> falls<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.439> it

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
quite a few tier fries and falls on it

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.980 
quite a few tier fries and falls on it
but<00:01:23.700> wouldn't<00:01:23.939> trust<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.360> too<00:01:24.509> much<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
but wouldn't trust it too much of the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.240 
but wouldn't trust it too much of the
end<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.470> only<00:01:25.650> 55<00:01:26.100> millimeters<00:01:28.250> sounds

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
end of it is only 55 millimeters sounds

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.120 
end of it is only 55 millimeters sounds
pretty<00:01:29.400> much<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:30.030> whole<00:01:30.500> seems<00:01:31.500> relatively

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
pretty much if a whole seems relatively

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.800 
pretty much if a whole seems relatively
good<00:01:32.430> especially<00:01:32.729> for<00:01:32.939> tier<00:01:33.270> 4<00:01:34.850> so<00:01:35.850> now<00:01:36.570> moving

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
good especially for tier 4 so now moving

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.749 
good especially for tier 4 so now moving
on<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> turret<00:01:37.500> Centrify<00:01:38.040> for<00:01:38.070> round<00:01:38.490> it's

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
on to the turret Centrify for round it's

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.819 
on to the turret Centrify for round it's
basically<00:01:39.210> identical<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.409> lend-lease

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
basically identical to the lend-lease

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.260 
basically identical to the lend-lease
one<00:01:41.600> pretty<00:01:42.600> nice<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.020> bouncy<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:44.180> just<00:01:45.180> in

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
one pretty nice and bouncy and just in

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.630 
one pretty nice and bouncy and just in
general<00:01:45.329> quite<00:01:45.930> nice<00:01:46.170> with<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.220> gun<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.549> has

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
general quite nice with this gun it has

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.300 
general quite nice with this gun it has
about<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.880> minus<00:01:48.329> ten<00:01:48.750> gun<00:01:49.500> depression<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:50.070> think

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
about a minus ten gun depression I think

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.850 
about a minus ten gun depression I think
so<00:01:50.549> it's<00:01:50.700> pretty<00:01:50.960> pretty<00:01:51.960> decent<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.619> fair

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
so it's pretty pretty decent to be fair

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.200 
so it's pretty pretty decent to be fair
and<00:01:53.659> all<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:54.840> all<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.049> armless<00:01:55.560> tank<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.950> nice

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
and all in all the armless tank is nice

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.630 
and all in all the armless tank is nice
just<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.750> note<00:01:58.049> these<00:01:58.409> boxes<00:01:59.009> will<00:01:59.040> not<00:01:59.399> count

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
just to note these boxes will not count

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.539 
just to note these boxes will not count
as<00:01:59.759> armor<00:02:00.240> part<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> tank<00:02:01.530> sorry<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.310> if<00:02:02.430> you

then nothing else it will go straight

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.040 
then nothing else it will go straight
through<00:02:06.870> same<00:02:07.560> with<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.830> fuel<00:02:08.310> tank<00:02:08.990> okay<00:02:09.990> so

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
through same with the fuel tank okay so

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.280 
through same with the fuel tank okay so
now<00:02:10.259> on<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:11.000> maneuverability<00:02:12.000> tank<00:02:12.480> this

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
now on to the maneuverability tank this

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.970 
now on to the maneuverability tank this
is<00:02:13.530> where<00:02:13.770> it's<00:02:13.980> really<00:02:14.040> bad<00:02:15.140> traverse<00:02:16.140> 36

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
is where it's really bad traverse 36

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.150 
is where it's really bad traverse 36
pretty<00:02:17.460> decent<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.290> 34<00:02:19.290> turret<00:02:19.620> Traverse<00:02:19.890> so

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
pretty decent and 34 turret Traverse so

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.700 
pretty decent and 34 turret Traverse so
Traverse<00:02:20.520> wise<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:21.030> okay<00:02:21.360> but<00:02:22.050> acceleration

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
Traverse wise it's okay but acceleration

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.960 
Traverse wise it's okay but acceleration
and<00:02:22.980> top<00:02:23.370> speed<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.120> really<00:02:24.630> quite<00:02:24.810> awful<00:02:25.970> 190

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
and top speed is really quite awful 190

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.440

really<00:02:33.450> sluggish<00:02:34.430> especially<00:02:35.430> when<00:02:35.520> you

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
really sluggish especially when you

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.980 
really sluggish especially when you

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
compare to the land lease one which is

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.180 
compare to the land lease one which is
about<00:02:37.760> 274<00:02:38.760> horsepower<00:02:39.000> for<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.660> same<00:02:39.840> weight

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
about 274 horsepower for the same weight

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.140 
about 274 horsepower for the same weight
but<00:02:41.660> 224<00:02:42.660> speed<00:02:43.350> limits<00:02:43.800> it<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.340> slow<00:02:44.730> but

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
but 224 speed limits it is slow but

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.690 
but 224 speed limits it is slow but
given<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.780> armor<00:02:46.170> it's<00:02:46.709> okay<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.459> also

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
given the armor it's okay and also

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.760 
given the armor it's okay and also
that's<00:02:48.270> gone<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.660> gun<00:02:48.900> now<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.620> the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
that's gone to the gun now this is the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.060 
that's gone to the gun now this is the
best<00:02:49.980> part<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.340> tank<00:02:50.550> by<00:02:50.730> far<00:02:52.010> okay<00:02:53.010> so

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
best part of the tank by far okay so

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.050 
best part of the tank by far okay so
here<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.430> gun<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:54.950> 121<00:02:55.950> penetration<00:02:56.790> that's

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060
