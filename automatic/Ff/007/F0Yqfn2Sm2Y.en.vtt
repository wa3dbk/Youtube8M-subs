differences with the figure itself so
the<00:01:52.170> concept<00:01:52.530> art<00:01:52.680> doesn't<00:01:53.220> have<00:01:53.430> those<00:01:53.579> green

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
the concept art doesn't have those green

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.609 
the concept art doesn't have those green
gauntlets<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.390> guess<00:01:54.570> cuz<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.350> figure

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
gauntlets I guess cuz the the figure

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.010 
gauntlets I guess cuz the the figure
itself<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.219> overly<00:01:57.119> painted<00:01:57.600> or<00:01:57.840> you

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
itself is just overly painted or you

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.120 
itself is just overly painted or you
know<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.259> just<00:01:58.320> painted<00:01:58.680> with<00:01:58.770> really

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
know it's just painted with really

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.270 
know it's just painted with really
bright<00:01:59.399> colors<00:01:59.790> instead<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:01.020> know

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
bright colors instead of the you know

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.859 
bright colors instead of the you know
more<00:02:02.280> grittier<00:02:02.759> darker<00:02:03.270> colors<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
more grittier darker colors that the

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.999 
more grittier darker colors that the
Arkham<00:02:04.290> game<00:02:04.649> style<00:02:05.070> has<00:02:06.259> so<00:02:07.259> yeah<00:02:07.649> we<00:02:07.829> don't

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
Arkham game style has so yeah we don't

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.710 
Arkham game style has so yeah we don't
really<00:02:08.129> see<00:02:08.459> those<00:02:08.700> green<00:02:09.060> gauntlets<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.660> he

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
really see those green gauntlets that he

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.240 
really see those green gauntlets that he
has<00:02:09.840> but<00:02:10.080> we<00:02:10.170> do<00:02:10.319> see<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.590> he<00:02:10.770> has<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.069> yellow

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
has but we do see that he has the yellow

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.250 
has but we do see that he has the yellow
cape<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.879> that's<00:02:12.090> not<00:02:12.270> on<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.569> figure<00:02:13.080> I

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
cape and that's not on the figure I

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.470 
cape and that's not on the figure I
guess<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.010> just<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.310> kind<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.640> more<00:02:14.940> lazily

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
guess this is just a kind of more lazily

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.540 
guess this is just a kind of more lazily
created<00:02:16.170> figure<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.920> can<00:02:17.040> really<00:02:17.310> tell<00:02:17.520> when

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
created figure you can really tell when

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.280 
created figure you can really tell when
you<00:02:17.790> look<00:02:17.970> at<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.239> figure<00:02:18.569> that<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.050> was<00:02:19.140> just

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
you look at the figure that it was just

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.150 
you look at the figure that it was just
like

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
like

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.280 
like
sat<00:02:20.790> in<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:20.970> basement<00:02:21.180> for<00:02:21.630> about<00:02:21.780> an<00:02:21.900> hour<00:02:22.020> or

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
sat in a basement for about an hour or

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.140 
sat in a basement for about an hour or
two<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.590> they<00:02:22.680> were<00:02:22.710> like<00:02:22.890> okay<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:23.160> gotta<00:02:23.430> take

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
two and they were like okay I gotta take

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.970 
two and they were like okay I gotta take
this<00:02:24.330> design<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.870> make<00:02:24.990> a<00:02:25.020> friggin<00:02:25.620> action

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
this design to make a friggin action

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.950 
this design to make a friggin action
figure<00:02:26.190> out<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.490> it<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.730> guess<00:02:26.970> but<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.840> know

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
figure out of it I guess but you know

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.720 
figure out of it I guess but you know
the<00:02:28.110> concept<00:02:28.470> art<00:02:28.620> would<00:02:28.860> be<00:02:28.890> more<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.610> the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
the concept art would be more of the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.000 
the concept art would be more of the
basis<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.270> go<00:02:30.450> on<00:02:30.630> towards<00:02:31.140> what<00:02:31.320> Robin<00:02:31.740> looks

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
basis to go on towards what Robin looks

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.130 
basis to go on towards what Robin looks
like<00:02:32.250> in<00:02:32.490> Arkham<00:02:33.150> Knight<00:02:33.330> rather<00:02:33.780> than<00:02:34.020> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
like in Arkham Knight rather than the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.930 
like in Arkham Knight rather than the
figure<00:02:34.350> itself<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:35.160> figure<00:02:35.430> itself<00:02:35.670> looks

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
figure itself the figure itself looks

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.570 
figure itself the figure itself looks
really<00:02:36.210> really<00:02:36.990> bright<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.500> kind<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.280> ugly

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
really really bright and kind of ugly

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.400 
really really bright and kind of ugly
I'm<00:02:39.090> sorry<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.480> don't<00:02:39.660> really<00:02:39.810> like<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.140> figure

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
I'm sorry I don't really like the figure

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.710 
I'm sorry I don't really like the figure
but<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.100> design<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.820> concept<00:02:42.270> art<00:02:42.360> on<00:02:42.570> the

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
but the design the concept art on the

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.200 
but the design the concept art on the
box<00:02:42.900> itself<00:02:43.230> let's<00:02:43.710> talk<00:02:43.890> about<00:02:44.040> this<00:02:44.280> looks

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
box itself let's talk about this looks

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.610 
box itself let's talk about this looks
freakin<00:02:45.930> awesome

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
freakin awesome

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.640 
freakin awesome
now<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.370> can<00:02:47.580> almost<00:02:47.970> right<00:02:48.720> away<00:02:48.900> tell<00:02:49.200> some

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
now you can almost right away tell some

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.200 
now you can almost right away tell some
of<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.800> differences<00:02:50.340> in<00:02:50.550> where<00:02:50.700> he<00:02:50.880> looks<00:02:51.120> a

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
of the differences in where he looks a

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.390 
of the differences in where he looks a
little<00:02:51.420> more<00:02:51.540> armoured<00:02:52.110> in<00:02:52.320> his<00:02:52.830> chest<00:02:53.070> area

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
little more armoured in his chest area

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.030 
little more armoured in his chest area
in<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.670> shoulder<00:02:54.090> area<00:02:54.470> where<00:02:55.470> in<00:02:55.680> Arkham

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
in the shoulder area where in Arkham

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.910 
in the shoulder area where in Arkham
City<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.640> was<00:02:56.940> kind<00:02:57.210> of<00:02:57.300> just<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.900> know<00:02:57.930> just<00:02:58.800> a

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
City it was kind of just you know just a

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.340 
City it was kind of just you know just a
regular<00:02:59.250> suit<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.970> was<00:03:00.030> just<00:03:00.210> a<00:03:00.300> regular<00:03:00.420> suit

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
regular suit it was just a regular suit

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.660 
regular suit it was just a regular suit
that<00:03:01.500> he<00:03:01.620> ran<00:03:01.800> around<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.370> know<00:03:02.490> well

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
that he ran around and you know well

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.070 
that he ran around and you know well
this<00:03:02.880> time<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.150> guess<00:03:03.450> they're<00:03:03.630> kind<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:03.840> going

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
this time I guess they're kind of going

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.260 
this time I guess they're kind of going
in<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.350> theme<00:03:04.590> where<00:03:05.130> Batman's<00:03:05.640> new<00:03:05.880> suit<00:03:06.150> is

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
in the theme where Batman's new suit is

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.540 
in the theme where Batman's new suit is
really<00:03:06.570> heavily<00:03:06.930> armored<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:07.890> guess<00:03:08.070> Robin

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
really heavily armored so I guess Robin

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.640 
really heavily armored so I guess Robin
got<00:03:08.730> some<00:03:08.940> upgrades<00:03:09.330> as<00:03:09.480> well<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:10.020> got<00:03:10.410> some

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
got some upgrades as well and got some

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.450 
got some upgrades as well and got some
armor<00:03:10.890> on<00:03:11.160> his<00:03:11.700> costume<00:03:12.000> as<00:03:12.480> well<00:03:12.740> the<00:03:13.740> upper

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
armor on his costume as well the upper

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.160 
armor on his costume as well the upper
chest<00:03:14.730> area<00:03:14.910> seems<00:03:15.330> a<00:03:15.420> lot<00:03:15.570> more<00:03:15.600> armored<00:03:16.140> than

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
chest area seems a lot more armored than

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.950 
chest area seems a lot more armored than
the<00:03:16.410> you<00:03:16.740> know<00:03:16.860> lower<00:03:17.460> abdomen<00:03:17.910> area<00:03:18.240> so<00:03:18.690> I

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
the you know lower abdomen area so I

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.880 
the you know lower abdomen area so I
don't<00:03:19.200> know<00:03:19.260> what's<00:03:19.440> up<00:03:19.530> with<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.650> maybe

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
don't know what's up with that maybe

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.320 
don't know what's up with that maybe
it's<00:03:20.040> kind<00:03:20.160> of<00:03:20.280> like<00:03:20.430> Batman's<00:03:20.850> armor<00:03:21.150> where

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
it's kind of like Batman's armor where

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.970 
it's kind of like Batman's armor where
the<00:03:21.810> bat<00:03:22.050> symbol<00:03:22.290> was<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.590> most<00:03:22.770> heavily

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
the bat symbol was the most heavily

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.070 
the bat symbol was the most heavily
armored<00:03:23.460> place<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.970> maybe<00:03:24.720> it's<00:03:24.900> kind<00:03:25.020> of

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
armored place and maybe it's kind of
