back up after we excavate back out here
with<00:00:34.530> insulation<00:00:35.030> piping<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.329> then<00:00:36.719> work

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
with insulation piping and then work

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.270 
with insulation piping and then work
ourselves<00:00:37.290> back<00:00:37.440> up<00:00:37.469> eventually<00:00:37.890> will<00:00:38.130> we<00:00:38.190> do

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
ourselves back up eventually will we do

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.470 
ourselves back up eventually will we do
the<00:00:38.370> concrete<00:00:38.579> pour<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.149> that's<00:00:39.300> gonna<00:00:39.390> be

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
the concrete pour so that's gonna be

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.610 
the concrete pour so that's gonna be
starting<00:00:39.690> here<00:00:39.810> in<00:00:39.990> the<00:00:40.050> next<00:00:40.230> couple<00:00:40.440> weeks

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.710 
starting here in the next couple weeks
and<00:00:41.070> then<00:00:41.550> we'll<00:00:41.670> probably<00:00:41.760> looking<00:00:42.150> for<00:00:42.450> our

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
and then we'll probably looking for our

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.410 
and then we'll probably looking for our
actual<00:00:43.200> ice<00:00:43.890> floor<00:00:44.340> probably<00:00:44.880> sometime<00:00:45.300> right

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
actual ice floor probably sometime right

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.790

the Penguins locker room area during the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.850 
the Penguins locker room area during the
early<00:01:42.420> stage<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:42.900> project<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.590> was<00:01:43.650> a<00:01:43.710> lot

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
early stage of this project it was a lot

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.500 
early stage of this project it was a lot
of<00:01:43.890> discussions<00:01:44.400> about<00:01:44.460> what<00:01:44.790> size<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.299> room

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
of discussions about what size this room

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.240 
of discussions about what size this room
needed<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.869> be<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.200> know<00:01:46.799> hockey<00:01:46.979> operations

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
needed to be I know hockey operations

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.460 
needed to be I know hockey operations
and<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.390> think<00:01:48.600> even<00:01:48.810> some<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.110> players<00:01:49.320> may

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
and I think even some of the players may

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.380 
and I think even some of the players may
have<00:01:49.619> some<00:01:49.770> input<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.790> ultimate<00:01:51.150> size

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
have some input in in the ultimate size

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.700

of this you want it big enough so they

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.810
