00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
the tactical insertion on nobody thinks

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.490 
the tactical insertion on nobody thinks
to<00:01:34.229> see<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> tactical<00:01:35.460> insertion<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.500> van

really really really really overpowered
that<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.240> can't<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:20.350> can<00:02:20.500> see<00:02:20.890> them<00:02:21.070> now<00:02:21.100> or

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
that you can't you can see them now or

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.950 
that you can't you can see them now or
you<00:02:21.670> can<00:02:22.980> dodge<00:02:23.980> them<00:02:24.250> get<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.730> nice<00:02:24.960> skewer

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
you can dodge them get a nice skewer

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.220 
you can dodge them get a nice skewer
there<00:02:29.280> then<00:02:30.280> come<00:02:30.640> back<00:02:30.670> upstairs<00:02:31.420> again<00:02:31.660> you

that<00:03:25.570> I<00:03:25.690> expect<00:03:26.200> with<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.650> chopper<00:03:26.920> gunner

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
that I expect with the chopper gunner

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.070 
that I expect with the chopper gunner
here<00:03:30.030> still<00:03:31.030> tearing<00:03:31.390> them<00:03:31.510> up<00:03:31.630> because<00:03:31.810> the

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
here still tearing them up because the

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.010 
here still tearing them up because the
dogs<00:03:32.320> are<00:03:32.500> out<00:03:32.739> I<00:03:33.480> don't<00:03:34.480> know<00:03:34.540> if<00:03:34.630> you<00:03:34.690> can<00:03:34.780> see

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
dogs are out I don't know if you can see

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.720 
dogs are out I don't know if you can see
them<00:03:35.170> at<00:03:35.350> on<00:03:35.590> this<00:03:35.739> matters<00:03:36.130> there<00:03:36.550> they<00:03:36.700> are

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
them at on this matters there they are

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.130 
them at on this matters there they are
running<00:03:37.570> across<00:03:38.670> so<00:03:39.670> I<00:03:40.209> think<00:03:40.780> that's<00:03:41.020> an

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
running across so I think that's an

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.550 
running across so I think that's an
interesting<00:03:41.709> I<00:03:42.100> don't<00:03:42.790> know<00:03:43.530> strategy<00:03:44.530> i

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
interesting I don't know strategy i

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.670 
interesting I don't know strategy i
guess<00:03:44.950> if<00:03:45.550> anyone's<00:03:46.060> tried<00:03:46.300> it<00:03:46.420> before<00:03:46.680> does

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
guess if anyone's tried it before does

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.070 
guess if anyone's tried it before does
it<00:03:47.800> do<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.100> dogs<00:03:48.370> die<00:03:48.670> if<00:03:48.880> you<00:03:49.000> shoot<00:03:49.239> near

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
it do the dogs die if you shoot near

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.650 
it do the dogs die if you shoot near
them<00:03:50.290> I<00:03:50.470> couldn't<00:03:51.220> see<00:03:52.060> if<00:03:52.150> they<00:03:52.270> do<00:03:52.420> or<00:03:52.540> not

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
them I couldn't see if they do or not

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.560 
them I couldn't see if they do or not
but<00:03:53.440> I<00:03:53.800> thought<00:03:54.190> if<00:03:54.400> I<00:03:54.489> had<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:54.820> dogs<00:03:55.060> out<00:03:55.300> at

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
but I thought if I had the dogs out at

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.490 
but I thought if I had the dogs out at
the<00:03:55.810> same<00:03:55.959> time<00:03:56.140> with<00:03:56.290> my<00:03:56.440> chopper<00:03:58.260> that<00:03:59.260> you

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
the same time with my chopper that you

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.840 
the same time with my chopper that you
know<00:03:59.590> if<00:03:59.680> anyone's<00:04:00.010> trying<00:04:00.160> to<00:04:00.280> use<00:04:00.489> the

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
know if anyone's trying to use the

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.620 
know if anyone's trying to use the
rocket<00:04:01.390> launcher<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:04.030> take<00:04:04.209> down<00:04:04.360> the<00:04:04.450> chopper

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
rocket launcher to take down the chopper

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.030 
rocket launcher to take down the chopper
gunner<00:04:04.870> than<00:04:05.110> the<00:04:05.200> dogs<00:04:05.410> would<00:04:05.620> take<00:04:05.800> them

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
gunner than the dogs would take them

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.190 
gunner than the dogs would take them
down<00:04:06.250> if<00:04:06.519> I<00:04:06.640> missed<00:04:06.910> him<00:04:07.060> he's<00:04:07.510> like<00:04:07.660> that<00:04:07.930> guy

might<00:04:16.479> have<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.019> whole<00:04:17.199> duration<00:04:18.190> of<00:04:18.310> that<00:04:18.569> so

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:19.569 
might have the whole duration of that so

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:21.479 
might have the whole duration of that so
I<00:04:19.599> was<00:04:19.780> still<00:04:19.959> alive<00:04:20.169> in<00:04:20.379> that<00:04:20.530> little<00:04:21.220> corner

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
I was still alive in that little corner

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.260 
I was still alive in that little corner
that<00:04:22.210> as<00:04:22.979> five<00:04:23.979> people<00:04:24.430> versus<00:04:24.789> nine<00:04:24.940> people

that as five people versus nine people
at<00:04:25.360> this<00:04:25.479> point<00:04:25.810> it's<00:04:26.650> just<00:04:26.740> as<00:04:27.129> I<00:04:27.280> said<00:04:27.490> it's

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
at this point it's just as I said it's

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.659 
at this point it's just as I said it's
just<00:04:27.909> them<00:04:28.180> I<00:04:28.330> failed<00:04:28.569> the<00:04:28.750> knife<00:04:28.930> there

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
just them I failed the knife there

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.249 
just them I failed the knife there
skewer<00:04:30.669> rather<00:04:30.909> it<00:04:31.509> was<00:04:31.690> just<00:04:31.750> to<00:04:32.050> demonstrate

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
skewer rather it was just to demonstrate

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:37.520 
skewer rather it was just to demonstrate
actually<00:04:33.539> why<00:04:34.539> the<00:04:34.599> knifing<00:04:35.470> is<00:04:35.680> just<00:04:35.919> so<00:04:36.129> bad

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
actually why the knifing is just so bad

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.640 
actually why the knifing is just so bad
you<00:04:38.530> can<00:04:39.150> pretty<00:04:40.150> much<00:04:40.270> get<00:04:41.050> ridiculous

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
you can pretty much get ridiculous

a game where I've just used knife able

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.920 
a game where I've just used knife able
and<00:04:46.900> I<00:04:46.990> haven't<00:04:47.259> used<00:04:47.379> the<00:04:47.620> kill<00:04:47.889> shrieks<00:04:48.190> and

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
as usual you know some servers when you

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.360 
as usual you know some servers when you
go<00:04:52.360> on<00:04:52.509> the<00:04:52.750> theatres<00:04:53.169> disabled<00:04:53.860> or<00:04:54.069> you<00:04:54.250> know

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
go on the theatres disabled or you know

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.180 
go on the theatres disabled or you know
games<00:04:54.639> aren't<00:04:55.300> saved<00:04:55.780> in<00:04:55.930> theatres<00:04:56.379> and<00:04:56.560> then

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
games aren't saved in theatres and then

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.279 
games aren't saved in theatres and then
some<00:04:57.699> other<00:04:57.729> servers<00:04:58.330> the<00:04:58.629> games<00:04:58.840> are<00:04:59.020> saved

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
some other servers the games are saved

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.890 
some other servers the games are saved
and<00:04:59.879> that<00:05:00.879> happened<00:05:01.240> to<00:05:01.270> be<00:05:01.360> in<00:05:01.479> one<00:05:01.719> of<00:05:01.750> those

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
and that happened to be in one of those

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.969 
and that happened to be in one of those
servers<00:05:02.169> where<00:05:03.479> the<00:05:04.479> game<00:05:05.050> wasn't<00:05:05.379> saved<00:05:05.740> so

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
servers where the game wasn't saved so

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.420 
servers where the game wasn't saved so
I'm<00:05:06.159> hoping<00:05:06.639> maybe<00:05:06.940> I<00:05:07.090> could<00:05:07.180> do<00:05:07.870> another

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
I'm hoping maybe I could do another

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.730 
I'm hoping maybe I could do another
ridiculous<00:05:09.659> gameplay<00:05:10.659> to<00:05:11.080> show<00:05:11.259> the

ridiculous gameplay to show the

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.140 
ridiculous gameplay to show the
ridiculous<00:05:12.599> ness<00:05:13.599> of<00:05:13.810> using<00:05:14.259> a<00:05:14.349> knife<00:05:15.150> with

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
ridiculous ness of using a knife with

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.550
