00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
that the easiest way to start doing that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.300 
that the easiest way to start doing that
was<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.340> get<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.030> consistent<00:02:09.929> pattern<00:02:10.170> going<00:02:10.649> so

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310
