00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.169
 can return in case of a hypothetical 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.519
 sixth game while combat 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.539

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.160
 defend your home for 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.260
 to be able to keep this series alive and have 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.000
 any option of champions to is a 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.730
 different party crocodile made the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.100
 adjustments left out of the roster to carl 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.800
 elliot and included ryan forehan kelly and 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.629
 went out to the court as with emmet lang the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.370
 own kelly and also the technician his 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.710
 random knowledge half a minute is a 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.239
 rye 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.040
 despite his injury he did a great 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.750
 I work in driving definitely 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.019
 when you're whole on the court what rotten 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.329
 it runs much better and that today the 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.219
 zancudo also gave some good 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.500
 minutes the rookie josu to the balance on 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.820
 everything at the beginning of the meeting and Miguel 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.729
 rivas also had his chance to 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.399
 play to cut there in driving 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.100
 today it was sent a little bit of the best 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.080
 GMT was more of offensive management but 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.490
 this was used by the sailor to leave it 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.549
 that out of the sun I would like the points 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.149
 left the rest of the 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.149
 team members show 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.380
 I remember was the opportunity to 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.960
 take the game when I was 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.800
 winning by a point missing 25 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.270
 seconds 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.520
 gregory vargas misjudged a free kick that 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.510
 break the match as they recovered 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.750
 the rebound the saurians 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.400
 luis bethelmy lost the ball 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.470
 inexplicably and it was there that 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.030
 I take advantage marine after this is given 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.830
 loss the technician between and baruta asks 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.210
 granma time a play in which 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.550
 ordered Gregory Vargas to attack the 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.260
 basket to then take the ball to the lion 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.300
 Roger who is the best shooter of the team 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.500
 and this one was ready and he forgave us 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.570
 converted the triple that was the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.880
 difference from the crazy party god had his 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.580
 last chance and insisted with him 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.100
 again to be all attacking the hoop 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.200
 but it did not arrive and there the 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.790
 hope of the capital 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.380
 this defeat represents a blow 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.180
 psychological hard for crocodiles 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.570
 because he had the match in his hands he had 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.670
 to the singing at 15 to 25 seconds of stealing 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.380
 a victory here in puerto la cruz and not 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.930
 he did not, so now he's bound 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.300
 to answer at home to have some 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.190
 option to continue fighting for the title 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.500
 otherwise rotten musicians do not 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.750
 they respond their hobby there will be very 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.770
 close to getting a new crown 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.770
 to professional basketball league
