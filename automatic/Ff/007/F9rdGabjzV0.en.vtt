00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
got to work on our NAB's bike from 2013

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.560 
got to work on our NAB's bike from 2013
so<00:00:30.009> it<00:00:31.009> was<00:00:31.160> one<00:00:31.730> of<00:00:31.789> the<00:00:31.880> satisfying<00:00:32.300> things

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
so it was one of the satisfying things

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.350 
so it was one of the satisfying things
it<00:00:32.780> was<00:00:32.870> a<00:00:32.900> real<00:00:33.110> group<00:00:33.410> effort<00:00:33.800> and<00:00:34.000> we<00:00:35.000> we

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
it was a real group effort and we we

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.840 
it was a real group effort and we we
started<00:00:35.810> with<00:00:36.020> the<00:00:36.829> basic<00:00:37.219> idea<00:00:37.370> that<00:00:37.670> we

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
started with the basic idea that we

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.430 
started with the basic idea that we
wanted<00:00:38.149> to<00:00:38.239> build<00:00:38.329> a<00:00:38.510> trail<00:00:38.750> maintenance<00:00:38.989> bike

wanted to build a trail maintenance bike
with<00:00:40.180> talking<00:00:41.180> to<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:41.510> local<00:00:41.840> folks<00:00:42.440> that<00:00:42.710> do

there<00:00:57.500> we<00:00:57.530> we<00:00:58.160> really<00:00:58.399> put<00:00:58.789> a<00:00:58.820> purpose-built

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
there we we really put a purpose-built

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
how we can get to the trail to work on

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.660 
how we can get to the trail to work on
in<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.040> spring<00:01:04.900> with<00:01:06.160> applying<00:01:07.160> what<00:01:07.370> we<00:01:07.490> know

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
in the spring with applying what we know

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.210 
in the spring with applying what we know
and<00:01:07.880> how<00:01:08.000> to<00:01:08.030> manufacture<00:01:08.360> titanium<00:01:09.290> one<00:01:10.159> of

and how to manufacture titanium one of
the<00:01:10.310> fun<00:01:10.460> things<00:01:10.610> was<00:01:10.939> we<00:01:11.150> we<00:01:11.479> built<00:01:11.720> a<00:01:11.810> fork

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
the fun things was we we built a fork

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.960 
the fun things was we we built a fork
for<00:01:12.409> it<00:01:12.590> because<00:01:13.220> we<00:01:13.400> were<00:01:13.460> going<00:01:13.549> to<00:01:13.640> build<00:01:13.820> it

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
for it because we were going to build it

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.039 
for it because we were going to build it
around<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.810> 29<00:01:15.259> plus<00:01:15.650> tire<00:01:15.979> platform<00:01:16.610> which

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
around the 29 plus tire platform which

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.359 
around the 29 plus tire platform which
didn't<00:01:18.049> have<00:01:18.170> a<00:01:18.200> lot<00:01:18.409> of<00:01:18.530> choices<00:01:18.740> but<00:01:18.979> we

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
didn't have a lot of choices but we

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.789 
didn't have a lot of choices but we
wanted<00:01:19.670> something<00:01:19.729> beefy<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:20.570> we<00:01:21.020> don't<00:01:21.259> we

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
wanted something beefy and we don't we

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.160 
wanted something beefy and we don't we
don't<00:01:21.979> build<00:01:22.130> Forks<00:01:22.610> but<00:01:22.820> we<00:01:23.090> just<00:01:23.750> wanted<00:01:24.110> to

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
don't build Forks but we just wanted to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.200 
don't build Forks but we just wanted to
show<00:01:24.350> that<00:01:24.380> we<00:01:24.560> can<00:01:24.829> and<00:01:25.130> then<00:01:25.820> a<00:01:25.850> rack<00:01:26.180> that

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
show that we can and then a rack that

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.380 
show that we can and then a rack that
holds<00:01:26.570> a<00:01:27.170> rogue<00:01:27.829> hoe<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:28.340> our<00:01:28.909> friends<00:01:29.270> at

together and come right off and we found
a<00:01:37.189> good<00:01:37.310> way<00:01:37.460> to<00:01:37.520> mount<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:38.000> rogue<00:01:38.240> hoe<00:01:38.450> we<00:01:38.840> do

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
a good way to mount the rogue hoe we do

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.690 
a good way to mount the rogue hoe we do
keep<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.500> leather<00:01:39.710> sheath<00:01:40.130> on<00:01:40.399> it<00:01:40.549> when

as<00:03:14.640> we<00:03:15.180> built<00:03:15.480> this<00:03:15.599> as<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.900> show<00:03:16.140> bike

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
as we built this as a show bike

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.429 
as we built this as a show bike
originally<00:03:16.980> but<00:03:17.519> what<00:03:18.510> where<00:03:18.900> where<00:03:19.349> it

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:19.439 
originally but what where where it

and getting out to the trailhead is it's
easier<00:03:33.450> we<00:03:33.599> got<00:03:33.750> low<00:03:34.049> enough<00:03:34.260> gears<00:03:34.620> but<00:03:34.920> also

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280
