00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.280
 hello soon divino today we are in 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.469
 harbor and meet the boys of vevey 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.719
 certainly is vegetarian kitchen 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.910
 healthier body we have to believe 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.660
 I do not talk about it for long 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.130
 we do not want that 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.859
 but rather we are doing it 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.430
 because we mediate the food fun 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.750
 can make 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.750
 I have been with myself for four years 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.100
 busy with the vegetarian kitchen 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.060
 and have tested many other things and that 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.000
 I found everything I saw 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.899
 always so boring pasta tofu 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.730
 any vegetables so casseroles 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.129
 vegetarian cuisine goes into mine 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.660
 another point of view that has a lot to do with it 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.260
 color shape and taste in front of everyone 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.300
 to do things 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.980
 I got to know him, and have the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.230
 david sometime said i needed me 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.970
 would like to measure ten minutes and 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.470
 Turn small video and over 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.070
 Vegetarian cuisine is a simple matter 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.230
 it could be 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.790
 and there is suggested I have time 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.820
 maybe you have time let us one 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.530
 Cooking show make a business model 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.719
 we do not have that's why it's one 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.969
 Giant experiment many people ask 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.379
 also a concept and it is easy 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.930
 important that we can do that 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.719
 he likes and not always this 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.280
 rather than convey stock stiffness 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:15.060
 show what we are and live 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.190
 that simple and want to convey things 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.690
 how easy cooking can be like delicious 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.690
 can be vegetarian cuisine 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.939
 By no means do we want to use wtb 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.369
 people want to convert but rather want 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.930
 we show what you can do are 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.670
 but not the people who are now in the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.860
 background and do you say you you 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.960
 have to eat vegetarian and vegan what 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.320
 i like vegan cuisine well 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.189
 I foxed myself and new ones 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.009
 find ways 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.509
 To cook incredibly good dishes so 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.030
 I'm so incredibly on the way 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.830
 sack if this vegan if this vegan 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.900
 kitchen or this vegan way of life like that 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.860
 far goes that one says I had today 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.409
 a vegan dip with vegan bath 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.600
 I would like to talk about wine 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.740
 if i talk about mine i can not 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.840
 talk longer than two sentences because then 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.460
 Just listen to my basic knowledge 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.799
 and I have always been very delighted 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.060
 If people bring us some wine 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.859
 story about this wine 18 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.860
 where does he come from which generation 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.360
 he goes through why why maybe why 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.099
 the son took over the winery and 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.330
 which change processes are there too 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.190
 For example, when I consider myself as a person 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.480
 suppose I have up to half 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.540
 year drunk beer 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.760
 and from now on, as well as crying 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.310
 You can always do some of mine 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.340
 so incredibly cool and russians 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.599
 cry so that drinks so that likes 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.660
 stuffy klingmann says he has one 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.920
 certain elegance brings with it and 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.269
 if you drink good wine then you have 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.819
 not the same tomorrow 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.250
 typical beer belly or as well as are head 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.239
 that I am a good wine now in 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.670
 I also learned the moment 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.120
 I would drink a sparkling wine and 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.500
 Although that's great because I think so 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.060
 is a good alternative to this 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.970
 all Schickimicki bubbly shit 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.859
 but you can pay him he is 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.750
 compatible and so incredible 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.599
 delicious so I have a crime 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.430
 met 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:04.430
 I do not know how it 's always called 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.880
 it but I could do quickly 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.079
 look to the right that I can 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.069
 should not pronounce in the camera 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.750
 hold cremonesi cremona jesse is here 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.630
 maybe just some 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.359
 winters dedicated to his lady or 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.780
 his dog i hope his lady that 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.780
 makes sense to me
