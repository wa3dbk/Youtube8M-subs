00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.299
 unknown but very valuable are the rock paintings that houses the 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.550
 monte valonsadero of the soriana capital representations of schematic art 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:17.240
 that supposedly took place between 3 thousand and 1800 before Christ 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.410
 fundamentally in sound of pastors of pastoral groups that the one who lived 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.970
 in the mountainous areas that would defend these areas 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.939
 looking for pasture costs 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.059
 who as much of summer as fundamentally although in some 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:31.259
 specific moments 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.310
 but this time it is boyal pasture that we have here defaulted at one point 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.510
 that was practiced 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.490
 for all groups in the northern zone where populations would be 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.530
 Mythical Neolithic Gonçalo Sale and Year Stalls 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.730
 and that in this one to the territory of those of the Iberian Peninsula 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.840
 emiliana develop widely in what is called the ancient bronze itself 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.330
 There are 35 stations in which you can observe different hunting scenes 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.840
 primitive identification of places 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.560
 and schematic drawings of everyday life 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.930
 although some of them have not yet been able to be different 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.950
 in that cultural period where the artistic forms that are 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.640
 purely schemes 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.870
 that's why we call schematic art because they are actually drawings 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.070
 children 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.630
 until some acts 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.140
 Per hundred we can identify some of the reasons why 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.630
 in the elements themselves remind us of the permits we know and there 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.010
 other executives rather 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.479
 until his sixth 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.550
 which is practically impossible 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.960
 which are almost always adorned with certain rituals with certain 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.650
 symbolic elements a very important part of the schemes make 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.350
 allusion 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.060
 there are elements of everyday life 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.100
 these people 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.740
 in such a way that we do not count hunting scenes at the end of this month of 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.700
 harvest 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.980
 some other ridiculous scene insisted 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.910
 that this population would be fundamentally pastori 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.880
 and career in such a way that 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.820
 the session representations 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.220
 they allude to these uses to these customs much more than agriculture 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.950
 that would be rudimentary 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.970
 and surely imagined 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.090
 but still in two friends some friends 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.659
 A &amp; B is that they can remind us that these people also 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.350
 I would use poultry 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.360
 percent a clear connection with livestock 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.359
 and with 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.649
 and with grazing 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:25.209
 this form of rock art was discovered in the 1930s 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.530
 probably by the teacher of a tender order but it was not until 1951 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.670
 when it is made known to public opinion corteo genes ertegün el 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.249
 field newspaper soria 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:37.979
 I write myself 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:42.309
 because the neglect of the paintings because that's the way it was ugly ugly sense of 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:45.129
 fact that offers hotels the first he wrote about paintings 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.060
 and to which they are always attributed and that in the small ones the truth is that the 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:50.109
 News 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.529
 that some or all of the coats gave them 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:53.769
 could convert 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.989
 that was always hot and what did not say until October these years before 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:58.399
 die 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:59.829
 I knew it when 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.539
 an order that was not 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:03.499
 He did not like the beech 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:07.599
 sick they were not but obviously he was retired they were not 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.849
 disappointed because he never wanted any kind of role but never 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.889
 that it is true that when the public rural box percent in the titles of 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.569
 valonsadero in my book the paintings I think is the brother of Fernando Alonso 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:20.779
 in your enviroment 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:23.779
 because it left a record of deposit and 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:30.079
 however until his discovery of the paintings have suffered not only for 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.850
 the inclement weather 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.049
 but also in the morning 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.099
 the paintings have suffered 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.379
 they have gone up more 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:38.489
 for the option 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.829
 anthropic say by man's action 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.579
 for the citizen who has arrived is to fire posts 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:44.950
 at the foot of the coats 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.229
 or have seen some 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:49.529
 the signs 1 some of the figures 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:54.099
 and thinking how good that the previous visitor to that place in the 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.829
 he did so he has also put south his note and his discretion those have been the 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.249
 major damage canteli these paintings 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:05.559
 hence, in 1982 the city council then that existed in the city of 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:06.169
 soria 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.169
 in Spain the increase of democratic unity and if I remember correctly 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.349
 he even paid attention to these complaints in the places 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.839
 main casualties were those stories it was predicted that people 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.349
 I did not know exactly what there was 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.830
 and how people like our ancestors are not fools produce 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.259
 to make chops or to take refuge in one's own 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.330
 and the same we both look for place now after the athlete is appropriate alba and 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.999
 warren or climate 

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:36.180
 the citizens of all would do the same to paint their 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.919
 in its sector it is in assumption among all its forms well I insist because 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.919
 there are elements that we do not know to what extent ch 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.840
 Mount Valonsadero hosts an unknown wealth for many of the 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.710
 sorianos 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.900
 It's worth going over and discovering what our ancestors left us 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.319
 oxide base and natural materials 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:00.529
 an important legacy that puts Valonsadero at the head of enclaves 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:03.930
 most significant cave paintings then
