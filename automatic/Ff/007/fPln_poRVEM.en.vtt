 Pigmentation extraction of carotenes 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.960
 in the carrots 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.950
 objective to show the extraction of 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.690
 pigments in the carrots through 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.690
 an experiment in model systems 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.770
 the quality of the food has two 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.880
 fundamental components one 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.340
 related to the aspects 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.380
 technological and other related to the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.470
 security and acceptance by the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.410
 Based on this consumer appears 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.850
 concept of functionality of which in 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.980
 function of the type of interaction 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.020
 produced can distinguish the internal 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.840
 which are physical properties fractions 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.610
 structures etcetera of the external one that 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.040
 that aspect and the quality that that 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.230
 interaction with the consumer in 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.300
 recent years has acquired a remarkable 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.920
 importance another exception of the term 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.690
 related to properties 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.210
 physiological of certain components 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.769
 whose use has repercussions 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.920
 beneficial to the health of the 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.350
 consumer has appeared accordingly 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.060
 a new category of food 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.310
 functional foods to which roberts 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.560
 oit has defined as a food that 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.720
 contains a food component already 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.060
 whether nutrient or not with selective effect 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.280
 on one or more functions of the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.010
 organism whose positive effects 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.439
 justify that it can be claimed that 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.700
 it is functional physiological or even 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.409
 healthy 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.390
 the concept of functionality 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.899
 from the point of view of coquinas and 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.819
 collaborators 1993 is the answer 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.979
 specific to the food versus 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:41.119
 set of forces applied during 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.219
 the processed preparation processes 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:48.780
 storage and consumption according to lawrence 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:50.520
 and collaborators 1998 is the expression and 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.189
 participation of physical properties 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.229
 and physicochemical in relation to 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.539
 sensory properties of food 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.369
 that contain the components that 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.099
 they have a greater involvement are 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.319
 obviously the macromolecules that are 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:06.209
 carbohydrates and proteins like 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.459
 consequence of different types of 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:10.349
 interaction with the water molecules of 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.480
 the interaction between them or with 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.590
 other polar molecules or with a 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.230
 gas phase 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.430
 The following are classified 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.019
 functional properties of 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.019
 macromolecules according to the order 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.739
 carotenes are not a large group 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.170
 of pigments very widespread in the 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.000
 Vegetable and animal kingdoms produce colors 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.579
 that range from yellow to red 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.290
 intense the generic name derives from the 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.030
 carrots broken cars since 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.220
 you can update these laurent by 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.099
 first time they are in fruits and 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.620
 vegetables like tomato carrot pineapples and 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.110
 citrus flowers you eat in steps and the 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.000
 Sunflower seeds like I some 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.359
 well three animals with my pen that 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.340
 Flemish and canary among others 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.530
 carotenoids belong to the class by 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.720
 full long chains with two ligatures 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.760
 with plays whose presence explains the 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.319
 intense color of the carotenoids since 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.810
 the conjugated systems present 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.790
 positional resonance what produces a 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.590
 electronic offshoring and so 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.730
 both absorb what energy there is 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.340
 result the color 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.379
 chemically the carotenoids are divided 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.569
 in two groups the characters that are 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:22.360
 hydrocarbons and their self rows 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.459
 oxygenated derivatives the carotenes are 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.500
 Very soluble in petroleum ether and focus 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.590
 in this girlfriend among these stand out the 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.739
 alpha beta and gamma carotenes and the 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.959
 lycopene beta-carotene is perhaps the 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.349
 carotenoids of greater importance in the 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.879
 food technology unlike 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.799
 of other fruits and vegetables 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.569
 tomatoes and carrots present a 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.180
 more carotenes than from sant 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.459
 or batteries the linear structure lycopene 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.160
 open is responsible for the color red 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.140
 of tomatoes on the other hand the color 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.440
 of the carrot is by the largest amount 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.420
 of beta-carotene 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.580
 because the carotenoids are 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.890
 soluble in lipids or insolvent as 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.960
 Hexane or petroleum ether are obtained 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.340
 by extractive methods the 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.350
 carotenoids has a structure 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.510
 unsaturated by those who are subject to 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.770
 numerous chemical changes induced by 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.080
 the different conditions of 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.030
 processing as they become saturated 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.519
 the double bonds and finally 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.709
 break the characteristic color 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.030
 disappears the carotenoids are used 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.520
 in a variety of products 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.210
 water based foods like juices 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.310
 refreshments soups pasta gelatin desserts 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.550
 confectionery and bakery 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.710
 meat substitute meat products a 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.350
 triglycerides base like margarines 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.530
 vegetable oils and shortening butter 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.330
 cheeses and dairy products and added to 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.110
 feeding birds to improve the 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.880
 skin color and yolk 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.790
 to carry out the extraction of 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.070
 carotenoids you need a scalpel a 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.740
 10 milliliter test tube an agitator 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.860
 glass a spatula a universal support 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.530
 a column for chromatography a 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.200
 volumetric pipette of 10 milliliters three 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.870
 150 milliliter beakers 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.780
 a separating funnel and three tubes of 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.850
 Equipment testing requires a 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.340
 grill heating material 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.240
 biological 5 grams of fresh carrot 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:20.630
 of reagents 20 milliliters of ethanol at 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:23.060
 95% 4.5 milliliters of distilled water 20 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.600
 milliliters of acetone and 10 grams of 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.600
 alumina 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.139
 first they were bitten and they passed 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:35.960
 10 grams of carrot to extract the 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:38.330
 pigments was heated in 5000 liters of 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.479
 95% alcohol in a glass of 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.360
 precipitates of 150 milliliters to a 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:46.490
 temperature not higher than 60 degrees due 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.349
 to these pigments soluble slightly 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.930
 in ethanol and the boiling point is 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:53.719
 under re re extracted with five others 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.550
 milliliters of 95% alcohol previously 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:57.159
 heated until the extract of 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:01.350
 carrot has remained practically 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:03.660
 colorless and gathered the extracts 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.490
 a yellow solution was obtained 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.430
 orange showing the presence of 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.280
 holy ranks and carotenes warmed the 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.380
 yellow solution and diluted 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:16.410
 approximately 85% of alcohol with 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:19.750
 4.5 milliliters of distilled water after 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:22.120
 It is done to cool to room temperature 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.830
 to separate these pigments the 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.050

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:30.090
 10,000 liters of acetone allowing 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.090
 rest to make visible the two phases 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.080
 in the organic phase, some 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.270
 carotenes by means of washes and in the 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.560
 thing to the anto rows that afterwards 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.960
 discarded because it was not the 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.880
 product of interest was dissolved received 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.570
 in two minutes of acetone before passing 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.570
 to the column 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:53.879
 10 grams of aluminum were dissolved in 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:55.289
 95% ethanol to coat and 

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:58.740
 introduced in the column for 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:07:00.749
 chromatography the sample was introduced 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.580
 by a pasteur pipette and it was allowed 

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:05.819
 stand to observe the separation of 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.559
 carotenes when performing the separation of 

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:09.899
 carotenoids by the chromatography method 

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:13.379
 in column they were able to obtain the three
