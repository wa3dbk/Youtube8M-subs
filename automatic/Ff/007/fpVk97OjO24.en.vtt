00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:03.650
 hello I'm a ness lake monster 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.240
 and in this video I'll tell you 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.709
 Why do you think the cash box is poorly visited? 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.370
 I was particularly elected on Wednesday 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.180
 in which I was the only person present in the auction 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.929
 beyond the auction house block 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:18.070
 he died 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.890
 It was just for me, she said. 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.460
 each one must touch the edict 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.819
 it's just you tell me when you want to buy 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:28.130
 Good year, if it proved to be more for me. 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.189
 this seems like a good place because they do business 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:33.790
 so come on 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.320
 this reminds me 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.240
 a trip that I have opportunity to do with the city of florianópolis 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.800
 from there I went on the big beach 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.940
 to judge 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.010
 simply wonderful paradisiac incredibly beautiful 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.320
 in contact with the light the problem but never with a bottleneck with 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.170
 potential said 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.830
 Maya is simply not explored, there are no houses nearby. 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.030
 there is no commerce nearby 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.369
 and then went to find out first 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.250
 the place is inside an ecological reserve 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.620
 if it can not then it can be explored accordingly 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.250
 second 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.799
 is exactly this is just the lack of civilization 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.590
 that such a greater contact with the person who goes there with nature gives a 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.090
 charm of the place with exactly this 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.219
 and so 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.860
 this escape from civilization that gave us a place 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.620
 This reminded me 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.150
 the federal savings bank auctions 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.000
 when I started to follow the cashier's trades I came across 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.390
 situations like the one with an aunt described 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.460
 previously I arrive at the auction there is no one just would only be there 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.429
 I thought 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:47.420
 each 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.220
 It can not be 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.670
 box auction charm 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.450
 and went looking for why that 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.130
 his team the first contact with the decree-law 70 that is the decree that he 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.510
 that I reacted to the auctions of the federal economic box 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.110
 this decree was created on January 21, 1976 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.709
 especially irritated by the prayer that this decree-law 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:13.829
 it was the lender's agencies 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.310
 bce buys unpaid debt 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.759
 without the intervention of the judiciary 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:25.109
 this made the execution process much more agile he could make a 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.559
 extrajudicial execution 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:32.919
 the borrowers or the people yourself if you had a debt to the lender 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.520
 even tried 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:42.229
 twenty-two years after it was created 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:46.619
 they argued that if execution should rather go through the power 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:50.549
 because in this way they would have more right to ample defense 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.650
 that they did not have 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.299
 at the reception with her as was done 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.779
 the way he's gone said the hall 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:03.689
 but there is this fight after going to the last of the last instance 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:07.759
 the supreme court or the supreme federal court 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:09.520
 decided 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.030
 emphasized decree-law 70 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.579
 that is, I found position 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.889
 they claimed that executing this officer the way she was not 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.049
 hurt you 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.439
 no one you were already correct 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:25.770
 and this has brought great legal support 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.510
 the auctions will be made seven were governed by the one by this decree 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.759
 and another very important thing that this dish said that this decree law said 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:38.139
 have here 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.340
 the lender 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.710
 before resuming the property 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.550
 and pass the property to his name should give chance 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:50.079
 for other people to buy this property was being resumed 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.739
 and how do you deal with this chance? 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.489
 through auctions 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.449
 So Lindsay should take her where he died. 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:59.789
 2 billion 

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:03.029
 first to the first auction 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:07.519
 if the property was not sold at this first auction he should then 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.090
 take a died to the background obviously are paulo was finished 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:15.269
 in the first auction there would be no need to carry the second is not 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.039
 second half 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.919
 property was still not paid by a third 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.719
 person or 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:26.960
 who needs 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.919
 finally involved in the process there 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.059
 the lender for example the federal savings bank 

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:38.589
 the victim fell to the ground and would vote again 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.780
 so when there has been little new partnership 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.040
 technician this technique we hit the federal savings bank 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.939
 and then yes once the new technique even her name 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:53.939
 she could sell it as she saw fit 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.819
 as for example through his real estate fair 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:58.830
 obidos 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.419
 you must have seen 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.939
 and it public bids or even through direct sale on the website 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:08.189
 of the federal savings bank itself 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:10.020
 so even so 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.180
 that you do not like box auction advertisements 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.379
 a grand jury in circulation as 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:18.710
 television 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.699
 or even sites of the economic box itself because because on the ground the 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:23.629
 immobile 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:26.899
 if two leads are to be treated as in a third party that the 

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:29.110
 property is not technically what it is then 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.189
 she can not simply divulge defending as she is very smart 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.350
 but nevertheless when woke up found to succeed it 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.330
 I can not disclose yet 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.110
 I do not believe that, for example, you've already seen 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.199
 is so paying the cashier's real estate malls on television by 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:48.800
 example 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.889
 so this is one of the factors that make this type of auction ie the auctions 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:01.010
 health and social benefits of the federal savings bank a good place but to do business 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.229
 good guys, I would like to thank you again 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.550
 by the time you gave me enough in my son 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.169
 and if you liked this video you can trust all the videos that I 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:21.139
 I've already done about an auction and all that I'm still going to do on my site that 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:23.849
 It's the www prolegômenos dot 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:25.490
 dot com 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.629
 so that's it and until the next month
