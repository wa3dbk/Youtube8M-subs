a<00:00:34.020> decent<00:00:34.530> year<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.010> Greece<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.579> then<00:00:35.910> you

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
a decent year in Greece and then you

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.020 
a decent year in Greece and then you
know<00:00:37.050> sort<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:38.040> go<00:00:38.160> back<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.579> my<00:00:38.700> Russian

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
along a single sort of the best option

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.420 
along a single sort of the best option
for<00:00:45.149> me<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.450> come<00:00:45.629> back<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.079> just<00:00:46.950> play<00:00:47.190> and
