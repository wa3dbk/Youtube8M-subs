00:00:00.252 --> 00:00:04.205
(joyful music)

00:00:05.324 --> 00:00:06.191
- Hey friends,

00:00:06.191 --> 00:00:06.725
- Hey everyone!

00:00:06.725 --> 00:00:08.493
- Thank you so much for
tuning in to Tasty Tuesday,

00:00:08.493 --> 00:00:10.128
today I'm going to show you guys

00:00:10.128 --> 00:00:11.763
how to make Tomato Bisque,

00:00:11.763 --> 00:00:14.033
this is a Food Network recipe that I found

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:15.534
but I kind of changed it up a bit,

00:00:15.534 --> 00:00:16.736
so I hope you guys enjoy!

00:00:16.736 --> 00:00:17.569
Let's get started.

00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:19.170
In a large pot, melt butter.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.273
Once the butter has melted, you're ready

00:00:21.273 --> 00:00:24.675
to add bacon, and saute
for about a minute or so,

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:26.845
and you're ready to add your chopped up

00:00:26.845 --> 00:00:29.715
onions, as well as your chopped up celery,

00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:32.651
minced garlic, as well as carrots.

00:00:32.651 --> 00:00:36.879
(mellow music)

00:00:38.056 --> 00:00:40.375
Next you're ready to add the flour.

00:00:43.095 --> 00:00:45.897
Pour one can of peeled
tomatoes, with the sauce.

00:00:45.897 --> 00:00:49.034
Also chicken broth as well.

00:00:49.034 --> 00:00:51.202
Now you're ready to add

00:00:51.202 --> 00:00:55.123
bay leaf, thyme, and parsley.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.443
You're going to put that into a boil,

00:00:58.443 --> 00:01:00.211
and once it's boiled,
you're ready to simmer

00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:02.414
for about 40 minutes,
and once it's cooled,

00:01:02.414 --> 00:01:05.014
you're ready to blend it gradually.

00:01:06.185 --> 00:01:09.221
(mellow music)

00:01:09.221 --> 00:01:11.789
Strain the soup so that
you don't get any chunks.

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:16.162
Now you're ready to
put it back in the pot,

00:01:16.162 --> 00:01:18.613
and whisk with heavy cream.

00:01:21.232 --> 00:01:23.018
Make sure to heat that up again.

00:01:25.604 --> 00:01:28.072
After heating it up,
you're ready to serve,

00:01:28.072 --> 00:01:28.406
and I made bread with it, enjoy.

00:01:28.406 --> 00:01:31.176
You can sprinkle basil, and more bacon.

00:01:31.176 --> 00:01:34.947
It's ready, and ooh, those
bacon bits look good.

00:01:34.947 --> 00:01:37.983
- Oh my gosh, this looks like so amazing.

00:01:37.983 --> 00:01:39.685
- Oh yeah, and you can also
have it with bread if you like.

00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:42.006
- This is like one of my
favorite things, I love it.

00:01:44.996 --> 00:01:48.193
Oh my lord, this is so good.

00:01:48.193 --> 00:01:50.895
- It was even good before the heavy cream,

00:01:50.895 --> 00:01:52.997
'cause I tasted it before the heavy cream,

00:01:52.997 --> 00:01:54.466
and I'm like, it's good
without the heavy cream,

00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:56.834
but it's better with the heavy cream.

00:01:56.834 --> 00:01:58.170
Oh, with the bread...

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.239
- Mmm!

00:01:59.239 --> 00:01:59.905
(laughing)

00:01:59.905 --> 00:02:00.972
This is not an exaggeration.

00:02:00.972 --> 00:02:03.408
This soup.

00:02:03.408 --> 00:02:06.948
Is there any better combination
than like warm soup,

00:02:06.948 --> 00:02:08.546
and dipping it with bread, you guys?

00:02:08.546 --> 00:02:09.481
Seriously, I don't...

00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:11.549
for fall especially, on
a cold day, rainy day,

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.751
there's nothing better than that.

00:02:13.751 --> 00:02:15.254
I don't know why, I just love the flavors

00:02:15.254 --> 00:02:16.557
in tomato bisque so much.

00:02:16.557 --> 00:02:17.322
- That's awesome.

00:02:17.322 --> 00:02:18.623
- This is so delicious,
honey, this is like

00:02:18.623 --> 00:02:20.525
legit, homemade, epicness.

00:02:20.525 --> 00:02:22.493
- Thank you, thank you kindly.

00:02:22.493 --> 00:02:23.428
- Mmm!

00:02:23.428 --> 00:02:25.630
- You guys, the bread
recipe is in the info box,

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.331
I used the bread machine to use it.

00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:31.971
You can feed daddy but
Liam eats pureed foods.

00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:33.137
Here, feed daddy.

00:02:33.137 --> 00:02:34.439
- Mmm.

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.342
- Yay, good job.

00:02:36.342 --> 00:02:37.142
(laughs)

00:02:37.142 --> 00:02:38.344
Thank you guys so much for watching,

00:02:38.344 --> 00:02:39.545
give this video a like if you enjoyed

00:02:39.545 --> 00:02:41.246
this video, we'll see
you guys next time, bye.

00:02:41.246 --> 00:02:44.616
- And I'm placing more of that pie crust

00:02:44.616 --> 00:02:48.620
on top of one another,
in a criss cross manner.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.959
I'm cutting off the ends with my fingers,

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.834
and making sure it sticks
to the pie pan like that.
