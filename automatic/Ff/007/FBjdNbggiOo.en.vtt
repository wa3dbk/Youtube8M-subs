from a previous video now I did say in

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
their previous video that if you

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.689 
their previous video that if you
deviations<00:00:28.470> break<00:00:28.710> out<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.130> ramp<00:00:29.340> you

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
deviations break out on the ramp you

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.099 
deviations break out on the ramp you
will<00:00:29.820> don't<00:00:29.910> wrestle<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.449> your<00:00:30.570> entrance<00:00:30.869> gate

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
will don't wrestle in your entrance gate

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.479 
will don't wrestle in your entrance gate
for<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.349> rest<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> match<00:00:31.890> well<00:00:32.369> that

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
for the rest of the match well that

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.040 
for the rest of the match well that
actually<00:00:32.730> turns<00:00:32.910> out<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.360> not<00:00:33.510> quite<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
actually turns out to not quite be the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.260 
actually turns out to not quite be the
case<00:00:34.320> because<00:00:34.860> apparently<00:00:35.460> what<00:00:35.700> happens<00:00:36.059> is

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
case because apparently what happens is

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.270 
case because apparently what happens is
that<00:00:36.329> after<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.870> entrance<00:00:37.170> breakout<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:38.070> can

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
that after the entrance breakout you can

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.920 
that after the entrance breakout you can
then<00:00:38.309> fight<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.879> your<00:00:39.030> interest<00:00:39.300> gear<00:00:39.629> but

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
then fight in your interest gear but

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.660 
then fight in your interest gear but
only<00:00:40.440> until<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.920> get<00:00:41.040> back<00:00:41.160> into<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.460> ring

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
only until you get back into the ring

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.580 
only until you get back into the ring
because<00:00:42.030> as<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.480> understand<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.079> once<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.469> are

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
because as I understand it once you are

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.080 
because as I understand it once you are
back<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.950> ring<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.280> get<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> cut<00:00:44.700> single

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
back in the ring you get a cut single

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.029 
back in the ring you get a cut single
referee<00:00:45.539> your<00:00:45.960> mat<00:00:46.260> point<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.860> then

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
referee your mat point on you then

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.950 
referee your mat point on you then
wrestle<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.640> your<00:00:47.789> normal<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.360> ring<00:00:48.660> attire

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
wrestle in your normal in ring attire

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.529 
wrestle in your normal in ring attire

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
something that isn't brand new but

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.619

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
obvious but not something that has got

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.960 
obvious but not something that has got
much<00:01:22.200> attention<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.340> addition<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.850> a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
much attention is the addition of a

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.030 
much attention is the addition of a
brand<00:01:24.270> new<00:01:24.420> referee<00:01:24.810> now<00:01:25.350> i'm<00:01:25.470> not<00:01:25.619> sure<00:01:25.890> why

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
brand new referee now i'm not sure why

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
they change with free from 15 but from

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.569 
they change with free from 15 but from
the<00:01:28.020> footage<00:01:28.259> we've<00:01:28.409> seen<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.799> far<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.310> looks

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
the footage we've seen so far it looks
