 [Music] 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.870
 there are people who do not have an obligation 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.310
 all of us have navel not the 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.349
 great majority of people from whom 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.110
 you are watching this video you give by 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.590
 understood that every human being has to 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.720
 have a belly button either inward or 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.440
 outward but we all have navel 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.750
 well, this is not true, there is very 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.870
 few people but there are some people 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.250
 that have no navel and is not born 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.550
 without navel is that actually the 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.560
 navel is formed because of the cord 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.700
 umbilical the signal that leaves the cord 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.790
 umbilical 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.730
 when it is cut but there are very 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.619
 few in which when the 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:10.509
 baby does not cut the umbilical cord 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.910
 let's say you have the baby attached to 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.149
 umbilical cord until this cord 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.100
 It dries and is naturally removed from 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.470
 way that is not what we know 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.159
 as forced but as a navel but that 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.039
 a completely flat belly remains 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.380
 no scar on the bottom of the navel 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.749
 it's a scar a scar that looks 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.969
 that the human being values ​​it as if 

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:36.969
 it was pretty but in the background is that one 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:39.490
 scar of birth well there is 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.890
 People who are born this way and that 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.329
 they do not have a navel, they do not have a navel 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.149
 simply because the umbilical cord 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:49.000
 It has fallen naturally without 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:52.060
 nobody cut it then there are also cases 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.250
 fewer cases yet but there are cases 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.829
 of a bilic or plasty that is to say of 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.759
 navel remodeling and there are some 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:02.379
 people who instead of wanting to wear the 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.599
 navel outward they want to put it 

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:08.379
 inward and there are also others that 

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:10.810
 they decide to cover their navels is a 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.420
 aesthetic operation very rare that very 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.440
 few people simply request 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.780
 because it looks weird not 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.360
 and well there are other circumstances 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.880
 in which you can disappear in 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.430
 certain way the navel or being capped 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.900
 such as, for example, operations 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.960
 of the viscera such as the 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.910
 small intestine , stomach what 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.690
 any any surgery that 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.990
 need to have access to these bodies 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.950
 internally you may then create a 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.680
 scar over the navel and do not look 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.960
 adequately however stressed that the 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.850
 most natural way of the way in 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.310
 which a person can be born without 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.800
 navel would be the mother after 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.170
 having the birth will not cut the cord 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.250
 umbilical to your child will let him be 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.140
 until he fell 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.300
 then in a few in a few 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.820
 hours or days I do not know how long it will take 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.230
 in falling the umbilical cord but the 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.450
 case is that a mother has to be 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.420
 holding for a long time until the 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:17.340
 umbilical cord dries and then already 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.340
 because a child would be born without 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.340
 belly button 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.200
