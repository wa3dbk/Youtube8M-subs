00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.450
 hello to all and hervé in the kitchens 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.040
 so do you like the meat of 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.600
 veal I like this meat is 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.730
 a white meat that is not very 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.590
 strong in taste and which allows 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.239
 associate it with very nice things 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.970
 so today I propose you to 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.710
 make a veal sauté with cream 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.580
 olives and lemon confit immediately 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.620
 behind by their recipes 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.809
 you will need mushrooms 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.420
 paris also liquid cream 30 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.680
 centilitres 10 centilitres of water a 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.699
 little bit of maïzena a teaspoon 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.520
 a veal stock 1 onion 2 cloves of garlic 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.559
 1 lemon confit of veal 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.030
 so also for special for the 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.219
 blanquette for example to blow up 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.059
 the veal so a kilo of green olives 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.590
 of course and a little talent so 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.580
 the first step is made cuts and 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.580
 onion in small cubes 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.860
 so I put a little oil background to 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.120
 to heat in my casserole and I 'm going to 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.470
 put the onions simply 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.470
 will make them color five minutes 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.590
 so during that time I was taking care of 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.299
 the go meat I 'm going to cut out the 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.299
 beautiful little cubes of meat like this 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.390
 so I have to degrease and cut the 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.189
 veal meat in square like this and I 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.369
 go now to put them with them 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.369
 onions 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.930
 I will add a tablespoon of 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.930
 corn flour or flour mix well 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.730
 so 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.299
 I will continue to cook for 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.299
 5 minutes 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.790
 so I'm going to take out now the 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.349
 Corsican will need candied lemon so you 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:37.310
 cut it in two here again in 4 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:39.080
 inside we'll get rid of it 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.390
 keep that skin that's the part 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.230
 built here and I'm going to cut and 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.230
 so thin slats 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:54.579
 I 'm adding live now so I'm using 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.579
 the hi press 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.410
 hence the presence of water 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.129
 also the cream 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:30.510
 we will add the mushrooms so you 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.900
 can choose to put it whole or 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.750
 why not cut into quarters if its 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.250
 little bit big this little ones 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.550
 well put them in full in the 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.550
 recipe 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.330
 so I will still cover with 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.690
 water to completely cover the 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
 meat 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.670
 I'm going to simmer for 45 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.090
 minutes and ten minutes before the end of 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.970
 the cooking 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:10.010
 I will add the lemon confit olives 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:12.140
 and the veal stock I will add the 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.320
 candied lemon slices that have me 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:19.810
 given a lot of taste also a good 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:28.550
 small green olives 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:30.560
 stoned the nicest and at the end of 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.260
 cooking for more taste again i'm going 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:38.000
 add a pot of veal stock here 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.500
 which will bring even more taste to 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.440
 our dish she will dissolve everything 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.910
 simply in the juice in the cream 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.800
 it's going to be perfect still lets them 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.090

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.340
 a suggestion of presentation 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.720

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.430
 ready you can serve them in 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.730

 will be very nice on the table so here 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.080
