00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.970
 Hi everyone in this video I want 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.570
 tell you briefly about a product that 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:17.710
 I was really surprised I didn't stay 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:21.100
 so and this is already the duo of enamel 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.800
 I peak as you know I work with kiko 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.440
 for which I received another color that 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.970
 I worked and bought this then if 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.770
 go on instagram 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:36.670
 the facebook page in the channel 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:40.900
 see my picture on the day when 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.480
 I put it on and after 56 days it seems to me ori 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.570
 published the photo another photo doing 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.090
 see how the color is gathered is 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.079
 the only flaw of this of these enamels 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:57.280
 is that they were found in limited editions 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.590
 still from some gem not in all of me 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.230
 has been said in via con firenze ha 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.000
 I also realized some will come 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.030
 refuel the larger ones the most 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.340
 piccoline no but here is a limited 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.280
 edition is really a shame because a 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.390
 super super valid product and this already 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:21.700
 the duo practically the color is the top 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:24.210
 coat apply two coats of color then 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.490
 girls really top coat lasts 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.680
 quietly 7 10 days and enamel 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.180
 which lasted me more than ever 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.680
 all the glazes we 've ever tried 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.500
 in my life 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.619
 absolutely where you would come i 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.090
 pupari lasting color not the lasting 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.840
 gel-colored that last a little less 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.340
 about me but I really remained 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.770
 ecstatic the duration of these enamels 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.030
 even the colors are not bad are colors 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.159
 which is better to be found almost everywhere 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.110
 however if you find any lead 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.790
 take it because there are no more from 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.100
 no part if you find them me 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.820
 I recommend I didn't go last 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.159
 time I found this blue yellow and a 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.879
 viola and I needed at that time the 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.860
 yellow however is a pity because they are 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:16.260
 really beautiful so if you find them 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:21.010
 take them are also very shiny 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:24.220
 when you roll them out they are not totally 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.630
 homogeneous but then with the touch 8 seems 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.040
 that is generated only if you become one 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.520
 completely smooth surface e 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.090
 lacquered are very shiny once 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:41.260
 applied and lights remain on days not 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.330
 is that it becomes opaque maybe the 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.379
 tenth day is not like the first one though 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.709
 the duration is really amazing costs 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:53.379
 our land 90 if I'm not mistaken and if there 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.959
 find the colors are many though 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.280
 I recommend anything again 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.510
 find get it because i really am 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.370
 beautiful 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.560

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.690

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.690
