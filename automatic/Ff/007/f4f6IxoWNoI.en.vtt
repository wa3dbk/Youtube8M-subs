 hello to all his 710 we find ourselves 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.880
 today for a new episode 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.240
 of moon lens and I have a good 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.220
 news 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.840
 I have good news since the big 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.260
 day has arrived I have reached the 8000 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.170
 success points on the panda 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.649
 so the moon lens that was to get 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.520
 success I show you the moon there 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.350
 look at the finger 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.750
 your finger something like that so 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.789
 it was to get is here in 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.680
 general wimille hit points so 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.399
 this is you show the moon there 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.520
 look at the finger 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.579
 that's it's a little bit better and 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.420
 so get the magnificent ornaments here 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.039
 present then obviously I have not 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.159
 the impression actually that what we had 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.450
 very hard to get there i'll get you 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.210
 explain in a second how I 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.140
 finished the last points of success I 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.659
 did it live for what they 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.159
 were and now ben there are the 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.450
 10000 that are possible with the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.979
 beautiful ornaments it's still 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.930
 remarkable that I obviously have on the 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.360
 sadi but not on the water then 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.390
 many ask me to continue 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.390
 series 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.060
 obviously I'm listening to you so 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.100
 I tell you already the series 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.329
 will not stop at wim success points 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.619
 we will continue but 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.450
 unfortunately finally rather 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.740
 luckily I realized in 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.320
 did it mean that it was a series 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.890
 was doing extremely well live so in 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.750
 streaming 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.759
 I did a lot of episodes in 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.049
 streaming and people have really good 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.100
 love 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.200
 simply because it allows me 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.790
 to do pv m while chatting with 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.920
 a cat and so on who pose 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.770
 questions and so that's it finally 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.840
 combine well but I have a huge concern 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.610
 it is that at the beginning my pc arrived all 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.270
 just 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.789
 to support a live with two three 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.880
 count more the stream 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.790
 but now my pc nokia even more 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.480
 the live plus one account so I do not 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.430
 can do more life unfortunately 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.530
 finally unfortunately not the live in 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.360
 done it's something I love that 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.470
 I appreciate enormously just as much as 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.170
 close video by the way that's driving 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.830
 very well I can turn the videos into 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.090
 live and that's so I'll try to 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.610
 find a solution then for 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.430
 the moment the solution that I found 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.760
 it's having new material 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.980
 data processing 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.209
 just so I have to 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.090
 give a little bit of information because we can 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.550
 not very trendy drying but a priori this 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.080
 would be buying a pc there I am in 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.200
 done on an old laptop that dates 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.110
 of more than 5 years is enough 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.760
 more in my opinion it would take a good turn 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.400
 after it's an investment but it's 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.380
 not that for that it takes a whole 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.140
 anyway a new pc a day etc 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.450
 in short, it concerns me only me 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.750
 so I'm going to pick up my mind 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.810
 the series will continue but for now 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.700
 I pause it on pause 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.140
 time that this new material arrives that 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.450
 I can do live again etc 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.709
 so we're waiting for the 8000 points that's there 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.459
 no worries then how did we reach 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.070
 his 8000 points 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:29.840
 the last successes that I did we 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:32.239
 have vulcania that happened a few years ago 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.170
 time I was doing some success that 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.160
 I had not I do not know normal 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.010
 to do it well I would have to 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.150
 continue for now I have a little 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.140
 little laziness because actually for the 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.670
 quests you have to redo them all 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.690
 I did half of last year and 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.950
 to be able to continue what has everything 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.769
 the air fabre for now I have a small 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.910
 little laziness but I still have time 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.709
 since last year was a success 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.780
 he had to overcome it seems to me 40 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.620
 cave mia and thanks to that it does not exist 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.610
 more 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.860
 I have the impression anyway I did not 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.540
 not found so already all the successes 6 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.370
 or regrossi agreed smera wise to go 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.780
 to make them for success that to be needed 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.920
 that I get out my fingers a little 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.980
 ass and that I was going to do everything 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.590
 simply 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.000
 so that's the way that 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.099
 I got the 8000 points of success 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.630
 that's the way I am 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:20.970
 passed 8900 7900 to 5980 earlier for 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.220
 get miles I made a duo taj 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.270
 he is here 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.690
 no here I did one of the hostages 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.510
 coriander I was streaming for those 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.740
 who were there you could see him 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:37.360
 so of course I think he will keep 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.090
 disappointed because still a lot of 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.060
 success not very hard to do and that I 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.830
 can do and show you that I am 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.970
 sure you can all do that I 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.680
 have not shown the coup there are 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.880
 maybe who have a little dead but 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.020
 unfortunately we have already arrived at 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.180
 8000 points without having to do them 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.460
 when we're going to do it's like I'm you 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.789
 I said we continue to the series live 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:01.840
 but for those who want to see 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:03.970
 success quickly that I did not show 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.050
 i can turn them to you offline 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.180
 so on my youtube channel everything 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.160
 simply in the next episode and this 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.599
 before I can redo live or 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.280
 if you have a particular request 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:14.710
 for example 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.419
 for example one of the viewers has some 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.580
 difficulties to do they have the village 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:19.750
 diot heart who are trying for a long time 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.229
 and who would wash really well that I him 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.360
 Ben shows I would agree to do that 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.490
 without doing the live before starting again 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.680
 the lives and the delayed tour 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.380
 for this viewer where seven players 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.750
 there either you be satisfied too 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.810
 echo evening massa a maximum satisfied 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.280
 for this series then another reason 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:43.599
 for which I put this series for 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.650
 the instant in pose is that I launched 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:46.120
 the new flagship series end the 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.889
 goultarminator chronicles it's going us 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.419
 take a lot of time and who says 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.130
 chronic taste of the shipowner says 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.590
 obviously goultarminator who says 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.650
 goultarminator says take a lot 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.780
 a lot of time for now but 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.260
 I prefer to focus on it then 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.400
 know also that a little bit before 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.360
 the end of the hang the terminator 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:10.289
 I will release my new series which I 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.599
 have already spoken to you in a live 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.219
 in my opinion it will be released around August 20 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:17.490
 say the trailer will be released around the 20th 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:19.110
 August maybe the 25th of August and as soon as the 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.599
 goalkeeper goal will be finished first 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.819
 episode will be released so it was this series 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:25.319
 will be called the challenges of this sadi for 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:26.699
 those who have seen there and you all know it 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:28.619
 is for others but will have to 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:31.439
 still a little bit wait for this 

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:32.639
 thriller come out so here it was 

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:34.770
