which<00:02:50.770> control<00:02:51.250> pattern<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:51.850> want<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.330> that

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
which control pattern you want and that

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.530 
which control pattern you want and that
is<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.320> difference<00:02:53.440> is<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:54.040> case<00:02:54.760> or<00:02:55.180> babka

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
is the difference is the case or babka

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.979 
is the difference is the case or babka
controls<00:02:55.930> where<00:02:56.850> you're<00:02:57.850> working<00:02:58.030> your

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
controls where you're working your

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.050 
controls where you're working your
tracks<00:02:59.320> forward<00:02:59.890> back<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.489> then<00:03:00.820> you're

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
tracks forward back and then you're

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.550 
tracks forward back and then you're
doing<00:03:01.420> your<00:03:01.510> pocket<00:03:01.840> with<00:03:01.959> this<00:03:02.080> one<00:03:02.320> and

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
doing your pocket with this one and

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.420 
doing your pocket with this one and
forward<00:03:03.250> back<00:03:03.549> and<00:03:04.140> doing<00:03:05.140> your<00:03:05.410> main<00:03:06.130> arm

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
forward back and doing your main arm

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.250 
forward back and doing your main arm
with<00:03:06.820> this<00:03:06.940> one<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.209> lift<00:03:07.420> that's<00:03:08.080> the

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
with this one you lift that's the

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.340 
with this one you lift that's the
difference<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:09.280> cat<00:03:09.489> controls<00:03:09.940> then<00:03:10.269> is<00:03:10.600> your

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
difference the cat controls then is your

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.830 
difference the cat controls then is your
whole<00:03:11.530> machine<00:03:11.950> moves<00:03:12.280> tracks<00:03:12.730> forward<00:03:13.299> back

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
whole machine moves tracks forward back

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.380 
whole machine moves tracks forward back
left<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.410> right<00:03:14.500> like<00:03:14.739> a<00:03:14.799> dozer<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.670> then

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
left and right like a dozer and then

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.720 
left and right like a dozer and then
this<00:03:16.600> side<00:03:16.870> raises<00:03:17.709> your<00:03:17.860> arm<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.400> dump<00:03:18.610> your

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
this side raises your arm and dump your

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.199 
this side raises your arm and dump your
pocket

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
pocket

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.910 
pocket
that's<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.260> difference<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.769> two

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
that's the difference of the two

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.789 
that's the difference of the two
patterns<00:03:21.160> so<00:03:22.150> this<00:03:22.840> one's<00:03:23.049> a<00:03:23.170> two-speed<00:03:23.590> one

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
patterns so this one's a two-speed one

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.830 
patterns so this one's a two-speed one
so<00:03:23.950> you<00:03:24.070> got<00:03:24.220> two<00:03:24.370> speeds<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:24.910> on<00:03:25.329> your

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
so you got two speeds and on your

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.240 
so you got two speeds and on your
controls<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:26.350> then<00:03:26.440> your<00:03:26.560> third<00:03:26.769> service

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
controls and then your third service

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.400 
controls and then your third service
there<00:03:27.430> too

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
there too

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.840 
there too
you<00:03:29.010> got<00:03:29.160> air-conditioning<00:03:30.890> here<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.580> then

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
you got air-conditioning here and then

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.160 
you got air-conditioning here and then
slowly<00:03:33.570> relics

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
slowly relics

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.070 
slowly relics
you<00:03:34.470> got<00:03:34.650> your<00:03:35.520> engine<00:03:35.820> temperature<00:03:36.300> your

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
you got your engine temperature your

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.170 
you got your engine temperature your
hydraulic<00:03:37.770> temperature<00:03:38.250> your<00:03:38.730> revs<00:03:38.970> and

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
hydraulic temperature your revs and

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.400 
hydraulic temperature your revs and
crowd<00:03:39.390> comes<00:03:39.600> up<00:03:39.720> here<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:39.930> in<00:03:40.080> your<00:03:40.200> fuel

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
crowd comes up here and in your fuel

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.510 
crowd comes up here and in your fuel
there<00:03:41.340> so<00:03:41.760> yeah<00:03:42.330> they're<00:03:42.570> a<00:03:42.600> really<00:03:42.930> nice<00:03:43.520> lot

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520

there so yeah they're a really nice lot
of<00:03:44.610> people<00:03:44.820> on<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.240> skid<00:03:45.450> steers<00:03:45.720> but<00:03:45.900> they

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
of people on the skid steers but they

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.840 
of people on the skid steers but they
are<00:03:46.590> really<00:03:46.800> nice<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.160> visibility<00:03:47.640> is<00:03:47.700> really

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
are really nice the visibility is really

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.910 
are really nice the visibility is really
nice<00:03:48.060> they're<00:03:48.360> comfortable<00:03:48.780> as<00:03:49.470> comfortable

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
as you can get in a skid steer so you

00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:02.450 
as you can get in a skid steer so you
know<00:03:53.160> there's<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.460> catch
