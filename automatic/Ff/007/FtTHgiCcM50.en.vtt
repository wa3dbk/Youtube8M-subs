00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.980
 preparing a festive treat today 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:16.980
 we cook sushi races near with me 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.720
 cold has become what can when he arose 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.619
 in the kitchen 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:26.550
 start we do rice multicooker 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:29.250
 we save it says and 20-25 minutes I 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:34.250
 add necessarily curry seasoning 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:41.160
 we make from a more spicy flavor and 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:43.530
 Sushi will be the most delicious and all about 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.930
 the drawing is ready in the slow cooker on mode 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.840
 Hurwitz took 20 minutes and then we 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.989
 take a sheet of nori and gently cut 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.539
 it into strips like this 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.640
 search stripes come in different vertices 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.710
 thinner than someone as comfortable 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.450
 experiment and how will you be 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.420
 more convenient now 1 is written to make us 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.840
 prepare the basis of which I will 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:21.210
 already wrapping a sheet of nori and again 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:25.250
 burn a little just kids do such 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.250
 hand movements and then it all 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:40.110
 since we are like a form when we 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.110
 must all wrap a sheet of nori 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.790
 3 st to be honest I'm a little wrong 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.860
 chose and here if what was now 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.440
 steamed and so expensive for that 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:02:00.670
 on the contrary does not use parboiled rice 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:02.320
 such a more round side poured himself ate 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.980
 Mancha fell apart a little 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:11.640
 dressed so now we take the holy affair 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.640
 we turn around and in that sea 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.540
 like this then bones which 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.480
 remains spikes karibaeva slightly 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.480
 wetted with plain water 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:43.599
 all prilepin as a form and a little bit 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:46.000
 clear out of 41 basis when ready 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:51.099
 you must first make a foundation and then 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.930
 already won them stuffing load so 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.459

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.140

 piquancy to our lessons will add divide 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.370
