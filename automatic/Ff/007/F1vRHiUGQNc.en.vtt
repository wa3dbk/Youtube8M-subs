00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.609
 Hello, I am Pavel Ignatovich 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.189
 and today we will talk with you about how 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.870
 choose the right gift but it 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.150
 certainly not quite psychology 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.730
 well these are some everyday observations 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.949
 which seems useful to me and since 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.189
 choose the right gift under here 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.090
 Many lot of questions at the person all has 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.850
 what to give him 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.010
 and or why he needs to give it to them 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.460
 maybe this is cool bauble friends 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.029
 my 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.059
 Firstly of course people are not known 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.610
 they are eager for a gift 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.620
 it's all the same the difference is not important to me 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.950
 gave the main thing that give me and specifically 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.530
 this man but generally there is a good one 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.730
 a way to give a person one hundred percent 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.620
 exactly what he likes to want 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.750
 watch your hands 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.000
 There are things that a person can imagine 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.500
 buy 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.020
 but for example for example the book is valid but 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.329
 book let's say dear let's say what not 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.489
 there will be a big colorful landscape 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.130
 format with good paper with good 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.189
 illustrations 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.799
 an album let's say at Salvador gave 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:16.080
 why not and that's what a person wants at all 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.720
 she likes to buy her herself 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.259
 but itâ€™s a pity for money 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.460
 yes you guessed it is necessary to buy it 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.890
 he wanted to buy this particular book and 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.770
 Generally the block but somehow well, do not give 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.820
 brutally money is not a pity but here it grew and 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.369
 donated and well 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.130
 another example wanted man for example 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.290
 can buy a bike 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.320
 allow but somehow not solved somehow 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.720
 But suddenly I will buy it once. 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.750
 skate is awkward unclear 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.549
 give him a bike 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.180
 let him even ride once and all 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.420
 but he will be pleased so if you want 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.930
 make gifts do them as follows 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.049
 way 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.299
 the coolest gift is that thing 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.850
 thing that a person wants to buy but 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.439
 until you decide to give it to people 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.239
 such things and they will you very much 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.740
 thankful so let's now how 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.950
