00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.630
 you are kind to you again nikolae tea 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.929
 blog today came to me my friend 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.870
 Sergey asked me the heat what is the difference 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.190
 my pmx from your Yandex and so we 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.260
 decided to take a review on them 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.650
 probably you have already seen our very first 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.650
 so to say 0 review where we broke the flask 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:29.210
 today we decided to approach this 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.999
 question more seriously by all on gopro 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:37.100
 the manufacturer is the company which country 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:39.050
 Germany with Turkish roots is my personal 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.420
 view of metal models from the company to i 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.340
 much more interesting practical and 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.720
 better than glass ie on 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.420
 glass we already did a review today 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.220
 we will analyze them these two models completely 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.740
 collapsible they are very easy to store 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.300
 carry the most favorite part of course 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.090
 there are glass cubes which 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.890
 principle can break time 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.650
 quite dense use 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.329
 there are about 8 months they have not 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.549
 rusted not listed 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.149
 that is, the quality of the materials of the company to I 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.219
 pretty good enough separate 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.840
 It deserves attention is the thread 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:13.759
 have it need to be lubricated periodically 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.810
 caring for her start just might 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:22.189
 get stuck and 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:25.490
 its very difficult to deploy why models 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.889
 Yandex are called 590 x 590 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.539
 because the length is 590 

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:31.789
 millimeters firm to offers 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:35.090
 enough variety in terms of design 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:37.670
 that is, the flasks of the mine themselves are very 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.219
 differ and remains purely your choice 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.170
 special attention should be paid to the flasks 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.509
 that is, there is a transparent model there 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.909
 opaque here is your choice because 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.340
 that someone likes to see the water level 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.959
 someone likes opaque models 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.990
 also models differ in quantity 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:56.529
 there are one hose ports 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.529
 somewhat not 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.660
 The lips in these models are stable 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.420
 wide grounds may not worry about 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.860
 the fact that your master will return we are again 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.840
 tried to serve the maximum 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.050
 canonical set that is with us 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.610
 hookah to me husband tukaya barracuda and silicone 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.040
 the female deserves special attention 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.830
 Silicone quality tight enough 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.820
 does not bend and I think that this is 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.200
 right one of the best silicone hoses 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.500
 husband tukaya barracuda is also enough 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.540
 quality it does not oxidize enough 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.110
 weighty all-metal 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.080
 and also very good mine diameter 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.750
 hookahs are very wide and provide 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.310
 excellent traction 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.260
 also excellent provide themselves 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.860
 the port under the hose which is also very 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.380
 wide 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.840
 also the models differ in the way 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.209
 fixing the mine flask that is and the system 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.690
 a scream that just snaps and there is 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.790
 on the thread 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.840
 well let's try to disassemble them and 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.060
 Find differences 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.510
 as I said the hookah completely 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.510
 demountable 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.469
 between the final element is 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.109
 seal which provides 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:34.879
 maximum tightness of the hookah again 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.189
 it's worth noting if you damage or 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.329
 sever this seal is very difficult 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.579
 will find him a replacement 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.709
 as you can see the disassembled 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.989
 hookah is very compact and easy 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.909
 even fit in a backpack let's 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.650
 consider the flask it consists of two 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:51.549
 elements that is the glass itself and 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.549
 attachment to the mine 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.989
 one of the minuses would be that 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.700
 mount to the glass just glued 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.889
 respectively from the wrong care 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.109
 or just water it can come unstuck 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.239
 due to the fact that the hookah itself is threaded 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.129
 I always want to move it for mine 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.049
 so be careful better 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:15.319
 support the bottom than you just 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.940
 the flask will fall and break if all the same 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.699
 broke the flask worth noting that 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.829
 strengthening is not included therefore 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:24.470
 you will need to remove it from the old flask 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.310
 and stick now well model payne x 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.310
 590 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.120
 the very first thing that catches your eye is 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.390
 of course, and the number of turns which 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.680
 much more than ign x 590 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.210
 completely defeated we will not model 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.450
 completely identical to her understand 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:01.550
 in the same way the portion costs from 2 parts 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:04.490
 which are also collapsible between these 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.070
 two pieces have a ball respectively 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.980
 It also serves as a model valve according to the Inn. 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:13.190
 x 590 ball goes metal models 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.200
 Isaacson plastic is lighter just like 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.450
 in any model for several hoses there 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.550
 small minus if in each valve 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.560
 you canâ€™t sell a hookah hook 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.570
 accordingly to ensure purging 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.640
 need to cut the new port will pull the ball 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:32.030
 but then the second smoker needs to be 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:33.920
 permanently plug the hose also all 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.140
 parts are sold separately and can be on 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.630
 single hose model unscrew the valve 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:44.210
 and put another port to do it 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:46.790
 found on these models is not intended 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.860
 lights in if there is a separate 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.390
 backlight stand so if you 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.250
 want your hookah light of its 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.260
 will need to buy separately let's 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.440
 go through the main minus hookah 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.000
 It is of course difficult to replace the flask 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.720
 also the ball which is in the valve 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.430
 whipping 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.350
 non-standard diameters are sufficient 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.430
 great so if you lose it 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.980
 very difficult to replace 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.470
 and of course the most important minus of these 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.180
 hookahs when the price is much higher 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.220
 than the same khalil mamoon them 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.410
 again the price of a hookah is completely 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.210
 corresponds to its quality well here in 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.280
 In general, both of these models 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.800
 deserves enough attention they 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.440
 very good is a great choice for both 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.900
 at home and institutions with you 2 nikolae 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.800
 Chaushesku friends Sergei thanks for 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.800
 attention yet
