00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 Autonomous and automatic wallraff this is at 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.280
 say that my accelerometer will measure to 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.230
 each time tilt and compensate 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.790
 the propulsion that is to say if 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.160
 bows in the blood will be of the lost 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.080
 engines and returns the Coy its part 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.300
 in the other direction either I turn back either 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.830
 I find rather the engine there and so 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.289
 to get a flatter plate 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.699
 possible then in demonstration it gives 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.699
 what all because they send 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.990
 the pleasant 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:39.060
 they are afraid the pigeon who plays the 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.060
 battery because they darken anything 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.760
 that's all 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.050
 the breakers according to m 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.050
 he integrated in my tablet 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.990
 we are waiting for him to be there, we are leading two 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.990
 month 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:13.619
 even if the fingers 38 and 45 folded 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.869
 and fr of the image so now that he 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.470
 is perfectly stable and we take 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.320
 pics 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.820
 at all 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.390
 he does not want to wait for the big guys 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.240
 can do 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.540
 automatic 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.540
 but not pages in a progress 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.120
 I take the worst 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.640
 12 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.290
 taylor 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.990
 yeah the mad cow 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.210
 Yes 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.210
 I will follow 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.650
 Yes 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.810
 m 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.659
 the world 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.180
 we can modify 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.350
 you 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.569
 no 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.569
 Bravo 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.360
 it's because we did not leave him for 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.220
 the moment every year happily 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.960
 that she caused the coconut side to appear 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.280
 simple but maybe yes but then 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.940
 started taking a wind more 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.940
 important 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.230
 Oh 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.350

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.480
 Oh 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.800
 140 but good 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.640
 and we should go back to the dough 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.640
 wood 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.200
 well it's in film for example 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.200
 on the film 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.639

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.360
