00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
view on these so this plate right here I

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.610 
view on these so this plate right here I
bought<00:00:56.980> from<00:00:57.190> Home<00:00:57.429> Depot<00:00:57.899> they're<00:00:58.899> about<00:00:59.079> $20

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
bought from Home Depot they're about $20

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.209 
bought from Home Depot they're about $20
apiece<00:00:59.710> and<00:01:00.249> then<00:01:00.760> these<00:01:00.969> are<00:01:01.620> 2<00:01:02.620> by<00:01:02.769> 8<00:01:02.980> by<00:01:03.190> 8

foot<00:01:03.730> pressure<00:01:04.150> treated<00:01:04.660> pieces<00:01:05.560> of<00:01:05.680> wood<00:01:05.880> it

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
foot pressure treated pieces of wood it

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.600 
foot pressure treated pieces of wood it
says<00:01:07.240> in<00:01:07.600> the<00:01:08.110> kit<00:01:08.350> that<00:01:08.380> it's<00:01:08.800> word<00:01:09.370> there

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
says in the kit that it's word there

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.420 
says in the kit that it's word there
they'll<00:01:09.909> hold<00:01:10.090> 700<00:01:10.630> pounds<00:01:10.900> of<00:01:10.960> piece<00:01:11.170> I<00:01:12.040> guess

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
they'll hold 700 pounds of piece I guess

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.970 
they'll hold 700 pounds of piece I guess
I<00:01:12.550> have<00:01:12.700> no<00:01:12.730> reason<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.210> disbelieve<00:01:13.390> that

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
I have no reason to disbelieve that

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.050 
I have no reason to disbelieve that
fortunately<00:01:14.980> I<00:01:15.040> mean<00:01:15.250> my<00:01:15.370> folio<00:01:15.580> only<00:01:15.909> weighs

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
fortunately I mean my folio only weighs

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.120 
fortunately I mean my folio only weighs
about<00:01:16.090> 500<00:01:16.570> pounds<00:01:16.990> so<00:01:17.380> it's<00:01:17.590> it's<00:01:17.800> not

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
about 500 pounds so it's it's not

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.330 
about 500 pounds so it's it's not
something<00:01:18.460> I'd<00:01:18.549> ever<00:01:18.579> worry<00:01:18.939> about<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:20.320> what<00:01:21.310> I

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
something I'd ever worry about so what I

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.160 
something I'd ever worry about so what I
did<00:01:21.610> to<00:01:21.729> kind<00:01:21.909> of<00:01:21.970> modify<00:01:22.299> these<00:01:22.479> better<00:01:22.960> than

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
did to kind of modify these better than

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.980 
did to kind of modify these better than
what<00:01:23.290> they<00:01:23.409> were<00:01:23.470> was<00:01:23.920> was<00:01:24.700> this<00:01:24.970> it's<00:01:25.780> got<00:01:25.960> a

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
what they were was was this it's got a

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.510 
what they were was was this it's got a
clip<00:01:26.350> that<00:01:26.619> clips<00:01:26.890> in<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:29.280> topper<00:01:30.280> year

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
clip that clips in for the topper year

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.840 
clip that clips in for the topper year
the<00:01:30.850> bed<00:01:31.420> actually<00:01:31.600> clips<00:01:32.110> into<00:01:32.469> it<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.729> this

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
the bed actually clips into it and this

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.469 
the bed actually clips into it and this
does<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.119> few<00:01:34.450> different<00:01:34.719> things<00:01:35.009> one<00:01:36.479> really

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
does a few different things one really

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:38.639 
does a few different things one really
more<00:01:37.659> than<00:01:37.780> anything<00:01:37.990> when<00:01:38.229> you're<00:01:38.380> going<00:01:38.530> to

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
more than anything when you're going to

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.590 
more than anything when you're going to
back<00:01:38.920> off<00:01:39.159> or<00:01:39.640> when<00:01:39.759> you're<00:01:39.880> pulling<00:01:40.119> up<00:01:40.360> on

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
back off or when you're pulling up on

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.240 
back off or when you're pulling up on
especially<00:01:41.079> if<00:01:41.409> you<00:01:41.500> have<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.680> drive<00:01:41.860> over<00:01:42.159> the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
especially if you have to drive over the

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.440 
especially if you have to drive over the
hump<00:01:42.399> switch<00:01:42.610> fortunately<00:01:43.060> I<00:01:43.090> don't<00:01:43.180> have<00:01:43.329> to

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
hump switch fortunately I don't have to

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.630 
hump switch fortunately I don't have to
do<00:01:43.570> with<00:01:43.689> this<00:01:43.780> boiler<00:01:44.170> these<00:01:44.979> these<00:01:45.340> tend<00:01:45.579> to

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
do with this boiler these these tend to

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.709 
do with this boiler these these tend to
want<00:01:45.789> to<00:01:45.880> kick<00:01:46.030> out<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:47.380> if<00:01:47.500> it<00:01:47.710> goes<00:01:48.390> as<00:01:49.390> far

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
want to kick out and if it goes as far

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:53.840 
want to kick out and if it goes as far
as<00:01:49.840> they<00:01:49.960> can<00:01:50.020> go<00:01:51.539> they<00:01:52.539> won't<00:01:52.719> kick<00:01:53.049> out

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
as they can go they won't kick out

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.130 
as they can go they won't kick out
that's<00:01:54.850> basically<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.420> principle<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:55.899> change

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
that's basically the principle to change

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.660 
that's basically the principle to change
and<00:01:56.439> it<00:01:56.530> does<00:01:56.710> have<00:01:56.890> some<00:01:56.920> adjustment<00:01:57.609> I

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
and it does have some adjustment I

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.120 
and it does have some adjustment I
actually<00:01:57.820> can<00:01:58.320> justice<00:01:59.320> tighter<00:01:59.560> but<00:01:59.799> it

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
actually can justice tighter but it

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.429 
actually can justice tighter but it
works<00:02:00.310> out<00:02:00.520> fine<00:02:00.759> for<00:02:01.030> me<00:02:01.180> it<00:02:01.840> keeps<00:02:02.079> them<00:02:02.289> in

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
works out fine for me it keeps them in

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.529 
works out fine for me it keeps them in
place<00:02:02.560> from<00:02:02.890> going<00:02:02.950> side<00:02:03.399> to<00:02:03.430> side<00:02:03.759> when<00:02:04.210> I<00:02:04.270> put

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
place from going side to side when I put

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.240 
place from going side to side when I put
them<00:02:04.630> on<00:02:04.719> the<00:02:04.869> truck<00:02:05.109> when<00:02:05.950> they're<00:02:06.130> in

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
them on the truck when they're in

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.150 
them on the truck when they're in
position<00:02:06.670> I<00:02:06.789> know<00:02:06.899> exactly<00:02:07.899> that<00:02:08.830> there's<00:02:09.009> no

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
position I know exactly that there's no

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.340 
position I know exactly that there's no
way<00:02:09.340> for<00:02:09.369> me<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.759> mess<00:02:10.030> up<00:02:10.210> driving<00:02:10.479> up<00:02:10.780> mine

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
way for me to mess up driving up mine

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.230 
way for me to mess up driving up mine
fits<00:02:11.710> in<00:02:11.890> as<00:02:12.070> tight<00:02:12.280> as<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.550> possibly<00:02:12.730> could

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
fits in as tight as it possibly could

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.650 
fits in as tight as it possibly could
and<00:02:14.340> yeah<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.610> basically<00:02:16.060> all<00:02:16.180> I<00:02:16.210> did<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:16.570> I

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
and yeah and basically all I did is I

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.509 
and yeah and basically all I did is I
just<00:02:16.840> put<00:02:16.960> a<00:02:16.990> longer<00:02:17.530> bolt<00:02:17.650> on<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:18.330> washer<00:02:19.330> and

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
just put a longer bolt on a washer and

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.929 
just put a longer bolt on a washer and
a<00:02:21.549> little<00:02:22.209> bit<00:02:22.329> Loctite<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.170> yeah<00:02:24.159> so<00:02:24.730> far

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 
a little bit Loctite and yeah so far

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:25.770 
a little bit Loctite and yeah so far
they've<00:02:25.090> worked<00:02:25.209> really<00:02:25.390> well

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
they've worked really well

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.630 
they've worked really well
I<00:02:25.959> don't<00:02:26.140> load<00:02:26.379> and<00:02:26.590> unload<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:27.069> spoiler<00:02:27.489> off

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
I don't load and unload the spoiler off

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.800 
I don't load and unload the spoiler off
his<00:02:27.819> truck<00:02:28.030> a<00:02:28.060> lot<00:02:28.269> more<00:02:28.569> or<00:02:28.959> very<00:02:29.200> often<00:02:30.810> and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
his truck a lot more or very often and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.050 
his truck a lot more or very often and
the<00:02:31.900> reality<00:02:32.349> is<00:02:32.379> is<00:02:32.709> yes<00:02:32.950> this<00:02:33.519> folder<00:02:33.939> is

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
the reality is is yes this folder is

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.520 
the reality is is yes this folder is
worth<00:02:34.269> probably<00:02:34.510> about<00:02:34.689> three<00:02:35.049> times<00:02:35.230> as<00:02:35.409> much

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
worth probably about three times as much

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.349 
worth probably about three times as much
as<00:02:35.709> this<00:02:35.799> truck<00:02:36.040> yeah<00:02:36.370> maybe<00:02:36.639> that's<00:02:36.849> that's<00:02:37.120> a

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
as this truck yeah maybe that's that's a

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.449 
as this truck yeah maybe that's that's a
little<00:02:37.629> bit<00:02:37.780> much<00:02:37.930> but<00:02:38.170> anyway<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:39.040> I'm<00:02:39.310> going

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
little bit much but anyway so I'm going

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.970 
little bit much but anyway so I'm going
to<00:02:39.489> show<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.700> kind<00:02:40.030> of<00:02:40.209> how<00:02:40.269> it<00:02:41.170> also<00:02:41.409> works<00:02:41.799> to

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
to show you kind of how it also works to

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.440 
to show you kind of how it also works to
do<00:02:42.099> one<00:02:42.250> other<00:02:42.370> things<00:02:42.700> so<00:02:42.909> hold<00:02:43.180> on<00:02:43.299> one

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
do one other things so hold on one

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.080 
do one other things so hold on one
second<00:02:43.870> all<00:02:44.099> right<00:02:45.099> so<00:02:45.280> after<00:02:45.430> I<00:02:45.639> built<00:02:45.939> these

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
second all right so after I built these

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.270 
second all right so after I built these
and<00:02:46.359> a<00:02:46.510> guy<00:02:47.079> at<00:02:47.109> my<00:02:47.379> shop<00:02:47.620> had<00:02:47.859> recommended

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
and a guy at my shop had recommended

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.899 
and a guy at my shop had recommended
this<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.560> when<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:50.739> did<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.430> worked

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
this and so when I did it that it worked

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.280 
this and so when I did it that it worked
you<00:02:52.090> know<00:02:52.150> fine<00:02:52.450> border<00:02:52.720> was<00:02:52.870> but<00:02:53.109> then<00:02:53.260> I

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
you know fine border was but then I

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.649 
you know fine border was but then I
realized<00:02:53.620> after<00:02:54.129> I<00:02:54.189> got<00:02:54.370> it<00:02:54.519> on<00:02:54.669> and<00:02:54.970> I<00:02:55.180> don't

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:55.659 
realized after I got it on and I don't

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:56.699 
realized after I got it on and I don't
know<00:02:55.720> if<00:02:55.810> this<00:02:55.959> is<00:02:56.109> true<00:02:56.290> for<00:02:56.530> all

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
know if this is true for all

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.729 
know if this is true for all
applications<00:02:57.959> but<00:02:58.959> it<00:02:59.049> certainly<00:02:59.230> worked<00:02:59.530> for

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
applications but it certainly worked for

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.140 
applications but it certainly worked for
mine<00:02:59.889> and<00:03:00.129> you<00:03:00.189> could<00:03:00.310> always<00:03:00.459> make<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.760> chain

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
mine and you could always make a chain

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.369 
mine and you could always make a chain
bigger<00:03:01.419> and<00:03:01.629> smaller<00:03:01.840> if<00:03:02.049> you<00:03:02.139> needed<00:03:02.290> to

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
bigger and smaller if you needed to

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.949 
bigger and smaller if you needed to
adjust<00:03:02.919> it<00:03:03.129> but<00:03:03.849> this<00:03:04.030> keeps<00:03:04.359> it<00:03:04.569> from<00:03:04.750> when

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
adjust it but this keeps it from when

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.420 
adjust it but this keeps it from when
I'm<00:03:05.049> going<00:03:05.319> down<00:03:05.469> the<00:03:05.560> road<00:03:05.590> I<00:03:05.769> don't<00:03:06.099> like<00:03:06.310> to

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
I'm going down the road I don't like to

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.309 
I'm going down the road I don't like to
worry<00:03:06.609> about<00:03:06.700> things<00:03:07.209> coming<00:03:07.569> out<00:03:07.659> there

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
worry about things coming out there

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.000 
worry about things coming out there
they're<00:03:08.560> not<00:03:08.590> going<00:03:08.950> anywhere<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:10.829> yeah<00:03:11.829> so

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
they're not going anywhere and yeah so

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.830 
they're not going anywhere and yeah so
it's<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.549> nice<00:03:12.700> little<00:03:13.060> added<00:03:13.180> feature<00:03:13.599> to<00:03:13.750> this

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
it's a nice little added feature to this

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.409 
it's a nice little added feature to this
and<00:03:16.840> they<00:03:16.989> were<00:03:17.230> this<00:03:18.060> compared<00:03:19.060> to<00:03:19.150> you<00:03:19.389> know

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:19.419 
and they were this compared to you know

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:23.250 
and they were this compared to you know
200<00:03:19.900> all<00:03:19.989> around<00:03:20.319> and<00:03:21.329> everything<00:03:22.329> else<00:03:22.510> and

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
200 all around and everything else and

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.259 
200 all around and everything else and
when<00:03:23.439> you<00:03:23.560> as<00:03:24.159> you<00:03:24.400> saw<00:03:24.609> it<00:03:24.760> sitting<00:03:24.940> on<00:03:25.150> the

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
when you as you saw it sitting on the

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.530 
when you as you saw it sitting on the
truck<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:26.370> these<00:03:27.370> do<00:03:27.669> stick<00:03:28.000> out<00:03:28.180> but<00:03:28.329> as<00:03:28.449> you

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
truck the these do stick out but as you

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.469 
truck the these do stick out but as you
can<00:03:28.690> see<00:03:29.159> as<00:03:30.159> far<00:03:30.400> as<00:03:30.519> traveling<00:03:30.879> with<00:03:31.030> it<00:03:31.180> who

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:31.479 
can see as far as traveling with it who

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.149 
can see as far as traveling with it who
cares<00:03:31.780> I<00:03:31.989> mean<00:03:32.019> for<00:03:32.379> me<00:03:32.470> I<00:03:32.500> have<00:03:32.799> to<00:03:32.919> have<00:03:32.949> the

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 
cares I mean for me I have to have the

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.670 
cares I mean for me I have to have the
bed<00:03:33.310> of<00:03:33.430> my<00:03:33.459> truck<00:03:33.579> down<00:03:34.199> just<00:03:35.199> because<00:03:35.349> of<00:03:35.620> the

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
bed of my truck down just because of the

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.149 
bed of my truck down just because of the
size<00:03:35.919> of<00:03:36.069> my<00:03:36.129> truck<00:03:37.290> so<00:03:38.290> for<00:03:38.530> me<00:03:38.650> having<00:03:39.040> the

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
size of my truck so for me having the

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:40.830 
size of my truck so for me having the
bed<00:03:39.310> open<00:03:39.609> and<00:03:39.729> having<00:03:39.970> these<00:03:40.090> stick<00:03:40.419> out<00:03:40.599> is

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
bed open and having these stick out is

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.530 
bed open and having these stick out is
absolutely<00:03:41.829> not<00:03:41.979> a<00:03:42.010> problem<00:03:42.099> for<00:03:42.489> me<00:03:42.669> but<00:03:43.510> I

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
absolutely not a problem for me but I

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.849 
absolutely not a problem for me but I
can<00:03:43.750> see<00:03:43.870> where<00:03:43.989> it<00:03:44.109> might<00:03:44.229> be<00:03:44.349> concerned<00:03:44.650> for

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
can see where it might be concerned for

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.679 
can see where it might be concerned for
somebody<00:03:45.099> else<00:03:45.250> but<00:03:45.729> what<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.000> do<00:03:46.090> gain<00:03:46.479> in

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:46.689 
somebody else but what I do gain in

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:50.550 
somebody else but what I do gain in
these<00:03:46.840> being<00:03:47.139> this<00:03:47.319> length<00:03:47.650> is<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:50.079> angle

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
these being this length is the the angle

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.659 
these being this length is the the angle
of<00:03:50.859> my<00:03:51.280> platform<00:03:52.269> driving<00:03:53.049> up<00:03:53.229> is<00:03:53.430> much<00:03:54.430> better

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669 
of my platform driving up is much better

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.479 
of my platform driving up is much better
than<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.689> know<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:55.840> $300<00:03:56.530> set<00:03:56.829> of<00:03:57.009> aluminum

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
than you know to $300 set of aluminum

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.659 
than you know to $300 set of aluminum
ones<00:03:57.669> that<00:03:58.479> have<00:03:58.979> you<00:03:59.979> know<00:04:00.009> a<00:04:00.099> much<00:04:00.370> shorter

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:00.669 
ones that have you know a much shorter

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.429 
ones that have you know a much shorter
angle<00:04:01.180> but<00:04:01.389> will<00:04:01.509> fit<00:04:01.750> in<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.109> bed<00:04:02.259> of<00:04:02.379> the

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 
angle but will fit in the bed of the

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:04.409 
angle but will fit in the bed of the
truck<00:04:02.590> so<00:04:03.370> for<00:04:03.579> me<00:04:03.699> the<00:04:03.819> trade<00:04:04.030> off<00:04:04.180> is<00:04:04.389> just

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:04.419 
truck so for me the trade off is just

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:07.469 
truck so for me the trade off is just
fine<00:04:04.900> these<00:04:05.590> also<00:04:06.069> with<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:07.239> pressure

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:07.479 
fine these also with the pressure

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:10.890 
fine these also with the pressure
treated<00:04:07.870> wood<00:04:07.930> $20<00:04:08.859> thing<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:10.060> chain<00:04:10.359> an<00:04:10.569> extra

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
treated wood $20 thing to chain an extra

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.479 
treated wood $20 thing to chain an extra
bolt<00:04:11.079> I<00:04:11.349> mean<00:04:11.500> you're<00:04:11.620> looking<00:04:11.739> right<00:04:12.189> under

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
bolt I mean you're looking right under

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.849 
bolt I mean you're looking right under
$50<00:04:13.180> I'm<00:04:13.569> sure<00:04:13.840> that<00:04:14.049> will<00:04:14.199> do<00:04:14.349> put<00:04:14.590> you<00:04:14.769> know

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
$50 I'm sure that will do put you know

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.979 
$50 I'm sure that will do put you know
depend<00:04:15.280> on<00:04:15.489> your<00:04:16.120> home<00:04:16.299> depot<00:04:16.570> and<00:04:16.599> really<00:04:16.870> the

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
depend on your home depot and really the

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.920 
depend on your home depot and really the
cost<00:04:17.799> of<00:04:18.039> the<00:04:18.099> pressure<00:04:18.310> treated<00:04:18.579> wood<00:04:18.870> but<00:04:19.870> uh

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
cost of the pressure treated wood but uh

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.990 
cost of the pressure treated wood but uh
so<00:04:20.620> far<00:04:20.889> it<00:04:20.979> works<00:04:21.070> good<00:04:21.340> for<00:04:21.579> me<00:04:21.699> the<00:04:21.880> only

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
so far it works good for me the only

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.640 
so far it works good for me the only
other<00:04:22.300> thing<00:04:22.509> I<00:04:22.599> might<00:04:22.780> do<00:04:22.990> is<00:04:23.020> I<00:04:23.289> might<00:04:23.320> put

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
other thing I might do is I might put

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.310 
other thing I might do is I might put
expanded<00:04:24.159> metal<00:04:24.570> on<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.720> other<00:04:25.810> side<00:04:26.139> for

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
expanded metal on the other side for

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.740 
expanded metal on the other side for
traction<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:27.550> looked<00:04:28.150> at<00:04:28.240> some<00:04:28.389> of<00:04:28.419> the<00:04:28.539> grip

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
traction I looked at some of the grip

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.820 
traction I looked at some of the grip
tape<00:04:28.930> stuff<00:04:29.229> and<00:04:29.409> all<00:04:29.469> that<00:04:29.500> and<00:04:29.710> it<00:04:29.800> just

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
tape stuff and all that and it just

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.769 
tape stuff and all that and it just
seemed<00:04:30.130> hokey<00:04:30.490> was<00:04:30.639> really<00:04:30.880> expensive<00:04:31.210> too

00:04:31.769 --> 00:04:31.779 
seemed hokey was really expensive too

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:34.559 
seemed hokey was really expensive too
for<00:04:32.380> what<00:04:32.800> I<00:04:32.830> would<00:04:33.010> needed<00:04:33.219> to<00:04:33.310> do<00:04:33.460> so

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:34.569 
for what I would needed to do so

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:36.179 
for what I would needed to do so
but<00:04:34.870> yeah<00:04:34.990> I<00:04:35.020> might<00:04:35.229> have<00:04:35.259> expanded<00:04:35.860> metal<00:04:35.979> on

00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:36.189 
but yeah I might have expanded metal on

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:38.579 
but yeah I might have expanded metal on
it<00:04:36.309> later<00:04:36.490> on<00:04:36.699> if<00:04:37.539> I<00:04:37.719> have<00:04:37.930> any<00:04:38.080> problems<00:04:38.469> with

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:38.589 
it later on if I have any problems with

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:40.110 
it later on if I have any problems with
it<00:04:38.620> I'll<00:04:38.979> know<00:04:39.339> when<00:04:39.490> I<00:04:39.520> go<00:04:39.729> to<00:04:39.789> load<00:04:39.999> this

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
it I'll know when I go to load this

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.659 
it I'll know when I go to load this
thing<00:04:40.360> when<00:04:40.509> it's<00:04:40.539> snowy<00:04:41.289> maybe<00:04:41.650> but<00:04:42.550> I've

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
thing when it's snowy maybe but I've

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.070 
thing when it's snowy maybe but I've
loaded<00:04:42.879> it<00:04:43.089> cover<00:04:43.300> with<00:04:43.509> mud<00:04:43.659> and<00:04:43.689> it<00:04:43.900> went<00:04:44.050> up

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
loaded it cover with mud and it went up

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.929 
loaded it cover with mud and it went up
just<00:04:44.139> fine

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:44.939 
just fine

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:48.570 
just fine
so<00:04:45.939> yeah<00:04:46.270> there's<00:04:47.050> a<00:04:47.199> there's<00:04:47.680> my<00:04:48.009> two<00:04:48.069> cents

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
so yeah there's a there's my two cents

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.260 
so yeah there's a there's my two cents
on<00:04:49.379> loading<00:04:50.379> ramps<00:04:50.860> for<00:04:51.279> a<00:04:51.339> full<00:04:51.520> wheeler<00:04:51.759> I'm

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
on loading ramps for a full wheeler I'm

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.519 
on loading ramps for a full wheeler I'm
sure<00:04:52.509> a<00:04:52.539> lawnmower<00:04:52.809> all<00:04:53.110> that<00:04:53.259> would<00:04:53.379> work

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:53.529 
sure a lawnmower all that would work

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:56.939 
sure a lawnmower all that would work
fine<00:04:53.710> especially<00:04:54.219> with<00:04:54.339> the<00:04:54.759> the<00:04:55.419> lower<00:04:56.349> angle

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
fine especially with the the lower angle

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.890 
fine especially with the the lower angle
and<00:04:57.189> the<00:04:57.309> ease<00:04:57.520> of<00:04:57.550> coming<00:04:58.180> over<00:04:58.330> the<00:04:58.419> top<00:04:58.629> but

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
and the ease of coming over the top but

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.049 
and the ease of coming over the top but
yeah<00:04:59.559> I<00:04:59.680> just<00:04:59.830> to<00:05:00.279> me<00:05:00.400> when<00:05:00.580> it<00:05:00.669> came<00:05:00.789> time<00:05:00.999> to

00:05:01.049 --> 00:05:01.059 
yeah I just to me when it came time to

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:03.360 
yeah I just to me when it came time to
build<00:05:01.210> ramps<00:05:01.779> or<00:05:01.960> buy<00:05:02.169> ramp<00:05:02.499> sites<00:05:02.919> you<00:05:03.249> know

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
build ramps or buy ramp sites you know

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.459 
build ramps or buy ramp sites you know
hundred<00:05:04.120> dollars<00:05:04.360> for<00:05:04.539> crappy<00:05:04.779> steel<00:05:05.199> ones

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:05.469 
hundred dollars for crappy steel ones

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:08.159 
hundred dollars for crappy steel ones
that<00:05:05.620> weighed<00:05:05.770> a<00:05:05.800> ton<00:05:05.919> or<00:05:06.370> you<00:05:07.360> know<00:05:07.479> two

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
that weighed a ton or you know two

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:09.540 
that weighed a ton or you know two
hundred<00:05:08.259> dollars<00:05:08.649> for<00:05:08.830> good<00:05:08.979> aluminum<00:05:09.370> ones

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
hundred dollars for good aluminum ones

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.659 
hundred dollars for good aluminum ones
or<00:05:10.059> you<00:05:11.050> know<00:05:11.139> fifty<00:05:11.770> bucks<00:05:11.949> for<00:05:12.069> this<00:05:12.249> I<00:05:12.490> think

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
or you know fifty bucks for this I think

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.219 
or you know fifty bucks for this I think
this<00:05:12.909> is<00:05:13.059> just<00:05:13.240> fine<00:05:13.419> and<00:05:13.479> I<00:05:13.749> think<00:05:13.960> over<00:05:14.199> time

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
this is just fine and I think over time

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.350 
this is just fine and I think over time
even<00:05:14.680> if<00:05:14.770> this<00:05:14.949> wood<00:05:15.189> was<00:05:15.849> to<00:05:15.999> wear<00:05:16.149> out<00:05:16.330> I

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
even if this wood was to wear out I

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.239 
even if this wood was to wear out I
don't<00:05:16.659> think<00:05:16.839> any<00:05:16.960> of<00:05:17.050> this<00:05:17.199> will<00:05:17.439> wear<00:05:17.770> I<00:05:17.800> also

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:18.249 
don't think any of this will wear I also

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:19.889 
don't think any of this will wear I also
got<00:05:18.550> decent<00:05:18.909> hardware<00:05:19.210> you<00:05:19.449> get<00:05:19.599> cheaper

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:19.899 
got decent hardware you get cheaper

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:22.170 
got decent hardware you get cheaper
hardware<00:05:20.050> you<00:05:20.889> probably<00:05:21.159> do<00:05:21.219> this<00:05:21.309> for<00:05:21.520> $40<00:05:22.059> if

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
hardware you probably do this for $40 if

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.820 
hardware you probably do this for $40 if
you<00:05:22.210> wanted<00:05:22.509> to<00:05:22.659> I'm<00:05:23.589> in<00:05:23.770> the

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
you wanted to I'm in the

you wanted to I'm in the
pressure-treated<00:05:24.279> you<00:05:24.550> might<00:05:24.729> you<00:05:24.909> know<00:05:24.969> if

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:25.089 
pressure-treated you might you know if

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:26.850 
pressure-treated you might you know if
you<00:05:25.210> go<00:05:25.300> cheaper<00:05:25.659> on<00:05:25.749> that<00:05:25.960> I<00:05:25.990> mean<00:05:26.259> all<00:05:26.589> in<00:05:26.770> all

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
you go cheaper on that I mean all in all

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.290 
you go cheaper on that I mean all in all
you<00:05:26.979> could<00:05:27.099> probably<00:05:27.219> do<00:05:27.430> this<00:05:27.550> for<00:05:27.699> $30<00:05:28.149> if

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
you could probably do this for $30 if

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.429 
you could probably do this for $30 if
you<00:05:28.360> wanted<00:05:28.599> to<00:05:28.689> if<00:05:28.779> you<00:05:28.839> want<00:05:29.020> to<00:05:29.050> be<00:05:29.199> cheap

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:29.439 
you wanted to if you want to be cheap

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:31.739 
you wanted to if you want to be cheap
cheap<00:05:29.710> about<00:05:29.979> it<00:05:30.099> but<00:05:30.249> anyways<00:05:31.240> there<00:05:31.539> you<00:05:31.629> go

00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:31.749 
cheap about it but anyways there you go

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:34.919 
cheap about it but anyways there you go
