00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 and delicate any team from 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.950
 food has been worked strive 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.610
 and knowing that things are not easy is 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.230
 a great and good team I will wait 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.120
 I really want every opportunity that I 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.560
 den to try to take advantage are two 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.300
 matches already the friendly of warsaw and 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.820
 today it is often said that the pressure in the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.890
 madrid is very big and that the goal 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.940
 when you put with a study of madrid 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.660
 better 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:33.140
 I am very very calm and I always say 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.270
 that when you study for an exam you 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.420
 feel ready to go make a 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.910
 exam I train hard I prepare myself well 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.340
 for each game then the work 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.989
 back I know that things within 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.230
 the court can go well they can come out 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.879
 badly bad but my conscience always 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.430
 I will be very calm because I am going to 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.809
 get the best prepared for 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.910
 try to make things work 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.420
 also a lot of film defending 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.800
 the Polynesia is involved enough 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.769
 less here it's hard to keep the 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.870
 good concentration that is not in every 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.850
 who I try to always be reading 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.159
 the match today for example was a 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.900
 party where we did not have many 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.310
 many times but the game 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.800
 it served to talk to my classmates 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.659
 to communicate to be attentive in 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.640
 each play to help them in many 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.750
 movements and I think those things 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.130
 they also help you to be 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.930
 concentrate is already prepared for 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.380
 anywhere you expected bearing 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.790
 but you are going to play today day number 5 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.680
 expect to play today I always wait 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.990
 play in the next day and always 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.049
 I am prepared and always 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.000
 to always be training as if 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.130
 out number one and that's what 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.509
 I will always be trying to do 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.909
 for the moment that the opportunities 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.710
 come that they do not take me by surprise 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.960
 well thank you keylor very quiet 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.720
 the truth is seen the goalkeeper and also 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.729
 without hurry the truth that I like 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.289
 listen because it is not due to nothing 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.200
 he was saying goodbye he was deciding and 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.119
 he said he is saying and 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.780

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.780
