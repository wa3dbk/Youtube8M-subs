00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.750
 photo collage allows you to make your own photo montages 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.109
 so to start we will add images so either from the computer or from 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.219
 the lawyer me 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.599
 so I added it from the computer 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.899
 once it's done pictures to chopin work for my thing that 

00:00:15.899 --> 00:00:18.839
 can see these are small blue bubbles that allows you to resize 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:20.220
 your image 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.640
 the only two rotation 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.089
 so I quickly explained the purpose of this daily 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.629
 so you first have the supreme title and therefore to delete an image 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.430
 the mythical duplicate 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.540
 the cementist supposed only in case you have images 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.000
 superimposed 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.750
 and so that for example to be broken this image in front so I'm going 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.320
 select my image and what is overcome 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.320
 if not, it's actually I'm on December 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.000
 then you have the taste of lemon crop 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.660
 so that only keeps a part of the image so offbeat 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.160
 the small squares 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.350
 for the area to be conserved 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.350
 once these facts referred to reframe themselves 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.120
 then you have the outlines 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.560
 more or less rounded 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.230
 then the counter head 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.570
 and the color of the tachometer 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.010
 then we have the image settings 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.340
 so transparency 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.220
 the luminosity 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.060
 the contrast 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.760
 and saturation 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.170
 then we will be able to add text 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.770
 we could pass 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.520
 our text 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.540
 and there instead of changing the properties immediately gilles 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.800
 click to add text 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.100
 to have the Korean version 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.100
 so here now I'm going to modify the properties 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.930
 so the size the alignment 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.140
 free color shoes 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.610
 and then we have a writing font 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.370
 so to change its axis later 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.610
 I select fromonteil Drosophila immediately 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.259
 and with the others the surcharges so there I can not modify - tec-sem group 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.119
 then we have December 6 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.119
 so it allows to use a brush so we choose the color 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:21.729
 the size of the brush 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:25.349
 and its transparency no longer transparency roth then we'll see the 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.249
 color 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:29.989
 so then we have there that m 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.139
 so to delete a path 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:34.879
 not wanted 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.540
 simply for deleted in one click on the site on the drawing 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.609
 and then on a brush tour to get started 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.819
 then we asked for accounts 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.229
 so here we have several categories buckle him enough to 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:52.279
 search 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:55.279
 so we select an image that we click 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:59.079
 and she buys a routine job 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.290
 franchitti chichis 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.689
 of the ihd man mentioned 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.689
 and place it as you want 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:09.479
 then, we have 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:12.180
 the bottom so to customize 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.029
 the background of the image 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:17.399
 so we can choose the colors 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:19.849
 one paper a year by default 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.459
 or a personal image 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.249
 so to make a personal page 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:25.279
 select the desired image 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:28.279
 and we click on used the selected image like that which is good 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:31.539
 once again it's done 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:33.449
 we can see an image that is buried 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.449
 so we will adapt the bottom 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.649
 to avoid an image repeating itself 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:43.849
 as if, well, we're part of it 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.989
 so after the dimensions 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.799
 of the work plan 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.799
 then came for added what is the filter 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:55.139
 so black and white is stone 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.769
 negative 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.529
 everywhere so place of two currently 

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:02.049
 so the color figure 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.489
 and the trend words that we must dissociate the two 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.489
 either you put the tent 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.989
 so that redefine all the colors 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.169
 or you apply a color filter and in this case I am 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.599
 as expectations 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:19.569
 as if if 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:23.369
 and conversely if I saw the time I'm removing the color filters and 

00:04:23.369 --> 00:04:26.439
 I modify the tent 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:29.270
 then you have the civilized philippics 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.430
 so more or less pixelated 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.409
 the blur effect 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:35.669
 so more or less blurred 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.990
 so I show you quickly 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.590
 exemplary simplicity 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.590
 two formatting 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:51.969
 like this or that added 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:54.969
 outlines 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.139
 after gray head room 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.990
 then to give a little style 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.990
 I used a saw do you think 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.289
 to make small dunes simply 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.339
 as a society 

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:22.809
 and so for once you're done so you can all erased for 

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:25.069
 to start over 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.709
 or then you can save the image by publishing suicide if you want
