00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.059
 How are you guys since it's Monday again 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.160
 and we return as not with our 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.300
 application program and games for 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.490
 iphone and ipad 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.410
 today we have prepared you as always a 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.289
 selection of apps that we liked 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.650
 so let's start the program of this 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.650
 week 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.359
 good good guys sure you have 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.849
 ever seen that effect that allows 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.460
 merge two faces and create a third 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.730
 individual with mixed features of the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.980
 two original photos is for that same 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.340
 what this week's application 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.469
 allows to be called face fusion and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.260
 prepared as a person would be 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.930
 known or yourselves with traits of 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.149
 another because surely ye shall die of 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.430
 laughter 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.379
 face fusion is an application 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.809
 sensational that allows us the commented thing 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.540
 that is, we take a picture of the face of 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:04.210
 two different people making sure of 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.040
 that are not in profile once taken 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.869
 we adjust the markers of the 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.530
 application where it indicates and 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.000
 we continue with the merger process 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.640
 face fusion has an algorithm 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.650
 quite accomplished that takes references from 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.110
 both faces and fuses them in such a way 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.450
 that manages to create a third face in 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.789
 the one that mixes the original features 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.539
 of both the result as you see is 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:30.030
 brutal 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:32.399
 at the end of processing the merger this 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.799
 tool allows us to correct some 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.200
 peculiarities of the masks see 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.210
 variations of the original merger as 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.810
 You can check with your own 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.340
 photos the results are sometimes 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.340
 unsuspected to try it and tell us 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.900
 when we say that the market of 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.210
 video game is changing is clear 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.700
 that we refer to titles like 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.680
 risk we put a game created by the 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.930
 I study Spanish digital legends and 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.460
 funded by zynga that despite 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.280
 take a while followed in the appstore 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.660
 it gets back among the most downloaded 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.660
 on iphone and ipad 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.250
 available is a style shooter 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.520
 cartoon that sure reminds you of games 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.770
 as team fortress 2 or battlefield 2 the 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.360
 title has an offline mode in the 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.330
 that we will have to complete 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.910
 missions and individual challenges in addition to 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.280
 an online and multiplayer mode in which 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.090
 we will enter to fight in an all against 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.280
 all or in rounds by teams in what 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.620
 respect to characters all start from the 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.750
 same model and only through improvements 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.090
 we can modify the appearance of 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.730
 skills or the equipment of it 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.040
 each improvement can be acquired with the 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.170
 money earned by own merit in 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.170
 each mission or through micropayments 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.290
 I usually do not usually support the system 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.900
 of controls of this type of games in 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.060
 a touch screen however in 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.430
 available for iphone and ipad has been 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.989
 worked a lot in this aspect and 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.269
 although at first glance 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.819
 appear similar to other games of the 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.950
 style the creators have implemented a 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.439
 small aiming assistant for 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.200
 keep the target more or less at shot 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:22.319
 but beware that it is not auto in just one 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.689
 amazing graphics assistant is a 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.659
 casual style a sound section 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:29.819
 sample available to them offers what 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:33.139
 that one can expect from the new 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.139
 generation of mobile games 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.180
 the mobile applications market 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.280
 It gives great opportunities to 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.260
 independent developers who 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.600
 they seek to make a living with their ideas 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.730
 for this it is necessary to have 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.710
 programming knowledge but 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.750
 also with a clear vision of what 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.570
 we want to do how we are going to present 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.230
 and how would I have to answer facing 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:03.900
 user as well a booker for ipad 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.600
 offers precisely a graphic environment 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.970
 to create and design models of 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.160
 applications for iphone and ipad e 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.190
 interact between screens and elements 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.410
 that is, sugar gives us dozens of 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.299
 interface elements of them and a 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.000
 system for organizing screens 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.650
 interactive sensational so that without 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.960
 have to write a single line of 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.480
 code we can see how our 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.260
 application what elements should have how 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:34.060
 respond to our action and others 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.070
 basically a booker for ipad is a 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.350
 editor and application simulator for 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.380
 them with which we can emulate our 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.240
 application to be able to subsequently 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.480
 add the necessary code lines 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.700
 from the editor of makos the best of 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.860
 Acucar is that it allows us to export the 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.440
 simulation of application to a pdf 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.290
 we can create a project legend and 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.360
 others no doubt a great application for 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.350
 Start programming your own application 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.350
 for them 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.850
 as I have always said the games that most 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.250
 success they have on mobile platforms 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.590
 are those that offer an experience 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.320
 simple without complications at the level of 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.810
 plot and with a casual style and 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.240
 clear having all these requirements 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:25.010
 candi meleon could not pass by 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.010
 this week's section 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.210
 candy meliÃ¡ is the name of a game very 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.910
 addictive in which we control a 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.400
 nice and sweet chameleon that you 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.350
 love the candies luckily I had 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.380
 near a factory of these rich 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.540
 goodies and has blown up now 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.550
 candy meleon has to take advantage and 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.040
 eat all the candy you can 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.290
 before they reach the ground to 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.660
 move it to the sides we will use the 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.910
 iphone or ipad accelerometer while 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.070
 that to catch them we will only need 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.260
 touch the screen and candy melee a 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:02.140
 throw to his long tongue 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.510
 the more candies we eat the more points 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.450
 we will win what will allow us to buy 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.040
 a lot of power apps plus candy 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:13.560
 million may increase your skills 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.560
 with certain colored candies 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.710
 eye because to hinder the departure 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.720
 we will have to dodge dozens of 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.360
 elements conscientiously put 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.000
 they will try to hit us like a 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.569
 sensational and addictive game for iphone 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.789
 and ipad 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:32.159
 Well, guys, so far, the program 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:34.169
 today as always we hope that you 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:36.449
 have liked the applications and 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:39.589
 we come back next Monday with more 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:39.589
 apps a greeting 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.240
 i
