dogs<00:00:04.990> are<00:00:05.230> a<00:00:05.260> part<00:00:05.590> of<00:00:05.710> our<00:00:05.890> everyday<00:00:06.190> lives

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:06.520 
dogs are a part of our everyday lives

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.580 
dogs are a part of our everyday lives
but<00:00:07.240> how<00:00:07.420> did<00:00:07.660> they<00:00:07.810> evolve<00:00:08.110> into<00:00:08.500> the

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
but how did they evolve into the

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.640 
but how did they evolve into the
different<00:00:08.950> breeds<00:00:09.130> we<00:00:09.370> see<00:00:09.580> around<00:00:09.700> us<00:00:10.000> today

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
different breeds we see around us today

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.049 
different breeds we see around us today
to<00:00:11.650> find<00:00:11.680> the<00:00:12.070> answer<00:00:12.400> we<00:00:12.639> must<00:00:12.670> take<00:00:13.030> a

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
to find the answer we must take a

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.609 
to find the answer we must take a
journey<00:00:13.389> back<00:00:13.510> through<00:00:13.990> thousands<00:00:14.469> of<00:00:14.559> years

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:14.619 
journey back through thousands of years

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:16.680 
journey back through thousands of years
when<00:00:15.219> early<00:00:15.549> humans<00:00:15.969> were<00:00:16.090> hunters<00:00:16.480> and

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:16.690 
when early humans were hunters and

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.769 
when early humans were hunters and
gatherers<00:00:16.720> as<00:00:17.580> humans<00:00:18.580> hunted<00:00:19.000> wolves<00:00:19.480> would

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
gatherers as humans hunted wolves would

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.660 
gatherers as humans hunted wolves would
follow<00:00:20.019> eating<00:00:20.710> the<00:00:20.800> scraps<00:00:21.099> of<00:00:21.279> food<00:00:21.460> they

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
follow eating the scraps of food they

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.589 
follow eating the scraps of food they
left<00:00:21.849> behind

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:22.599 
left behind

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.779 
left behind
eventually<00:00:23.410> the<00:00:23.859> humans<00:00:24.250> started<00:00:24.580> hunting

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
eventually the humans started hunting

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.519 
eventually the humans started hunting
with<00:00:25.119> the<00:00:25.300> wolves<00:00:25.630> and<00:00:25.750> sharing<00:00:26.109> food<00:00:26.320> with

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
with the wolves and sharing food with

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.060 
with the wolves and sharing food with
them<00:00:26.769> basically<00:00:27.640> over<00:00:28.599> time<00:00:29.009> humans<00:00:30.009> have

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
them basically over time humans have

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.220 
them basically over time humans have
sort<00:00:30.369> of<00:00:30.490> allowed<00:00:30.910> dogs<00:00:31.419> to<00:00:31.720> come<00:00:31.900> into<00:00:32.050> their

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
sort of allowed dogs to come into their

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.569 
sort of allowed dogs to come into their
village<00:00:32.439> and<00:00:32.829> especially<00:00:33.220> if<00:00:33.400> they<00:00:33.520> were

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
village and especially if they were

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.810 
village and especially if they were
helpful<00:00:33.910> they<00:00:34.600> let<00:00:34.810> them<00:00:34.960> live<00:00:35.290> and<00:00:35.680> and<00:00:36.130> breed

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
helpful they let them live and and breed

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.060 
helpful they let them live and and breed
and<00:00:37.090> over<00:00:37.630> time<00:00:37.840> that<00:00:37.870> breeding<00:00:38.470> became<00:00:38.770> more

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
and over time that breeding became more

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.500 
and over time that breeding became more
and<00:00:39.160> more<00:00:39.220> sophisticated<00:00:39.490> so<00:00:40.210> that<00:00:40.330> they<00:00:40.420> were

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
and more sophisticated so that they were

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.270 
and more sophisticated so that they were
actually<00:00:40.630> choosing<00:00:41.320> dogs<00:00:41.560> did<00:00:41.920> things<00:00:42.190> that

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
actually choosing dogs did things that

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.100 
actually choosing dogs did things that
were<00:00:42.430> useful<00:00:42.610> to<00:00:42.910> them<00:00:43.060> like<00:00:43.540> help<00:00:43.780> them<00:00:43.930> hunt

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
were useful to them like help them hunt

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.370 
were useful to them like help them hunt
or<00:00:44.590> help<00:00:44.890> them<00:00:45.150> herd<00:00:46.150> their<00:00:46.450> herd<00:00:46.810> animals

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
or help them herd their herd animals

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.010 
or help them herd their herd animals
like<00:00:47.590> sheep<00:00:47.920> or<00:00:48.190> cattle<00:00:48.370> and<00:00:48.760> so<00:00:49.450> you<00:00:49.900> know

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
like sheep or cattle and so you know

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.350 
like sheep or cattle and so you know
over<00:00:50.230> time<00:00:50.650> it's<00:00:51.100> this<00:00:51.310> artificial<00:00:52.030> selection

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
over time it's this artificial selection

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.170 
over time it's this artificial selection
process<00:00:53.020> of<00:00:53.170> humans<00:00:53.680> choosing<00:00:54.160> which<00:00:54.640> animals

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
process of humans choosing which animals

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.820 
process of humans choosing which animals
would<00:00:55.390> live<00:00:55.630> in<00:00:55.840> which<00:00:56.020> ones<00:00:56.260> would<00:00:56.470> breed

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
would live in which ones would breed

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.920 
would live in which ones would breed
that<00:00:57.400> leads<00:00:57.940> to<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.210> artificial<00:00:58.540> selection

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
that leads to the artificial selection

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.140 
that leads to the artificial selection
and<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.410> blend<00:00:59.950> the<00:01:00.190> formation<00:01:00.910> of<00:01:00.970> these

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
and the blend the formation of these

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.120 
and the blend the formation of these
different<00:01:01.510> breeds<00:01:01.720> through<00:01:02.710> artificial

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
different breeds through artificial

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.490 
different breeds through artificial
selection<00:01:03.610> humans<00:01:04.360> gradually<00:01:04.900> selected<00:01:05.379> the

selection humans gradually selected the

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.109 
selection humans gradually selected the
traits<00:01:05.770> they<00:01:06.009> wanted<00:01:06.400> and<00:01:06.580> created<00:01:07.000> the

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
traits they wanted and created the

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.440

breeds<00:01:07.360> we<00:01:07.540> have<00:01:07.750> today<00:01:08.110> so<00:01:09.450> natural

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
breeds we have today so natural

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.160 
breeds we have today so natural
selection<00:01:10.570> is<00:01:10.930> just<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.230> process<00:01:11.710> of<00:01:12.310> nature

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
selection is just the process of nature

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.690 
selection is just the process of nature
deciding<00:01:14.170> which<00:01:14.410> animals<00:01:14.920> survived<00:01:15.400> and

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
deciding which animals survived and

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.800 
deciding which animals survived and
which<00:01:15.820> ones<00:01:16.030> reproduce

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
which ones reproduce

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.540 
which ones reproduce
well<00:01:17.020> artificial<00:01:17.650> selection<00:01:17.860> is<00:01:18.130> very<00:01:18.370> much

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
well artificial selection is very much

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.100 
well artificial selection is very much
the<00:01:18.730> same<00:01:18.760> and<00:01:19.120> it<00:01:19.180> leads<00:01:19.360> to<00:01:19.450> evolution<00:01:19.659> in

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
the same and it leads to evolution in

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.260 
the same and it leads to evolution in
very<00:01:20.320> much<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.650> same<00:01:20.830> way<00:01:21.070> but<00:01:21.640> it's<00:01:21.760> humans

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
very much the same way but it's humans

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.750 
very much the same way but it's humans
that<00:01:22.450> decide<00:01:22.780> which<00:01:23.080> animals<00:01:23.590> live<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:24.130> which

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
that decide which animals live and which

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.880 
that decide which animals live and which
animals<00:01:25.240> can<00:01:25.420> breed<00:01:25.690> with<00:01:25.720> each<00:01:26.020> other<00:01:26.230> but

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
animals can breed with each other but

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.260 
animals can breed with each other but
because<00:01:27.040> they've<00:01:27.460> been<00:01:27.610> under<00:01:27.730> artificial

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
because they've been under artificial

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.630 
because they've been under artificial
selection<00:01:28.510> for<00:01:28.870> so<00:01:29.020> long<00:01:29.230> they've<00:01:29.980> evolved

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
selection for so long they've evolved

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.000 
selection for so long they've evolved
down<00:01:30.790> these<00:01:30.940> separate<00:01:31.510> evolutionary<00:01:32.320> paths

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
down these separate evolutionary paths

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.010 
down these separate evolutionary paths
if<00:01:33.370> you<00:01:33.490> will<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:33.940> so<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.450> dog<00:01:34.630> breeds<00:01:34.900> are

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
if you will and so the dog breeds are

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.170 
if you will and so the dog breeds are
still<00:01:35.200> very<00:01:35.710> different<00:01:36.490> and<00:01:36.909> you<00:01:37.000> can

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
still very different and you can

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.120 
still very different and you can
recognize<00:01:37.390> them<00:01:37.810> easily<00:01:38.320> but<00:01:38.770> we<00:01:38.890> still

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
recognize them easily but we still

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.010 
recognize them easily but we still
consider<00:01:39.460> them<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.820> same<00:01:40.060> species<00:01:40.420> because

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
consider them the same species because

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.660 
consider them the same species because
they<00:01:41.050> can<00:01:41.409> interbreed<00:01:41.800> with<00:01:42.250> one<00:01:42.430> another

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
they can interbreed with one another

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.300 
they can interbreed with one another
with<00:01:43.510> their<00:01:43.690> short<00:01:44.040> water-resistant<00:01:45.040> coats

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
with their short water-resistant coats

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.090 
with their short water-resistant coats
and<00:01:45.580> webbed<00:01:45.880> feet<00:01:46.440> Labradors<00:01:47.440> were<00:01:47.830> bred<00:01:48.070> as

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
and webbed feet Labradors were bred as

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.180 
and webbed feet Labradors were bred as
gun<00:01:48.490> dogs<00:01:48.760> and<00:01:49.030> waterfowl<00:01:49.540> retrievers<00:01:50.200> the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
gun dogs and waterfowl retrievers the

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
gun dogs and waterfowl retrievers the
dogs<00:01:51.430> that<00:01:51.700> were<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:51.940> most<00:01:52.120> adept

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
dogs that were the most adept

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.240 
dogs that were the most adept

we<00:02:47.090> can<00:02:47.240> see<00:02:47.270> many<00:02:47.660> differences<00:02:48.200> between

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
we can see many differences between

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.320 
we can see many differences between
modern<00:02:49.070> domestic<00:02:49.520> dog<00:02:49.700> breeds<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.210> their

modern domestic dog breeds and their

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.780 
modern domestic dog breeds and their
wolf<00:02:50.540> ancestors<00:02:50.960> well<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:52.100> differences<00:02:52.550> can

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
wolf ancestors well the differences can

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.060 
wolf ancestors well the differences can
be<00:02:52.850> very<00:02:53.210> subtle<00:02:53.510> because<00:02:54.020> because<00:02:54.620> domestic

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
be very subtle because because domestic

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.800 
be very subtle because because domestic
dogs<00:02:55.280> are<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.790> descendants<00:02:56.240> of<00:02:56.360> wolves<00:02:56.570> so

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
dogs are the descendants of wolves so

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.210 
dogs are the descendants of wolves so
they<00:02:56.930> have<00:02:57.050> a<00:02:57.080> lot<00:02:57.260> of<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.410> same<00:02:57.620> genes<00:02:57.920> in<00:02:58.160> the

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
they have a lot of the same genes in the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.060 
they have a lot of the same genes in the
same<00:02:58.400> skull<00:02:58.880> elements<00:02:59.450> but<00:03:00.350> over<00:03:00.560> time<00:03:00.770> we've

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
same skull elements but over time we've

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.280 
same skull elements but over time we've
selected<00:03:01.280> them<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:02.239> do<00:03:02.390> different<00:03:02.810> things<00:03:02.840> and

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
selected them to do different things and

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.650 
selected them to do different things and
so<00:03:03.530> one<00:03:03.680> of<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.830> major<00:03:03.980> differences<00:03:04.300> is<00:03:05.300> that

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
so one of the major differences is that

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.630 
so one of the major differences is that
the<00:03:06.050> muzzle<00:03:06.290> tends<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.770> be<00:03:06.890> longer<00:03:07.190> or<00:03:07.550> shorter

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
the muzzle tends to be longer or shorter

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.240 
the muzzle tends to be longer or shorter
in<00:03:08.239> some<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:09.260> attachment<00:03:09.709> of<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:09.800> muscles

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
that close the jaws can be you know

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.949 
that close the jaws can be you know
stronger<00:03:12.890> in<00:03:13.010> some<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.430> weaker<00:03:13.760> in<00:03:13.790> some<00:03:14.090> and
