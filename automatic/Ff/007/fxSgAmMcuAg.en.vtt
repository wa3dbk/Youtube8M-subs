yeah what's the difference it should be

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.599

the same thing for beating up a kid
period<00:04:21.419> I<00:04:21.600> don't<00:04:21.810> think<00:04:21.930> there<00:04:22.049> should<00:04:22.079> be<00:04:22.260> a

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
period I don't think there should be a

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.260 
period I don't think there should be a
hate<00:04:22.440> crime<00:04:22.620> law<00:04:22.800> well<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.520> just<00:04:23.639> think<00:04:24.030> the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
hate crime law well I just think the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.879 
hate crime law well I just think the
current<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.840> penalties<00:04:25.229> are<00:04:25.380> too<00:04:25.500> soft<00:04:25.680> to

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
current the penalties are too soft to

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.230 
current the penalties are too soft to
begin<00:04:26.130> with<00:04:26.280> but<00:04:26.580> do<00:04:26.699> you<00:04:26.790> think<00:04:27.000> you're

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
begin with but do you think you're

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.490 
begin with but do you think you're
