00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
coming over some the major parts that I

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.660 
coming over some the major parts that I
saw<00:00:42.989> once<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.649> really<00:00:43.890> liked<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.070> most<00:00:44.280> and

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
saw once I really liked the most and

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.080 
saw once I really liked the most and
starting<00:00:45.450> off<00:00:45.570> with<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.050> one<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.710> really<00:00:47.700> like

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
starting off with the one I really like

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.170 
starting off with the one I really like
the<00:00:48.379> armor<00:00:49.379> as<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.399> can<00:00:50.550> see<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> picture<00:00:51.120> in

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
the screen there is armor now I think

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.540 
the screen there is armor now I think
it's<00:00:54.059> not<00:00:54.210> just<00:00:54.449> straight-up<00:00:54.780> um<00:00:55.309> health<00:00:56.309> it's

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
it's not just straight-up um health it's

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.430 
it's not just straight-up um health it's
you<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.090> armor<00:00:57.329> net<00:00:57.449> which<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.570> really<00:00:57.989> cool

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
it's kind of bringing um a little bit of

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.510 
it's kind of bringing um a little bit of
Halo<00:01:01.320> into<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:01.890> some<00:01:01.980> other<00:01:02.070> games<00:01:02.309> that

but<00:01:20.100> another<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.729> really<00:01:21.360> really

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
but another one that I really really

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.770 
but another one that I really really
liked<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.439> saw<00:01:22.830> was<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.939> squad's

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
liked and saw was the squad's

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.140 
liked and saw was the squad's
the<00:01:25.049> deployables<00:01:25.650> squads<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.729> get<00:01:26.909> I

am<00:02:22.920> just<00:02:23.190> kind<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.370> guessing<00:02:23.580> this<00:02:23.880> one<00:02:24.090> is

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
am just kind of guessing this one is

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.320 
am just kind of guessing this one is
with<00:02:24.989> riot<00:02:25.290> shields<00:02:25.670> yes<00:02:26.670> they<00:02:26.910> are<00:02:26.940> back

with riot shields yes they are back

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.940 
with riot shields yes they are back
because<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.840> can<00:02:27.930> see<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.290> Chow<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:28.800> this

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
because you can see the Chow in this

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.410 
because you can see the Chow in this
juggernaut<00:02:29.459> clip<00:02:31.040> they<00:02:32.040> are<00:02:32.310> back<00:02:33.000> and

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
juggernaut clip they are back and

juggernaut clip they are back and
they're<00:02:34.380> gonna<00:02:34.530> be<00:02:34.650> use<00:02:34.830> kind<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.250> really<00:02:35.910> well

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
they're gonna be use kind of really well

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.839 
they're gonna be use kind of really well
so<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.190> really<00:02:38.790> hope<00:02:39.050> it's<00:02:40.050> gonna<00:02:40.380> be<00:02:40.560> um<00:02:40.849> like

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
so I really hope it's gonna be um like

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.120 
so I really hope it's gonna be um like

put together so now it's not just an
endless<00:02:44.690> machine<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:46.050> can<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.319> can<00:02:46.350> just

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
endless machine that can you can just

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.160 
endless machine that can you can just
push<00:02:46.950> forward<00:02:46.980> with<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:47.790> not<00:02:47.970> get<00:02:48.180> killed<00:02:48.420> now

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170
