don't<00:00:13.170> know<00:00:13.230> what<00:00:13.500> you're<00:00:13.620> seeing<00:00:13.769> right<00:00:13.860> now

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
don't know what you're seeing right now

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.430 
don't know what you're seeing right now
because<00:00:14.429> for<00:00:14.580> some<00:00:14.790> reason<00:00:14.820> my<00:00:15.440> preview

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
because for some reason my preview

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.890 
because for some reason my preview
window<00:00:17.310> as<00:00:17.670> I'm<00:00:17.940> saying<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.420> isn't<00:00:18.690> working

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
window as I'm saying this isn't working

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.120 
window as I'm saying this isn't working
correctly<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.590> it's<00:00:19.680> taking<00:00:19.859> forever<00:00:20.010> to

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
correctly and it's taking forever to

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.070 
correctly and it's taking forever to
load<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.060> decided<00:00:21.359> just<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.600> cut<00:00:21.779> my<00:00:21.900> losses

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
load so I decided just to cut my losses

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.990 
load so I decided just to cut my losses
and<00:00:22.320> start<00:00:22.680> off<00:00:22.769> do<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.310> anyway<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.609> usually

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
and start off do it anyway I usually

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.310 
and start off do it anyway I usually
don't<00:00:24.090> talk<00:00:24.240> about<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.539> gameplay<00:00:24.720> too<00:00:25.080> much

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
don't talk about the gameplay too much

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.050 
don't talk about the gameplay too much
so<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.279> shouldn't<00:00:26.490> be<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.580> much<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.910> loss

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
so it shouldn't be that much of a loss

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.910 
so it shouldn't be that much of a loss
but<00:00:28.019> yeah<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.439> gameplay<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.830> pretty

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
but yeah the gameplay is pretty

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.820 
but yeah the gameplay is pretty
entertaining<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.730> think<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:31.470> addition<00:00:31.590> to

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
entertaining I think and in addition to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.860 
entertaining I think and in addition to
that<00:00:32.070> there<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.759> surprise<00:00:33.120> ending<00:00:33.360> which

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
that there is a surprise ending which

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.590 
that there is a surprise ending which
I'm<00:00:33.989> going<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.200> ruin<00:00:34.380> right<00:00:34.649> now<00:00:34.910> I<00:00:35.910> get<00:00:36.329> going

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
I'm going to ruin right now I get going

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.240 
I'm going to ruin right now I get going
really<00:00:36.750> well<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.200> think<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.680> final<00:00:37.829> score<00:00:38.219> of

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
really well I think the final score of

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.630 
really well I think the final score of
this<00:00:38.489> game<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.760> like<00:00:38.820> 12<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.239> one<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:40.309> i<00:00:41.309> think

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
this game is like 12 and one and i think

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.880 
this game is like 12 and one and i think
i<00:00:41.820> only<00:00:42.000> play<00:00:42.120> three<00:00:42.450> rounds<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
i only play three rounds and in the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.889 
i only play three rounds and in the
middle<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.250> fourth<00:00:44.550> round<00:00:44.809> when<00:00:45.809> I'm

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
middle of the fourth round when I'm

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.240 
middle of the fourth round when I'm
about<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.200> win<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.559> make<00:00:46.649> out<00:00:46.739> like<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.890> 40

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
about to win and make out like a 40

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.389 
about to win and make out like a 40
sweep<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.329> nice<00:00:48.510> win<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.620> other<00:00:49.739> team<00:00:49.950> was

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
sweep a nice win the other team was

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.889 
sweep a nice win the other team was
giving<00:00:50.910> me<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> lot<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.210> lip<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.570> whole<00:00:51.719> game

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
and they dashboard so that's kind of

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.810 
and they dashboard so that's kind of
aggravating<00:00:55.860> when<00:00:56.160> you're<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.610> middle<00:00:56.760> of

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.909 
a great fourth of July a little bit of
an<00:03:03.910> update<00:03:04.120> on<00:03:04.329> my<00:03:04.569> ear<00:03:04.780> I<00:03:05.049> am<00:03:05.410> very<00:03:05.590> fortunate

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:05.919 
an update on my ear I am very fortunate

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.729 
an update on my ear I am very fortunate
I<00:03:06.400> actually<00:03:07.230> took<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.349> lot<00:03:08.500> of<00:03:08.530> precautions

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
I actually took a lot of precautions

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.650 
I actually took a lot of precautions
with<00:03:09.370> my<00:03:09.489> ear<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.910> I<00:03:10.000> prevented<00:03:10.540> it<00:03:10.630> from

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
with my ear and I prevented it from

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.680 
with my ear and I prevented it from
busting<00:03:11.169> and<00:03:11.380> just<00:03:12.040> rupturing<00:03:12.849> and<00:03:13.239> so<00:03:13.419> that's

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
busting and just rupturing and so that's

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.059 
busting and just rupturing and so that's
great<00:03:13.989> news<00:03:14.169> it<00:03:14.440> means<00:03:14.590> I'm<00:03:14.680> not<00:03:14.799> going<00:03:14.919> to<00:03:14.980> be

gameplay but as I've set up an out of

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.030 
gameplay but as I've set up an out of
town<00:04:01.970> I<00:04:02.000> haven't<00:04:02.390> had<00:04:02.480> much<00:04:02.630> chance<00:04:03.170> and<00:04:03.620> this

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
town I haven't had much chance and this

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.559 
town I haven't had much chance and this
game<00:04:04.340> has<00:04:04.489> been<00:04:04.580> on<00:04:04.640> my<00:04:04.760> hard<00:04:04.940> drive<00:04:04.970> for<00:04:05.300> a<00:04:05.360> few

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569

probably<00:04:06.110> about<00:04:06.200> a<00:04:06.260> week<00:04:06.290> now<00:04:06.440> and<00:04:06.769> so<00:04:07.519> I

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
probably about a week now and so I

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.360 
probably about a week now and so I

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
are fun to use and people complained

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.259 
are fun to use and people complained
about<00:04:12.050> him<00:04:12.230> a<00:04:12.319> lot<00:04:12.410> which<00:04:12.590> I<00:04:12.709> don't<00:04:12.769> get

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
about him a lot which I don't get

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.060 
about him a lot which I don't get
because<00:04:14.269> I<00:04:14.510> mean<00:04:14.660> they're<00:04:15.410> not<00:04:15.560> very<00:04:15.799> good

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
because I mean they're not very good

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.069 
because I mean they're not very good
they're<00:04:16.579> just<00:04:16.790> not<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.209> range<00:04:17.479> is<00:04:17.780> abysmal

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
they're just not the range is abysmal

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.120 
they're just not the range is abysmal
it's<00:04:18.530> horrible<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:20.150> I<00:04:20.959> mean<00:04:21.680> if<00:04:21.769> you<00:04:21.859> get<00:04:22.010> in

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
it's horrible and I mean if you get in

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.159 
it's horrible and I mean if you get in
the<00:04:22.220> same<00:04:22.430> room<00:04:22.639> akimbo<00:04:23.300> Rangers<00:04:23.780> versus<00:04:24.050> a<00:04:24.139> a

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
the same room akimbo Rangers versus a a

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.830 
the same room akimbo Rangers versus a a
12<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.770> eight<00:04:24.889> well<00:04:25.250> that<00:04:25.520> takes<00:04:25.760> it<00:04:26.030> nine<00:04:26.660> out

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
12 the eight well that takes it nine out

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.810 
12 the eight well that takes it nine out
of<00:04:26.930> ten<00:04:27.110> times<00:04:27.350> its<00:04:27.680> I<00:04:28.100> think<00:04:28.400> it<00:04:28.490> actually<00:04:28.580> has

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
of ten times its I think it actually has

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.190 
of ten times its I think it actually has
a<00:04:28.850> little<00:04:29.000> bit<00:04:29.090> more<00:04:29.240> range<00:04:29.419> than<00:04:29.570> the<00:04:29.720> Rangers

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
a little bit more range than the Rangers

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.190 
a little bit more range than the Rangers
higher<00:04:30.979> clip<00:04:31.280> size<00:04:31.490> faster<00:04:32.030> fire<00:04:32.270> rate<00:04:32.630> not

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
higher clip size faster fire rate not

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.480 
higher clip size faster fire rate not
faster<00:04:33.530> fire<00:04:33.710> right<00:04:33.919> depending<00:04:34.100> on<00:04:34.310> how<00:04:34.430> you

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
faster fire right depending on how you

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.719 
faster fire right depending on how you
switch<00:04:35.150> your<00:04:35.180> fingers<00:04:35.510> up<00:04:35.660> but<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:37.430> I<00:04:37.520> think

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
switch your fingers up but and I think

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.909 
switch your fingers up but and I think
it<00:04:37.790> even<00:04:38.000> has<00:04:38.240> more<00:04:38.479> power<00:04:38.660> maybe<00:04:39.320> the<00:04:39.830> only

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
it even has more power maybe the only

gotten so far was a like six and one but

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.830 
gotten so far was a like six and one but
it<00:05:15.050> ended<00:05:15.289> too<00:05:15.410> quick<00:05:15.680> can't<00:05:15.919> use<00:05:16.100> that<00:05:16.130> and
