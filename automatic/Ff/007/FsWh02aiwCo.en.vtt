00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
stone you put cobblestone in furnace and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.880 
stone you put cobblestone in furnace and
smelt<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.370> with<00:00:38.370> coal<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.030> as<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.379> see<00:00:40.410> if

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
smelt it with coal and as you can see if

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.069 
smelt it with coal and as you can see if
you<00:00:41.010> come<00:00:41.190> here<00:00:41.460> nothing's<00:00:42.450> happening<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
you come here nothing's happening the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.840 
you come here nothing's happening the
color<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.410> not<00:00:43.559> changing<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.160> diamond

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
color is not changing in the diamond

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.869 
color is not changing in the diamond
meter<00:00:45.590> that's<00:00:46.590> because<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.010> only<00:00:47.160> works<00:00:47.640> on

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
meter that's because it only works on

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.060 
meter that's because it only works on
diamond<00:00:48.390> door<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.260> if<00:00:49.320> we<00:00:49.379> head<00:00:49.590> over<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
diamond door so if we head over to the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.250 
diamond door so if we head over to the
diamond<00:00:50.430> door<00:00:50.579> as<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:51.600> one<00:00:51.989> block

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
diamond door as you can see one block

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.200 
diamond door as you can see one block
away<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.829> green<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.550> that's<00:00:53.879> because<00:00:53.969> we're

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
away is green and that's because we're

six to eight away is a red color nine is

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.780 
six to eight away is a red color nine is
none<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.960> let's<00:01:07.140> just<00:01:07.350> recap<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.799> one<00:01:08.670> away
