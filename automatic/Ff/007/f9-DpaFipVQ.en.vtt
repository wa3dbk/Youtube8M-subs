last video I did was an unboxing video

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.140 
last video I did was an unboxing video
of<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:06.150> Asus<00:00:06.600> n<00:00:06.859> fifty-six<00:00:07.859> jr.<00:00:08.220> this<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.030> a

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
of the Asus n fifty-six jr. this is a

of the Asus n fifty-six jr. this is a
sort<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.690> preview<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.230> that<00:00:10.590> I've<00:00:10.830> had<00:00:11.099> it

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
sort of a preview of that I've had it

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.839 
sort of a preview of that I've had it
now<00:00:11.280> for<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.120> bit<00:00:12.330> less<00:00:12.630> than<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.990> day<00:00:13.730> but<00:00:14.730> I'm

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
now for a bit less than a day but I'm

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.640 
now for a bit less than a day but I'm
still<00:00:15.150> able<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.570> provide<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:15.990> with<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.199> little

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
still able to provide you with a little

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.620 
still able to provide you with a little
bit<00:00:16.740> more<00:00:16.949> information<00:00:17.190> about<00:00:17.520> about<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
bit more information about about the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.500 
bit more information about about the
laptop<00:00:19.070> so<00:00:20.070> let's<00:00:20.279> get<00:00:20.430> started<00:00:20.880> first<00:00:21.090> we're

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
laptop so let's get started first we're

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.580 
laptop so let's get started first we're
going<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.689> talk<00:00:21.840> about<00:00:21.869> quickly<00:00:22.260> the

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
going to talk about quickly the

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.109 
going to talk about quickly the
processor<00:00:23.100> it's<00:00:24.029> an<00:00:24.210> Intel<00:00:24.660> Core<00:00:25.439> i7

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
processor it's an Intel Core i7

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.550 
processor it's an Intel Core i7
processor<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:28.050> specific<00:00:28.650> model<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.420> 4700<00:00:30.529> h-q

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
processor the specific model is 4700 h-q

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.310 
processor the specific model is 4700 h-q
so<00:00:31.890> HQ<00:00:32.669> stands<00:00:32.850> for<00:00:33.000> high<00:00:33.090> quality<00:00:33.149> it's<00:00:33.750> it's

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
so HQ stands for high quality it's it's

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.810 
so HQ stands for high quality it's it's
a<00:00:34.530> very<00:00:34.739> high-end<00:00:35.329> notebook<00:00:36.500> processor<00:00:37.820> it

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
a very high-end notebook processor it

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.209 
a very high-end notebook processor it
does<00:00:39.059> 2.4<00:00:39.899> gigahertz<00:00:40.170> but<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.710> think<00:00:41.070> it

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
does 2.4 gigahertz but I think it

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.910 
does 2.4 gigahertz but I think it
actually<00:00:41.370> has<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:42.329> turbo<00:00:42.989> boost<00:00:43.170> feature<00:00:43.469> which

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
actually has a turbo boost feature which

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.400 
actually has a turbo boost feature which
will<00:00:44.250> bump<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.210> up<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.360> just<00:00:45.750> above<00:00:46.050> 3

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
will bump it up to just above 3

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.020 
will bump it up to just above 3
gigahertz<00:00:49.039> until<00:00:50.039> now<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.489> been<00:00:50.670> it's<00:00:50.969> been

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
gigahertz until now it's been it's been

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.840 
gigahertz until now it's been it's been
fine<00:00:51.390> no<00:00:51.780> lag<00:00:51.809> when<00:00:52.620> browsing<00:00:52.890> websites<00:00:53.250> and

fine no lag when browsing websites and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.180

going<00:00:54.750> browsing<00:00:55.110> down<00:00:55.260> read<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.620> quickly<00:00:55.800> no

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
going browsing down read it quickly no

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.630 
going browsing down read it quickly no
no<00:00:56.579> problems<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:57.030> that

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
no problems with that

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.040 
no problems with that
relating<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.870> processor<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
relating to the processor is the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.319 
relating to the processor is the
graphics<00:01:01.530> card<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.160> GPU<00:01:02.640> here

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
graphics card so the GPU here

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.859 
graphics card so the GPU here
it's<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.930> geforce<00:01:04.379> gtx<00:01:05.000> 760<00:01:06.000> mm<00:01:06.420> now<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.720> is

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
it's the geforce gtx 760 mm now this is

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.530 
it's the geforce gtx 760 mm now this is
unusual<00:01:07.110> for<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> non<00:01:08.430> gaming<00:01:08.790> laptop<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.360> have

unusual for a non gaming laptop to have
the<00:01:09.720> gtx<00:01:10.729> GPU<00:01:11.729> but<00:01:12.060> actually<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.869> decided

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the gtx GPU but actually it is decided

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.070 
the gtx GPU but actually it is decided
with<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.070> laptop<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:15.630> better<00:01:15.840> have

with this laptop that it better have
some<00:01:16.229> power<00:01:16.439> not<00:01:16.970> actually<00:01:17.970> explain<00:01:18.299> why<00:01:18.720> that

some power not actually explain why that

on that yet they did promise i mean they

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.420 
on that yet they did promise i mean they
did<00:01:33.000> mention<00:01:33.390> on<00:01:33.829> notebook<00:01:34.829> check<00:01:35.070> and

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
did mention on notebook check and

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.270 
did mention on notebook check and
dot-com<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:37.259> should<00:01:37.680> be<00:01:37.829> able<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.100> run

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
dot-com that it should be able to run

battlefield 4 on high settings around 40
frames<00:01:42.570> per<00:01:42.869> second<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.740> sounds<00:01:44.189> very

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
frames per second so that sounds very

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.780 
frames per second so that sounds very
promising

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
promising

promising
i'm<00:01:44.939> very<00:01:45.060> excited<00:01:45.180> for<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:47.600> another<00:01:48.600> thing

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
i'm very excited for that another thing

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.840 
i'm very excited for that another thing
about<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.350> laptop<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:50.189> i<00:01:50.220> know<00:01:50.340> now<00:01:50.700> about

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
about this laptop that i know now about

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.310 
about this laptop that i know now about
is<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.509> hard<00:01:51.720> drive<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.829> hard<00:01:52.950> drive<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:54.320> 750

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
is the hard drive the hard drive is 750

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.940 
is the hard drive the hard drive is 750
gigabytes

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
gigabytes

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.580 
gigabytes
it's<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.939> very<00:01:57.420> basic<00:01:57.630> hard<00:01:58.020> drive<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.350> has<00:01:58.530> a

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it's a very basic hard drive it has a

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.520 
it's a very basic hard drive it has a
rotating<00:01:58.920> speed<00:01:59.490> just<00:02:00.090> over<00:02:00.360> 5,000<00:02:01.140> drops<00:02:01.350> per

rotating speed just over 5,000 drops per

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.350 
rotating speed just over 5,000 drops per
minute<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:01.950> it's<00:02:02.369> not<00:02:02.640> anything<00:02:02.969> great

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
minute so it's not anything great

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.039 
minute so it's not anything great
actually<00:02:03.840> when<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.079> go<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.500> windows

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
actually when you go to the windows

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.350 
actually when you go to the windows
performance<00:02:07.049> check<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.920> gives<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.459> 5.9<00:02:09.179> and

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
performance check it gives you a 5.9 and

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
it has only one solid piece here so the

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.990 
it has only one solid piece here so the
mouse<00:04:20.079> clicks<00:04:20.440> are<00:04:20.590> actually<00:04:21.039> very<00:04:21.579> silent

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
mouse clicks are actually very silent

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.680 
mouse clicks are actually very silent
and<00:04:22.120> they're<00:04:22.240> not

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
and they're not

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.900 
and they're not
buttons<00:04:23.170> it<00:04:23.620> does<00:04:23.830> support<00:04:24.220> three<00:04:24.520> fingers

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
buttons it does support three fingers

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.080 
buttons it does support three fingers
and<00:04:25.980> rotates<00:04:26.980> and<00:04:27.160> zooms<00:04:27.460> and<00:04:27.640> all<00:04:27.700> that<00:04:27.850> stuff

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
and rotates and zooms and all that stuff

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.630 
and rotates and zooms and all that stuff
but<00:04:28.330> I<00:04:28.810> haven't<00:04:29.290> played<00:04:29.620> around<00:04:30.340> with<00:04:30.430> that

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
but I haven't played around with that

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.580 
but I haven't played around with that
too<00:04:30.790> much<00:04:30.910> I<00:04:31.150> have<00:04:31.300> my<00:04:31.420> own<00:04:31.770> wired<00:04:32.770> mouth<00:04:33.040> so

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
too much I have my own wired mouth so

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.640 
too much I have my own wired mouth so
not<00:04:35.590> much<00:04:35.860> more<00:04:36.100> about<00:04:36.340> that<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:38.200> keyboard

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
not much more about that the keyboard

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.560 
not much more about that the keyboard
it's<00:04:38.920> very<00:04:39.190> soft<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:39.790> keys<00:04:39.970> are<00:04:40.120> not<00:04:40.270> hard

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
it's very soft the keys are not hard

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.030 
it's very soft the keys are not hard
like<00:04:40.630> they<00:04:40.960> were<00:04:41.020> in<00:04:41.290> my<00:04:41.440> value<00:04:41.800> but<00:04:41.950> they're

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
like they were in my value but they're

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.400 
like they were in my value but they're
actually<00:04:42.190> quite<00:04:42.400> comfortable<00:04:43.150> and<00:04:43.240> soft<00:04:43.540> I'll

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
actually quite comfortable and soft I'll

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.050 
actually quite comfortable and soft I'll
have<00:04:44.530> to<00:04:44.650> be<00:04:44.770> careful<00:04:45.130> not<00:04:45.250> to<00:04:45.310> scrape<00:04:45.700> them<00:04:45.940> or

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
have to be careful not to scrape them or

have to be careful not to scrape them or
scratch<00:04:46.330> them<00:04:46.540> too<00:04:46.840> much<00:04:47.020> and<00:04:47.260> they're<00:04:47.620> also

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
scratch them too much and they're also

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.260 
scratch them too much and they're also
very<00:04:48.040> silent<00:04:50.070> here's<00:04:51.070> a<00:04:51.130> full<00:04:51.490> numerical

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
very silent here's a full numerical

expect for 15.6 laptop so so very very

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.040 
expect for 15.6 laptop so so very very
nice<00:04:59.800> and<00:05:00.270> somewhat<00:05:01.270> typical<00:05:01.420> people<00:05:01.840> are

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
nice and somewhat typical people are

the next thing we're going to talk about

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.960 
the next thing we're going to talk about
quickly<00:05:07.210> is<00:05:07.390> the<00:05:07.600> sound<00:05:07.840> system<00:05:08.290> so<00:05:09.010> I've<00:05:09.760> had

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
quickly is the sound system so I've had

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.430 
quickly is the sound system so I've had
a<00:05:10.000> chance<00:05:10.300> to<00:05:10.450> listen<00:05:10.570> some<00:05:10.840> music<00:05:10.930> on<00:05:11.230> this

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
a chance to listen some music on this

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.980 
a chance to listen some music on this
and<00:05:12.430> with<00:05:12.670> the<00:05:12.820> subwoofer<00:05:13.120> especially<00:05:13.810> the

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
and with the subwoofer especially the

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.840 
and with the subwoofer especially the
sound<00:05:14.200> is<00:05:14.500> nice<00:05:14.860> it's<00:05:15.160> very<00:05:15.370> nice<00:05:15.550> for<00:05:15.820> a

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
sound is nice it's very nice for a

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.010 
sound is nice it's very nice for a
notebook<00:05:16.530> it's<00:05:17.530> a<00:05:18.060> sort<00:05:19.060> of<00:05:19.120> a<00:05:19.210> special<00:05:19.450> audio

don't<00:05:24.130> know<00:05:24.190> exactly<00:05:24.310> what<00:05:24.700> that<00:05:24.790> means<00:05:24.970> but

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
don't know exactly what that means but

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.920 
don't know exactly what that means but
it<00:05:25.240> sounds<00:05:25.510> pretty<00:05:25.720> cool<00:05:25.930> and<00:05:26.800> to<00:05:26.919> emphasize

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
it sounds pretty cool and to emphasize

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.480 
it sounds pretty cool and to emphasize
their<00:05:28.930> efforts<00:05:29.350> on<00:05:29.500> the<00:05:29.590> sound<00:05:29.860> they<00:05:30.160> actually

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
their efforts on the sound they actually

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.460 
their efforts on the sound they actually
made<00:05:30.669> an<00:05:30.820> extra<00:05:31.180> design<00:05:31.510> of<00:05:31.990> these<00:05:32.200> little

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
made an extra design of these little

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.409 
made an extra design of these little
circles<00:05:32.710> around<00:05:33.130> the<00:05:33.370> speakers<00:05:33.790> I<00:05:34.030> don't<00:05:34.360> know

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
circles around the speakers I don't know

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.150 
circles around the speakers I don't know
if<00:05:34.540> you<00:05:34.660> can<00:05:34.810> see<00:05:35.020> it<00:05:35.140> very<00:05:35.169> well<00:05:35.410> but<00:05:35.560> there's

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
if you can see it very well but there's

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.610 
if you can see it very well but there's
a<00:05:36.280> hole<00:05:36.940> here<00:05:36.970> actually<00:05:37.840> from<00:05:38.320> the<00:05:38.440> laptop

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
a hole here actually from the laptop

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.170 
a hole here actually from the laptop
they<00:05:39.100> actually<00:05:39.460> said<00:05:39.640> that<00:05:39.669> this<00:05:39.880> also

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
they actually said that this also

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.390 
they actually said that this also
increases<00:05:40.600> heat<00:05:41.140> dissipation<00:05:41.710> so<00:05:42.070> it<00:05:42.220> should

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
increases heat dissipation so it should

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.110 
increases heat dissipation so it should
keep<00:05:42.580> the<00:05:42.730> laptop<00:05:43.020> relatively<00:05:44.020> cool<00:05:45.120> talk

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
keep the laptop relatively cool talk

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.970 
keep the laptop relatively cool talk
about<00:05:46.390> cool<00:05:46.690> there's<00:05:47.260> the<00:05:47.560> primary

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:47.980 
about cool there's the primary

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.350 
about cool there's the primary
ventilation<00:05:48.490> shaft<00:05:48.700> here<00:05:48.880> on<00:05:48.940> the<00:05:49.030> left<00:05:49.210> but

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
ventilation shaft here on the left but

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.360 
ventilation shaft here on the left but
there<00:05:49.510> actually<00:05:49.600> is<00:05:50.020> a<00:05:50.230> right<00:05:50.560> one<00:05:50.830> here<00:05:51.160> also

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
there actually is a right one here also

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.420 
there actually is a right one here also
so<00:05:51.760> there's<00:05:51.970> two<00:05:52.150> ventilations<00:05:53.130> one<00:05:54.130> of<00:05:54.250> which

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
so there's two ventilations one of which

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.130 
so there's two ventilations one of which
is<00:05:54.610> always<00:05:54.940> active<00:05:55.330> and<00:05:55.570> the<00:05:55.810> other<00:05:55.960> one

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
is always active and the other one

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:02.640 
is always active and the other one
becomes<00:05:56.830> active<00:05:57.540> when<00:05:58.540> necessary<00:05:58.780> so<00:06:01.650> some

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
becomes active when necessary so some

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.710 
becomes active when necessary so some
miscellaneous<00:06:03.160> information<00:06:03.970> about<00:06:04.570> this

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
miscellaneous information about this

miscellaneous information about this
laptop<00:06:06.390> it<00:06:07.390> does<00:06:07.660> come<00:06:07.930> with<00:06:07.960> a<00:06:08.140> subwoofer

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380

deleting some of them as they do take

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.410 
deleting some of them as they do take
quite<00:07:02.170> a<00:07:02.230> lot<00:07:02.470> of<00:07:02.590> RAM<00:07:02.830> if<00:07:03.430> all<00:07:03.850> of<00:07:03.970> them<00:07:04.090> are<00:07:04.210> on

quite a lot of RAM if all of them are on
at<00:07:04.570> the<00:07:04.660> same<00:07:04.810> time

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 
at the same time

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.920 
at the same time
Sagara<00:07:05.860> actually<00:07:06.280> does<00:07:06.490> have<00:07:06.730> an<00:07:07.060> 8<00:07:07.390> gigabyte

you're not going to be your laptop also
another<00:07:35.890> thing<00:07:36.160> that<00:07:36.370> I'm<00:07:36.460> a<00:07:36.490> little<00:07:36.610> bit

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:36.970 
another thing that I'm a little bit

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.120 
another thing that I'm a little bit
disappointed<00:07:37.150> at<00:07:37.990> this<00:07:38.260> price<00:07:38.530> range<00:07:38.800> is<00:07:39.010> the

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:39.130 
disappointed at this price range is the

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.860 
disappointed at this price range is the
fact<00:07:39.340> that<00:07:39.460> it<00:07:39.550> doesn't<00:07:39.700> have<00:07:39.850> any<00:07:39.970> SSD<00:07:40.690> or

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:40.870 
fact that it doesn't have any SSD or

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.610 
fact that it doesn't have any SSD or
flash<00:07:41.170> memory<00:07:41.200> I<00:07:41.860> mean<00:07:42.370> only<00:07:42.490> has<00:07:42.730> that<00:07:43.620> 750

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:44.620 
flash memory I mean only has that 750

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.680 
flash memory I mean only has that 750
gigabyte<00:07:44.920> hard<00:07:45.280> drive<00:07:45.400> which<00:07:46.240> isn't<00:07:46.480> even

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:46.690 
gigabyte hard drive which isn't even

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.450 
gigabyte hard drive which isn't even
spinning<00:07:47.260> so<00:07:47.470> fast<00:07:47.500> so<00:07:47.920> it's<00:07:48.070> not<00:07:48.190> going<00:07:48.400> to

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:48.460 
spinning so fast so it's not going to

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.950 
spinning so fast so it's not going to
have<00:07:48.610> massive<00:07:49.710> information<00:07:50.710> transfer<00:07:51.070> speeds

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 
have massive information transfer speeds

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.410 
have massive information transfer speeds
but<00:07:52.960> you<00:07:53.200> know<00:07:53.350> you<00:07:53.890> get<00:07:54.550> rid<00:07:54.730> get<00:07:54.970> at<00:07:55.240> this

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:55.420 
but you know you get rid get at this

00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:01.170 
but you know you get rid get at this
price<00:07:56.460> which<00:07:57.460> is<00:07:57.580> around<00:07:57.790> 1000<00:07:58.540> euro<00:08:00.150> so<00:08:01.150> I

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:01.180 
price which is around 1000 euro so I

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.760 
price which is around 1000 euro so I
think<00:08:01.450> that's<00:08:01.600> gonna<00:08:01.720> be<00:08:01.810> all<00:08:02.050> for<00:08:02.290> my<00:08:02.380> preview

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:02.770 
think that's gonna be all for my preview

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.310 
think that's gonna be all for my preview
video<00:08:03.070> this<00:08:03.280> time<00:08:03.580> I<00:08:04.000> think<00:08:04.510> in<00:08:04.810> a<00:08:04.900> couple<00:08:05.050> days

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:05.320 
video this time I think in a couple days

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.550 
video this time I think in a couple days
I'll<00:08:05.680> be<00:08:05.740> making<00:08:06.280> a<00:08:06.460> very<00:08:06.760> detailed<00:08:07.150> review<00:08:07.990> so

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 
I'll be making a very detailed review so

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.340 
I'll be making a very detailed review so
one<00:08:08.770> more<00:08:08.950> video<00:08:09.130> of<00:08:09.370> this<00:08:09.550> but<00:08:10.300> until<00:08:10.810> now<00:08:11.050> I

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:11.350 
one more video of this but until now I

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.340 
one more video of this but until now I
just<00:08:11.380> say<00:08:11.770> peace<00:08:12.070> out
