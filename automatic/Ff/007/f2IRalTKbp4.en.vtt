00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.080 

now<00:00:00.480> I'm<00:00:00.630> going<00:00:00.810> to<00:00:00.900> show<00:00:01.110> you<00:00:01.140> how<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:02.090> base

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
now I'm going to show you how to base

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.249 
now I'm going to show you how to base
the<00:00:03.419> star<00:00:03.799> you<00:00:04.799> could<00:00:05.250> base<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.390> star<00:00:06.720> with

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
the star you could base the star with

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.089 
the star you could base the star with
thread<00:00:07.770> like<00:00:08.309> we<00:00:08.490> did<00:00:08.700> on<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.970> circle<00:00:09.679> but<00:00:10.679> I

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
thread like we did on the circle but I

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.520 
thread like we did on the circle but I
think<00:00:11.550> it<00:00:11.670> might<00:00:11.820> be<00:00:11.849> easier<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.900> use<00:00:12.929> a

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
think it might be easier to use a

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.180 
think it might be easier to use a
washable<00:00:14.009> glue<00:00:14.160> stick<00:00:14.900> to<00:00:15.900> do<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.139> basting<00:00:16.890> of

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
washable glue stick to do the basting of

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.910 
washable glue stick to do the basting of
the<00:00:17.820> star<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.720> once<00:00:18.960> again<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.500> reason<00:00:19.830> why

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
the star so once again the reason why

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.099 
the star so once again the reason why
I'm<00:00:20.010> basting<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.850> want<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.480> quarter<00:00:21.900> inch

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
I'm basting I want this quarter inch

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.620 
I'm basting I want this quarter inch
seam<00:00:22.439> allowance<00:00:22.500> out<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.580> way<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:24.449> it's

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
seam allowance out of the way so it's

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.929 
seam allowance out of the way so it's
easier<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.170> handle<00:00:25.500> when<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.010> go<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.369> apply<00:00:26.880> it

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
easier to handle when I go to apply it

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.480 
easier to handle when I go to apply it
so<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.930> first<00:00:28.109> thing<00:00:28.470> I'm<00:00:28.769> going<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.010> do<00:00:29.220> is

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
a needle and thread I kind of work my

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.500 
a needle and thread I kind of work my
way<00:02:35.850> around<00:02:36.180> here<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:38.250> get<00:02:38.819> to<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.030> point<00:02:39.239> where

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
way around here to get to a point where

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.100 
way around here to get to a point where
it's<00:02:39.630> easy<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:40.020> show<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:41.100> I'm<00:02:41.489> coming<00:02:42.060> in<00:02:42.360> to

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
it's easy to show so I'm coming in to

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.000 
it's easy to show so I'm coming in to
this<00:02:43.320> point<00:02:43.709> if<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.220> go<00:02:45.030> like<00:02:45.360> this<00:02:45.890> then<00:02:46.890> I'm

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
this point if I go like this then I'm

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.949 
this point if I go like this then I'm
gonna<00:02:47.130> have<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.430> hard<00:02:47.730> time<00:02:48.090> bringing<00:02:48.630> this

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
gonna have a hard time bringing this

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.470 
gonna have a hard time bringing this
back<00:02:49.320> around<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:50.190> it's<00:02:50.370> just<00:02:50.459> gonna<00:02:51.390> be

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
back around and it's just gonna be

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.540 
back around and it's just gonna be
cumbersome<00:02:52.200> there's<00:02:52.440> gonna<00:02:52.590> be<00:02:52.769> fabric<00:02:53.280> left

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
cumbersome there's gonna be fabric left

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.690 
cumbersome there's gonna be fabric left
over<00:02:53.820> I<00:02:54.209> don't<00:02:54.570> want<00:02:54.989> to<00:02:55.080> cut<00:02:55.380> this<00:02:55.680> because<00:02:56.550> if

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
over I don't want to cut this because if

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.380 
over I don't want to cut this because if
I<00:02:56.819> cut<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.630> makes<00:02:58.019> it<00:02:58.260> hard<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.650> handle<00:02:59.390> the

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
I cut it it makes it hard to handle the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.090 
I cut it it makes it hard to handle the
little<00:03:00.720> piece<00:03:00.930> that's<00:03:01.140> left<00:03:01.500> over<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:02.010> I'm

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
going to fold this down I can put a pin

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.220 
going to fold this down I can put a pin
there<00:03:05.700> if<00:03:06.209> I<00:03:06.450> want<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.989> or<00:03:08.420> maybe<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:09.569> can<00:03:09.959> just
