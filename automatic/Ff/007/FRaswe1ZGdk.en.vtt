00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.290
 Antonio is an animal specialist 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.480
 exotic and with it we will discover that 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.430
 a beautiful silver fox can be 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.769
 break a leg like the dog so 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.020
 Playful of your neighbor is the way to 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.840
 treat it and take care of it what can mark 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.039
 the difference after all does not stop 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.489
 be a wild animal 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.859
 let's do a fracture surgery 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:30.260
 of a fox's leg is a fox that 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.930
 it's a silver fox looks like it's a 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.150
 complete fracture and the two bones 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.040
 go to operate so small animals 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.080
 Well, not only do we have to work hard 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.580
 and what to do then material that we 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.840
 we build ourselves this 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.720
 specifically it is an external fixator 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.850
 we'll put the little foot in here for 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.739
 get aligned and we will go through 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.739
 with osteosynthesis needles 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.460
 let's try to give it I do not know how 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.350
 will react because it is an animal that is 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.080
 Well, even if they have it as a pet, it's a 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.510
 little is a little scared a little bit wild 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.580
 I see him wearing his little leg 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.880
 the leg of his right front leg goes 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.880
 hanging 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.890
 and cover his head so he can see us 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.240
 and at the same time put the sedative 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.240
 perfect 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.439
 is not very very asleep and we have to 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.509
 handle it with care but we already 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.729
 allows you to move it from one side to the other without 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.860
 problems so nothing are we going to help you 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.530
 to do radiography first 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.360
 the silver fox is actually a 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.310
 variety of the common fox that looks a 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.530
 characteristic gray and black fur 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.350
 sadly appreciated by the industry 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.570
 fox fur in the nature 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.300
 silver is no more than 10% of the 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.520
 total population of the common fox but by 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.740
 his coat is the variety that grows more 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.390
 in captivity your skin has been valued 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.700
 historically and already the natives 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.770
 Pre-Columbian New England 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.600
 they hunted the skin of a single animal like 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.600
 the equivalent of 40 beavers 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.780
 well the one affected is the right one that already 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.160
 simple palpation already looks like a 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.160
 movement that is not normal 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.470
 this is the right leg and if you look 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.620
 here there is a fracture both decubitus 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.110
 like as a radio that looks pretty 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.050
 it's true that we have to put this 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.790
 piece here and this piece here we have to 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.790
 take and place it on your site 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.390
 and we will pass him to try to pass him 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.420
 two needles before the fracture what 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.190
 let's say on one side of the fracture and 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.910
 two other needles after the fracture 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.420
 to keep the leg aligned and 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.420
 stretched 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.170
 it's a surgery that is nothing 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.750
 it is the least invasive that we can 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:31.430
 with these guides what we are doing 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:34.340
 it is already to pass the forces of the bone to 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.470
 external plastic is like a plaster if 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.980
 it really is similar to the effect it makes 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.980
 a plaster 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:46.030
 let's do an x-ray 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.030
 to see that everything is in order 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.650
 Well, here we already see that we have 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.510
 on the one hand the radio 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.660
 that traces this image and on the other the 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.410
 ulna that traces this other perfectly 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.410
 aligned 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.390
 well then now basically what 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.620
 What we do is make this comfortable for you 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.049
 let's make a bandage 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.060
 my father is a carpenter and there he would do this 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.960
 rather better than I sure because this 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.699
 It is a tente ie 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.310
 and the people who are familiar with 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.500
 this kind of tools much better me 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.180
 I worked for a time with my father and the 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.800
 it really helps me a lot for this 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.060
 kind of for this type of surgeries 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.419
 because this is good and complete already 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.039
 you have seen these screws plates and 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.669
 Good thing I already know say one hundred 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.669
 one hundred I tried 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.000
 and many fellow veterinarians among 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.440
 his parents vets an uncle 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.470
 veterinarian of a veterinary cousin 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.330
 someone veterinarian no one nothing is 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.850
 something that I have since childhood in my house 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.410
 I always give the typical of the following 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.210
 bug between home and that you go out 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.520
 andy house so I know very well 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.200
 because from good since well tiny 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.720
 but I've got them all but 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.760
 I have everything it's about, it's all here 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.760
 already if you see they are leaving to wake up 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.310
 we have placed the antidote and you see 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.710
 that you see that the face is already beginning to be 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.340
 attentive 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:22.040
 and now the animal what it feels is that 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.180
 is very sleepy is disoriented not 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.040
 he knows very well what it is that has 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.960
 happened and now has fixed that the paw 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.000
 not even the next one not always if 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.200
 had pain in the leg an animal of 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.580
 stress that has pain the first thing that 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.580
 does it go to bite her 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.830
 this really makes me able to support that 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.020
 as now the forces of bone 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.120
 makes the plastic the external fixator 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.889
 now it is very common and especially now 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.379
 that does not hurt because directly and 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:58.259
 support so come what we are going to do now 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:06:00.000
 is to turn off the light and let him rest 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:01.590
 be sure throughout the night 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.990
 I already spent it sleeping, which is what 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.669
 you need and to start your rest to that 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.280
 It is endearing to see a puppy of 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:11.159
 silvery fox so small so tender 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.990
 so helpless then it will be better than not 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:15.090
 let's tell you how this becomes 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:19.159
 precious animal and a few brothers 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.159
 yours an expensive fur coat
