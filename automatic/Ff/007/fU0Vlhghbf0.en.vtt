made for German customer I made him this
Bell<00:00:14.309> board<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.910> what<00:00:15.599> he<00:00:15.719> wanted<00:00:16.080> was<00:00:16.379> a

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
Bell board and what he wanted was a

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.599 
Bell board and what he wanted was a
combination<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.650> eleven<00:00:19.650> different<00:00:20.039> more

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
combination of eleven different more

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.570 
combination of eleven different more
petals<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.570> combination<00:00:22.410> with<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.830> palma

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
petals in combination with the palma

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.650 
petals in combination with the palma
October's<00:00:24.060> it's<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.570> loop<00:00:24.840> switcher<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:26.660> what

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
October's it's a loop switcher and what

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.640 
October's it's a loop switcher and what
we<00:00:27.779> did<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.580> eight<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.449> more<00:00:30.929> effects<00:00:31.320> we

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
we did is eight of the more effects we

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.709 
we did is eight of the more effects we
put<00:00:31.859> into<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.279> loop<00:00:32.430> switcher<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.090> that

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
put into the loop switcher and that

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.020 
put into the loop switcher and that
means<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.170> with<00:00:34.430> one<00:00:35.430> press<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> button

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
means that with one press on a button

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.740 
means that with one press on a button
you<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.930> have<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.290> preset<00:00:37.800> with<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.750> combination

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
you can have a preset with a combination

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.229 
you can have a preset with a combination
any<00:00:40.379> combination<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.280> like<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.760> eight

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
any combination that you like of eight

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.130 
any combination that you like of eight
of<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.540> panels<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:44.660> october's<00:00:45.660> has<00:00:45.930> got

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
of the panels and october's has got

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.400 
of the panels and october's has got
eight<00:00:46.800> banks<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.600> every<00:00:48.600> bank<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.230> have

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
eight banks and every bank you can have

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.100 
eight banks and every bank you can have
one<00:00:49.920> two<00:00:50.219> three<00:00:50.250> four<00:00:50.820> presets<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:51.809> that

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
one two three four presets so that

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.560 
one two three four presets so that
allows<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:53.280> get<00:00:53.430> plenty<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.059> different

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
allows you to get plenty of different

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.599 
allows you to get plenty of different
sounds<00:00:56.750> but<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.140> said<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.559> only<00:00:58.649> has<00:00:59.010> eight

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
sounds but like I said it only has eight

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.090 
sounds but like I said it only has eight
loops<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.260> eleven<00:01:01.949> different

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
loops and we have eleven different

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.179 
loops and we have eleven different
pedals<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:03.329> means<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.989> these<00:01:04.379> three<00:01:04.949> are

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
pedals that means that these three are

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.510 
pedals that means that these three are
not<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> loose<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.860> reason<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.369> did

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
not in the loose the reason that we did

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.820 
not in the loose the reason that we did
that<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.750> first<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.869> all<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> funky

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.359 
and here's the ninety orange it's a
phaser<00:01:20.729> pedal<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.390> weighed<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.380> same<00:01:23.070> story

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
phaser pedal and weighed the same story

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.640 
phaser pedal and weighed the same story
and<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.360> course<00:01:24.570> here<00:01:24.750> we<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.200> baby

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
of course that's not necessary to have

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.429 
of course that's not necessary to have
it<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.509> there<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.259> loop<00:01:33.079> like<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.110> said<00:01:34.320> we

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
it in there and a loop like I said we

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.370 
it in there and a loop like I said we
have<00:01:34.560> several<00:01:34.950> different<00:01:35.780> panels<00:01:36.780> we've<00:01:37.140> got

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
have several different panels we've got

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.420 
have several different panels we've got
delay<00:01:37.799> we've<00:01:38.189> got<00:01:38.460> phaser<00:01:39.360> we've<00:01:39.659> got<00:01:39.840> chorus

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
delay we've got phaser we've got chorus

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.300 
delay we've got phaser we've got chorus
without<00:01:41.430> four<00:01:41.759> different<00:01:42.299> types<00:01:42.600> of

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
without four different types of

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.100 
without four different types of
distortion

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
distortion

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.730 
distortion
it<00:01:46.110> goes<00:01:46.350> from<00:01:47.119> yeah<00:01:48.119> very<00:01:49.020> crunchy<00:01:49.320> type

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
it goes from yeah very crunchy type

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.359 
it goes from yeah very crunchy type
sounds<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.549> even<00:01:51.119> very<00:01:51.930> heavy<00:01:52.200> metal<00:01:52.590> sound<00:01:53.100> I

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
sounds to even very heavy metal sound I

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.160 
sounds to even very heavy metal sound I
have<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.270> yellow<00:01:54.420> cone<00:01:54.950> compressor<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:57.170> yeah

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
have the yellow cone compressor and yeah

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.230 
have the yellow cone compressor and yeah
like<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.409> said<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.829> allows<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.090> lot

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
like I said it allows you to have a lot

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.700 
like I said it allows you to have a lot
of<00:02:00.420> different<00:02:00.899> sound<00:02:01.619> possibilities<00:02:03.619> what<00:02:04.619> we

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
of different sound possibilities what we

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.310 
of different sound possibilities what we
did<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.009> we<00:02:05.040> mounted<00:02:05.610> all<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.450> flight<00:02:06.899> case

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
did is we mounted all in a flight case

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.870 
did is we mounted all in a flight case
so<00:02:07.710> it's<00:02:07.920> roads<00:02:08.700> proof<00:02:09.390> as<00:02:09.660> we<00:02:09.929> say<00:02:10.580> power

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
so it's roads proof as we say power

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.610 
so it's roads proof as we say power
connector<00:02:12.330> for<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.020> power<00:02:15.380> here<00:02:16.380> we<00:02:16.500> have

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
connector for the power here we have

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.390 
connector for the power here we have
these<00:02:17.210> network<00:02:18.210> connectors<00:02:19.050> one<00:02:19.590> where<00:02:20.220> the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
these network connectors one where the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.910 
these network connectors one where the
tar<00:02:20.610> goes<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.030> one<00:02:21.840> where<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.290> signal<00:02:22.620> comes

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
tar goes and one where the signal comes

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.150 
tar goes and one where the signal comes
out<00:02:23.100> that<00:02:23.550> goes<00:02:23.820> through<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.090> amp<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:25.160> you

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
out that goes through the amp and you
