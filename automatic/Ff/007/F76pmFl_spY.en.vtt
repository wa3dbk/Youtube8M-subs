00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.200
 let's apply glue to the piece 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.210
 ah 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.410
 base 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.410
 we had put this this kid 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.410
 there 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.250
 but we had said that we are not going to 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.250
 remove 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.219
 right now 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.379
 For now , we're going to leave it because 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.270
 yes I know that we are going to remove for the question 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:43.379
 of the grades when we put some 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.680
 some kind of degree and do not go the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.710
 disc to grab our exile because it 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.550
 we are going to break the diamond 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:57.680
 of carbon the carbide is going away 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.120
 will break down is going to break 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:06.260
 we must remove the excess 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:10.400
 the excess of glue where 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:15.000
 where it does not let us arrive just 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:18.330
 our our guide wall 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.460
 from our template to follow what we 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.590
 it's going to interest 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.070
 once we remove all the 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.070
 glue 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.720
 let's 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.720
 to fix 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.220
 the squad 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.220
 let's fix it well 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.910
 ah 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.610
 is we square our our piece 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.400
 exactly 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.950
 ok there it is and we are going to put 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.100
 with fixing we're going to put kids in the 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.060
 downstairs 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.060
 from bottom to top 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.590
 to our wood 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.320
 rectify 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.320
 from this point 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.680
 we need our disc 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.530
 run 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.540
 runs perfectly 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.580
 we have to give it looks like a small 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.580
 movement 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.209
 we were a little 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.790
 moved let's see if this time 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.879
 do not 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:43.450
 does not follow 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.450
 we are still wrong we will remove 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.050
 we are going to withdraw this 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.200
 there is 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:29.370
 let's put a screw 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:32.930
 in some hole where we do not find 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.930
 we have not put 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.820
 we do not hit him 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.480
 ay ay ay 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:49.590
 good an error is committed by anyone and 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.590
 two also 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.580
 we have a small movement here 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.050
 there is 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:11.830
 it seems that there it is 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.830
 we'll see 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.580
 let's drill here 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:24.900
 Yes now 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.900
 well, well 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.260
 there 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.500
 and ready 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.500
 ready ready ready 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.350
 ok then let's do 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.650
 eating our our pieces 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.170
 here 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.750
 our way this has a line 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.750
 straight 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.930
 once 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.930
 once you have that now 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:39.270
 we go 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.920
 let's plan the cut 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.479
 cut of 22 degrees and a half 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.590
 I believe that if there is no need 

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:59.639
 to put more 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.140
 and there we are fine 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:10.310
 so 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.310
 we'll see 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:20.400
 ok what would follow 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:24.120
 would be to apply glue to the appointment 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:26.250
 I think it would be going to do the video 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:29.669
 we are going to prepare to apply the 

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:32.220
 glue to the piece and we will follow you 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:35.660
 After a while we see you subscribe because 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.660
 this is very interesting
