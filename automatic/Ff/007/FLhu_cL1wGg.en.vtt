00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.390
 consciousness outside the brain 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.289
 information from the outside world which 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.089
 come to our brains through ports on itunes 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:21.419
 using a colossal chain 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.099
 chemical reactions are converted to 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.159
 electrical impulses 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.989
 these impulses are decoded and 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.249
 perceived to be relevant 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:33.310
 parts of our brain 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.220
 thanks to brain decoding 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.960
 As a result of these impulses we can 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.250
 see a person or we can for example 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.870
 smell the flower hear rustling 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.330
 leaf addon novini wind 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.220
 that is, in our brain there is neither 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.230
 taste in the direct sense of the word 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.560
 no sound no pictures in our 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.620
 the brain we can only find 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.450
 electrical impulses containing in 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.820
 yourself in encrypted form all 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.550
 listed 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.260
 from the first mick of birth we 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.100
 see the colorful world around us 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.760
 whereas in the outer world there is neither 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.420
 single color 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.030
 in perception and awareness of color 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.480
 arises in our brain 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.430
 in the outside world there are only 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.750
 collector magnetic waves of various lengths 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.490
 that is the world that we actually see 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.490
 is inside our 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.950
 model i can never know what 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.850
 the essence of matter 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.060
 so is the outside world where we are real 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.759
 perceive it thanks to 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.049
 pulse decoding 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.720
 long-suffering 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.720
 OK 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.710
 but then who is the rational being 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.590
 which are lifelong in 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.770
 pitch dark and silent silence 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.500
 Brain look those images which 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.220
 are shown to them ponders doing 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.470
 logical conclusion makes decisions 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.500
 it is clear that the brain that 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.200
 essentially consists of unreasonable debates 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.290
 water molecules fat proteins and other 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.550
 substances can't be that thinking 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.600
 a creature that feels and 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.579
 ponders 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.809
 there must be some kind of completely 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:19.400
 excellent essence that exist 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.119
 outside the brain 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:23.919
 paper is essentially going through hiding 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:25.809
 all so reality that even 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:27.939
 cannot realize that everything visible and 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.239
 heard by her 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.409
 in fact he is a reality 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.969
 hear poisoned it visible in 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:35.899
 essences of souls a man
