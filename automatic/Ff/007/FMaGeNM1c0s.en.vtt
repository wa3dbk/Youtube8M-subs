00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
of the word let's try and find the base

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.240 
of the word let's try and find the base
of<00:03:52.030> a<00:03:52.090> whole<00:03:52.210> zone<00:03:52.390> that<00:03:53.610> was<00:03:54.610> easy

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
of a whole zone that was easy

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.610 
of a whole zone that was easy
my<00:03:57.250> guess<00:03:57.520> is<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:57.880> laser<00:03:58.060> battle<00:03:58.390> zone<00:03:58.810> is

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
my guess is the laser battle zone is

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.880 
my guess is the laser battle zone is
through<00:04:00.070> the<00:04:00.130> middle<00:04:00.370> one<00:04:01.290> wow<00:04:02.290> this<00:04:02.620> was<00:04:02.860> a

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
through the middle one wow this was a

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.110 
through the middle one wow this was a
bit<00:04:03.190> graphical<00:04:03.940> floors<00:04:04.210> here<00:04:05.550> but<00:04:06.550> yeah<00:04:06.700> guess

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
bit graphical floors here but yeah guess

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.450 
bit graphical floors here but yeah guess
one<00:04:07.360> owns<00:04:07.710> feel<00:04:08.710> most<00:04:08.950> comfortable<00:04:09.100> at<00:04:09.400> the

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
one owns feel most comfortable at the
