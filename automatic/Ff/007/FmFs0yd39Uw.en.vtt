that this was probably my favorite part
of<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.120> game<00:02:30.300> because<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.720> grew<00:02:31.080> up<00:02:31.110> with<00:02:31.290> Toy

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
of the game because I grew up with Toy

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.680 
of the game because I grew up with Toy
Story<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:32.040> mean<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.730> original<00:02:33.090> Toy<00:02:33.239> Story<00:02:33.540> came

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
Story I mean the original Toy Story came

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.010 
Story I mean the original Toy Story came
out<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:33.930> 1995<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:34.950> was<00:02:35.070> like<00:02:35.220> 12<00:02:35.989> but<00:02:36.989> I

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
out in 1995 and I was like 12 but I

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.440 
out in 1995 and I was like 12 but I
think<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:37.410> was<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.620> first<00:02:37.860> all<00:02:38.370> CGI<00:02:38.940> movie

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
think this was the first all CGI movie

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.870 
think this was the first all CGI movie
it<00:02:39.900> was<00:02:40.050> a<00:02:40.110> very<00:02:40.350> big<00:02:40.560> deal<00:02:40.770> so<00:02:41.310> doing<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.730> Toy

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.340 
it was a very big deal so doing the Toy

and the game itself takes around four
hours<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.880> complete<00:03:09.000> it's<00:03:09.750> not<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.019> longest

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410
