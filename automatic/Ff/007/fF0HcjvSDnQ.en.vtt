00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
slightly because I believe that to get a

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.859 
slightly because I believe that to get a
full<00:01:05.369> range<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.760> motion<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.390> develop

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
full range of motion and to develop

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.170 
full range of motion and to develop
flexibility<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.070> should<00:01:08.310> go<00:01:08.490> down<00:01:08.790> all<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
flexibility you should go down all the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.899 
flexibility you should go down all the
way<00:01:09.600> as<00:01:09.869> far<00:01:10.110> as<00:01:10.500> your<00:01:10.830> body<00:01:10.979> allows<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.729> to

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
way as far as your body allows you to

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.840 
way as far as your body allows you to
now<00:01:12.180> if<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.290> can't<00:01:13.530> go<00:01:13.770> down<00:01:13.979> all<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.670> way

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
now if you can't go down all the way

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.600 
now if you can't go down all the way
that's<00:01:15.210> fine<00:01:15.600> start<00:01:16.380> where<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.189> and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
that's fine start where you can and and

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.580 
that's fine start where you can and and
try<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.150> work<00:01:18.360> your<00:01:18.570> way<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.750> go<00:01:19.049> further<00:01:19.350> and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
try to work your way to go further and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.740 
try to work your way to go further and
further<00:01:19.830> each<00:01:20.250> time<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
further each time so this is the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.109 
further each time so this is the
movement<00:01:22.430> that<00:01:23.430> we're<00:01:23.610> going<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.790> be<00:01:23.939> aiming

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
movement that we're going to be aiming

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.870 
movement that we're going to be aiming

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.539 
now the only other thing we need to do
is<00:01:47.480> add<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:48.110> kettlebell<00:01:48.500> so

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.179 

the<00:01:51.850> way<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.270> we<00:01:52.360> hold<00:01:52.689> it<00:01:52.960> we<00:01:53.590> codify<00:01:54.009> what

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
the way that we hold it we codify what

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.510 
the way that we hold it we codify what
we<00:01:54.490> call<00:01:54.729> performs<00:01:55.570> order<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:56.350> handle<00:01:56.860> would

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
we call performs order the handle would

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.460 
we call performs order the handle would
tuck<00:01:57.790> our<00:01:57.970> arms<00:01:58.299> into<00:01:58.600> it<00:01:58.720> and<00:01:59.049> hold<00:01:59.290> it<00:01:59.380> right

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
tuck our arms into it and hold it right

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.770 
tuck our arms into it and hold it right
up<00:01:59.830> to<00:02:00.040> our<00:02:00.130> bodies<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:00.759> it<00:02:01.330> should<00:02:01.570> look

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
up to our bodies and it should look
