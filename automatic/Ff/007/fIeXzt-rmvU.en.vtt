season so there's not a whole lot of

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.200 
season so there's not a whole lot of
information<00:00:13.559> they<00:00:14.219> obviously<00:00:14.490> had<00:00:15.059> an

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
information they obviously had an

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.810 
information they obviously had an
impressive<00:00:15.540> run<00:00:16.010> last<00:00:17.010> year<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.400> get<00:00:17.550> here<00:00:17.609> so

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
impressive run last year to get here so

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.560 
impressive run last year to get here so
you<00:00:18.720> know<00:00:19.220> we<00:00:20.220> respect<00:00:20.670> our<00:00:20.820> opponent<00:00:21.300> we<00:00:21.390> just

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
you know we respect our opponent we just

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.810 
you know we respect our opponent we just
need<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.050> obviously<00:00:22.619> be<00:00:23.100> more<00:00:23.460> concerned

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
need to obviously be more concerned

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.779 
need to obviously be more concerned
about<00:00:23.970> ourselves<00:00:24.240> say<00:00:24.779> they<00:00:25.019> have<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.789> good

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
about ourselves say they have a good

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.990 
about ourselves say they have a good
history<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.660> Costa<00:00:28.019> Rica<00:00:28.400> but<00:00:29.400> they<00:00:29.849> have

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
history in Costa Rica but they have

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.049 
history in Costa Rica but they have
broadened<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.810> think<00:00:31.560> most<00:00:32.340> 70<00:00:32.820> years

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
broadened it I think most 70 years

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.280 
broadened it I think most 70 years
without<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.829> championship<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:37.760> good<00:00:38.760> crowd

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
without the championship and good crowd

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.709 
without the championship and good crowd
good<00:00:40.290> down<00:00:40.910> it's<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.000> good<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.420> good<00:00:42.450> club

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
good down it's a good it's a good club

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.869 
good down it's a good it's a good club
it's<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.410> good<00:00:43.559> club<00:00:43.680> was<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.280> be<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> big<00:00:44.640> club

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
it's a good club was to be a big club

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.729 
it's a good club was to be a big club
for<00:00:45.329> me<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.539> course<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:46.289> get<00:00:46.379> game<00:00:46.620> is

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
for me of course to get game is

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.950 
for me of course to get game is
important<00:00:47.129> but<00:00:47.180> not<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.719> our<00:00:48.809> first

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
important but not so our first

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.360 
important but not so our first
championship<00:00:49.410> game<00:00:49.739> we're<00:00:49.920> playing<00:00:49.950> at<00:00:50.219> home

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
championship game we're playing at home

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.970 
championship game we're playing at home
some<00:00:51.300> more<00:00:51.449> importantly<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.379> we<00:00:52.860> got

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
some more importantly is that we we got

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.860 
some more importantly is that we we got
to<00:00:53.100> get<00:00:53.160> herself<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.300> think<00:00:54.539> it's

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
to get herself and I think it's

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.799 
to get herself and I think it's
important<00:00:55.289> being<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.739> sterner<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.250> kind<00:00:56.430> of

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
important being the sterner to kind of

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.150 
important being the sterner to kind of
missed<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.050> first<00:00:58.260> two<00:00:58.469> three<00:00:58.649> games<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.070> get

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
missed the first two three games to get

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.650 
missed the first two three games to get
as<00:00:59.250> many<00:00:59.340> points<00:00:59.520> as<00:00:59.640> possible<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.180> make<00:01:00.539> it

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
as many points as possible and make it

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.479 
as many points as possible and make it
easier<00:01:00.960> on<00:01:01.020> your<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.890> your<00:01:01.949> team<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.309> know

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
easier on your on your team you know

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.280 
easier on your on your team you know
towards<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.760> end<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.000> season<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.719> I'm

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
towards the end of season so I'm

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.200 
towards the end of season so I'm
obviously<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.799> big<00:01:05.040> game<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.430> us<00:01:05.489> playing<00:01:06.030> home

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
obviously a big game for us playing home

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.030 
obviously a big game for us playing home
playing<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.659> good<00:01:06.810> team<00:01:06.960> I've<00:01:07.350> had<00:01:07.710> some

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040

playing it's good team I've had some
decent<00:01:08.250> results<00:01:08.700> as<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.850> late<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:10.159> I'm<00:01:11.159> just

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310
