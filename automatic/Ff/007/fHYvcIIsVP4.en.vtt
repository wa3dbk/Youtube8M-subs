00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:23.360
 today i saw 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.360
 I want to take off how to pour fish in the winter 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.360
 Today I will tell you how to cook fish in the winter 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.809
 so this winter rod for 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.680
 little summer well, it's clear that 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.769
 there is no big need here 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.110
 coil but u about so small 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:51.120
 nods here it is if you see yes 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.399
 A little inconvenient not to take off, but I hope 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.620
 see and mean jingle on which 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.739
 the worm is a little bit frozen worm well 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.280
 at the debate you lie there still dress there 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.280
 as usual 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.479
 it means will drilled someone here 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.479
 located 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:30.239
 to every rumor of type of snow 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:35.599
 fishing line to be walked freely prevented 

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:39.989
 we follow the bites 

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:45.599
 that is, we have a snowball pull out of 

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:48.119
 the wells to keep the water clean for this 

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:53.310
 such a ladle is suitable there or 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:55.560
 who than they catch there beat someone 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.800
 homemade someone just takes from the kitchen 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.500
 as I took today from my wife and ruined 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:08.700
 already broke 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:13.650
 before skimmer usual means snowball enough 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:17.940
 laugh means there is a professional here 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:21.340
 today who laugh means hum or 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:29.000
 snowball take 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:31.830
 we drop the line there and that means yes worm 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.120
 or with other bait 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:41.070
 and let go if a button on this 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:44.030
 winter fishing rods which we keep 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.030
 skip fishing line 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:53.430
 actually the task is 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:55.340
 let the bait down to the bottom let go 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.800
 until 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.800
 lowering while fishing line at the expense of frowning 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:12.530
 at the edges let go send let go 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:15.440
 then you can see that the line I want to invest 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:23.000
 then the bait lies on the bottom means 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:28.930
 pull back a little fishing line and then 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.930
 I see, for example, that 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:44.370
 also worshiped crouch 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.010
 boats experience begins to rise further 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.990
 scoreboard 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:59.760
 I have the next bit 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:59.760
 and now I know that this is me already 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:09.430
 you can put this bait 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:13.069
 yes legs and do not bathe and wait for bites 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:17.060
 climb what's a nod when biting 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:23.710
 will play the key he will create and 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:27.610
 movement g but in theory 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:35.630
 old professionals they act like 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:39.710
 they support fishing rod in Russian 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.680
 they say jerking off like that 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:46.280
 movements we tease this sleeping fish 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.850
 which is at the bottom there is an option 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:54.889
 that she will bite sometime today as 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:59.320
 such is cool yet so I just 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.320
 I will show how it makes growth approximately 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.510
 it means it is clear that the nod is not 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.860
 moves 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:16.820
 if the fish pecked, it is clear that he 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:20.430
 was like this I pulled it sharply 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:24.920
 for example fish pecked on maple 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:29.510
 doing as I make a jerk 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:34.950
 fishing hook and quickly-quickly 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:37.230
 I pull out the line I pull out with my hands 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:42.180
 the idea here was to be a fish but also 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:43.440
 no clear yes she is there somewhere in 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:49.290
 river in the lake 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:50.990
 Chudskoe forgiveness is not clear, we remove 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.020
 fish 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.020
 we throw her somewhere aside clothes 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.430
 for bait 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:02.780
 the second time we throw the bait 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:06.470
 throwing it is not necessary to reel it 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:11.270
 just take this piece of iron and 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:15.880
 back and and also run quietly 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.880
 so that nothing is confused 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:26.930
 let's not even have a victory already 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:30.740
 measured out and we essentially do on the same 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:34.880
 the depth of another fish which while I am again 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.850
 no yes or you can leave the bait 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:41.490
 just and go smoke some grass 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:44.999
 or just sit down and watch 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:47.680
 until the hell will freeze 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:50.920
 that's essentially all wisdom 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.990
 winter fishing 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:07:00.340
 and I also want to show my legs 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:03.370
 Many people think that this is a fucking 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:06.310
 extreme really not so 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.680
 cold and winter fishing if you get dressed 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.420
 warmer 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:15.400
 but what are the benefits of fresh air 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:17.980
 good company 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.640
 dose of alcohol which raises 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.640
 mood 

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:29.550
 and all the delights of nature here in short I tell you 

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:34.910
 told about winter fishing so 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.910
 ride and fish for good fishing
