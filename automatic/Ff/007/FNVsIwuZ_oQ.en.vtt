00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.470 
like maybe winning 5-4 something like
that<00:03:11.010> i'm<00:03:11.130> not<00:03:11.160> too<00:03:11.430> sure<00:03:11.459> but<00:03:12.150> they<00:03:12.330> will

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
that i'm not too sure but they will

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.090 
that i'm not too sure but they will
consist<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.080> more<00:03:13.380> builds<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.739> reason<00:03:14.010> so

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
consist of the more builds the reason so

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.039 
consist of the more builds the reason so
this<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:14.700> counter-attacking<00:03:15.690> on<00:03:15.930> this

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
this is that a counter-attacking on this

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.770 
this is that a counter-attacking on this
game<00:03:16.230> is<00:03:16.500> very<00:03:16.950> powerful<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:18.150> defending<00:03:18.660> is

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
game is very powerful the defending is

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.930 
game is very powerful the defending is
very<00:03:19.260> hard<00:03:19.620> nearly<00:03:20.100> impossible<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.730> defend

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
very hard nearly impossible to defend

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.380 
very hard nearly impossible to defend
against<00:03:21.269> counter-attacks<00:03:21.900> so<00:03:23.150> like<00:03:24.150> maybe

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
against counter-attacks so like maybe

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.240 
against counter-attacks so like maybe
the<00:03:24.690> attacking<00:03:24.930> i<00:03:25.079> could<00:03:25.350> be<00:03:25.470> pulled<00:03:26.010> down<00:03:26.100> a

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
the attacking i could be pulled down a

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.090 
the attacking i could be pulled down a
bit<00:03:26.489> but<00:03:26.670> i<00:03:26.730> think<00:03:27.030> i<00:03:27.299> think<00:03:28.290> it's<00:03:28.799> just<00:03:28.950> one<00:03:29.070> of

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
bit but i think i think it's just one of

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.830 
bit but i think i think it's just one of
those<00:03:29.190> things<00:03:29.310> like<00:03:30.000> cuz<00:03:30.180> it's<00:03:30.329> new<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.720> the

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
those things like cuz it's new to the

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.449 
those things like cuz it's new to the
game<00:03:31.019> you<00:03:31.049> need<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.440> get<00:03:31.530> used<00:03:31.769> to<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.130> and

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
game you need to get used to it and

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.550 
game you need to get used to it and
we'll<00:03:33.000> all<00:03:33.150> learn<00:03:33.390> how<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.720> defend<00:03:33.989> against<00:03:34.470> it

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
we'll all learn how to defend against it

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.259 
we'll all learn how to defend against it
eventually<00:03:35.190> but<00:03:35.609> it's<00:03:35.730> just<00:03:35.850> cuz<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.090> games

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
eventually but it's just cuz the games

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.610 
eventually but it's just cuz the games
i've<00:03:36.359> been<00:03:36.540> up<00:03:36.630> two<00:03:36.870> weeks<00:03:37.079> that's<00:03:37.230> just<00:03:37.470> one

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
i've been up two weeks that's just one

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.620 
i've been up two weeks that's just one
thing<00:03:37.739> i'm<00:03:37.980> not<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.220> fan<00:03:38.519> of<00:03:38.579> but<00:03:39.239> i<00:03:39.299> think<00:03:39.510> it's

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
thing i'm not a fan of but i think it's

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.940 
thing i'm not a fan of but i think it's
like<00:03:39.720> contained<00:03:40.350> when<00:03:40.620> they<00:03:40.680> bought<00:03:40.829> in

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
like contained when they bought in

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.310 
like contained when they bought in
container<00:03:41.280> fifa<00:03:41.579> 12<00:03:41.820> everyone<00:03:42.720> like<00:03:42.870> hated<00:03:43.230> it

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
container fifa 12 everyone like hated it

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.420 
container fifa 12 everyone like hated it
then<00:03:43.500> by<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.650> end<00:03:43.769> not<00:03:44.010> really<00:03:44.220> that<00:03:44.340> many

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
then by the end not really that many

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.620 
then by the end not really that many
people<00:03:44.730> were<00:03:44.790> complaining<00:03:45.060> about<00:03:45.450> it

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
people were complaining about it

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.539 
people were complaining about it
although<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.109> was<00:03:46.200> still<00:03:46.380> annoying<00:03:46.650> i<00:03:46.980> think

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
although it was still annoying i think

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.640 
although it was still annoying i think
this<00:03:47.670> is<00:03:47.820> kind<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.150> counteracting<00:03:49.140> that

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
this is kind of counteracting that

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.310 
this is kind of counteracting that
contain<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.250> ball<00:03:50.430> in<00:03:50.549> FIFA<00:03:50.700> 12<00:03:51.320> whereas

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
contain the ball in FIFA 12 whereas

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.380 
contain the ball in FIFA 12 whereas
contain<00:03:52.769> doesn't<00:03:53.100> seem<00:03:53.370> as<00:03:53.579> effective<00:03:54.180> in

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
contain doesn't seem as effective in

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.140 
contain doesn't seem as effective in
FIFA<00:03:54.570> 13<00:03:54.690> as<00:03:55.350> it<00:03:55.620> wasn't<00:03:55.799> 5012<00:03:56.340> against

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
FIFA 13 as it wasn't 5012 against

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.990 
FIFA 13 as it wasn't 5012 against
counter-attacks<00:03:57.780> it<00:03:58.590> kind<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:59.040> evens<00:03:59.280> out<00:03:59.609> but

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
counter-attacks it kind of evens out but

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.729 
counter-attacks it kind of evens out but
yeah<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.600> runs<00:04:00.930> that<00:04:01.049> some<00:04:01.290> players<00:04:01.440> maker

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
yeah the runs that some players maker

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.190 
yeah the runs that some players maker
absolutely<00:04:02.340> amazing<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.209> sometimes<00:04:04.049> they're

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
absolutely amazing and sometimes they're

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.590 
absolutely amazing and sometimes they're
just<00:04:04.230> really<00:04:04.739> bad<00:04:05.010> but<00:04:05.819> obviously<00:04:06.239> it's<00:04:06.450> just

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
just really bad but obviously it's just

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.550 
just really bad but obviously it's just
one<00:04:06.690> of<00:04:06.720> those<00:04:06.840> things<00:04:06.930> when<00:04:07.319> you're<00:04:07.410> on<00:04:07.530> the

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
one of those things when you're on the

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.410 
one of those things when you're on the
receiving<00:04:07.739> end<00:04:08.250> of<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.609> very<00:04:08.640> good<00:04:09.000> run<00:04:09.209> which

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
receiving end of a very good run which

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.599 
receiving end of a very good run which
MZ<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.810> go<00:04:09.959> you're<00:04:10.470> not<00:04:10.590> happy<00:04:10.950> with<00:04:10.980> it<00:04:11.250> but<00:04:11.459> if

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
MZ to go you're not happy with it but if

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.129 
MZ to go you're not happy with it but if
your<00:04:12.359> player<00:04:12.540> does<00:04:12.720> it<00:04:12.840> then<00:04:12.989> obviously

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
your player does it then obviously

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.660 
your player does it then obviously
you're<00:04:13.680> very<00:04:13.859> happy<00:04:14.040> with<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.370> but<00:04:14.400> yeah

that's just my opinion I personally on

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.680 
that's just my opinion I personally on
both<00:04:17.039> perspectives<00:04:17.370> whether<00:04:18.120> it's<00:04:18.329> familiar

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
both perspectives whether it's familiar

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.120 
both perspectives whether it's familiar
whether<00:04:18.870> it's<00:04:19.049> from<00:04:19.169> my<00:04:19.320> opponent<00:04:19.769> thing<00:04:19.979> they

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
whether it's from my opponent thing they

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.020 
whether it's from my opponent thing they
are<00:04:20.160> overpowered<00:04:21.800> the<00:04:22.800> three<00:04:23.070> balls<00:04:23.310> is<00:04:23.550> very

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
are overpowered the three balls is very

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.379 
are overpowered the three balls is very
annoying<00:04:24.240> but<00:04:24.990> yeah<00:04:25.169> we'll<00:04:26.010> go

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
annoying but yeah we'll go

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.089 
annoying but yeah we'll go
that<00:04:26.599> topic<00:04:26.990> now<00:04:27.110> I<00:04:27.139> move<00:04:27.439> on<00:04:27.620> to<00:04:27.710> the<00:04:27.800> next<00:04:27.830> one

that topic now I move on to the next one
which<00:04:28.370> is<00:04:28.400> um<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:30.650> referees<00:04:31.159> they've<00:04:31.580> really

00:04:31.929 --> 00:04:31.939

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:37.129 
they were absolutely appalling and in my

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:38.679 
they were absolutely appalling and in my
opinion<00:04:37.219> this<00:04:37.550> is<00:04:37.610> absolutely<00:04:38.090> appalling<00:04:38.449> as

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:38.689 
opinion this is absolutely appalling as

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:41.529 
opinion this is absolutely appalling as

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
well you could either when you tap be to

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:42.640 
well you could either when you tap be to

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:18.429 
whole crossing business obviously you
have<00:06:17.120> to<00:06:17.240> learn<00:06:17.389> to<00:06:17.449> defend<00:06:17.719> against<00:06:18.169> it<00:06:18.259> is

00:06:18.429 --> 00:06:18.439 
have to learn to defend against it is

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:19.959 
have to learn to defend against it is
very<00:06:18.740> hard<00:06:18.979> to<00:06:19.069> defend<00:06:19.370> against<00:06:19.699> at<00:06:19.879> the

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:19.969 
very hard to defend against at the

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:22.510 
very hard to defend against at the
moment<00:06:20.409> but<00:06:21.409> yeah<00:06:21.560> that's<00:06:21.800> just<00:06:21.889> one<00:06:22.430> of<00:06:22.460> the

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
moment but yeah that's just one of the

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.040 
moment but yeah that's just one of the
main<00:06:22.669> things<00:06:22.699> i<00:06:23.029> don't<00:06:23.089> like<00:06:23.330> i<00:06:23.569> can<00:06:23.750> see<00:06:23.930> it<00:06:23.990> a

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
main things i don't like i can see it a

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.019 
main things i don't like i can see it a
lot<00:06:24.259> of<00:06:24.409> headers<00:06:24.710> i<00:06:24.919> think<00:06:25.370> it<00:06:25.580> may<00:06:25.699> be<00:06:25.729> in<00:06:25.969> the

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:26.029 
lot of headers i think it may be in the

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:27.339 
lot of headers i think it may be in the
game<00:06:26.180> player<00:06:26.389> you<00:06:26.539> watch<00:06:26.689> now<00:06:26.930> you<00:06:26.990> might<00:06:27.199> even

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349 
game player you watch now you might even

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:28.929 
game player you watch now you might even
seem<00:06:27.589> you<00:06:27.710> can<00:06:27.860> see<00:06:28.009> the<00:06:28.129> henna<00:06:28.279> header<00:06:28.669> i'm

00:06:28.929 --> 00:06:28.939 
seem you can see the henna header i'm

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:30.490 
seem you can see the henna header i'm
not<00:06:29.089> too<00:06:29.240> sure<00:06:29.270> this<00:06:29.599> the<00:06:29.960> vast<00:06:30.139> plain<00:06:30.379> was

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
not too sure this the vast plain was

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.320 
not too sure this the vast plain was
crossing<00:06:30.740> a<00:06:31.039> lot<00:06:31.219> it<00:06:31.550> depends<00:06:32.060> whether<00:06:32.180> you're

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
crossing a lot it depends whether you're

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.639 
crossing a lot it depends whether you're
watching<00:06:32.599> the<00:06:32.659> first<00:06:32.810> or<00:06:33.050> second<00:06:33.319> half<00:06:33.469> of

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:33.649 
watching the first or second half of

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:35.920 
watching the first or second half of
that<00:06:33.680> game<00:06:34.039> but<00:06:34.909> yeah<00:06:35.029> guys<00:06:35.209> I<00:06:35.269> think<00:06:35.719> that's

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930
