prayer is about a God who is
prescriptive<00:01:34.680> or<00:01:35.280> condemning<00:01:36.150> but<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> God<00:01:37.229> who

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
prescriptive or condemning but a God who

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
which is which is wonderful I think a

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.149 
which is which is wonderful I think a
lot<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.710> people<00:01:43.829> perhaps<00:01:44.189> haven't<00:01:45.000> discovered

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
lot of people perhaps haven't discovered

that<00:01:47.159> God<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.170> found<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.590> think<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> lot<00:01:49.799> of

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
that God and I found I think a lot of

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.630 
that God and I found I think a lot of
people<00:01:50.060> still<00:01:51.060> carrying<00:01:51.840> their<00:01:52.110> minds<00:01:53.009> but

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
people still carrying their minds but

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.209 
people still carrying their minds but
God<00:01:53.880> which<00:01:54.060> they<00:01:54.240> may<00:01:54.420> be<00:01:54.649> learned<00:01:55.649> about<00:01:55.979> when

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
God which they may be learned about when

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.490 
God which they may be learned about when
they<00:01:56.369> were<00:01:56.430> little<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.090> has<00:01:57.899> remained<00:01:58.320> ever

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
they were little and has remained ever

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.459 
they were little and has remained ever
since<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:59.310> think<00:02:00.240> they<00:02:00.360> need<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.750> perhaps<00:02:00.899> smash

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
since I think they need to perhaps smash

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.310 
since I think they need to perhaps smash
that<00:02:01.740> image<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.430> kind<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.759> interior<00:02:03.420> iconoclasm

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
that image a kind of interior iconoclasm

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.430 
that image a kind of interior iconoclasm
and<00:02:05.440> say<00:02:05.800> that's<00:02:06.010> not<00:02:06.220> God<00:02:06.760> and<00:02:07.120> God<00:02:08.110> i<00:02:08.140> think

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
and say that's not God and God i think

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.260 
and say that's not God and God i think
is<00:02:08.530> longing<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:09.420> reveal<00:02:10.420> himself<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.120> new

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
is longing to reveal himself in a new

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.140
