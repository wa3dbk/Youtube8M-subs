this is after patch I mean technically

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.740 
this is after patch I mean technically
they<00:00:35.040> did<00:00:35.280> try<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.520> patch<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.090> at<00:00:36.329> one<00:00:36.510> time

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
they did try to patch this at one time

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.840 
they did try to patch this at one time
but<00:00:37.140> there<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> way<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.040> make<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.310> work<00:00:38.460> and

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
but there is a way to make it work and

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.700 
but there is a way to make it work and
it's<00:00:39.000> still<00:00:39.270> working<00:00:39.720> so<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.590> obviously

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
it's still working so we can obviously

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.010 
it's still working so we can obviously
assume<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:41.970> always<00:00:42.239> going<00:00:42.630> to<00:00:42.750> work

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
assume that it's always going to work

00:00:43.020 --> 00:01:18.560 
assume that it's always going to work
because<00:00:43.260> there<00:00:43.770> are<00:00:43.980> no<00:00:44.130> more<00:00:44.310> patches
