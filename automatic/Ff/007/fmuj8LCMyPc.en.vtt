00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.230 
this is one of the really really cool

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.379 
this is one of the really really cool
will<00:00:07.280> tricks<00:00:08.280> that<00:00:08.519> we've<00:00:08.639> done<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.970> this<00:00:09.090> car

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
will tricks that we've done to this car

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.810 
will tricks that we've done to this car
it's<00:00:10.230> very<00:00:10.469> very<00:00:10.769> subtle<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.370> can't<00:00:11.639> wait

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
it's very very subtle and I can't wait

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.730 
it's very very subtle and I can't wait
to<00:00:11.969> have<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.150> parked<00:00:12.599> next<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:13.019> stock<00:00:13.469> one

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
to have it parked next to a stock one

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.950 
to have it parked next to a stock one
later<00:00:14.549> on<00:00:14.849> for<00:00:15.179> comparison<00:00:15.870> what<00:00:16.830> we've<00:00:17.010> done

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
later on for comparison what we've done

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.599 
later on for comparison what we've done
three<00:00:18.960> things<00:00:19.640> to<00:00:20.640> facilitate<00:00:21.630> fitting<00:00:22.609> 345

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
three things to facilitate fitting 345

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.660 
three things to facilitate fitting 345
tires<00:00:24.180> which<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.260> rather<00:00:25.740> large<00:00:26.039> chunk<00:00:26.550> of

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
tires which is rather large chunk of

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.050 
tires which is rather large chunk of
rubber<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.750> unlike<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.830> bigger<00:00:29.039> say<00:00:29.429> b-body

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060

dodges<00:00:30.660> like<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> Dodge<00:00:31.109> Charger<00:00:31.439> these

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
dodges like a Dodge Charger these

Mustangs<00:00:32.910> one<00:00:33.450> physically<00:00:34.020> are<00:00:34.230> as<00:00:34.469> big<00:00:34.800> into

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
Mustangs one physically are as big into

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.040 
Mustangs one physically are as big into
their<00:00:35.340> wheel<00:00:35.579> wells<00:00:35.850> are<00:00:36.090> definitely<00:00:36.690> not<00:00:36.840> as

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
their wheel wells are definitely not as

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.990 
their wheel wells are definitely not as
big<00:00:37.730> so<00:00:39.350> first<00:00:40.350> thing<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.280> frame<00:00:41.579> rail<00:00:41.820> on

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
big so first thing is the frame rail on

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.220 
big so first thing is the frame rail on
the<00:00:42.120> inside<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:43.200> Mustang<00:00:43.590> frames<00:00:44.010> actually

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
the inside the Mustang frames actually

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.630 
the inside the Mustang frames actually
flow<00:00:46.230> out<00:00:46.559> they're<00:00:46.890> not<00:00:47.070> perfectly<00:00:47.520> straight

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
flow out they're not perfectly straight

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.979 
flow out they're not perfectly straight
rails<00:00:48.170> so<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.410> not<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.730> lower<00:00:50.940> edge<00:00:51.239> or<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
rails so we not the lower edge or the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.470 
rails so we not the lower edge or the
rear<00:00:52.800> facing<00:00:53.129> edge<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.760> rail<00:00:53.940> thinned<00:00:54.360> it

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
rear facing edge of the rail thinned it

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.729 
rear facing edge of the rail thinned it
up<00:00:54.770> to<00:00:55.770> keep<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.070> parallel<00:00:56.550> line<00:00:57.170> then<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
up to keep a parallel line then the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.180 
up to keep a parallel line then the
factory<00:00:59.250> inner<00:00:59.489> wheel<00:01:00.059> tub<00:01:00.390> was<00:01:01.140> moved<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.859> all

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
factory inner wheel tub was moved in all

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.530 
factory inner wheel tub was moved in all
the<00:01:02.460> way<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.940> frame<00:01:03.660> rail<00:01:03.799> location

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
the way to the frame rail location

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.469 
the way to the frame rail location
filler<00:01:06.540> panels<00:01:07.110> were<00:01:07.260> made<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.560> take<00:01:07.799> up<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
filler panels were made to take up the

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.929 
filler panels were made to take up the
empty<00:01:09.479> space<00:01:09.810> from<00:01:10.140> moving<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.890> new<00:01:11.640> outer

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
empty space from moving it a new outer

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.179 
empty space from moving it a new outer
tub<00:01:12.390> was<00:01:12.630> made<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> new<00:01:13.470> outer<00:01:13.710> flange

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
tub was made with a new outer flange

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.580 
tub was made with a new outer flange
coming<00:01:14.850> out<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:16.500> flare<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:18.590> you're

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
coming out to the flare and you're

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.260 
coming out to the flare and you're
probably<00:01:19.799> seeing<00:01:20.250> these<00:01:20.430> numbers<00:01:20.700> here<00:01:21.060> now

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
probably seeing these numbers here now

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.289 
probably seeing these numbers here now
and<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.570> see<00:01:21.780> these<00:01:21.930> cuts<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.650> grid<00:01:23.299> what

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
and you see these cuts in this grid what

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.219 
and you see these cuts in this grid what
we've<00:01:24.509> done<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.490> we<00:01:26.490> cut<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.420> factory<00:01:27.869> quarter

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
we've done is we cut the factory quarter

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.499 
we've done is we cut the factory quarter
off<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:29.070> don't<00:01:29.250> worry<00:01:29.490> there<00:01:29.820> was<00:01:29.939> damage<00:01:30.329> on

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
off and don't worry there was damage on

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.590 
off and don't worry there was damage on
them<00:01:30.659> anyway<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.369> break<00:01:32.790> over<00:01:33.240> here

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
them anyway and this break over here

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.960 
them anyway and this break over here
used<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.470> be<00:01:34.680> an<00:01:34.890> inch<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> half<00:01:35.520> back<00:01:36.509> gear

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
used to be an inch and a half back gear

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.330 
used to be an inch and a half back gear
so<00:01:38.970> what<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.360> did<00:01:39.570> was<00:01:39.840> we<00:01:39.869> did<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> mild

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
so what we did was we did a mild

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.889 
so what we did was we did a mild
wide-body<00:01:42.270> but<00:01:44.329> instead<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.689> whole

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
wide-body but instead of the whole

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.620 
wide-body but instead of the whole
things<00:01:46.200> pulled<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.860> trick<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.390> needs

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
things pulled the trick is is it needs

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.069 
things pulled the trick is is it needs
to<00:01:48.869> land<00:01:49.110> here<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.280> factory<00:01:50.729> location<00:01:51.079> and

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
to land here in the factory location and

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.770 
to land here in the factory location and
it<00:01:52.229> needs<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.710> land<00:01:52.920> here<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.360> factory

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
it needs to land here in the factory

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.440 
it needs to land here in the factory
location<00:01:54.979> well<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.130> makes<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.969> problem

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
location well that makes a problem

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.030 
location well that makes a problem
because<00:01:58.189> this<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.549> way<00:02:00.240> out<00:02:00.509> here<00:02:00.899> now<00:02:01.140> so

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
because this is way out here now so

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.840 
because this is way out here now so
these<00:02:02.549> cuts<00:02:03.000> are<00:02:03.180> relief<00:02:03.479> cuts<00:02:03.860> allowing<00:02:04.860> us

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
these cuts are relief cuts allowing us

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.050 
these cuts are relief cuts allowing us
the<00:02:06.210> quarter<00:02:06.570> pin<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.530> basically<00:02:08.130> if<00:02:08.729> your

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
the quarter pin so basically if your

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.880 
the quarter pin so basically if your
factory<00:02:09.570> quarter<00:02:09.929> panel<00:02:10.259> has<00:02:10.350> made<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> silly

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
factory quarter panel has made a silly

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.770 
factory quarter panel has made a silly
putty<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.490> just<00:02:12.000> grabbed<00:02:12.240> here<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.630> went

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
putty I just grabbed here and went

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.050 
putty I just grabbed here and went
weren't<00:02:13.230> pulled<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.190> thing<00:02:14.340> out<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:14.760> inch<00:02:14.940> and

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
weren't pulled the thing out in inch and

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.449 
weren't pulled the thing out in inch and
a<00:02:15.150> half<00:02:15.180> where<00:02:16.170> we<00:02:16.290> did<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.800> gentle<00:02:17.250> arc

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
a half where we did it in a gentle arc

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.020 
a half where we did it in a gentle arc
that<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.450> really<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.350> won't<00:02:20.340> be<00:02:20.550> able<00:02:20.910> to

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
that you really you won't be able to

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.600 
that you really you won't be able to
tell<00:02:21.470> Mustang<00:02:22.470> guys<00:02:22.709> will<00:02:22.950> be<00:02:23.070> able<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.430> tell

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
tell Mustang guys will be able to tell
