00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.330 
more of a harsh white on top of the
highlights<00:02:16.810> either<00:02:17.110> like<00:02:17.230> on<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.440> brows<00:02:17.650> on

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
highlights either like on the brows on

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.950 
highlights either like on the brows on
the<00:02:18.550> cheeks<00:02:18.820> right<00:02:19.180> here<00:02:19.360> at<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.570> corner<00:02:19.930> of

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
the cheeks right here at the corner of

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.170 
the cheeks right here at the corner of
the<00:02:20.080> orbital<00:02:20.500> sockets<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.730> then<00:02:21.850> from<00:02:22.000> there

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
the orbital sockets and then from there

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.450 
the orbital sockets and then from there
we<00:02:22.510> just<00:02:22.990> went<00:02:23.140> in<00:02:23.260> with<00:02:23.350> black<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:24.220> was<00:02:24.370> all

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
we just went in with black it was all

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.700 
we just went in with black it was all
about<00:02:24.610> doing<00:02:24.790> greyscale<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:26.350> we<00:02:26.440> went<00:02:26.620> in

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
about doing greyscale so we went in

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.380 
about doing greyscale so we went in
rather<00:02:27.160> than<00:02:27.310> going<00:02:27.400> straight<00:02:27.520> to<00:02:28.000> really

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
rather than going straight to really

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.030 
rather than going straight to really
harsh<00:02:28.630> black<00:02:28.870> we<00:02:29.110> did<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.260> lot<00:02:29.380> of<00:02:29.410> cool<00:02:29.680> rings

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
harsh black we did a lot of cool rings

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.530 
harsh black we did a lot of cool rings
and<00:02:30.340> then<00:02:30.430> filled<00:02:30.730> back<00:02:30.910> in<00:02:31.120> with<00:02:31.360> black

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
and then filled back in with black

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.850 
and then filled back in with black
because<00:02:31.810> we<00:02:31.930> wanted<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.200> go<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.530> I<00:02:32.590> figured

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
because we wanted to go and I figured

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.380 
because we wanted to go and I figured
out<00:02:32.920> what<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.160> shapes<00:02:33.460> I<00:02:33.640> wanted<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:33.970> be<00:02:34.060> for

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
out what the shapes I wanted to be for

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.000 
out what the shapes I wanted to be for
Meghan's<00:02:34.690> makeup<00:02:35.050> we<00:02:35.500> wanted<00:02:35.740> to<00:02:35.830> have<00:02:35.980> a

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
Meghan's makeup we wanted to have a

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.640 
Meghan's makeup we wanted to have a
little<00:02:36.310> bit<00:02:36.430> of<00:02:36.930> variation<00:02:37.930> between<00:02:38.200> them<00:02:38.470> so

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
little bit of variation between them so

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.770 
little bit of variation between them so
we<00:02:38.740> did<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:38.890> full<00:02:39.130> skull<00:02:39.460> on<00:02:39.610> her<00:02:39.790> it's

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
we did a full skull on her it's

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.180 
we did a full skull on her it's
basically<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.170> same<00:02:41.320> exact<00:02:41.620> principle<00:02:41.980> we

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
basically the same exact principle we

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.770 
basically the same exact principle we
started<00:02:42.490> with<00:02:42.580> a<00:02:42.610> plain<00:02:42.820> even<00:02:43.240> base<00:02:43.420> coat<00:02:43.690> of

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
started with a plain even base coat of

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.360 
started with a plain even base coat of
white<00:02:43.930> we<00:02:44.680> go<00:02:44.800> back<00:02:44.950> in<00:02:45.100> through<00:02:45.250> the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
white we go back in through the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.010 
white we go back in through the
highlights<00:02:45.670> again<00:02:45.940> on<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.180> ground<00:02:46.450> which<00:02:46.840> is

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
highlights again on the ground which is

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.620 
highlights again on the ground which is
the<00:02:47.410> chin<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:48.700> then<00:02:48.790> from<00:02:49.000> there<00:02:49.180> it's<00:02:49.390> kind

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
the chin and then from there it's kind

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.030 
the chin and then from there it's kind
of<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.750> same<00:02:49.930> basic<00:02:50.350> principle<00:02:50.470> we're<00:02:50.950> gonna

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
of the same basic principle we're gonna

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.310 
of the same basic principle we're gonna
go<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.880> what<00:02:52.000> we<00:02:52.090> did<00:02:52.240> was<00:02:52.390> i<00:02:52.510> chiseled<00:02:53.080> out

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
go and what we did was i chiseled out

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.510 
go and what we did was i chiseled out
the<00:02:53.530> cheeks<00:02:53.770> to<00:02:53.920> kind<00:02:54.190> of<00:02:54.280> sketched

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
the cheeks to kind of sketched

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.890 
the cheeks to kind of sketched
everything<00:02:54.970> in<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.240> make<00:02:55.390> sure<00:02:55.540> everything

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
everything in to make sure everything

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.720 
everything in to make sure everything
was<00:02:56.020> gonna<00:02:56.170> fit<00:02:56.470> where<00:02:56.650> I<00:02:56.680> wanted<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.280> then

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
was gonna fit where I wanted and then

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.400 
was gonna fit where I wanted and then
once<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.180> got<00:02:58.270> everything<00:02:58.570> lined<00:02:58.900> up<00:02:59.050> I<00:02:59.230> knew<00:02:59.380> I

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
once I got everything lined up I knew I

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.080 
once I got everything lined up I knew I
could<00:02:59.650> start<00:02:59.860> going<00:03:00.010> in<00:03:00.190> with<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.760> harsher

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
could start going in with the harsher

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.360 
could start going in with the harsher
blacks<00:03:01.330> you<00:03:02.290> notice<00:03:02.530> on<00:03:02.650> hers<00:03:02.830> it's<00:03:03.100> a<00:03:03.160> little
