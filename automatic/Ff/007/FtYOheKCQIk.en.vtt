now this air charge difference is gonna

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.500 
now this air charge difference is gonna
mean<00:04:00.640> more<00:04:00.820> horsepower

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
mean more horsepower

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
figure out some of the transitions that

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.060 
figure out some of the transitions that

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
careful with the car after we were able

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
to finish the throttle body everything

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.210 
to finish the throttle body everything
was<00:04:31.660> perfect<00:04:32.110> for<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.380> tune<00:04:32.560> so<00:04:32.830> we<00:04:32.920> decided

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
was perfect for the tune so we decided

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.130 
was perfect for the tune so we decided
to<00:04:33.310> swap<00:04:33.580> pulleys<00:04:34.030> and<00:04:34.270> a<00:04:34.600> little<00:04:34.840> bit<00:04:34.960> more

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
to swap pulleys and a little bit more

to swap pulleys and a little bit more
boost<00:04:35.380> put<00:04:35.980> some<00:04:36.100> race<00:04:36.250> gas<00:04:36.520> in<00:04:36.730> the<00:04:36.790> tank<00:04:37.030> and

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
boost put some race gas in the tank and

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.640 
boost put some race gas in the tank and
see<00:04:37.510> what<00:04:37.630> it<00:04:37.690> she'd<00:04:37.840> make<00:04:37.990> on<00:04:38.140> the<00:04:38.260> horsepower

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
see what it she'd make on the horsepower

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.100 
see what it she'd make on the horsepower
for<00:04:38.890> a<00:04:39.070> race<00:04:39.340> tune<00:04:39.610> so<00:04:40.510> what<00:04:40.660> you<00:04:40.780> can<00:04:40.930> see<00:04:41.080> here

for a race tune so what you can see here

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.200 
for a race tune so what you can see here
is<00:04:42.480> we<00:04:43.480> made<00:04:43.919> 633<00:04:44.919> horsepower<00:04:45.520> on<00:04:45.790> the<00:04:46.030> race

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
is we made 633 horsepower on the race

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.100 
is we made 633 horsepower on the race

this<00:05:11.410> week<00:05:11.820> it<00:05:12.820> looks<00:05:13.030> like<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.330> cars

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
this week it looks like the cars

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.420 
this week it looks like the cars
definitely<00:05:13.810> got<00:05:14.169> 10-second<00:05:14.770> capabilities

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430

the<00:05:17.740> only<00:05:17.919> thing<00:05:18.070> holding<00:05:18.190> us<00:05:18.430> back<00:05:18.780> usually

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
the only thing holding us back usually

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.840 
the only thing holding us back usually
we<00:05:20.050> go<00:05:20.200> with<00:05:20.320> like<00:05:20.410> a<00:05:20.500> 410<00:05:20.950> or<00:05:21.130> a<00:05:21.160> 430<00:05:21.640> gear

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
we go with like a 410 or a 430 gear
