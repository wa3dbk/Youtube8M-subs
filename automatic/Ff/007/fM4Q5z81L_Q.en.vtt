00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
different things sometimes we tend to

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.720 
different things sometimes we tend to
try<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.210> use<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:46.289> same<00:00:46.559> password<00:00:46.770> all<00:00:47.309> over

iPad<00:01:06.979> app<00:01:07.979> actually<00:01:08.580> let's<00:01:08.820> get<00:01:09.030> started<00:01:09.600> here

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
iPad app actually let's get started here

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.590 
iPad app actually let's get started here
when<00:01:10.740> we<00:01:10.890> first<00:01:11.189> load<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.580> app<00:01:11.640> by<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.390> way

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
when we first load the app by the way

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.560 
when we first load the app by the way
the<00:01:12.869> app<00:01:12.990> costs<00:01:14.750> 995<00:01:15.799> so<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:17.340> there<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> there

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the app costs 995 so in there is a there

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.570 
the app costs 995 so in there is a there
is<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.720> desktop<00:01:19.140> version<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.890> app<00:01:20.159> as<00:01:20.400> well

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
is a desktop version of that app as well

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.320 
is a desktop version of that app as well
which<00:01:20.990> for<00:01:21.990> Windows<00:01:22.290> crossed<00:01:23.060> 1995<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.270> I

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
which for Windows crossed 1995 and I

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.390 
which for Windows crossed 1995 and I
think<00:01:24.509> there<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.720> there<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.500> version<00:01:26.009> for
