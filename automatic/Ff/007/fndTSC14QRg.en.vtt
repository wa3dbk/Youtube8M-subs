00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
running around so much I definitely like

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.590 
running around so much I definitely like
the<00:02:22.480> powerful<00:02:23.480> sense<00:02:23.750> so<00:02:24.560> that's<00:02:24.740> a<00:02:24.920> plus

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
the powerful sense so that's a plus

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.030

I'm<00:02:42.830> using<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.190> century<00:02:43.520> good<00:02:44.500> i<00:02:45.730> think<00:02:46.730> that

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
I'm using the century good i think that

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.910 
I'm using the century good i think that
the<00:02:47.060> sentry<00:02:47.390> gun<00:02:47.540> is<00:02:47.720> so<00:02:47.959> underrated<00:02:48.440> in<00:02:48.740> this

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
the sentry gun is so underrated in this

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.120 
the sentry gun is so underrated in this
game<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.670> never<00:02:49.850> see<00:02:50.209> anyone<00:02:50.630> using<00:02:51.020> this<00:02:51.140> but

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
game you never see anyone using this but

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.890 
game you never see anyone using this but
it<00:02:52.310> could<00:02:52.430> easily<00:02:52.640> get<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.209> more<00:02:53.390> kill<00:02:53.690> from

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
it could easily get you more kill from

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.650 
it could easily get you more kill from
the<00:02:53.990> prisoner<00:02:54.700> because<00:02:55.700> everyone<00:02:56.300> uses<00:02:56.630> a

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
the prisoner because everyone uses a

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.870 
the prisoner because everyone uses a
predator<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.350> get<00:02:57.500> that<00:02:57.650> easy<00:02:57.890> one<00:02:58.280> maybe

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
predator to get that easy one maybe

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.600 
predator to get that easy one maybe
three<00:02:59.810> show<00:03:01.150> but<00:03:02.150> i<00:03:02.590> think<00:03:03.590> that's<00:03:04.160> such<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.310> gun

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
three show but i think that's such a gun

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.380 
three show but i think that's such a gun
so<00:03:05.150> much<00:03:05.300> better<00:03:05.540> oh<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:07.010> I<00:03:07.220> I<00:03:07.610> kind<00:03:08.060> of<00:03:08.150> fail

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
so much better oh and I I kind of fail

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.570 
so much better oh and I I kind of fail
like<00:03:08.630> going<00:03:08.810> down<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:08.959> ladder<00:03:09.290> right<00:03:09.530> here<00:03:09.709> am

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580

I<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.730> only<00:03:10.910> one<00:03:11.269> that<00:03:11.450> thinks<00:03:11.660> ladders<00:03:12.290> and

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
I the only one that thinks ladders and

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.940 
I the only one that thinks ladders and
games<00:03:12.800> are<00:03:13.040> always<00:03:13.430> so<00:03:13.760> hard<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.120> go<00:03:14.239> down<00:03:14.950> they

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
games are always so hard to go down they

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.470 
games are always so hard to go down they
got<00:03:16.130> to<00:03:16.220> change<00:03:16.459> something<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:17.090> know<00:03:17.180> because

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.690 
got to change something you know because
I<00:03:17.720> just<00:03:18.260> suck<00:03:18.590> at<00:03:18.620> ladders<00:03:19.040> I<00:03:19.160> try<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.400> avoid

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
I just suck at ladders I try to avoid

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.729

it to a little bit more populated area
which<00:04:24.290> is<00:04:24.440> right<00:04:24.680> here<00:04:24.730> this<00:04:25.730> can<00:04:25.970> usually<00:04:26.120> get

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
which is right here this can usually get

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.860 
which is right here this can usually get
a<00:04:26.510> future<00:04:27.520> but<00:04:28.520> for<00:04:28.790> the<00:04:29.210> game<00:04:29.450> for<00:04:29.690> some

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
a future but for the game for some

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.150 
a future but for the game for some
reason<00:04:30.170> I<00:04:30.260> just<00:04:30.290> don't<00:04:30.860> get<00:04:30.980> too<00:04:31.160> many<00:04:31.190> sadly

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
reason I just don't get too many sadly

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.280 
reason I just don't get too many sadly
and<00:04:34.160> yeah<00:04:34.460> I<00:04:34.790> know<00:04:34.850> this<00:04:35.300> isn't<00:04:35.510> my<00:04:35.660> best<00:04:35.960> game

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
and yeah I know this isn't my best game

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.520 
and yeah I know this isn't my best game
I've<00:04:36.560> died<00:04:36.890> maybe<00:04:37.270> 45<00:04:38.270> times<00:04:38.630> already<00:04:38.930> but<00:04:39.230> I

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
I've died maybe 45 times already but I

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.690 
I've died maybe 45 times already but I
think<00:04:39.890> that's<00:04:40.070> it<00:04:40.220> for<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.520> game<00:04:42.250> not<00:04:43.250> my<00:04:43.460> best

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
think that's it for the game not my best

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:50.110 
think that's it for the game not my best
kill<00:04:44.330> death<00:04:44.570> ratio<00:04:44.690> but<00:04:45.320> i'll<00:04:46.040> live<00:04:46.310> i<00:04:49.120> think

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
kill death ratio but i'll live i think

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.460 
kill death ratio but i'll live i think
my<00:04:50.300> last<00:04:50.540> definite<00:04:51.050> have<00:04:51.260> an<00:04:51.410> upscale<00:04:53.470> maybe

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
my last definite have an upscale maybe

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.880 
my last definite have an upscale maybe
that<00:04:54.800> area<00:04:55.160> I<00:04:55.430> think<00:04:55.670> you<00:04:55.730> already<00:04:55.850> have<00:04:56.890> and

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
that area I think you already have and

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.320 
that area I think you already have and
I'm<00:04:58.070> waiting<00:04:58.370> for<00:04:58.400> rich<00:04:58.640> care<00:04:58.850> package<00:04:59.240> right

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
I'm waiting for rich care package right

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.770 
I'm waiting for rich care package right
now<00:04:59.950> but<00:05:00.950> sadly

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
now but sadly

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.760 
now but sadly
and<00:05:03.470> I<00:05:03.560> get<00:05:03.710> your<00:05:03.920> order<00:05:05.139> so<00:05:06.139> not<00:05:06.320> much<00:05:06.440> change

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
and I get your order so not much change

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.580 
and I get your order so not much change
right<00:05:06.980> there<00:05:07.210> and<00:05:08.210> I<00:05:08.720> thought<00:05:09.139> that<00:05:09.200> someone

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
right there and I thought that someone

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.260 
right there and I thought that someone
else<00:05:09.710> was<00:05:09.889> augmenter<00:05:10.430> the<00:05:10.520> care<00:05:10.700> package<00:05:11.090> but

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
else was augmenter the care package but

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.810 
else was augmenter the care package but
I<00:05:11.480> guess<00:05:11.690> that's<00:05:11.720> I<00:05:12.230> just<00:05:12.740> kind<00:05:12.889> of<00:05:12.980> leave<00:05:13.430> it<00:05:13.490> I

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
I guess that's I just kind of leave it I

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:19.330 
I guess that's I just kind of leave it I
don't<00:05:14.750> need<00:05:14.870> it<00:05:15.020> anyway<00:05:17.139> I<00:05:18.160> only<00:05:19.160> have<00:05:19.280> a
