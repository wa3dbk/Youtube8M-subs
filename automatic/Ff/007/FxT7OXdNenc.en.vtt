00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
that because of like Callaway or because

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.410 
that because of like Callaway or because
of<00:01:28.170> economy<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:29.460> kind<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.759> combination<00:01:30.060> of

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
of economy it's kind of a combination of

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.700 
of economy it's kind of a combination of
both<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:30.869> basically<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.350> know<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
both it's basically you know this is a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.370 
both it's basically you know this is a
low-income<00:01:32.159> area<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.030> grocery<00:01:33.840> stores<00:01:34.110> don't

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
low-income area so grocery stores don't

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.690 
low-income area so grocery stores don't
want<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.590> set<00:01:34.740> up<00:01:34.770> shop<00:01:34.890> here<00:01:35.340> because<00:01:35.610> they

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
want to set up shop here because they

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.460 
want to set up shop here because they
don't<00:01:35.790> think<00:01:36.060> they'll<00:01:36.240> get<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.540> right<00:01:36.720> amount

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
don't think they'll get the right amount

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.950 
don't think they'll get the right amount
of<00:01:37.770> revenue<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:39.119> what<00:01:39.299> happens<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.930> know

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
of revenue so what happens is you know

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.330 
of revenue so what happens is you know
the<00:01:40.140> nearest<00:01:40.470> place<00:01:40.829> where<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.250> get

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
the nearest place where you can get

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.100 
the nearest place where you can get
fresh<00:01:41.610> healthy<00:01:41.820> food<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.329> two<00:01:42.600> three<00:01:42.930> miles

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
fresh healthy food is two three miles

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.289 
fresh healthy food is two three miles
away<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.100> if<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.430> imagine<00:01:44.610> being<00:01:44.970> someone

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
away so if you can imagine being someone

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.370 
away so if you can imagine being someone
living<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.750> neighborhood<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.229> know

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
living in this neighborhood you know

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.749 
living in this neighborhood you know

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
they don't have much money they have to

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.999 
they don't have much money they have to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
and their kids and go you know two miles

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.530 
and their kids and go you know two miles

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
that's not gonna happen all the time

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.100 
that's not gonna happen all the time
nope<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.670> what<00:01:57.420> you're<00:01:57.540> doing<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.810> really<00:01:58.079> a

inside and we'll start to have a look at

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.810 
inside and we'll start to have a look at
some<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.100> things<00:02:02.280> you're<00:02:02.430> doing<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.729> that

okay<00:02:03.380> let's<00:02:04.380> go

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
okay let's go

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.730 
okay let's go
a<00:02:06.090> little<00:02:06.570> bit<00:02:06.690> cheaper<00:02:07.049> than<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.290> PVC

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
a little bit cheaper than the PVC

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.620 
a little bit cheaper than the PVC
plastic<00:02:08.250> part<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.819> our<00:02:08.940> goal<00:02:09.119> here<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.600> to

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
plastic part of our goal here is to

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.740 
plastic part of our goal here is to
lower<00:02:10.619> our<00:02:10.740> cause<00:02:11.009> across<00:02:11.340> as<00:02:11.490> possible<00:02:12.000> be<00:02:12.660> as

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
lower our cause across as possible be as

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.230 
lower our cause across as possible be as
low<00:02:12.959> energy<00:02:13.140> as<00:02:13.410> possible<00:02:13.890> also<00:02:14.459> there<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:15.030> two

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
low energy as possible also there is two

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.240 
low energy as possible also there is two
layers<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:15.990> drop<00:02:16.260> here<00:02:16.290> which<00:02:16.920> allows

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
layers in this drop here which allows

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.059 
layers in this drop here which allows
water<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.270> overflow<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:19.050> go<00:02:19.290> into<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.590> second

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
water to overflow and go into a second

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.610 
water to overflow and go into a second
Wow<00:02:20.400> that's<00:02:20.670> lady<00:02:20.940> gets<00:02:21.780> better<00:02:21.990> aeration<00:02:22.500> to

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
Wow that's lady gets better aeration to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.050 
Wow that's lady gets better aeration to
the<00:02:22.709> roots<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.160> really<00:02:23.220> addresses<00:02:23.819> one<00:02:24.030> of

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
the roots and really addresses one of

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.640 
the roots and really addresses one of
the<00:02:24.300> bigger<00:02:24.540> problems<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.200> have<00:02:25.380> with

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
the bigger problems you have with

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.640 
the bigger problems you have with
traditional<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.489> FPS<00:02:27.000> -<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:28.110> this<00:02:28.350> is<00:02:28.500> quite

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
traditional in FPS - so this is quite

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.500 
traditional in FPS - so this is quite
expensive<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.550> know<00:02:29.670> it's<00:02:29.790> important<00:02:30.450> we

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
expensive you know it's important we

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.820 
expensive you know it's important we
wanted<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.900> do<00:02:31.050> something<00:02:31.470> different<00:02:31.560> with

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830
