00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 Hi there, this is a review of tank t-34 3 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.010
 more precisely video tips how to raise it 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.809
 the effectiveness of their hands first we 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.200
 need to decide on modules for this 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.849
 tank and crew skills from the modules we 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.650
 put the ventilation and rammer and 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.410
 vertical alignment stabilizer 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.470
 so it does not reduce the time information and 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.240
 reloading for crew main skill 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.760
 this martial brotherhood is a smooth turn 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.109
 turrets and smooth ride 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.449
 consumables can be inserted as simple 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.800
 so for gold but without gold 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.480
 shells will often be tight 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.940
 since we want to not only ponagibat but 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.230
 and pick a tactic in my opinion 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.920
 quite peculiar to him 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.690
 calling her battle firefly shine like 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.190
 on this tank we will fail so 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.739
 choose a safe route and and go as 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.120
 can be closer to the enemy 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.129
 raise it because we have to 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.100
 vylazit flashes cause damage and 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.769
 hiding because recharging with us 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.890
 about dance seconds when staged earlier 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.110
 listed skill and modules 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.060
 must cover 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.390
 allies with good guns and not always 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.440
 artillery is suitable for this role if 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.690
 cover us to no one that is often the case 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.070
 go allied stitches and do the same 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.570
 that they either 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.580
 and liner with heavy tanks and cover them 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.070
 in this fight I only shot armor-piercing 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.009
 shells 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.020
 fired 15 shot in 13 of them passed with 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.979
 breaking through 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.009
 as you see from this distance 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.759
 shoot is not difficult to wait long for information 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.759
 not necessary 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.950
 and if it's not risky, then I can not 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.950
 find near targets 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.680
 shoot long distances even with 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.680
 places at full among
