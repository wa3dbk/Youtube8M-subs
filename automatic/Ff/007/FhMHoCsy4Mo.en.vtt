00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:07.710
 hi guys are emmett brown visited 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.460
 site 20 sign up for the youtube channel 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.910
 and to the facebook group today anima to see 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.119
 how to set and check the level of 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.850
 radiator fluid what it looks like 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:26.130
 trivial but alas until now how 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.570
 radiator fluid used 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.019
 this is the flop parÃ  

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.750
 this concentrated version and so of it 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.469
 louis koo to my pleasure here is this 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.480
 for engines with aluminum text of is 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:45.090
 Red 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:49.800
 we have the tank above for 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.020
 disassemble it we get the cap we can do 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.239
 light to disassemble the manual tells us of 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.780
 remove the front panel instead 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.090
 what the level we have to see then 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.680
 first impact 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:07.590
 then here I currently dc is empty e 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.580
 it doesn't open very little when you see it 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.909
 at first it should not be filled up everything 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.619
 this because because ours 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.230
 tank is made to a u-shape 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.710
 because it passes around the 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:29.430
 around the handlebar is really made into 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.550
 this way however one thing 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.130
 that which is not good and which honestly put 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.390
 in plan but in vertical it is put in 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.880
 this way and that is the water will go to 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.430
 settle in obviously on the sides for 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.270
 coming down where the bumps if we do it 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:56.850
 we fill too much liquid will come out in 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:02:01.280
 Following it took me a while to it is 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.280
 dropped another pole 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.619
 you see it coming down or saying that it passes 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:11.630
 on the other hand and it remains then it is 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:16.260
 stopped now we can at first glance 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.420
 we can say if the liquid is what 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:25.739
 we must do we must mount on 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:28.650
 moped and and tilt it on its own 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.060
 that way when we come back 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.390
 we will see that the liquid will pass by 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.739
 on the other hand when we bring it in 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.209
 position at the if the liquid returns from 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.010
 this part means that from the other 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.320
 full part 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.630
 if instead the liquid does not return it wants 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.750
 say that the other part is still empty 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.400
 we must re overflow again 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.570
 usually a scooter we will send from the other 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.970
 part of the radiator fluid and up to 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.250
 when he didn't see a back there if there 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.320
 return honey means that it is full 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.850
 while this water is only a ditch 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:08.730
 a dun dun of the tank has 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.190
 having done this we can close it to many 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.070
 to many it is deceived 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.110
 they say but I see it there is the liquid yes 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.350
 ok it's on this side but it's not there 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.180
 on the other but this is not a problem 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.510
 we can solve it because the 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.850
 tank did it this way e 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.170
 so we keep it so important 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.630
 than us twice and put them 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.470
 let's control and leaven bow down 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.450
 motor on the side and if it does not return it wants to 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.470
 say that on the other side is empty and here 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.940
 we have to overflow ok ok guys if 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.180
 the video you liked put me a 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.180
