 and now we pass the recommendation 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.340
 Christmas the book that I'm going to 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.440
 recommend is the color of dreams of 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.570
 route is pretty a book that I loved 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.460
 very much is my favorites the 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.740
 story is set from the 50s 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.480
 and it starts with josh and he's 10 years old and 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.520
 her mother and she return to the loyal place 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.380
 because his mother is a prostitute has 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.420
 she's out of work and wants me to take her 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.150
 in the brothel where he worked before 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.280
 The evil nerd brothel principle is very 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.630
 reluctant to take it but see that the girl 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.520
 It has a lot of potential and it is very 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.650
 smart and he takes it more than anything 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.930
 the girl the story continues seven years 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.970
 later when I am 17 years old and 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.810
 live in an apartment that is above 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.270
 of the store 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.250
 where your mother already works is a person 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.230
 very materialistic that only cares 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.910
 by herself and since she was very small 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.130
 to look for life herself and 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.800
 look for work and such willy that is the 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.569
 adam of the brothel is looking for a job in 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.790
 the bookstore where he works in the afternoon 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.650
 and in the morning help willy with the 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.510
 accounts and also cleaning the brothel 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.550
 it will seem a very strange story 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.230
 if it's worth I had never read anything like that 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.000
 what I liked most about this story 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.470
 are the characters that are are very 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.690
 special each one has a 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.910
 very marked personality and have 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.549
 very different personalities and good is 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.860
 the story of her wanting not 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.930
 look like his mother because he has not 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.580
 never treated well as he deserved and 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.989
 wants to be a much better person has 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.970
 I really liked how you write routes on 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.530
 betis is amazing as you write I like 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.470
 very much in that series there are also 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.500
 murders mafia and seriously you have to 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.290
 see him because they cry 5 out of 5 is amazing 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.540
 It is very original and you will love it and I am 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.519
 sure and my recommendation is a book 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.769
 I 'm sure many of you 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.959
 you know but few the view of a 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.090
 opportunity as he happened to me is the 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.060
 value of memories the first part 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.820
 as I said is a book that knows him 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.500
 many people but few have read it and I 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.060
 I have been slow to do it and I 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.010
 I regret because the truth is that it has 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.040
 delighted an account the history of jonÃ¡s 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.889
 which it is a 12 year old boy who lives in a 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.780
 very strange world where it is like they have been 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:46.110
 deprived of the feelings of the 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.169
 emotions and to say it in a way is 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.060
 all quite linear so to speak not 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.280
 they experience neither sadness and 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.770
 happiness or the hostel if they are in a 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.229
 Midpoint to make life easier 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.240
 they have erased all the memories of 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.820
 what was the world previously for 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.130
 that they can not know that there are more 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.169
 things of which they know other 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.780
 very curious thing is that they see everything in 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.030
 black and white because they believe that the 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.310
 colors will make you have to choose 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.500
 between this and this and that is already 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.320
 complicate life the story itself 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.789
 this jonÃ¡s as done at the beginning that a 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.770
 see all children at the age of 12 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:25.740
 years is assigned to a mission to 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.740
 It's your turn to be the memory receiver 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.910
 it is a mission that give each lot 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.730
 years 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.860
 he's a little scared because in 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.810
 does not really know who is the recipient of 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.700
 memory and portray it as if to 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.640
 be something that will cause pain 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:45.240
 unimaginable but then he realizes 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.920
 he likes but also to see how 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.960
 before we realize 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.810
 that is unfair that they have been 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.030
 deprived everyone of such things 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.280
 pretty so to speak is a book to 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.010
 I gave it a 5 out of 5 so you can 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.200
 imagine is a classic if inside is a 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.900
 classic there's even a movie but it 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.610
 it seems nothing once we hope that you 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.950
 have really liked this initiative and that 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.480

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.530
