any any scenery from the background in

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.690 
any any scenery from the background in
this<00:01:50.939> picture<00:01:51.270> there<00:01:51.450> were<00:01:51.600> buoys<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.890> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
this picture there were buoys in the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.789 
this picture there were buoys in the
back<00:01:53.850> over<00:01:54.149> there<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.689> removed<00:01:55.229> those<00:01:55.470> from

her
so<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.560> hardest<00:01:58.860> part<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.190> to<00:01:59.430> decide<00:01:59.790> which

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
so the hardest part is to decide which

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.240 
so the hardest part is to decide which
affects<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.020> most<00:02:01.170> there<00:02:01.950> are
