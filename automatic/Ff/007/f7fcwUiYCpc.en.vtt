pylon pylon coming out right near
thinking<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.870> an<00:00:39.989> early<00:00:40.320> expansion<00:00:40.590> perhaps

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010

this<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> very<00:00:41.760> nicely<00:00:42.120> placed<00:00:42.480> pilot<00:00:42.930> if

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
this is a very nicely placed pilot if

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.619 
this is a very nicely placed pilot if
you<00:00:43.020> look<00:00:43.200> at<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.590> exactly<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:45.300> kind<00:00:45.329> of

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
you look at it it's exactly the kind of

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.560 
you look at it it's exactly the kind of
thing<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.870> want<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:48.149> do<00:00:48.300> see<00:00:48.539> a

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
thing you want to have we do see a

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.950 
thing you want to have we do see a
spawning<00:00:48.989> pool<00:00:49.350> going<00:00:49.620> down<00:00:49.739> at<00:00:50.250> 90<00:00:51.059> very

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
spawning pool going down at 90 very

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.100 
spawning pool going down at 90 very
early<00:00:52.289> spawning<00:00:52.649> pool<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.860> think<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:54.390> we're

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
early spawning pool I think and we're

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.689 
early spawning pool I think and we're
going<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.379> see<00:00:55.500> some<00:00:55.530> action<00:00:55.890> very<00:00:56.250> quickly<00:00:56.579> I

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
going to see some action very quickly I

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.479 
going to see some action very quickly I
believe<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:58.109> Overlord<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:59.160> to

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
believe this one Overlord is going to

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.060 
believe this one Overlord is going to
the<00:01:00.059> duck<00:01:00.539> low<00:01:01.410> raw<00:01:01.770> position<00:01:03.650> we<00:01:04.650> do<00:01:04.830> see

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
the duck low raw position we do see

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.060 
the duck low raw position we do see
additional<00:01:05.309> workers<00:01:05.909> being<00:01:07.040> created<00:01:08.040> right

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
additional workers being created right

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.240 
additional workers being created right
now<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.549> probes<00:01:09.420> coming<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.500> one<00:01:10.830> probe

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
now and probes coming in this one probe

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.080 
now and probes coming in this one probe
is<00:01:11.580> going<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.939> determine<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:13.159> the<00:01:14.159> tone<00:01:15.060> for

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
is going to determine the the tone for

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.780 
is going to determine the the tone for
this<00:01:15.420> game<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:15.900> he<00:01:15.990> does<00:01:16.200> set<00:01:16.740> one<00:01:17.159> gateway<00:01:17.490> and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
this game as he does set one gateway and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.870 
this game as he does set one gateway and
he's<00:01:18.390> waiting<00:01:18.689> what<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.650> he<00:01:19.770> gonna<00:01:19.860> set<00:01:20.250> next<00:01:20.580> a

he's waiting what is he gonna set next a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.230 
he's waiting what is he gonna set next a
forge<00:01:21.810> or<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> gateway<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.710> forgery<00:01:23.549> gateway

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
then these erick sees this and he starts

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.110 
then these erick sees this and he starts
shooting<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.750> pylon

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
shooting the pylon

shooting the pylon
and<00:01:41.240> apparently<00:01:41.420> there<00:01:41.690> was<00:01:41.750> some<00:01:41.810> lag<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.380> we

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
do see mad frog pulls one to four probes
