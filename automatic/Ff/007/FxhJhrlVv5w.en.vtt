and<00:01:08.920> that<00:01:09.070> is<00:01:09.189> to<00:01:09.369> attack<00:01:09.729> quickly<00:01:10.030> enough

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390

it's<00:01:10.840> no<00:01:11.020> longer<00:01:11.409> I<00:01:11.619> think<00:01:11.650> we'll<00:01:12.580> see<00:01:12.820> how<00:01:13.270> we

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330

it's no longer I think we'll see how we
will<00:01:13.750> attack<00:01:14.170> Cologne<00:01:14.590> tomorrow<00:01:15.010> and<00:01:15.369> what

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
will attack Cologne tomorrow and what

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.450 
will attack Cologne tomorrow and what

our underlying offensive concept will be

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.370 
our underlying offensive concept will be
like<00:01:18.670> one<00:01:19.119> way<00:01:19.270> or<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.420> other<00:01:19.540> we<00:01:20.200> will

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
like one way or the other we will

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.870 
like one way or the other we will
certainly<00:01:20.830> have<00:01:21.009> to<00:01:21.040> control<00:01:21.580> their
