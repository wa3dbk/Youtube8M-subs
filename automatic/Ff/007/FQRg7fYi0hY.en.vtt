00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 when you think of top-end graphics in 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.680
 games you naturally do not mean 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.690
 Xbox 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.480
 or any other console you immediately 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.090
 think for now 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.160
 this system with two video cards 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.020
 which we brought here just like that but 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.560
 digital storm have driven us a system with 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.930
 by four 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.180
 very high in terms of iron and 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.460
 we asked our friends from quar enix 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.080
 share with us information about their work 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.840
 which is a mixture 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.349
 computational science quality graphics and 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.510
 art to share information about 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.760
 what they can do and divide x12 and 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.070
 windows 10 where these technologies will be 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.989
 first implemented now and main 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.989
 the engineer will sound a little intro 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.700
 my name is hache metabo that is 2 departments 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.550
 business of the company square enix where we are 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.020
 create a fantasy fantasy 15 our team 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.059
 trying to achieve more and more 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.860
 vertices in both for previously processed 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.719
 and handle the present tense 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.309
 computer graphics to the present 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.140
 time with microsoft and we 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.539
 have prepared for you the haze created with 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.699
 using the latest technology we share 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.769
 with you a preview of our current developments 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.939
 who will continue to change the future 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.799
 in many directions 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.570
 relax and enjoy our 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.580
 the latest developments of Square Enix 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.119
 sold 100 million copies of the file 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.820
 fantasy 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.369
 they owe their success to art and science 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.670
 technologies that go hand in hand the 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.640
 what they saw it was 9 x 11 now I will launch 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.500
 the same at 9 x 12 looking at it you 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.630
 you might think that this is also a video 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.729
 but the truth is that this direct x 12 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.350
 action now we will switch 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.329
 between manual and automatic and 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.970
 Controls and I can squander 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.250
 back and forth and we will see that I 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.380
 Managed manually will now be running 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.000
 automatic mode but when change 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.380
 lighting you will see it happen 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.210
 in real time 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.070
 now i pause and i can 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.060
 look around look down change 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.009
 lighting effects 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.799
 we can go on like this 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.380
 turn on the shadows remove them well let's 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.990
 continue i will skip this part and move on 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.509
 for the next look at these skin colors 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.939
 when we approach what is really 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.860
 so striking is a big improvement 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.740
 used here each of these prices 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.039
 uses over 63 million polygons 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.530
 this is about 6 to 12 times more than 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.870
 we could at 9 x 11 just pop 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.020
 wash the texture you see it 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.750
 again texture 8k to 8k is much 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.970
 more than we could before most 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.220
 interesting starts on the hair each 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.350
 hair is processed by a separate polygon 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.170
 This me some unpretentious texture 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.060
 Up to 50 types of shaders participate in scenes. 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.130
 each of which are responsible for 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.890
 various effects such as fog and smoke 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.560
 light water steam shadows and things like that 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.480
 after this rich shader processing 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.120
 the picture is incredible 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.220
 Many thanks to square 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.650
 enix for the material provided and for their 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.420
 a job that is awesome 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.420
 a mixture of high technology and art
