00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
rounds like I made a mistake and then

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.500 
rounds like I made a mistake and then
got<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.220> little<00:01:59.400> bit<00:01:59.610> behind<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.210> tried<00:02:00.390> to

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
got this little bit behind and tried to

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.420 
got this little bit behind and tried to
push<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.080> make<00:02:01.260> up<00:02:01.470> for<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.220> I<00:02:02.280> actually

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
push the make up for it and I actually

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.640 
push the make up for it and I actually
go<00:02:02.730> slower<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.510> even<00:02:03.870> with<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.050> mistakes<00:02:04.440> at

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
go slower so even with the mistakes at

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.200 
go slower so even with the mistakes at
this<00:02:04.920> time<00:02:05.190> I<00:02:05.220> wasn't<00:02:05.640> quite<00:02:05.880> sure<00:02:06.000> what

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.690 
to hit my lines and be precise and
definitely<00:02:13.770> worked<00:02:13.950> out<00:02:14.130> for<00:02:14.280> me<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.610> that's

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
definitely worked out for me and that's

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.280 
definitely worked out for me and that's
always<00:02:14.970> when<00:02:15.209> I<00:02:15.239> go<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.570> fastest<00:02:16.020> whenever

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
always when I go to the fastest whenever

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.320 
always when I go to the fastest whenever
I<00:02:16.380> try<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.680> push<00:02:16.950> really<00:02:17.160> hard<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.760> tend<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.150> go<00:02:18.300> a

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
I try to push really hard I tend to go a

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.750 
I try to push really hard I tend to go a
bit<00:02:18.600> slower<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.530> wasn't<00:02:19.920> actually<00:02:20.160> worried

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
bit slower so I wasn't actually worried

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.580 
bit slower so I wasn't actually worried
and<00:02:20.970> trying<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.390> go<00:02:21.510> for<00:02:21.660> TQ<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.110> was<00:02:22.440> just

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
and trying to go for TQ I was just

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.880 
and trying to go for TQ I was just
trying<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.450> drive<00:02:24.450> as<00:02:24.600> best<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:25.020> could<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.560> end

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
trying to drive as best I could and end

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.180 
trying to drive as best I could and end
up<00:02:26.160> where<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.400> would<00:02:26.640> and

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
up where I would and

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.100 
up where I would and
fortunately<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:27.970> round<00:02:28.330> out<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.660> exhume<00:02:28.960> you

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
fortunately it round out the exhume you

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.100 
fortunately it round out the exhume you
know<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:30.610> on<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:30.820> track<00:02:31.150> like<00:02:31.390> this<00:02:31.450> that's<00:02:31.990> on

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
know so on a track like this that's on

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.620 
know so on a track like this that's on
the<00:02:32.230> loser<00:02:32.650> side<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.370> difficult<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.480> get

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
the loser side and difficult to get

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.650 
the loser side and difficult to get
around<00:02:34.750> is<00:02:35.530> TQ<00:02:36.070> as<00:02:36.190> important<00:02:36.730> as<00:02:36.850> it<00:02:36.880> as<00:02:37.300> it<00:02:37.330> is

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
around is TQ as important as it as it is

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.440 
around is TQ as important as it as it is
in<00:02:37.810> most<00:02:37.990> races<00:02:38.700> Tiki<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:39.760> always<00:02:40.030> important

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
in most races Tiki is always important

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.480 
in most races Tiki is always important
in<00:02:40.510> every<00:02:40.750> race<00:02:40.900> but<00:02:41.350> I<00:02:41.380> definitely<00:02:42.280> think

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
in every race but I definitely think

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.210 
in every race but I definitely think
with<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.790> huge<00:02:43.060> quad<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.960> the<00:02:44.500> challenges<00:02:45.040> of

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
with the huge quad and the challenges of

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.010 
with the huge quad and the challenges of
this<00:02:45.370> track<00:02:45.760> that<00:02:46.210> there's<00:02:46.510> definitely<00:02:46.900> going

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
this track that there's definitely going

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.330 
this track that there's definitely going
to<00:02:47.080> be<00:02:47.140> some<00:02:47.380> mistakes<00:02:47.710> and<00:02:47.860> stuff<00:02:48.100> but

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
to be some mistakes and stuff but

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.610 
to be some mistakes and stuff but
definitely<00:02:48.910> starting<00:02:49.240> out<00:02:49.360> front<00:02:49.660> you<00:02:49.900> always

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
definitely starting out front you always

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.840 
definitely starting out front you always
have<00:02:50.800> clean<00:02:50.980> air<00:02:51.130> don't<00:02:51.400> have<00:02:51.520> to<00:02:51.610> worry<00:02:51.760> about

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
have clean air don't have to worry about

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.220 
have clean air don't have to worry about
front<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.270> you<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.540> is<00:02:52.660> where<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:52.960> want<00:02:53.080> to

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
front of you and is where you want to

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.140 
front of you and is where you want to
start<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:53.740> it's<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.310> think<00:02:54.370> it's<00:02:54.610> almost<00:02:54.850> just

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
start so it's I think it's almost just

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.890 
start so it's I think it's almost just
as<00:02:55.300> far<00:02:55.570> as<00:02:55.720> any<00:02:55.900> other<00:02:56.020> race<00:02:56.440> for<00:02:56.710> sure
