whole bunch of other boards out that
will<00:00:17.250> support<00:00:17.609> them<00:00:17.880> we<00:00:18.210> checked<00:00:18.480> out<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.630> ud7

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
will support them we checked out the ud7

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.689 
will support them we checked out the ud7
a<00:00:19.439> little<00:00:19.680> while<00:00:19.770> earlier<00:00:20.189> today<00:00:20.490> we're<00:00:20.609> gonna

check out the 990 FX a ud5 now really
the<00:00:24.359> only<00:00:24.539> difference<00:00:24.900> between<00:00:24.960> this

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
the only difference between this

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.779 
the only difference between this
motherboard<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.890> other<00:00:26.010> one<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
motherboard and the other one is the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.880 
motherboard and the other one is the
other<00:00:26.820> one<00:00:26.970> supported<00:00:27.449> both<00:00:27.599> Quad<00:00:27.990> SLI<00:00:28.260> and

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
other one supported both Quad SLI and

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.880 
other one supported both Quad SLI and
quad<00:00:29.369> crossfire<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.539> only<00:00:30.869> supports<00:00:31.289> normal

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
quad crossfire this only supports normal

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.709 
quad crossfire this only supports normal
dual<00:00:32.340> card<00:00:32.700> boats<00:00:32.969> that's<00:00:33.239> really<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> only

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
dual card boats that's really the only

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.330 
dual card boats that's really the only
difference<00:00:33.930> all<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.739> other<00:00:34.860> features<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
difference all the other features of the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.799 
difference all the other features of the
ultra-durable<00:00:35.730> series<00:00:36.180> will<00:00:36.329> be<00:00:36.420> seeing<00:00:36.660> this

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
ultra-durable series will be seeing this

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.360 
ultra-durable series will be seeing this
motherboard<00:00:37.170> all<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.040> stuff<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.340> that

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
motherboard all the stuff that that

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.819 
motherboard all the stuff that that
gigabyte<00:00:38.879> has<00:00:39.090> will<00:00:39.570> be<00:00:39.719> here<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.620> said

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
gigabyte has will be here like I said

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.350 
gigabyte has will be here like I said
really<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.070> only<00:00:41.219> difference<00:00:41.489> from<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.700> UD<00:00:42.030> 7

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
really the only difference from the UD 7

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.119 
really the only difference from the UD 7
in<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.510> UD<00:00:42.780> 5<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.739> difference<00:00:44.070> between

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
in the UD 5 is the difference between

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.130 
in the UD 5 is the difference between
the<00:00:44.640> video<00:00:44.850> card<00:00:45.120> support<00:00:45.570> beyond<00:00:45.930> that

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the video card support beyond that

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.990 
the video card support beyond that
they're<00:00:46.320> pretty<00:00:46.559> much<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.010> same<00:00:47.219> today<00:00:47.850> we're

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
they're pretty much the same today we're

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.250 
they're pretty much the same today we're
going<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.180> do<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> unboxing<00:00:48.510> will<00:00:49.050> show<00:00:49.170> you

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
going to do the unboxing will show you

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.209 
going to do the unboxing will show you
everything<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.559> come<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> side<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
everything that come to the side of the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.889 
everything that come to the side of the
box<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.940> when<00:00:51.059> you're<00:00:51.180> out<00:00:51.239> purchasing<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.840> or

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
box so when you're out purchasing it or

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:52.850 
box so when you're out purchasing it or
maybe<00:00:52.050> when<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.260> go<00:00:52.350> out<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.559> look<00:00:52.649> at<00:00:52.770> this

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
maybe when you go out to look at this

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.200 
maybe when you go out to look at this
motherboard<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.340> buy<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.760> compare<00:00:54.149> and

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
motherboard you buy you can compare and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.700 
motherboard you buy you can compare and
see<00:00:54.390> if<00:00:54.480> everything<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.930> got<00:00:55.110> was<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
see if everything that you got was the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.400 
see if everything that you got was the
same<00:00:55.920> thing<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.239> said<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:58.020> guys<00:00:58.199> can<00:00:58.320> go

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
same thing so that said you guys can go

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.910 
same thing so that said you guys can go

now new 990 FSA chipset supports a lot

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.040 
now new 990 FSA chipset supports a lot
of<00:01:19.980> things<00:01:20.190> usually<00:01:21.150> most<00:01:21.510> of<00:01:21.630> other<00:01:21.810> boards

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
of things usually most of other boards

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.180 
of things usually most of other boards
that<00:01:22.140> we've<00:01:22.260> seen<00:01:22.440> that<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:22.650> come<00:01:22.800> out<00:01:22.920> have

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
that we've seen that have come out have

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.280 
that we've seen that have come out have
been<00:01:23.310> supporting<00:01:23.760> mostly<00:01:24.570> all<00:01:24.780> across<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
been supporting mostly all across the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.160 
been supporting mostly all across the
board<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.800> new<00:01:25.950> SATA<00:01:26.670> 6<00:01:26.910> gigabits<00:01:27.060> only<00:01:28.020> one

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
board the new SATA 6 gigabits only one

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.840 
board the new SATA 6 gigabits only one
board<00:01:28.440> that<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:28.710> saw<00:01:28.920> didn't<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.580> used<00:01:29.760> a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
board that we saw didn't it used a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.040 
board that we saw didn't it used a
different<00:01:30.150> controller<00:01:30.480> but<00:01:30.660> most<00:01:30.870> of<00:01:30.930> them

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
different controller but most of them

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.530 
different controller but most of them
have<00:01:31.190> oops<00:01:32.190> even<00:01:32.820> there<00:01:32.940> folks<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.300> dropped

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
have oops even there folks I dropped

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.780 
have oops even there folks I dropped
something<00:01:33.860> so<00:01:34.860> let's<00:01:35.010> go<00:01:35.310> over<00:01:35.370> here<00:01:35.550> first

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
something so let's go over here first

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.640 
something so let's go over here first
here<00:01:36.510> basically<00:01:36.780> all<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:37.170> stuff<00:01:37.230> that<00:01:37.440> would

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
here basically all the stuff that would

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.140 
here basically all the stuff that would
be<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.100> bundles<00:01:38.490> page<00:01:38.700> if<00:01:38.910> you<00:01:39.030> were

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
be on the bundles page if you were

reading<00:01:39.330> a<00:01:39.510> written<00:01:39.780> review<00:01:39.930> let's<00:01:40.920> go<00:01:41.010> ahead

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
reading a written review let's go ahead

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.230 
reading a written review let's go ahead
and<00:01:41.220> set<00:01:41.370> this<00:01:41.490> stuff<00:01:41.700> out<00:01:41.880> here

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
and set this stuff out here

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.650 
and set this stuff out here
this<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.840> multi<00:01:43.380> installation<00:01:44.130> guide

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
this is the multi installation guide

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.890 
this is the multi installation guide
then<00:01:45.660> I<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.170> g8<00:01:46.500> 990<00:01:47.100> FX<00:01:47.400> AED<00:01:47.850> 5<00:01:48.150> user's

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
then I have the g8 990 FX AED 5 user's

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.730 
then I have the g8 990 FX AED 5 user's
manual<00:01:50.450> that<00:01:51.450> includes<00:01:51.870> the<00:01:52.020> driver<00:01:52.230> CD<00:01:52.560> as

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
manual that includes the driver CD as

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.040 
manual that includes the driver CD as
well<00:01:52.770> set<00:01:53.250> over<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.490> hair<00:01:55.100> then<00:01:56.100> right<00:01:56.280> here

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
well set over the hair then right here

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.260 
well set over the hair then right here
ok<00:01:58.050> so<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.890> guess<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.400> does<00:01:59.550> support<00:01:59.850> triple

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
ok so I guess it does support triple

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.940 
ok so I guess it does support triple
3-way<00:02:00.600> SLI<00:02:00.630> because<00:02:01.350> here's<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.650> 3-way<00:02:01.920> SLI

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
3-way SLI because here's a 3-way SLI

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.250 
3-way SLI because here's a 3-way SLI
bridge<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.120> guess<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.540> sports<00:02:03.810> 3-way<00:02:04.230> SLI

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
bridge so I guess in sports 3-way SLI

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.690 
bridge so I guess in sports 3-way SLI
and<00:02:04.860> dual<00:02:05.490> crossfire<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:08.310> here's<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.670> other

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
and dual crossfire and here's the other

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.210 
and dual crossfire and here's the other
SLI<00:02:09.330> bridge<00:02:11.690> here's<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.840> backplate<00:02:13.260> all

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
SLI bridge here's the backplate all

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.740 
SLI bridge here's the backplate all
color<00:02:14.640> coding<00:02:15.000> everything<00:02:15.060> don't<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.570> see

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
color coding everything don't you see

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.140 
color coding everything don't you see
what's<00:02:15.900> on<00:02:16.050> their<00:02:16.610> axis<00:02:17.610> would<00:02:17.730> actually<00:02:18.060> be

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
what's on their axis would actually be

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.550 
what's on their axis would actually be
pretty<00:02:18.390> good<00:02:18.570> to<00:02:18.720> use<00:02:18.870> actually<00:02:19.320> in<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
pretty good to use actually in the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.590 
pretty good to use actually in the
review<00:02:19.890> actually<00:02:20.100> it<00:02:21.000> actually<00:02:21.090> tells<00:02:21.510> you

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
review actually it actually tells you

00:05:17.489 --> 00:05:17.499 
use the Marvell chipset for one and then

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:19.980 
use the Marvell chipset for one and then
the<00:05:17.589> onboard<00:05:17.919> chipset<00:05:18.309> for<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:18.580> other<00:05:18.990> let's

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
the onboard chipset for the other let's

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.749 
the onboard chipset for the other let's
see<00:05:20.169> here<00:05:20.349> so<00:05:20.860> I<00:05:20.889> pretty<00:05:21.159> much<00:05:21.309> sums<00:05:21.550> that<00:05:21.610> the
