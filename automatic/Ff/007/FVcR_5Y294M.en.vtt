the fret see he is a big man who lives
near<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.030> river<00:03:42.299> so<00:03:43.019> I'd<00:03:43.110> have<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.380> do<00:03:43.500> things

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
near a river so I'd have to do things

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.319 
near a river so I'd have to do things
like<00:03:43.860> that<00:03:44.070> but<00:03:44.310> then<00:03:44.459> I<00:03:44.489> was<00:03:44.790> also<00:03:45.000> allowed<00:03:45.120> to

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
like that but then I was also allowed to

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.410 
like that but then I was also allowed to
mess<00:03:45.989> around<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.500> bit<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:47.360> bring<00:03:48.360> the

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
mess around a bit and bring the

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:55.960 
mess around a bit and bring the
historian<00:03:49.049> to<00:03:49.470> life

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970
