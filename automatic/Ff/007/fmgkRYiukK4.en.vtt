00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
said cool behind-the-scenes video you

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.990 
said cool behind-the-scenes video you
said<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.529> added<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.920> blue<00:00:17.130> gel<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.670> warm<00:00:17.880> the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
said you added a blue gel to warm the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.330 
said you added a blue gel to warm the
light<00:00:18.180> wouldn't<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:18.960> cool<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.560> light<00:00:19.740> and

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
light wouldn't that cool the light and

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.160 
light wouldn't that cool the light and
he's<00:00:20.490> talking<00:00:20.820> specifically<00:00:21.390> about<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.810> video

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
he's talking specifically about a video

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.320 
he's talking specifically about a video
that<00:00:22.199> we<00:00:22.439> did<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:23.400> behind-the-scenes<00:00:23.970> video

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
that we did a behind-the-scenes video

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.179 
that we did a behind-the-scenes video
about<00:00:24.539> shooting<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.990> iPad<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.590> said<00:00:25.800> again

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
about shooting the iPad and I said again

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.550 
about shooting the iPad and I said again
that<00:00:26.369> if<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.849> added<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.210> blue<00:00:27.539> gel<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.349> this

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
that if I added this blue gel to this

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.919 
that if I added this blue gel to this
Airy<00:00:28.890> tungsten<00:00:29.519> light<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.300> warms<00:00:30.689> up<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
Airy tungsten light that it warms up the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.930 
Airy tungsten light that it warms up the
light<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.830> he's<00:00:32.009> like<00:00:32.189> he's<00:00:32.489> saying<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.790> know

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
light and he's like he's saying you know

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.580 
light and he's like he's saying you know
I<00:00:33.210> thought<00:00:33.510> adding<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.870> blue<00:00:34.050> gel<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.410> going<00:00:34.530> to

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
I thought adding a blue gel is going to

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.440 
I thought adding a blue gel is going to
cool<00:00:34.829> off<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.219> light<00:00:35.370> well<00:00:35.910> we<00:00:36.030> made<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> video

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
cool off the light well we made a video

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.479 
cool off the light well we made a video
about<00:00:36.660> color<00:00:37.290> temperature<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.250> we<00:00:38.309> just

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
about color temperature that we just

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.040 
about color temperature that we just
published<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:39.030> digital<00:00:39.600> photography

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
published a digital photography

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.660 
published a digital photography
one-on-one<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.770> watch<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.219> but

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
one-on-one so you can watch that but

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.100 
one-on-one so you can watch that but
there<00:00:41.820> was<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> bunch<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.300> stuff<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.600> wanted<00:00:42.960> to

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
there was a bunch of stuff I wanted to

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.360 
there was a bunch of stuff I wanted to
talk<00:00:43.290> about<00:00:43.320> but<00:00:43.710> we<00:00:43.829> didn't<00:00:44.070> have<00:00:44.160> enough

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
talk about but we didn't have enough

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.610 
talk about but we didn't have enough
time<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.820> video<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.410> some

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
time in that video and so it's some

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.500 
time in that video and so it's some
color<00:00:46.829> theory<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.370> got<00:00:47.550> taken<00:00:48.059> out<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.300> that

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
color theory that got taken out of that

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.350 
color theory that got taken out of that
episode<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.590> we're<00:00:49.680> going<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.860> go<00:00:50.000> really<00:00:51.000> old

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
episode so we're going to go really old

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.850 
episode so we're going to go really old
school<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:51.930> I'm<00:00:52.020> going<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.170> put<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.680> on

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
school here and I'm going to put this on

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.560 
school here and I'm going to put this on
a<00:00:52.890> whiteboard<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.520> sort<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.730> explain<00:00:54.210> some<00:00:54.539> of

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
a whiteboard to sort of explain some of

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.660 
a whiteboard to sort of explain some of
this<00:00:54.750> stuff<00:00:54.989> now<00:00:55.680> there<00:00:55.860> are<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.010> few<00:00:56.250> things<00:00:56.489> to

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
this stuff now there are a few things to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.569 
this stuff now there are a few things to
understand<00:00:57.120> about<00:00:57.180> color<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.430> there<00:00:59.430> are

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
understand about color and there are

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.939 
understand about color and there are
cool<00:01:00.000> colors<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.600> warm<00:01:00.780> colors<00:01:01.170> cool<00:01:01.590> colors

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
cool colors and warm colors cool colors

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.729 
cool colors and warm colors cool colors
are<00:01:02.219> normally<00:01:02.879> blue<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.570> warm<00:01:04.199> colors<00:01:04.559> are

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
are normally blue and warm colors are

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.310 
are normally blue and warm colors are
normally<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.519> red<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.000> orange<00:01:06.420> area<00:01:07.020> and

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
normally in the red and orange area and

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.600 
normally in the red and orange area and
so<00:01:07.530> usually<00:01:07.830> when<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.010> talk<00:01:08.220> about<00:01:08.250> cool

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
so usually when you talk about cool

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.190 
so usually when you talk about cool
colors<00:01:08.909> are<00:01:09.000> talking<00:01:09.270> about<00:01:09.360> blue<00:01:09.600> colors<00:01:09.900> but

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
colors are talking about blue colors but

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.230 
colors are talking about blue colors but
that's<00:01:10.409> not<00:01:10.619> true<00:01:10.979> about<00:01:11.130> color<00:01:11.490> temperature

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
that's not true about color temperature

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.940 
that's not true about color temperature
they're<00:01:12.630> actually<00:01:12.960> reversed<00:01:13.320> color

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
they're actually reversed color

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.810 
they're actually reversed color
temperature<00:01:14.869> hot<00:01:15.869> colors<00:01:16.409> are<00:01:16.619> hot<00:01:16.860> lights

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
temperature hot colors are hot lights

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.660 
temperature hot colors are hot lights
are<00:01:18.119> blue<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.799> cooler<00:01:19.799> lights<00:01:20.009> are<00:01:20.189> orange<00:01:20.520> so

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
are blue and cooler lights are orange so

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.160 
are blue and cooler lights are orange so
a<00:01:20.700> candle<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.330> burns<00:01:21.600> at<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> really<00:01:22.080> low

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
a candle it burns at a really low

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.700 
a candle it burns at a really low
temperatures<00:01:22.740> orange<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:24.200> blue<00:01:25.200> sky<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
temperatures orange and blue sky in the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.649 
temperatures orange and blue sky in the
middle<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.070> day<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.520> about<00:01:27.060> 10,000

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
middle of the day is about 10,000

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.840 
middle of the day is about 10,000
degrees<00:01:27.750> Kelvin<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.590> that's<00:01:28.710> blue<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.759> if

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
degrees Kelvin and that's blue and so if

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.310 
degrees Kelvin and that's blue and so if
you<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> light<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.200> a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
you have a light like this this is a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.260 
you have a light like this this is a
tungsten<00:01:31.650> light<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.790> want<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.090> be

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
tungsten light and you want it to be

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.450 
tungsten light and you want it to be
warmer<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.200> burns<00:01:34.409> at<00:01:34.619> about<00:01:34.650> thirty<00:01:35.220> two

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
warmer it burns at about thirty two

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.210 
warmer it burns at about thirty two
hundred<00:01:35.490> Kelvin<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.200> that's<00:01:37.650> about<00:01:37.799> where<00:01:38.189> it

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
hundred Kelvin so that's about where it

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.580 
hundred Kelvin so that's about where it
is<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.759> scale<00:01:39.030> right<00:01:39.299> here<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.689> we<00:01:40.290> wanted

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
is on the scale right here and we wanted

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.130 
is on the scale right here and we wanted
to<00:01:40.650> match<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.369> what<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> ipad<00:01:42.390> was<00:01:42.689> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
to match that to what the ipad was the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.859 
to match that to what the ipad was the
ipad<00:01:43.530> i'm<00:01:43.770> not<00:01:43.920> sure<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.490> about<00:01:44.869> 6,000

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
ipad i'm not sure but it's about 6,000

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.100 
ipad i'm not sure but it's about 6,000
degrees<00:01:46.320> kelvin<00:01:47.310> about<00:01:47.729> right<00:01:47.909> here<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.360> so

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
degrees kelvin about right here and so

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.889 
degrees kelvin about right here and so
this<00:01:49.409> light<00:01:49.710> has<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> lot<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.399> orange<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.450> and

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
this light has a lot of orange in it and

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.469 
this light has a lot of orange in it and
we<00:01:52.049> wanted<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.409> take<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.490> orange<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.119> add

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
we wanted to take the orange and add

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.499 
we wanted to take the orange and add
blue<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.579> would<00:01:56.700> match<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.240> over

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
blue so that it would match this over

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.240 
blue so that it would match this over
here<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.780> we're<00:01:57.899> adding<00:01:58.049> blue<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.979> light

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
here so we're adding blue to this light

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.120 
here so we're adding blue to this light
to<00:01:59.790> make<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.060> look<00:02:00.299> like<00:02:00.479> it's<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.899> warmer<00:02:01.500> color

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
to make it look like it's a warmer color

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.980 
to make it look like it's a warmer color
temperature<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.850> know<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.329> seems<00:02:03.540> backwards

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
temperature I know it seems backwards

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.050 
temperature I know it seems backwards
but<00:02:04.170> that's<00:02:04.290> how<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.469> goes<00:02:04.680> now<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.430> reason<00:02:05.729> it

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
but that's how it goes now the reason it

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.999 
but that's how it goes now the reason it
seems<00:02:06.270> backwards<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.469> if<00:02:07.590> you're<00:02:07.770> in

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
seems backwards is that if you're in

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.699 
seems backwards is that if you're in
aperture<00:02:08.819> or<00:02:09.030> lightroom<00:02:09.239> or<00:02:09.899> Photoshop

the left to cool down your picture what

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.950 
the left to cool down your picture what
happens<00:02:19.010> it<00:02:19.130> becomes<00:02:19.220> blue<00:02:19.820> well<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:20.810> reason

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
happens it becomes blue well the reason

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.440 
happens it becomes blue well the reason

but<00:02:25.760> what<00:02:25.910> you're<00:02:26.060> doing<00:02:26.240> is<00:02:26.660> you're<00:02:26.930> saying

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
but what you're doing is you're saying

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.420 
but what you're doing is you're saying
my<00:02:28.720> image<00:02:29.720> was<00:02:29.900> over<00:02:30.110> here<00:02:30.410> it<00:02:30.530> was<00:02:30.650> warm<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.070> I

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
my image was over here it was warm and I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.640 
my image was over here it was warm and I
need<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.760> cool<00:02:32.060> it<00:02:32.270> off<00:02:32.390> by<00:02:32.960> cooling<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.500> off

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
need to cool it off by cooling it off

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.460 
need to cool it off by cooling it off
you're<00:02:34.610> trying<00:02:34.820> to<00:02:35.000> balance<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.840> color<00:02:36.140> and

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
you're trying to balance the color and

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.890 
you're trying to balance the color and
so<00:02:37.100> when<00:02:37.490> you<00:02:37.610> go<00:02:37.790> down<00:02:38.090> on<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.570> scale<00:02:38.870> you

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
so when you go down on the scale you

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.080 
so when you go down on the scale you
have<00:02:39.200> too<00:02:39.410> much<00:02:39.560> orange<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:40.670> need<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:40.940> add

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
have too much orange and you need to add

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.140 
have too much orange and you need to add
some<00:02:41.600> blue<00:02:41.870> in<00:02:42.110> here<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:43.310> have<00:02:43.730> an<00:02:43.850> equal

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
some blue in here to have an equal

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.330 
some blue in here to have an equal
balance<00:02:44.240> of<00:02:44.570> blue<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:44.960> amber<00:02:45.800> so<00:02:46.220> you're

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
balance of blue and amber so you're

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.220 
balance of blue and amber so you're
actually<00:02:46.459> adding<00:02:46.760> blue<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.720> picture<00:02:48.020> to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
actually adding blue to the picture to

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.190 
actually adding blue to the picture to
balance<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:48.980> white<00:02:49.250> balance<00:02:49.580> not<00:02:50.390> fix<00:02:51.020> the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
balance the white balance not fix the

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.800 
balance the white balance not fix the
color<00:02:51.350> temperature<00:02:51.590> as<00:02:52.250> far<00:02:52.550> as<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:52.910> warming

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
color temperature as far as the warming

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.420 
color temperature as far as the warming
or<00:02:53.930> cooling<00:02:54.080> down<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.500> light<00:02:54.680> so<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:55.190> seems

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
or cooling down the light so it seems

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.400 
or cooling down the light so it seems
backwards<00:02:56.060> but<00:02:56.240> it's<00:02:56.360> actually<00:02:56.690> not<00:02:56.810> so<00:02:57.290> if

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
backwards but it's actually not so if

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.320 
backwards but it's actually not so if
you<00:02:57.530> want<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:57.800> warm<00:02:58.100> up<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.340> light<00:02:58.520> you<00:02:59.120> add<00:02:59.300> a

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
you want to warm up a light you add a

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.449 
you want to warm up a light you add a
blue<00:02:59.690> gel<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.140> take<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.380> from<00:03:00.500> amber<00:03:00.860> to<00:03:01.250> more

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
blue gel to take it from amber to more

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.490 
blue gel to take it from amber to more
blue<00:03:01.640> if<00:03:01.850> you<00:03:02.240> want<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.480> make<00:03:02.600> your<00:03:02.780> flash<00:03:03.170> like

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
blue if you want to make your flash like

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.280 
blue if you want to make your flash like
your<00:03:03.680> strobe<00:03:04.070> your<00:03:04.310> 550<00:03:04.790> or<00:03:05.000> 580ex<00:03:05.540> two<00:03:05.959> or

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
your nikon speedlight if you want to

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.960 
your nikon speedlight if you want to
take<00:03:08.630> that<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.200> cool<00:03:09.800> it<00:03:09.950> down<00:03:09.980> to<00:03:10.790> match

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
take that and cool it down to match

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.880 
take that and cool it down to match
tungsten<00:03:11.600> lights<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:12.170> actually<00:03:12.560> put<00:03:12.740> an

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
tungsten lights you actually put an

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.940 
tungsten lights you actually put an
orange<00:03:13.190> or<00:03:13.730> an<00:03:13.880> Amber<00:03:14.150> jail<00:03:14.450> gel<00:03:15.050> on<00:03:15.260> top<00:03:15.800> of

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
orange or an Amber jail gel on top of

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.920 
orange or an Amber jail gel on top of
that<00:03:16.040> light<00:03:16.280> to<00:03:16.790> cool<00:03:17.390> it<00:03:17.480> down<00:03:17.510> you<00:03:17.720> want<00:03:17.870> to

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
that light to cool it down you want to

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.870 
that light to cool it down you want to
add<00:03:18.019> more<00:03:18.260> amber<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:18.830> it<00:03:18.950> because<00:03:19.519> it's<00:03:19.700> more

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
add more amber to it because it's more

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.030
