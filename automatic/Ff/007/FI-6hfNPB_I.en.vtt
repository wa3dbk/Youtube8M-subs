00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
 and 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.779
 very good to all guys this art a 7 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.610
 to 5 online in version 1.25 of 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.619
 playstation3 and good to start with 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.840
 this other case the only thing that we should of 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.369
 do is have good in general no longer 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.460
 you have to have no friends I'm 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.230
 here recording with friends for now 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.719
 because they were asking to record 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.360
 Well, the only thing we will need is 

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:34.040
 enter the session by printing so be it 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.930
 I suppose that public also serves but 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.719
 it is more advisable to do a session 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.370
 private good this this trick also what 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.309
 what we need is a song or a 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.859
 vehicle that every one that enters what 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.269
 it would be these suburban stores as you see 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:50.120
 the insurance stores are these that 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:53.210
 they have so well elegant that they look like 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.579
 to some boys but these are a 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.409
 little low class not then what 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.539
 we will be as I say is a point the only thing 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.030
 that we know is a quantum and now we have 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.640
 that put the point more or less in the 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.250
 door 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.090
 of the entry I'm not going to say that the 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.100
 game is going to make fun and how the dad 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.979
 will think that the door never closed 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.890
 and something like that with finishing it 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.450
 we can there's a door and we're going to 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.070
 shoot inside when we wait 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.350
 inside is not that life is closed 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.630
 but the door of the suburban is not going to 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.030
 to be able to close because we 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.040
 we have played the game by putting the 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.020
 point and good is that is that that trick and 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.909
 had been serving the past versions 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.470
 but it's really a trick for the 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.560
 who are poor and who want so 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.080
 less pay what it would be to the department 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.660
 that does not tell you you paid 100 dollars 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.550
 of the department and you do not have or have 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.009
 to be a bank they made fertilizers of gestures 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.869
 I'm sad if they have those moments 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.610
 this is going to be very good for you and it will be going 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.380
 better than docking stores since the 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.570
 truth of docking store is not so good 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.360
 well what we have to do is kill 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.030
 to the girl and destroy what would be the 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.700
 boxes of these and with a friend I almost 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:08.229
 remove the money that you do not even know 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.190
 what I let him get in there and well what 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.100
 do 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.480
 destroy the boxes as I say and now 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.540
 collect the money as they see spending 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.760
 money money money but the truth is 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.680
 that was a lot more depending on 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.020
 how many laps we give here outside like 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.030
 come and it will not come out so it's my turn 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.070
 go up and do a little more 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.930
 forward and already good now we have to 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.320
 go around here here like this like this 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.660
 if we want to jump x 6x jump x 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.330
 square of the square in case of play 3 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.850
 we have to run 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.980
 run and if we want square 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.750
 Normally if we run more it gives us more 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.630
 money but in this case I would write 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.840
 varying a bit later in this case I 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.790
 I run pretty and actually see 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.090
 how much they are going but they will give 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.270
 much more if it is that they still give more 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.290
 it turns out that this trick helps 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.450
 very much for those who are 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:06.560
 really poor like here is me 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:09.010
 giving money to more than 150 dollars 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.840
 to do a trick of this 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.209
 they are very much left with less money 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.610
 it's going very well so too poor this 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.890
 trick is perfect and best of all 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.230
 is it going on solitary astrup ie 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.060
 only just completely alone and the trick 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.060
 it will go perfectly 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.610
 here I will be leaving a click 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.769
 again at the beginning the video and other 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.549
 time here to click on the video 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:39.370
 and go to what would be the miniature 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.470
 good the video of a clip that is super 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.690
 well for those who are millionaires if 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.420
 they want to have a lot more money that trick 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.639
 It consists of duplicating street cars 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.799
 and then if we're going to sell it and we're going to 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:53.319
 earn millions of millions with the method 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.569
 I teach them is super easy so I know 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.269
 I recommend you click and go and see and 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.370
 let insular like this video also and 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.290
 Well I hope you liked it I hope 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.879
 that give like good here a 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.120
 recommendation is to give more or less 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:09.129
 about ten laps and jump each each 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.230
 return us at least one jump each 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:13.389
 back so achieve a bit more than 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.470
 tickets and on each ticket you will give 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.840
 plus 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.220
 very well I hope you liked it 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.329
 favorite likes and see you in the 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.329
 next bye 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.490
 all right 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.590
 uses
