 loops loosen man here he is 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:44.700
 ordered these to make two door gadgets 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.040
 well here on the straight card 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:52.270
 I do not have a direct I made the card to 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.220
 Su en customer immediately said that there is no 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.670
 I am straight on the card only oblique 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:02.890
 will but the client agreed for this on 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:05.979
 thank you card 007 and I just 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:11.920
 gave the card but the wheel and there I 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:17.110
 already made donated wheel I myself 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:19.360
 did keeping a point like that 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.860
 I happened to start hauling 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.740
 here's the steeple of glasses and I 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:31.049
 turned cone 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:35.890
 thicker here is thinner 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:38.760
 the cone turned out somewhere around 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.619
 8 hectare area I had here 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.869
 to trim the file with a skin 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:50.020
 the sleeve came in exactly with the pressure 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:54.790
 that's when I made them I decided to do 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:59.740
 machine tool why aren't they cone well 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.420
 yesterday began to put the grandmother in front 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.340
 because did not become a super shoulder 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:10.390
 guides to touch here I exhibited 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.630
 For two days yesterday I put forward my grandmother 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.870
 exhibited never exposed and spat and 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.340
 went home better did not come and yet 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:24.090
 here is the time already the fourth hour I and shot 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:29.260
 machined left such a vest 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:33.160
 I pierced it and I dragged it from the first 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.890
 times so here with two times because 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.470
 it is still long and bends y 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:43.090
 her blood here right here he even chuck 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:46.170
 I can not bend it now I will see 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:56.950
 I don't even know how long 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:58.230
 so but here it is almost 110 in length 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.730
 millimeters almost 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:07.959
 But on these 110 millimeters I got with 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:12.640
 accuracy but somewhere a little less than half 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.080
 day a little less than half a hundred we here 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:20.709
 I'll take it now 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:25.690
 micrometer at least and show no 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.530
 hand is not comfortable somehow its right 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.290
 a meeting 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.290
 like this 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.840
 30 30 ares 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:46.150
 now one second door now 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:49.570
 I will open a pause click so continue the video 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.350
 it's knocking on the door those who do 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:57.450
 there is nothing what Victorious says 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:04:11.460
 goes out and get in the way so now we will 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:18.239
 we measure hand at all uncomfortable well here 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:26.460
 the scale costs 37 a little less a little less 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:26.460
 29 and a half 29 and a half here 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:38.640
 roughly i am also looking at and 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:43.350
 mic then i feel awkward here too 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:48.160
 there are about 30 but maybe even 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:53.470
 how to say nepal weave and even less 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:59.310
 half a day put up my head but I want 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:01.020
 say very much i was tortured to exhibit this 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.819
 head 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:10.349
 Well, as you can see, well, let 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:13.909
 We will assume we are less there 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:19.110
 floor weave but sotochku 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:21.419
 so rude shall we say now 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:25.259
 you can even sharpen such long spire 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:27.629
 Points normally but stanochek Monica 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:30.060
 no stiffness here I have it 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:34.069
 the table must still be done under it 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:37.409
 a stand to put it on a stand 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:40.409
 because that's when I put my head in 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:42.509
 you take the headstock up and here 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:46.050
 micrometer already shows another 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:49.919
 deviation had to stand the head 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:54.090
 qwerty do not move it well this same 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:57.120
 Lesochka pierced with two times first there 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:00.300
 I probably shot 025 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:05.569
 and then five hundred points passed in one 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:09.960
 there is a party as if I am satisfied satisfied 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:13.680
 today called the seller about the machine 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:16.529
 one seems 2 he said 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:20.520
 give me a couple of days i will gather people 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:22.919
 think about how to get it out of it 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.729
 the rooms dragged him in as I spoke 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:26.159
 already out the window 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:29.190
 but here they are probably talking under 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:32.219
 window opening will be cut down or opening 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.840
 the door is just there uncomfortable from one 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:37.889
 the door you need to turn right 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:42.770
 left and the second door and there is still a plus 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:47.060
 the stairs are shorter here so let's wait 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:50.020
 what will the seller say about the machine when 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:55.949
 will need to take 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:07:00.659
 Well, here's a video on the repair of the corvette to 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:00.659
 all until we meet again
