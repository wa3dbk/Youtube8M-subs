00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
i baba Gilpin with MB amps and what

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.580 
i baba Gilpin with MB amps and what
we're<00:00:10.460> going<00:00:10.610> to<00:00:10.639> do<00:00:10.850> here<00:00:11.300> today<00:00:11.540> is<00:00:11.780> I<00:00:12.139> have<00:00:12.559> a

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
we're going to do here today is I have a

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.520 
we're going to do here today is I have a
little<00:00:12.920> he's<00:00:13.459> a<00:00:13.490> 10<00:00:14.030> watt<00:00:14.360> I<00:00:14.750> call<00:00:15.049> it<00:00:15.139> a<00:00:15.230> 10

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
little he's a 10 watt I call it a 10

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.950 
little he's a 10 watt I call it a 10
watt<00:00:15.799> kind<00:00:16.190> of<00:00:16.309> based<00:00:16.550> off<00:00:16.789> of<00:00:16.850> a<00:00:17.150> Marshall

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
watt kind of based off of a Marshall

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.200 
watt kind of based off of a Marshall
it's<00:00:18.369> single-ended<00:00:19.369> it's<00:00:19.670> got<00:00:21.220> cascaded<00:00:22.220> gain

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
it's single-ended it's got cascaded gain

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.200 
it's single-ended it's got cascaded gain
stages<00:00:24.199> and<00:00:24.619> a<00:00:24.679> master<00:00:25.189> volume<00:00:25.460> so<00:00:25.910> that<00:00:26.090> you

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
stages and a master volume so that you

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.439 
stages and a master volume so that you
can<00:00:26.390> kind<00:00:26.599> of<00:00:26.660> play<00:00:26.929> at<00:00:28.060> reasonable<00:00:29.060> levels

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
can kind of play at reasonable levels

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.730 
can kind of play at reasonable levels
and<00:00:30.699> have<00:00:31.699> fun<00:00:32.000> and<00:00:32.210> get<00:00:32.270> a<00:00:32.330> big<00:00:32.570> sound<00:00:32.960> got

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:33.740 
and have fun and get a big sound got

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.819 
and have fun and get a big sound got
mercury<00:00:34.010> magnetic<00:00:34.820> transformers<00:00:35.150> which<00:00:35.990> is

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
mercury magnetic transformers which is

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:38.440 
mercury magnetic transformers which is
you<00:00:36.980> know<00:00:37.129> I<00:00:37.160> love<00:00:37.550> I<00:00:37.760> think<00:00:37.820> I<00:00:38.030> get<00:00:38.210> a<00:00:38.239> great

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
you know I love I think I get a great

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.779 
you know I love I think I get a great
tone<00:00:38.840> this<00:00:39.500> one's<00:00:39.739> got<00:00:39.920> a<00:00:39.950> unique<00:00:40.280> one<00:00:40.579> it's

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:40.789 
tone this one's got a unique one it's

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:46.209 
tone this one's got a unique one it's
got<00:00:40.940> multi<00:00:43.449> impedance<00:00:44.449> primary<00:00:45.410> impedance<00:00:46.039> so

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
got multi impedance primary impedance so

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.569 
got multi impedance primary impedance so
that<00:00:46.399> you<00:00:46.489> could<00:00:46.699> really<00:00:46.910> set<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:48.579> primary

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
that you could really set the primary

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.670 
that you could really set the primary
impedance<00:00:50.270> to<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.449> tube<00:00:50.780> that<00:00:50.960> you<00:00:51.020> use<00:00:51.410> and

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
impedance to the tube that you use and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.119 
impedance to the tube that you use and
so<00:00:51.859> it's<00:00:52.070> using<00:00:52.309> a<00:00:52.579> single-ended<00:00:55.210> el34<00:00:56.239> and<00:00:57.129> it

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
so it's using a single-ended el34 and it

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.040 
so it's using a single-ended el34 and it
gets<00:00:58.309> a<00:00:58.430> very<00:00:58.640> nice<00:00:58.879> tone<00:00:59.239> here<00:00:59.539> so<00:00:59.690> let's<00:00:59.870> play

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
gets a very nice tone here so let's play

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.509 
gets a very nice tone here so let's play
a<00:01:00.079> little<00:01:00.320> bit<00:01:00.590> and<00:01:00.710> then<00:01:00.800> we'll<00:01:00.949> do<00:01:01.070> some<00:01:01.280> jam

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
a little bit and then we'll do some jam

00:01:01.519 --> 00:02:03.100 
a little bit and then we'll do some jam
and<00:01:01.550> just<00:01:02.059> have<00:01:02.210> some<00:01:02.480> fun

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.180 

I<00:02:03.140> just<00:02:03.980> going<00:02:04.220> through<00:02:04.430> a<00:02:04.460> single<00:02:04.880> 12<00:02:05.150> speaker

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
I just going through a single 12 speaker

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.620 
I just going through a single 12 speaker
that<00:02:07.190> can<00:02:07.550> de<00:02:08.210> que<00:02:09.050> de<00:02:09.259> speakers<00:02:09.830> uh<00:02:10.630> recall

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630
