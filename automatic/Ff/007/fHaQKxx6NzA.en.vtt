00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.060
 for you which is very further and me 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.609
 I think I am the first in the Netherlands 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.350
 with the thing that is the least one movie 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.810
 of places 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:31.399
 This is the Delphox Xbox one of the knowledge 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.969
 power power stins throats or something and 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.610
 very fat 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.649
 we here the green ninja and of course 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.680
 the delphox and the 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.149
 chestnut here is the back and you can 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.230
 stop him to read what's on 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.760
 state 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.579
 and I'm quite curious about what 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.610
 this is very curious anyway 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.699
 to myself I can see him already 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.399
 of course if it's out of the box 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.129
 better the artwork of the box is too 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.559
 to go very far and more and more 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.239
 really get involved with the pokÃ©mon and what 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.729
 on it then now it comes completely 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.200
 to the front of the fire by feel so 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.110
 that is very beautiful 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.400
 and I think they are getting better with 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.070
 making the designs of this tent 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.530
