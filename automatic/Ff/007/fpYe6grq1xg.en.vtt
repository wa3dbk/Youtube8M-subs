let's explain a bit how the game works
as<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:20.310> promised<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:20.970> would<00:00:21.330> explain<00:00:21.630> that

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
as I promised that I would explain that

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.250 
as I promised that I would explain that
any<00:00:22.020> gameplay<00:00:22.769> video<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.910> then<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.960> game<00:00:25.140> to

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
any gameplay video so then this game to

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.630 
any gameplay video so then this game to
control<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.560> team<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.949> these<00:00:26.070> four<00:00:26.400> breaking

them one a fork let's give me one of

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.930 
them one a fork let's give me one of
three<00:00:45.930> commands<00:00:46.760> basically<00:00:47.760> when<00:00:47.850> they

once and Oh keep attacking an enemy
wrecking<00:00:55.890> ball<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.850> don't<00:00:57.000> impress<00:00:57.270> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
wrecking ball you don't impress a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.119 
wrecking ball you don't impress a
repeatedly<00:00:57.840> over<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.109> over<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:58.890> way

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
repeatedly over and over so that way

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.700 
repeatedly over and over so that way
allows<00:00:59.430> for<00:00:59.760> automated<00:01:00.530> response<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
allows for automated response and

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.930 
allows for automated response and
wrecking<00:01:02.010> balls<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.309> they<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.550> all<00:01:02.670> be<00:01:02.699> doing

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
wrecking balls so they can all be doing

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.969 
wrecking balls so they can all be doing
something<00:01:03.270> at<00:01:03.359> once<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.409> block<00:01:04.619> button<00:01:04.830> is

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
something at once on the block button is

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.410 
something at once on the block button is
helpful<00:01:05.309> when<00:01:05.339> when<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.970> wrecking<00:01:06.210> ball<00:01:06.240> is

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
helpful when when a wrecking ball is

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.310 
helpful when when a wrecking ball is
being<00:01:06.510> attacked<00:01:06.780> by<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> lot<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.229> people

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
being attacked by a lot of people

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.760 
being attacked by a lot of people
basically<00:01:08.220> blocked<00:01:09.150> us<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.540> doesn't<00:01:09.900> doesn't

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
basically blocked us it doesn't doesn't

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.679 
basically blocked us it doesn't doesn't
make<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.010> invincible<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:12.210> allows<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.540> to

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
make it invincible but it allows you to

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.539 
make it invincible but it allows you to
not<00:01:13.470> get<00:01:13.619> as<00:01:13.680> much<00:01:13.799> damage<00:01:14.010> when<00:01:14.310> being

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
not get as much damage when being

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.539 
not get as much damage when being
attacked<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.659> ulan<00:01:16.020> allows<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.040> target

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
attacked and a ulan allows you to target

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.730 
attacked and a ulan allows you to target
an<00:01:17.820> item<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.479> also<00:01:18.630> just<00:01:18.869> move<00:01:19.049> with<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
an item you can also just move with the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.390 
an item you can also just move with the
d-pad<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.369> grab<00:01:21.060> an<00:01:21.210> item<00:01:22.130> during<00:01:23.130> here<00:01:23.280> that

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
d-pad to grab an item during here that

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.390 
d-pad to grab an item during here that
basically<00:01:23.520> explains<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.080> game

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
basically explains just of the game

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.039 
basically explains just of the game
hopefully<00:01:26.400> my<00:01:26.700> bill<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.509> might<00:01:27.780> make<00:01:27.930> more

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
hopefully my bill that might make more

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.179 
hopefully my bill that might make more
sense<00:01:28.110> once<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.530> actually<00:01:28.680> see<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.070> action

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
sense once you actually see it in action

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.760 
sense once you actually see it in action
so<00:01:30.030> say<00:01:30.689> which<00:01:30.960> one<00:01:31.110> do<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.259> showed<00:01:31.470> up<00:01:31.590> well

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
so say which one do you showed up well

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.719 
so say which one do you showed up well
in<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.979> camera<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:33.299> hard<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:34.520> have<00:01:35.520> somebody

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
in the camera it's hard to have somebody

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.469 
in the camera it's hard to have somebody
