00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
balancing in 1959 that it was probably

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.540 
balancing in 1959 that it was probably
an<00:00:49.710> enormous<00:00:50.870> shock<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.410> everybody<00:00:52.650> because

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
an enormous shock to everybody because

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.200 
an enormous shock to everybody because

he combined two sections one with Martha
Graham<00:00:57.450> and<00:00:57.810> then<00:00:58.770> one<00:00:59.130> with<00:00:59.880> himself<00:01:00.150> with

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
Graham and then one with himself with

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.800
