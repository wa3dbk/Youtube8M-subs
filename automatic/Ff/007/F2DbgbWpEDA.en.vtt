 hello how about i'm jose luis rolls the 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.710
 today I am going to share a 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:23.669
 extraordinary video that he shared with us 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.079
 Mr. Marco Antonio Rodríguez is a 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:29.579
 video that makes us 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:35.550
 spectacular and it's from an object or a UFO 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:38.570
 who supervises or will monitor the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.610
 popocatépetl activity 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.430
 when you are in an activity 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.860
 quite impressive see you 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.840
 you can see the activity that 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.780
 has the poop throwing material 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.400
 incandescent told us sea because in 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.350
 that moment they were impressed 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.320
 for the amount of objects that was 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.140
 throwing the crater you see the 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.610
 object on your left side that is 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:11.030
 moving very very slowly 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:15.020
 this object seems to be getting closer 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.830
 the crater of the volcano Popocatepetl see 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.620
 you the crater that is throwing 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:25.220
 because he told us frame was throwing 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:29.720
 in rocks the size of cars 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.640
 of frame trucks does not realize nor 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.470
 even of the object that is being 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.540
 approaching that is why it reaches to move 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.470
 the camera to continue recording the 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.470
 pop activity or the mole is 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.890
 throwing a lot of material 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.340
 incandescent that is very active the day 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.850
 March 8, 2015 went up with some 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.649
 companions who accompanied him 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.300
 precisely to this site and see you 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.970
 the object that is on the side 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:03.220
 left is still followed as 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.440
 approaching where the activity is 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.770
 it is not an airplane 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:13.660
 this this seems to be getting closer 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:16.500
 where all that amount is flowing 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.540
 of d 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:24.140
 and ashes 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.280
 of water vapor is to that amount of 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.879
 incandescent material that is 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.870
 throwing the popocatépetl volcano 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.489
 was possibly what made this 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.180
 object was approaching so 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.760
 very slow towards where the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.099
 popocatépetl the truth is a material 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.470
 incredible and that it makes me 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.079
 extraordinary precisely in the 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.939
 moment in which in the popocatépetl it 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.489
 I found in a very intense activity 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.989
 the object comes closer to see what is it 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.599
 What was happening 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.950
 well I'm jose luis wheel and even the 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.950
 next see you
