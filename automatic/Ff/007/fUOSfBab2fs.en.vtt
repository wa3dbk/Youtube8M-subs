00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.150 
fan of sticking my hand under the UV
light<00:00:28.170> for<00:00:28.920> some<00:00:29.699> awesome<00:00:30.210> nail<00:00:30.449> design<00:00:30.840> and

another<00:00:32.160> thing<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.820> they<00:00:33.059> claim<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.930> that

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
another thing that they claim is that

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.979 
another thing that they claim is that
the<00:00:34.530> miracle<00:00:34.980> gel<00:00:35.430> removes<00:00:35.969> just<00:00:36.450> like<00:00:36.750> a

the miracle gel removes just like a
regular<00:00:37.200> polish<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.489> if<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.879> know<00:00:39.000> anything

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
regular polish so if you know anything

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.920 
regular polish so if you know anything
about<00:00:39.719> gel<00:00:40.140> polishes<00:00:40.770> they<00:00:41.129> do<00:00:41.190> require<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:42.360> lot

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
about gel polishes they do require a lot

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.529 
about gel polishes they do require a lot
of<00:00:42.960> soaking<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> acetone<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:45.030> Probert

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
of soaking in the acetone to Probert

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.139 
of soaking in the acetone to Probert
properly<00:00:46.469> remove<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.550> that's<00:00:47.760> kind<00:00:48.090> of

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
properly remove so that's kind of

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.600 
properly remove so that's kind of
damaging<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.809> your<00:00:48.899> nails<00:00:49.140> if<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.800> want<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.430> do

so I do have a hundred percent acetone
here<00:04:31.570> in<00:04:31.780> this<00:04:31.960> cap<00:04:32.320> and<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:33.639> cap<00:04:33.880> is<00:04:34.030> not<00:04:34.240> very

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
here in this cap and the cap is not very

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.840 
here in this cap and the cap is not very
clean<00:04:34.780> because<00:04:35.110> I<00:04:35.199> always<00:04:35.410> use<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.889> cap<00:04:36.130> as<00:04:36.789> a

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
clean because I always use the cap as a

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.050 
clean because I always use the cap as a
reservoir<00:04:37.330> for<00:04:37.539> the<00:04:37.810> 100%<00:04:38.680> acetone<00:04:38.830> I<00:04:39.460> always

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
reservoir for the 100% acetone I always

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.320 
reservoir for the 100% acetone I always
use<00:04:40.300> 100%<00:04:41.110> acetone<00:04:41.259> for<00:04:41.919> nail<00:04:42.430> polish<00:04:42.610> removal

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
use 100% acetone for nail polish removal

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.439 
use 100% acetone for nail polish removal
because<00:04:43.539> it's<00:04:44.020> just<00:04:44.259> faster<00:04:45.039> and<00:04:45.370> easier<00:04:45.639> and

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
because it's just faster and easier and

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.659 
because it's just faster and easier and

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
since I have nail polish on this hand

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.520 
since I have nail polish on this hand

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
I'm just gonna go ahead and use a

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.370 
I'm just gonna go ahead and use a

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
mind and let's just go ahead and see how

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:52.269 
mind and let's just go ahead and see how
this<00:05:08.919> one<00:05:09.370> removes

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:52.279 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:55.850 

and<00:05:53.279> as<00:05:53.669> you<00:05:53.909> can<00:05:54.119> see<00:05:54.179> that<00:05:54.839> removes<00:05:55.349> very

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
and as you can see that removes very

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.889 
and as you can see that removes very
very<00:05:56.309> easily<00:05:56.699> with<00:05:57.330> a<00:05:57.360> hundred<00:05:57.659> percent

00:05:57.889 --> 00:05:57.899 
very easily with a hundred percent

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:01.369 
very easily with a hundred percent
acetone<00:05:58.830> and<00:05:59.309> I<00:05:59.999> do<00:06:00.059> have<00:06:00.539> a<00:06:00.569> little<00:06:01.050> bit<00:06:01.349> of

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:01.379 
acetone and I do have a little bit of

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:03.499 
acetone and I do have a little bit of
staining<00:06:02.129> for<00:06:02.490> the<00:06:02.639> blue<00:06:02.819> but<00:06:03.089> it's<00:06:03.240> really

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
staining for the blue but it's really

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:05.510 
staining for the blue but it's really
not<00:06:03.659> that<00:06:03.719> bad<00:06:04.050> for<00:06:04.439> a<00:06:04.469> blue<00:06:04.679> polish<00:06:05.189> you<00:06:05.369> do

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
not that bad for a blue polish you do

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.089 
not that bad for a blue polish you do
expect<00:06:06.059> staining<00:06:06.929> just<00:06:07.229> because<00:06:07.559> a<00:06:07.770> lot<00:06:07.949> of

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099 
expect staining just because a lot of

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.029 
expect staining just because a lot of
blue<00:06:08.249> polishes<00:06:08.819> do<00:06:09.059> so<00:06:09.809> overall<00:06:10.289> I<00:06:10.740> am<00:06:10.770> very
