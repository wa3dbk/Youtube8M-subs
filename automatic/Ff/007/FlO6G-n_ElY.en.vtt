00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.989
 it is to stay at least at the 4th place 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.010

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.910
 shortage land it was deserved in view of the 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.400

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.690
 to tackle already I think that there I when 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.890
 managed to gain experience 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.670
