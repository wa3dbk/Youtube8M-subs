00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
I think this also inspired by the same

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.980 
I think this also inspired by the same
persons<00:03:18.710> above<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:19.490> restaurant<00:03:19.730> yeah<00:03:20.660> yeah

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
more seating because this is more of a

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.710 
more seating because this is more of a
restaurant<00:03:31.670> Harbor<00:03:32.210> than<00:03:32.390> a<00:03:32.560> fast-food<00:03:33.560> base

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
but I mean Louis under these green most

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.120 
but I mean Louis under these green most
lights<00:03:37.720> because<00:03:38.720> he<00:03:39.560> sort<00:03:39.740> of<00:03:39.770> treated

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
Oval sort shape yeah that should be

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.670 
Oval sort shape yeah that should be
behind<00:06:00.360> them<00:06:00.539> never<00:06:00.780> roller<00:06:01.050> coaster<00:06:01.530> which

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
behind them never roller coaster which

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.709 
behind them never roller coaster which
needs<00:06:01.949> something<00:06:02.250> on<00:06:02.340> the<00:06:02.400> floor<00:06:02.639> I<00:06:02.669> think<00:06:02.820> but

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:03.719 
needs something on the floor I think but

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:05.629 
needs something on the floor I think but
um<00:06:03.900> yeah<00:06:04.320> goes<00:06:04.860> all<00:06:05.070> the<00:06:05.130> way<00:06:05.219> there's<00:06:05.520> gonna
