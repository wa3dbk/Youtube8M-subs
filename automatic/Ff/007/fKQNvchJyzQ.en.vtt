00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 for the clock with buttons we need 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.509
 felt 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.350
 set to tackle 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:15.330
 large colored buttons 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.330
 gun and glue sticks 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.860
 clock and now that they were living 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.500
 He remembered the materials because we 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.710
 let's get them out and start with this going 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.169
 It's good because I have the hoops 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.509
 what are we going to need as 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:34.360
 the framework are many years to address 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.220
 is current are those and also 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.850
 we need the fabric that in this case already 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:43.650
 we bring it cut while the color 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:47.170
 Entities want as you see is a scam 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:50.329
 we can make the size that is not 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.559
 also and we're going 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.559
 to place here 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.530
 we also need to go to 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.660
 need to help you with something brings 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.920
 message be there the scissors the 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.390
 magic box grammar and buttons 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.549
 also this in this case we are going to 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.210
 put buttons if you have another design 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.039
 has these figurines made like the 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.960
 typical figurines that take clothes 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.700
 and they already come as woven also 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.149
 you can put something like that I go for the 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.549
 buttons that I have here and most 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.560
 important of this the clock machine 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.720
 I'm going to tell you a thank you that I 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.310
 I say to give you an idea the other day 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.640
 with this this program is going 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.069
 a lot to the tlapalerÃ­a not then I arrived and 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.750
 for my purchase of a lot of money 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:38.720
 they gave me a veil but there was a 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.360
 girl with a bikini and I got my 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.670
 Mom get angry, she throws it on me, not then 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.049
 as you can and remove the machine and here 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.270
 was where it occurred to me that this is the 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.679
 my mom is going to love it and not anymore 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.100
 is going to bring me closer to me 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.929
 because I have women there with little clothes 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.409
 so what we are going to do is also 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.409
 we're 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.870
 suddenly it's like complicated you animate with 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.860
 the votes 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.150
 but here we have 1 2 3 4 buttons that 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.080
 they are the biggest and we are going to 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:14.740
 use to do here the division that 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:19.860
 is happening we can put say the 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.860
 12 3 6 and 9 with a large 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.400
 and here I am doing what I am doing 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.470
 separate the hands from the machine 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.190
 so they can cover without any 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.560
 problem 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.620
 it's very original it seems ideal for me 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.670
 I do not know how to have in my children's room 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.560
 regardless of whether we have 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.390
 our alarm clock is also a good 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.790
 option to start teaches them to read the 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.790
 watch the children that if it costs a 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.100
 little bit of work with the minutes 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.200
 seconds and we are all modern and no longer 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.870
 you must to receive all digital but the 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.040
 truth is that 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.570
 necessary 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.310
 very cheerful with colored buttons 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.200
 can be made of wood can be what 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.270
 They may all be different 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.010
 as they use now it's very fashionable for 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.850
 example in the dining rooms put chairs 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.430
 different or different dishes from 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.620
 different dishes different 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.140
 I know models and so on. 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.780
 Cutlery can be purposely made 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.870
 well and it gives a more fun touch 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.640
 let's say me original and create live alone 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.830
 here what we are going to do is going to be that 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.310
 start cutting everything that is left over 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.310
 of cloth 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.850
 it's super fast and simple that I think 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.850
 what is important 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.870
 useful easy practical very economical for 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.700
 the little ball 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.959
 for the neighbor to 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.580
 Well, I do not know why the husband 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.180
 can you make lady tell you to take it 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.180
 to give 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:04:00.920
 we no longer use a watch for bringing it in 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.360
 cell phone like that is already here fridge and 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.300
 then you run out of the pile you do not know 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:09.220
 well where do you live and well here we are going to 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.220
 make a hole in the center of the fabric 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:19.950
 we let ourselves be like a doctor who 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.950
 passed the legal report the disease 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.030
 the more patients join him all 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.520
 doctor of origin is fine 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:32.139
 not so big so not so big 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:36.220
 so you will not see and I would tell you the 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:42.180
 existing reservation and over here 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.180
 first goes the second hand 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.580
 this is cool and if it goes to 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.150
 look like where you bought it most 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.430
 easy in which store he taught me when I 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.490
 cost 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.990
 and you can also see them because the 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.060
 they surpass original seems to me a good 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.030
 gift sometimes you have to take the 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.620
 school is not many moms do some 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.460
 activity at school and asking how 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.410
 give back with some then I do not know gift 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.390
 also for the teachers to change 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.730
 to that he napkin ring the typical 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:18.330
 napkin ring of mothers day here 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.860
 more you can change them and give the average 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.480
 afternoon Mothers Day 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.660
 here we can also add the 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:27.210
 other buttons that would mark the rest of 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.030
 the area the rest of the clock hours do not 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.180
 marques the hours today comes a little 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:36.249
 romantic na 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:40.919
 I do not know boys help in minor 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:43.160
 do not laugh no more and we have two more 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.530
 outraged 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.510
 and here we get these buttons that the 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.490
 they're really super colorful 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.700
 they have a design father to me it occurs to me 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.380
 what can we do with buttons that 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.950
 let's get in one of these places where 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.950
 they sell antiques 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.660
 if it could be what we were talking about, 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.190
 just the style we give it to us 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.120
 depending on the color of the felt 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:10.460
 we can paint the frame is also new 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.490
 it is embroidered with it at the same time 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.290
 suddenly towards point we say and it 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.630
 it happens that they can also make point of 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:21.890
 cross and your cross stitch turn it into 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:25.100
 a watch very well I never learned 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:27.100
 nothing while teaching and my regards 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.690

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.920
 but look here, and other 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:35.880

 way of elaboration covers the rings with 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.750
 the fabric the way it is left 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:58.000
 completely stretched mark on the 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.650
 circle center a hole that 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.940
 will serve to introduce on the part of 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.550
 down the clock machine 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.289
 once attached to the hands, choose 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.729
