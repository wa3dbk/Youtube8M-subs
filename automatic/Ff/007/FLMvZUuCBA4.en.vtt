reviews<00:00:10.090> for<00:00:10.269> another<00:00:10.480> very<00:00:10.719> quick<00:00:11.049> review<00:00:11.530> a

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 
reviews for another very quick review a

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.029 
reviews for another very quick review a
quick<00:00:11.889> look<00:00:12.129> at<00:00:12.340> some<00:00:12.369> LEDs<00:00:13.209> from<00:00:13.690> C<00:00:14.559> timer<00:00:14.799> and

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:15.039 
quick look at some LEDs from C timer and

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:16.109 
quick look at some LEDs from C timer and
you<00:00:15.129> can<00:00:15.219> tell<00:00:15.340> it<00:00:15.429> from<00:00:15.490> RC<00:00:15.730> time<00:00:15.879> because<00:00:16.090> it

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119 
you can tell it from RC time because it

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.380 
you can tell it from RC time because it
says<00:00:16.390> on<00:00:16.539> it<00:00:16.660> RC<00:00:17.020> timer<00:00:17.430> now<00:00:18.430> been<00:00:18.970> good<00:00:19.240> has

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
says on it RC timer now been good has

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.849 
says on it RC timer now been good has
been<00:00:19.570> selling<00:00:19.900> LEDs<00:00:20.320> I've<00:00:20.470> looked<00:00:20.680> at<00:00:20.769> those

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:20.859 
been selling LEDs I've looked at those

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:22.349 
been selling LEDs I've looked at those
before<00:00:21.310> there's<00:00:21.490> a<00:00:21.519> review<00:00:21.850> i<00:00:21.880> put<00:00:22.029> a<00:00:22.060> link<00:00:22.269> in

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359 
before there's a review i put a link in

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.029 
before there's a review i put a link in
the<00:00:22.480> description<00:00:22.930> of<00:00:23.050> this<00:00:23.349> video<00:00:23.530> so<00:00:23.920> you<00:00:23.980> can

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
the description of this video so you can

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.060 
the description of this video so you can
see<00:00:24.250> the<00:00:24.400> bang<00:00:24.789> good<00:00:25.119> leds<00:00:25.930> these<00:00:26.470> are<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:26.800> RC

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
see the bang good leds these are the RC

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.220 
see the bang good leds these are the RC
timer<00:00:27.280> ones<00:00:27.520> why<00:00:28.300> are<00:00:28.539> these<00:00:28.660> different<00:00:29.080> well

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
timer ones why are these different well

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.920 
timer ones why are these different well
they<00:00:29.830> have<00:00:30.010> more<00:00:30.160> colors<00:00:30.340> for<00:00:30.610> a<00:00:30.640> start<00:00:30.970> as<00:00:31.480> you

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
they have more colors for a start as you

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.189 
they have more colors for a start as you
can<00:00:32.050> see<00:00:32.379> they've<00:00:32.949> got<00:00:33.160> some<00:00:33.600> plain<00:00:34.600> look<00:00:34.930> they

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
can see they've got some plain look they

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:36.270 
can see they've got some plain look they
look<00:00:35.320> playing<00:00:35.590> these<00:00:35.739> laws<00:00:35.920> these<00:00:36.070> got

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
look playing these laws these got

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.590 
look playing these laws these got
colored<00:00:36.550> phosphors<00:00:36.969> now<00:00:37.090> the<00:00:37.149> yellow<00:00:37.390> one<00:00:37.570> is

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
colored phosphors now the yellow one is

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.469 
colored phosphors now the yellow one is
white<00:00:37.960> because<00:00:38.500> the<00:00:38.680> way<00:00:38.770> LEDs<00:00:39.190> work<00:00:39.399> you<00:00:40.239> can

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:40.479 
white because the way LEDs work you can

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:41.880 
white because the way LEDs work you can
actually<00:00:40.659> create<00:00:40.870> a<00:00:41.019> white<00:00:41.289> light<00:00:41.559> with<00:00:41.829> an

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
actually create a white light with an

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.369 
actually create a white light with an
LED<00:00:42.010> because<00:00:42.489> white<00:00:42.699> is<00:00:42.879> a<00:00:43.329> wide<00:00:43.929> variety<00:00:44.109> of

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
LED because white is a wide variety of

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.009 
LED because white is a wide variety of
bandwidth<00:00:44.800> and<00:00:44.949> LEDs<00:00:45.729> tend<00:00:46.389> to<00:00:46.510> focus<00:00:46.719> on<00:00:46.989> a

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
bandwidth and LEDs tend to focus on a

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.709 
bandwidth and LEDs tend to focus on a
very<00:00:47.260> narrow<00:00:47.289> beam<00:00:48.129> of<00:00:48.399> narrow<00:00:49.120> band<00:00:49.539> of

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
very narrow beam of narrow band of

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.360 
very narrow beam of narrow band of
frequencies<00:00:50.350> so<00:00:50.739> you'll<00:00:50.920> normally<00:00:50.979> got<00:00:51.249> your

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
frequencies so you'll normally got your

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.099 
frequencies so you'll normally got your
red<00:00:51.489> green<00:00:51.760> your<00:00:51.909> blue<00:00:52.059> which<00:00:52.809> are<00:00:52.989> an

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109 
red green your blue which are an

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.860 
red green your blue which are an
individual<00:00:53.769> frequency<00:00:54.399> but<00:00:55.089> white<00:00:55.569> is<00:00:55.600> all

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
individual frequency but white is all

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.029 
individual frequency but white is all
frequencies<00:00:56.260> so<00:00:56.440> what<00:00:56.559> they<00:00:56.679> do<00:00:56.739> is<00:00:56.829> they

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
frequencies so what they do is they

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.579 
frequencies so what they do is they
illuminate<00:00:57.519> some<00:00:57.639> phosphors<00:00:58.149> with<00:00:58.359> a

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
illuminate some phosphors with a

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.899 
illuminate some phosphors with a
sometimes<00:00:59.589> an<00:00:59.679> ultra<00:00:59.920> violet<00:01:00.190> or<00:01:00.370> blue<00:01:00.399> LED

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
sometimes an ultra violet or blue LED

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:03.599 
sometimes an ultra violet or blue LED
which<00:01:01.329> illuminates<00:01:01.959> fossils<00:01:02.379> which<00:01:02.530> then<00:01:02.709> we

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
which illuminates fossils which then we

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.670 
which illuminates fossils which then we
can<00:01:04.239> all<00:01:04.390> basically<00:01:04.659> convert<00:01:05.049> that<00:01:05.199> frequency

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
can all basically convert that frequency

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.140 
can all basically convert that frequency
that<00:01:05.920> single<00:01:06.310> light<00:01:06.490> frequency<00:01:06.880> into<00:01:07.090> a

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
that single light frequency into a

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.210 
that single light frequency into a
wide-ranging<00:01:07.810> frequency<00:01:08.260> and<00:01:08.440> there<00:01:08.890> is<00:01:09.040> use

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
wide-ranging frequency and there is use

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.680 
wide-ranging frequency and there is use
them<00:01:09.430> to<00:01:09.610> create<00:01:09.760> a<00:01:09.880> white<00:01:10.030> light<00:01:10.210> simple<00:01:10.630> as

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
them to create a white light simple as

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.540 
them to create a white light simple as
that<00:01:10.720> and<00:01:11.080> this<00:01:11.650> orange<00:01:12.010> one<00:01:12.070> here<00:01:12.400> it's

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
that and this orange one here it's

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.880 
that and this orange one here it's
interesting<00:01:12.670> i<00:01:13.060> think<00:01:13.090> come<00:01:13.510> obviously<00:01:14.500> they

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
interesting i think come obviously they

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.410 
interesting i think come obviously they
forgot<00:01:15.160> the<00:01:15.250> same<00:01:15.430> problem<00:01:15.550> as<00:01:15.790> oranges<00:01:16.180> red

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
forgot the same problem as oranges red

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.110 
forgot the same problem as oranges red
and<00:01:16.630> yellow<00:01:16.780> so<00:01:17.410> leds<00:01:18.220> generally<00:01:18.640> produce<00:01:18.790> one

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
and yellow so leds generally produce one

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.570 
and yellow so leds generally produce one
frequency<00:01:19.870> of<00:01:20.020> light<00:01:20.050> so<00:01:20.440> they've<00:01:20.890> had<00:01:21.010> to<00:01:21.130> use

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
frequency of light so they've had to use

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.910 
frequency of light so they've had to use
an<00:01:21.700> orange<00:01:22.060> phosphor<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.230> get<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:23.740> necessary

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
an orange phosphor to get the necessary

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.490 
an orange phosphor to get the necessary
spread<00:01:24.850> of<00:01:25.090> frequencies<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:26.080> produce<00:01:26.200> this

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
spread of frequencies to produce this

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.040 
spread of frequencies to produce this
orange<00:01:26.920> color<00:01:27.340> but<00:01:27.760> otherwise<00:01:27.970> we've<00:01:28.300> got<00:01:28.510> as

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
orange color but otherwise we've got as

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.330 
orange color but otherwise we've got as
you<00:01:29.140> can<00:01:29.200> see<00:01:29.350> on<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.560> back<00:01:29.650> here<00:01:29.830> red<00:01:30.330> and

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
you can see on the back here red and

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.790 
you can see on the back here red and
blue<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:33.730> green<00:01:34.630> they<00:01:35.350> don't<00:01:35.530> need<00:01:35.620> any

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
blue and green they don't need any

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.050 
blue and green they don't need any
phosphorus<00:01:36.160> because<00:01:36.430> they're<00:01:36.580> just<00:01:36.700> a<00:01:36.850> single

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
phosphorus because they're just a single

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.120 
phosphorus because they're just a single
frequency<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:37.720> they<00:01:37.900> can<00:01:38.140> produce<00:01:38.650> within

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
frequency that they can produce within

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.860 
frequency that they can produce within
the<00:01:39.310> LED<00:01:39.730> itself<00:01:40.090> there<00:01:40.480> you<00:01:40.540> go<00:01:40.690> a<00:01:40.720> little

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
the LED itself there you go a little

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.540 
the LED itself there you go a little
background<00:01:41.230> on<00:01:41.530> LEDs<00:01:42.010> and<00:01:42.040> colored<00:01:42.370> ones

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
background on LEDs and colored ones

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.930 
background on LEDs and colored ones
these<00:01:43.210> come<00:01:43.600> you<00:01:44.440> get<00:01:44.590> five<00:01:44.920> peers<00:01:45.610> because

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
these come you get five peers because

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.730 
these come you get five peers because
you<00:01:46.240> get<00:01:46.390> two<00:01:46.780> of<00:01:46.810> each<00:01:46.990> obviously<00:01:47.470> one<00:01:47.590> for

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
you get two of each obviously one for

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.350 
you get two of each obviously one for
each<00:01:47.830> side<00:01:48.040> and<00:01:48.280> as<00:01:48.760> I<00:01:48.850> say<00:01:48.970> you've<00:01:49.120> got<00:01:49.150> your

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
each side and as I say you've got your

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.740 
each side and as I say you've got your
red<00:01:49.480> green<00:01:49.690> blue<00:01:49.870> white<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.980> orange<00:01:51.520> or<00:01:52.330> amber

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
red green blue white and orange or amber

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.870 
red green blue white and orange or amber
I<00:01:52.930> suppose<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:54.100> also<00:01:54.220> get<00:01:54.400> a<00:01:54.460> bunch<00:01:54.670> of<00:01:54.760> this

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
I suppose you also get a bunch of this

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.580 
I suppose you also get a bunch of this
wire<00:01:55.090> so<00:01:55.510> you<00:01:55.600> can<00:01:55.720> wire<00:01:55.900> them<00:01:56.020> up<00:01:56.170> now<00:01:56.500> they

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
wire so you can wire them up now they

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.800 
wire so you can wire them up now they
don't<00:01:56.680> come<00:01:56.890> pre<00:01:57.100> sold<00:01:57.280> it<00:01:57.460> I<00:01:57.580> think<00:01:57.810> neither

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
don't come pre sold it I think neither

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.300 
don't come pre sold it I think neither
do<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.080> bangles<00:01:59.470> ones<00:01:59.710> but<00:01:59.980> you<00:02:00.130> got<00:02:00.250> this

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
do the bangles ones but you got this

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.530 
do the bangles ones but you got this
nice<00:02:00.490> than<00:02:00.760> Y<00:02:00.880> here<00:02:01.090> you<00:02:01.150> can<00:02:01.240> solder<00:02:01.420> on

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
nice than Y here you can solder on

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.450 
nice than Y here you can solder on
little<00:02:01.810> solder<00:02:02.320> tabs<00:02:02.710> down<00:02:02.800> there<00:02:03.190> I<00:02:03.220> have<00:02:03.430> a

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
little solder tabs down there I have a

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.430 
little solder tabs down there I have a
close<00:02:03.640> look<00:02:03.760> at<00:02:03.880> those<00:02:04.000> in<00:02:04.090> moment<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:04.540> so<00:02:05.350> we

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
close look at those in moment and so we

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.560 
close look at those in moment and so we
got<00:02:05.560> three<00:02:05.770> LEDs<00:02:06.100> two<00:02:06.250> resistors<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.820> circuit

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
got three LEDs two resistors and circuit

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.270 
got three LEDs two resistors and circuit
board<00:02:07.720> that's<00:02:07.840> basically<00:02:08.319> it<00:02:08.619> so<00:02:09.069> here's<00:02:09.250> a

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
board that's basically it so here's a

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.529 
board that's basically it so here's a
close-up<00:02:09.550> view<00:02:09.729> of<00:02:09.759> one<00:02:09.879> of<00:02:09.940> these<00:02:10.000> LEDs<00:02:10.420> you

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
close-up view of one of these LEDs you

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.119 
close-up view of one of these LEDs you
can<00:02:10.629> see<00:02:10.720> we<00:02:10.780> got<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:10.989> three<00:02:11.260> actual<00:02:11.560> LEDs

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
can see we got the three actual LEDs

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.100 
can see we got the three actual LEDs
here<00:02:12.370> we've<00:02:13.030> got<00:02:13.209> some<00:02:13.360> solder<00:02:13.720> pads<00:02:13.840> down

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
here we've got some solder pads down

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.080 
here we've got some solder pads down
here<00:02:14.319> and<00:02:14.470> two<00:02:14.680> resistors<00:02:15.190> now<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.639> was

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
here and two resistors now I was

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.550 
here and two resistors now I was
thinking<00:02:16.180> one<00:02:16.480> we<00:02:16.599> use<00:02:16.749> two<00:02:16.989> resistors<00:02:17.409> it

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
thinking one we use two resistors it

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.599 
thinking one we use two resistors it
doesn't<00:02:17.799> seem<00:02:17.920> quite<00:02:18.010> right<00:02:18.099> why<00:02:18.400> they're

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:18.609 
doesn't seem quite right why they're

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.280 
doesn't seem quite right why they're
three<00:02:18.790> solder<00:02:19.090> pairs<00:02:19.269> well<00:02:19.420> quite<00:02:19.989> clever

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
three solder pairs well quite clever

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.660 
three solder pairs well quite clever
really

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
really

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.130 
really
these<00:02:20.760> things<00:02:21.030> unlike<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.510> band<00:02:21.780> good<00:02:21.959> ones

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
these things unlike the band good ones

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.830 
these things unlike the band good ones
will<00:02:22.319> operate<00:02:22.650> on<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:23.040> wide<00:02:23.430> range<00:02:23.459> of<00:02:24.060> battery

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
will operate on a wide range of battery

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.070 
will operate on a wide range of battery
sizes<00:02:25.140> rule<00:02:25.530> away<00:02:25.709> from<00:02:25.950> three<00:02:26.849> cells<00:02:27.180> up<00:02:27.480> to

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
sizes rule away from three cells up to

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.170 
sizes rule away from three cells up to
six<00:02:28.800> cells<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.370> if<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.520> turn<00:02:29.700> it<00:02:29.819> over<00:02:29.940> it's

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
six cells so if you turn it over it's

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.100 
six cells so if you turn it over it's
got<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.330> little<00:02:30.390> legend<00:02:30.780> on<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.900> back<00:02:31.080> that

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
got a little legend on the back that

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.660 
got a little legend on the back that
tells<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.500> what<00:02:31.650> those<00:02:31.800> sold<00:02:32.069> at<00:02:32.160> abs<00:02:32.340> are<00:02:32.520> and

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
tells you what those sold at abs are and

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.820 
tells you what those sold at abs are and
you<00:02:32.730> can<00:02:32.849> see<00:02:33.030> we've<00:02:33.239> got<00:02:33.319> one<00:02:34.319> tab<00:02:34.560> which<00:02:34.709> will

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
you can see we've got one tab which will

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.320 
you can see we've got one tab which will
handle<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.190> positive<00:02:35.610> voltage<00:02:35.880> from<00:02:36.060> three

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
handle the positive voltage from three

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.660 
handle the positive voltage from three
to<00:02:36.420> four<00:02:36.630> cells<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.170> another<00:02:37.860> tab<00:02:38.160> will

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
to four cells and another tab will

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.120 
to four cells and another tab will
handle<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.540> positive<00:02:39.870> voltage<00:02:39.959> from<00:02:40.380> five<00:02:40.680> to

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
handle a positive voltage from five to

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.370 
handle a positive voltage from five to
six<00:02:41.670> cells<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.270> then<00:02:42.780> there's<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.050> common-

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
six cells and then there's the common-

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.990 
six cells and then there's the common-
down<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.010> bottom<00:02:44.220> there<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.850> can

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
down the bottom there so you can

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.070 
down the bottom there so you can
depending<00:02:45.270> on<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.420> size<00:02:45.569> of<00:02:45.720> battery<00:02:45.989> you

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
depending on the size of battery you

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.809 
depending on the size of battery you
just<00:02:46.260> put<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.560> wires<00:02:46.739> on<00:02:46.980> whichever<00:02:47.400> tabs<00:02:47.730> you

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
just put the wires on whichever tabs you

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.520 
just put the wires on whichever tabs you
need<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.090> give<00:02:48.269> you<00:02:48.420> safe<00:02:48.989> but<00:02:49.019> bright

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
need to give you safe but bright

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.430 
need to give you safe but bright
illumination<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.849> LEDs<00:02:51.810> that's<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.230> very

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
illumination of the LEDs that's a very

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.140 
illumination of the LEDs that's a very
good<00:02:52.620> idea<00:02:52.980> now<00:02:53.430> there<00:02:53.550> are<00:02:53.640> holes<00:02:53.819> on<00:02:54.060> the

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
good idea now there are holes on the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.420 
good idea now there are holes on the
side<00:02:54.360> here<00:02:54.600> on<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.560> mini<00:02:55.800> quad<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.069> don't<00:02:56.310> think

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
side here on a mini quad I don't think

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.830 
side here on a mini quad I don't think
it'd<00:02:56.489> be<00:02:56.519> screwing<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.209> anything<00:02:57.420> normally

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
it'd be screwing it to anything normally

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.110 
it'd be screwing it to anything normally
we<00:02:58.019> do<00:02:58.230> some<00:02:58.380> cable<00:02:58.680> ties<00:02:58.709> or<00:02:59.120> some

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
we do some cable ties or some

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.479 
we do some cable ties or some
heat-shrink<00:03:00.330> as<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:00.780> tend<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.049> do<00:03:01.200> but<00:03:01.799> if<00:03:02.370> you

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
heat-shrink as I tend to do but if you

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.280 
heat-shrink as I tend to do but if you
want<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.730> bolt<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.120> holes<00:03:03.299> are<00:03:03.390> there<00:03:03.540> and

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
want to bolt it the holes are there and

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.470 
want to bolt it the holes are there and
as<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.620> say<00:03:04.830> this<00:03:05.190> is<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.400> wireless<00:03:05.819> very<00:03:06.180> fine

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
as I say this is the wireless very fine

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.699 
as I say this is the wireless very fine
wire<00:03:06.720> but<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:07.019> doesn't<00:03:07.260> matter<00:03:07.319> because<00:03:07.440> we're

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
wire but it doesn't matter because we're

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.500 
wire but it doesn't matter because we're
only<00:03:07.769> using<00:03:08.010> very<00:03:08.760> small<00:03:08.880> amount<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.239> current

only using very small amount of current
to<00:03:09.600> drive<00:03:09.780> these<00:03:09.959> these<00:03:10.140> are<00:03:10.290> not<00:03:10.410> ultra<00:03:11.130> high

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280

to drive these these are not ultra high
power<00:03:11.549> LED<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:12.330> we're<00:03:12.870> talking<00:03:13.200> probably<00:03:13.410> tens

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
power LED so we're talking probably tens

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.220 
power LED so we're talking probably tens
or<00:03:14.459> a<00:03:14.700> hundred<00:03:15.030> or<00:03:15.269> so<00:03:15.299> milliamps<00:03:16.019> i<00:03:16.080> would

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
or a hundred or so milliamps i would

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.750 
or a hundred or so milliamps i would
think<00:03:16.440> maximum<00:03:17.040> but<00:03:17.160> we'll<00:03:17.250> measure<00:03:17.430> it<00:03:17.610> let's

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
think maximum but we'll measure it let's

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.640 
think maximum but we'll measure it let's

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
throw down the pass blind you see much

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.070 
throw down the pass blind you see much
power<00:03:19.920> these<00:03:20.130> things<00:03:20.340> really<00:03:20.549> suck<00:03:21.080> rodeo

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
power these things really suck rodeo

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.470 
power these things really suck rodeo
here<00:03:22.290> we<00:03:22.380> are<00:03:22.470> I've<00:03:22.650> got<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:22.980> been<00:03:23.700> good<00:03:23.940> LEDs

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
here we are I've got the been good LEDs

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.229 
here we are I've got the been good LEDs
up<00:03:24.660> here<00:03:24.870> I've<00:03:24.989> got<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.380> RC<00:03:26.370> timer<00:03:26.579> LEDs<00:03:27.030> down

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
up here I've got the RC timer LEDs down

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.099 
up here I've got the RC timer LEDs down
here<00:03:27.390> I've<00:03:27.480> noticed<00:03:27.750> i<00:03:27.810> looked<00:03:27.989> at<00:03:28.079> the

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
here I've noticed i looked at the

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.430 
here I've noticed i looked at the
resistors<00:03:28.530> on<00:03:28.650> these<00:03:28.799> and<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.400> RC<00:03:30.359> timer<00:03:30.780> leds

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
resistors on these and the RC timer leds

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.050 
resistors on these and the RC timer leds
use<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.650> slightly<00:03:32.010> higher<00:03:32.160> value<00:03:32.609> of<00:03:32.700> resistor

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
use a slightly higher value of resistor

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.539 
use a slightly higher value of resistor
so<00:03:33.090> i<00:03:33.209> wouldn't<00:03:33.600> expect<00:03:33.720> their<00:03:34.650> leds<00:03:35.070> to<00:03:35.250> be<00:03:35.340> as

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
so i wouldn't expect their leds to be as

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.380 
so i wouldn't expect their leds to be as
bright<00:03:35.970> as<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:37.430> band<00:03:38.430> good<00:03:38.579> ones<00:03:38.760> but<00:03:38.970> on<00:03:39.209> the

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
bright as the band good ones but on the

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.729 
bright as the band good ones but on the
other<00:03:39.480> hand<00:03:39.570> if<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:39.900> run<00:03:40.079> this<00:03:40.290> is<00:03:40.440> on<00:03:40.560> for

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
other hand if you run this is on for

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.050 
other hand if you run this is on for
three<00:03:40.980> cells<00:03:41.190> if<00:03:41.310> you're<00:03:41.400> running<00:03:41.579> for<00:03:41.790> cells

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
three cells if you're running for cells

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.420 
three cells if you're running for cells
i<00:03:42.269> think<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.140> leds<00:03:44.010> are<00:03:44.160> probably<00:03:44.370> a

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
i think that the leds are probably a

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.190 
i think that the leds are probably a
little<00:03:44.640> bit<00:03:44.850> over<00:03:45.090> driven<00:03:45.390> on<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.660> band<00:03:46.049> good

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
little bit over driven on the band good

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.690 
little bit over driven on the band good
one<00:03:46.350> so<00:03:46.530> they<00:03:46.620> may<00:03:46.739> not<00:03:46.890> last<00:03:47.040> as<00:03:47.280> long<00:03:47.310> on<00:03:47.609> that

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
one so they may not last as long on that

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.880 
one so they may not last as long on that
as<00:03:48.600> they<00:03:48.720> will<00:03:48.870> on<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.019> RC<00:03:49.260> time<00:03:49.290> because<00:03:49.709> the

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
as they will on the RC time because the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.770 
as they will on the RC time because the
lower<00:03:50.400> current<00:03:50.850> that<00:03:51.060> flows<00:03:51.120> through<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.540> RC

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
lower current that flows through the RC

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.360 
lower current that flows through the RC
time<00:03:51.810> one<00:03:52.109> but<00:03:52.260> what<00:03:52.650> I'm<00:03:52.769> going<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:53.010> do<00:03:53.130> is<00:03:53.250> I'm

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
time one but what I'm going to do is I'm

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.400 
time one but what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:03:53.549> to<00:03:53.640> set<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.390> exposure<00:03:54.660> of<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.900> camera

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
going to set the exposure of the camera

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.990 
going to set the exposure of the camera
because<00:03:56.070> otherwise<00:03:56.310> it'll<00:03:56.579> just<00:03:56.640> all<00:03:56.850> blow

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
because otherwise it'll just all blow

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.460 
because otherwise it'll just all blow
out<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:57.420> we'll<00:03:57.810> just<00:03:57.989> compare<00:03:58.109> the

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
out and we'll just compare the

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.080 
out and we'll just compare the
brightness<00:03:58.980> these<00:03:59.160> are<00:03:59.280> blue<00:03:59.400> leds<00:03:59.790> because<00:04:00.030> I

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
brightness these are blue leds because I

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.610 
brightness these are blue leds because I
happen<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.299> have<00:04:00.359> the<00:04:00.450> Bengal<00:04:01.320> blue<00:04:01.470> ones

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
happen to have the Bengal blue ones

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.080 
happen to have the Bengal blue ones
laying<00:04:01.799> around<00:04:02.070> we<00:04:02.160> just<00:04:02.310> compare<00:04:02.640> the

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
laying around we just compare the

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.819 
laying around we just compare the
brightness<00:04:03.630> okay<00:04:04.019> so<00:04:04.079> here<00:04:04.290> we<00:04:04.380> are<00:04:04.500> pictures

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
brightness okay so here we are pictures

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.890 
brightness okay so here we are pictures
all<00:04:04.950> dark<00:04:05.220> because<00:04:05.489> I've<00:04:05.640> closed<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.420> iris<00:04:06.720> or

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
all dark because I've closed the iris or

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.050 
all dark because I've closed the iris or
reduce<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.799> exposure<00:04:08.100> on<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.519> camera<00:04:08.850> and

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
reduce the exposure on the camera and

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.610 
reduce the exposure on the camera and
we're<00:04:09.420> going<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:09.569> turn<00:04:09.780> on<00:04:09.959> now<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.470> we<00:04:10.560> should

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
we're going to turn on now and we should

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.800 
we're going to turn on now and we should
get<00:04:10.890> an<00:04:11.160> idea<00:04:11.459> there<00:04:11.640> we<00:04:11.730> go<00:04:11.880> well<00:04:12.540> there's<00:04:12.750> not

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
get an idea there we go well there's not

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.240 
get an idea there we go well there's not
really<00:04:12.870> much<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.290> choose<00:04:13.560> from<00:04:13.620> as<00:04:13.950> there<00:04:14.100> I

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
really much to choose from as there I

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.099 
really much to choose from as there I
mean<00:04:14.370> they<00:04:14.459> look<00:04:14.549> pretty<00:04:14.730> similar<00:04:15.180> if<00:04:15.630> looking

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
mean they look pretty similar if looking

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.900 
mean they look pretty similar if looking
without<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.650> thing<00:04:16.799> I<00:04:16.979> think<00:04:17.489> probably<00:04:17.639> the

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
without the thing I think probably the

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.719 
without the thing I think probably the
Bengal<00:04:18.359> buns<00:04:18.510> are<00:04:18.660> just<00:04:18.959> marginally

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
Bengal buns are just marginally

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.250 
Bengal buns are just marginally
marginally<00:04:20.729> brighter<00:04:21.030> as<00:04:21.329> I<00:04:21.479> expected<00:04:21.959> but

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
marginally brighter as I expected but

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.020 
marginally brighter as I expected but
nothing<00:04:22.860> really<00:04:23.100> to<00:04:23.190> worry<00:04:23.310> about<00:04:23.490> I'm<00:04:23.940> going

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
nothing really to worry about I'm going

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.779 
nothing really to worry about I'm going
to<00:04:24.090> wind<00:04:24.300> them<00:04:24.450> up<00:04:24.479> now<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:25.400> 14.4<00:04:26.400> volt<00:04:26.580> switch

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
to wind them up now to 14.4 volt switch

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.370 
to wind them up now to 14.4 volt switch
is<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.270> equivalent<00:04:27.930> of<00:04:28.200> a<00:04:28.680> four-cell<00:04:29.430> pack

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
is the equivalent of a four-cell pack

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.380 
is the equivalent of a four-cell pack
that<00:04:31.380> at<00:04:31.650> nominal<00:04:32.250> voltage

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
that at nominal voltage

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.450 
that at nominal voltage
and<00:04:34.760> yep<00:04:35.780> now<00:04:36.780> they<00:04:36.990> look<00:04:37.110> to<00:04:37.260> be<00:04:37.290> I<00:04:37.590> know<00:04:38.370> the

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
and yep now they look to be I know the

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.620 
and yep now they look to be I know the
bank<00:04:38.640> goods<00:04:38.850> are<00:04:38.940> still<00:04:39.120> slightly<00:04:39.360> brighter

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
bank goods are still slightly brighter

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.850 
bank goods are still slightly brighter
so<00:04:39.870> they're<00:04:40.020> not<00:04:40.110> being<00:04:40.290> over<00:04:40.500> driven<00:04:40.770> because

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
so they're not being over driven because

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.770 
so they're not being over driven because
with<00:04:41.070> an<00:04:41.160> LED<00:04:41.310> if<00:04:41.580> you<00:04:41.670> /<00:04:41.940> pretty<00:04:42.420> much<00:04:42.510> can't

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
with an LED if you / pretty much can't

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.390 
with an LED if you / pretty much can't
sue<00:04:42.900> they<00:04:43.050> actually<00:04:43.290> get<00:04:43.410> dimmer<00:04:43.740> well<00:04:44.310> you

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
sue they actually get dimmer well you

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.350 
sue they actually get dimmer well you
reach<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.640> point<00:04:44.670> they<00:04:44.910> have<00:04:45.000> maximum

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
reach a point they have maximum

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
reach a point they have maximum
brightness<00:04:45.510> and<00:04:45.780> then<00:04:45.870> they<00:04:45.960> start<00:04:46.170> to<00:04:46.260> get

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
brightness and then they start to get

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.710 
brightness and then they start to get
dimmer<00:04:46.740> as<00:04:47.010> their<00:04:47.370> efficiency<00:04:47.790> drops<00:04:47.940> off<00:04:48.240> so

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
dimmer as their efficiency drops off so

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.460 
dimmer as their efficiency drops off so
yeah<00:04:49.470> you<00:04:49.890> know<00:04:50.010> I'd<00:04:50.220> say<00:04:50.430> six<00:04:51.300> of<00:04:51.450> one<00:04:51.630> half<00:04:52.350> a

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
yeah you know I'd say six of one half a

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.590 
yeah you know I'd say six of one half a
dozen<00:04:52.500> of<00:04:52.770> another<00:04:53.280> really<00:04:53.640> okay<00:04:54.450> let's

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
dozen of another really okay let's

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.670 
dozen of another really okay let's
measure<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:54.900> current<00:04:55.050> draw<00:04:55.350> these<00:04:55.500> are<00:04:55.620> the

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
measure the current draw these are the

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.590 
measure the current draw these are the
band<00:04:55.860> good<00:04:56.010> ones<00:04:56.190> and<00:04:56.490> they<00:04:57.150> are<00:04:57.330> going<00:04:57.510> to

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
band good ones and they are going to

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.430 
band good ones and they are going to
draw<00:04:58.400> 42<00:04:59.400> milliamps<00:05:00.270> when<00:05:00.840> they're<00:05:00.990> on<00:05:01.020> that's

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
draw 42 milliamps when they're on that's

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.640 
draw 42 milliamps when they're on that's
fine<00:05:01.650> let's<00:05:02.190> try<00:05:02.460> the<00:05:02.660> surveys<00:05:03.660> own<00:05:03.930> ones<00:05:04.170> see

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
fine let's try the surveys own ones see

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.370 
fine let's try the surveys own ones see
what<00:05:04.770> they<00:05:04.890> draw<00:05:05.180> surveil<00:05:06.180> zone<00:05:06.450> LEDs<00:05:06.870> here<00:05:07.290> we

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
what they draw surveil zone LEDs here we

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.450 
what they draw surveil zone LEDs here we
go<00:05:07.560> and<00:05:08.360> as<00:05:09.360> I<00:05:09.510> suspected<00:05:09.990> 35<00:05:10.470> 36<00:05:11.010> milliamps

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
go and as I suspected 35 36 milliamps

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.410 
go and as I suspected 35 36 milliamps
that's<00:05:11.610> because<00:05:11.850> the<00:05:11.970> resistor<00:05:12.300> in<00:05:12.390> series

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
that's because the resistor in series

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.960 
that's because the resistor in series
with<00:05:12.780> them<00:05:12.960> is<00:05:13.110> a<00:05:13.620> larger<00:05:14.190> failure<00:05:14.460> limits<00:05:14.880> the

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
with them is a larger failure limits the

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.250 
with them is a larger failure limits the
amount<00:05:15.030> of<00:05:15.210> current<00:05:15.510> that<00:05:15.570> flows<00:05:15.690> oh<00:05:16.050> here<00:05:16.230> you

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
amount of current that flows oh here you

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.170 
amount of current that flows oh here you
go<00:05:16.350> but<00:05:17.130> not<00:05:17.310> a<00:05:17.340> lot<00:05:17.400> to<00:05:17.610> choose<00:05:17.790> between<00:05:17.910> them

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
go but not a lot to choose between them

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.450 
go but not a lot to choose between them
as<00:05:18.360> I<00:05:18.480> say<00:05:18.720> so<00:05:19.320> there<00:05:19.440> we<00:05:19.500> go<00:05:19.530> there's<00:05:19.920> the<00:05:20.160> 10

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
as I say so there we go there's the 10

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.370 
as I say so there we go there's the 10
LED<00:05:20.730> strips<00:05:21.240> that<00:05:21.300> you<00:05:21.390> get<00:05:21.690> for<00:05:21.930> your<00:05:22.050> nearly

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
LED strips that you get for your nearly

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.960 
LED strips that you get for your nearly
ten<00:05:22.560> bucks<00:05:22.920> and<00:05:23.250> just<00:05:23.550> if<00:05:23.670> you<00:05:23.760> wanna<00:05:23.910> know

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
ten bucks and just if you wanna know

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.400 
ten bucks and just if you wanna know
what<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.150> other<00:05:24.210> colors<00:05:24.480> look<00:05:24.750> like<00:05:24.900> this<00:05:25.230> is

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
what the other colors look like this is

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.920 
what the other colors look like this is
the<00:05:25.590> amber<00:05:26.370> or<00:05:26.520> orange<00:05:26.910> color<00:05:27.210> there<00:05:27.750> it<00:05:27.840> is

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
the amber or orange color there it is

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.080 
the amber or orange color there it is
see<00:05:28.320> it's<00:05:28.560> quite<00:05:28.680> bright<00:05:28.980> so<00:05:29.370> very<00:05:29.580> warm<00:05:29.850> it's

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
see it's quite bright so very warm it's

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.170 
see it's quite bright so very warm it's
not<00:05:30.300> as<00:05:30.420> sharp<00:05:31.080> readers<00:05:31.530> the<00:05:31.650> red<00:05:31.940> and<00:05:32.940> this<00:05:33.120> is

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
not as sharp readers the red and this is

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.940 
not as sharp readers the red and this is
the<00:05:33.600> white<00:05:33.900> which<00:05:34.110> obviously<00:05:34.380> is<00:05:34.560> that<00:05:34.740> much

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
the white which obviously is that much

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.280 
the white which obviously is that much
brighter<00:05:35.370> of<00:05:35.730> all<00:05:36.090> the<00:05:36.270> colors<00:05:36.630> really<00:05:36.960> really

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
brighter of all the colors really really

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.650 
brighter of all the colors really really
bright<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:37.860> white<00:05:38.070> LEDs<00:05:38.550> so<00:05:39.240> there<00:05:39.510> you<00:05:39.540> go

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
bright the white LEDs so there you go

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.420 
bright the white LEDs so there you go
now<00:05:40.020> price<00:05:40.290> wise<00:05:40.500> i<00:05:40.710> think<00:05:40.890> these<00:05:41.010> were<00:05:41.190> ten

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
now price wise i think these were ten

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.950 
now price wise i think these were ten
bucks<00:05:41.640> i<00:05:41.820> paid<00:05:42.000> ten<00:05:42.180> bucks<00:05:42.360> for<00:05:42.600> these<00:05:42.690> that's

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
bucks i paid ten bucks for these that's

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.590 
bucks i paid ten bucks for these that's
better<00:05:43.110> dollar<00:05:43.410> per<00:05:43.710> LED<00:05:44.280> strip<00:05:44.640> and<00:05:45.030> the<00:05:45.420> band

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
better dollar per LED strip and the band

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.760 
better dollar per LED strip and the band
good<00:05:45.750> ones<00:05:45.930> are<00:05:46.020> a<00:05:46.110> bit<00:05:46.230> cheaper<00:05:46.500> i<00:05:46.530> think<00:05:46.710> of

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
good ones are a bit cheaper i think of

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.050 
good ones are a bit cheaper i think of
dollars<00:05:47.010> when<00:05:47.400> I<00:05:47.430> bought<00:05:47.610> mine<00:05:47.790> a<00:05:47.820> dollar

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
dollars when I bought mine a dollar

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.810 
dollars when I bought mine a dollar
sixty-nine<00:05:48.510> for<00:05:49.320> two<00:05:49.980> strips<00:05:50.280> which<00:05:50.430> is<00:05:50.610> you

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
sixty-nine for two strips which is you

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.540 
sixty-nine for two strips which is you
know<00:05:50.850> but<00:05:51.150> was<00:05:51.510> it<00:05:51.630> a<00:05:51.660> bit<00:05:52.310> eighteen<00:05:53.310> ninety

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
know but was it a bit eighteen ninety

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.100 
know but was it a bit eighteen ninety
cents<00:05:53.820> per<00:05:54.090> LED<00:05:54.510> so<00:05:54.660> the<00:05:54.720> price<00:05:54.900> difference

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
cents per LED so the price difference

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.900 
cents per LED so the price difference
isn't<00:05:55.350> that<00:05:55.530> great<00:05:55.770> the<00:05:56.130> benefit<00:05:56.520> of<00:05:56.670> these

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
isn't that great the benefit of these

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.330 
isn't that great the benefit of these
are<00:05:57.060> see<00:05:57.210> timelines<00:05:57.630> is<00:05:57.810> that<00:05:57.990> they<00:05:58.140> are<00:05:58.410> a

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
are see timelines is that they are a

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.550 
are see timelines is that they are a
wider<00:05:59.910> range<00:06:00.090> of<00:06:00.210> colors<00:06:00.510> which<00:06:01.260> is<00:06:01.410> quite

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
wider range of colors which is quite

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.170 
wider range of colors which is quite
nice<00:06:01.740> if<00:06:02.190> you<00:06:02.340> only<00:06:02.490> wanted<00:06:02.730> one<00:06:02.850> color<00:06:03.060> of

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
nice if you only wanted one color of

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.640 
nice if you only wanted one color of
course<00:06:03.360> well<00:06:03.600> you<00:06:03.750> know<00:06:03.840> you<00:06:04.020> can<00:06:04.050> get<00:06:04.350> to<00:06:04.500> buy

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
course well you know you can get to buy

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.860 
course well you know you can get to buy
them<00:06:04.800> in<00:06:04.890> packs<00:06:05.070> of<00:06:05.280> five<00:06:05.760> the<00:06:05.790> five<00:06:06.420> colors

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
them in packs of five the five colors

timer so if you don't want all the
colors<00:06:11.940> I<00:06:12.090> guess<00:06:12.300> it's<00:06:12.450> not<00:06:12.570> as<00:06:12.750> good<00:06:12.990> a<00:06:13.020> deal

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 
colors I guess it's not as good a deal

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.190 
colors I guess it's not as good a deal

really screwed up and they haven't

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.180 
really screwed up and they haven't
followed<00:06:22.380> through<00:06:22.680> with<00:06:22.710> any<00:06:22.920> kind<00:06:23.070> of

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
followed through with any kind of

followed through with any kind of
customer<00:06:23.580> support<00:06:23.730> so<00:06:24.030> mean<00:06:24.330> just<00:06:25.020> based<00:06:25.170> on

customer support so mean just based on
customer<00:06:25.530> service<00:06:25.740> alone<00:06:26.250> I'd<00:06:26.400> probably<00:06:26.670> opt

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
customer service alone I'd probably opt

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.440 
customer service alone I'd probably opt
for<00:06:27.270> the<00:06:27.300> RC<00:06:27.690> timer<00:06:28.010> LEDs<00:06:29.010> and<00:06:29.450> performance

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450 
for the RC timer LEDs and performance

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.880 
for the RC timer LEDs and performance
wise<00:06:30.630> there's<00:06:31.080> very<00:06:31.290> little<00:06:31.470> to<00:06:31.590> choose<00:06:31.740> from

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:31.890 
wise there's very little to choose from

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.320 
wise there's very little to choose from
price-wise<00:06:32.400> there's<00:06:32.760> little<00:06:32.970> to<00:06:33.030> choose<00:06:33.180> from

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330 
price-wise there's little to choose from

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.270 
price-wise there's little to choose from
