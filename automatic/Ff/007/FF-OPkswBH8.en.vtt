00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.110 
disclaimer I played this on a ps3 not a
PSP<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:26.160> only<00:01:26.250> speak<00:01:26.550> to<00:01:26.610> how<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.910> plays

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
PSP so I can only speak to how it plays

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.600 
PSP so I can only speak to how it plays
on<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.420> big<00:01:27.660> console<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.770> playing<00:01:29.430> this

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
on the big console but playing this

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.180 
on the big console but playing this
thing<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.940> a<00:01:29.970> dual<00:01:30.270> shock<00:01:30.630> was<00:01:31.230> not<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> very

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
thing on a dual shock was not a very

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.340 
thing on a dual shock was not a very
comfortable<00:01:32.700> experience

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.730 

so<00:01:37.250> obviously<00:01:37.700> time<00:01:38.150> soldiers<00:01:38.810> is<00:01:39.050> a<00:01:39.080> top-down

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
so obviously time soldiers is a top-down

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.490 
so obviously time soldiers is a top-down
run-and-gun<00:01:40.460> shooter<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.210> it's<00:01:41.810> actually<00:01:42.380> an

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
run-and-gun shooter and it's actually an

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.110 
run-and-gun shooter and it's actually an
awesome<00:01:42.650> one<00:01:43.010> but<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.310> problem<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:43.790> had<00:01:43.970> with

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
awesome one but the problem I had with

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.110 
awesome one but the problem I had with
this<00:01:44.330> particular<00:01:44.810> version<00:01:45.380> is<00:01:45.740> that<00:01:46.220> aiming

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
this particular version is that aiming

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.900 
this particular version is that aiming
feels<00:01:47.479> very<00:01:48.050> awkward<00:01:48.380> we<00:01:49.070> move<00:01:49.340> with<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:49.670> left

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
feels very awkward we move with the left

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.480 
feels very awkward we move with the left
analog<00:01:50.150> stick<00:01:50.420> but<00:01:51.290> rather<00:01:51.650> than<00:01:51.979> shooting

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
analog stick but rather than shooting

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.880 
analog stick but rather than shooting
with<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.820> right<00:01:53.060> stick<00:01:53.420> you'd<00:01:53.990> shoot<00:01:54.380> with<00:01:54.619> X

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
with the right stick you'd shoot with X

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.480 
with the right stick you'd shoot with X
and<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:56.060> aim<00:01:56.300> with<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.780> shoulder<00:01:57.350> buttons<00:01:57.740> so

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
and you aim with the shoulder buttons so

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.330 
and you aim with the shoulder buttons so
rather<00:01:58.880> than<00:01:59.180> just<00:01:59.240> aim<00:01:59.750> and<00:02:00.050> shoot

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
rather than just aim and shoot

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.650 
rather than just aim and shoot
simultaneously<00:02:01.340> it's<00:02:01.820> actually<00:02:02.180> a<00:02:02.210> two-part

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
simultaneously it's actually a two-part

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.690 
simultaneously it's actually a two-part
process<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:03.500> shoulder<00:02:03.830> buttons<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:04.250> aim<00:02:04.400> and

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
process the shoulder buttons to aim and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.969 
process the shoulder buttons to aim and
the<00:02:05.090> X<00:02:05.270> button<00:02:05.630> to<00:02:05.780> shoot<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:06.200> compared<00:02:06.920> to

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
the X button to shoot and compared to

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.979 
the X button to shoot and compared to
similar<00:02:07.400> games<00:02:07.700> that's<00:02:08.270> a<00:02:08.390> bit<00:02:08.509> cumbersome

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
similar games that's a bit cumbersome

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.140 
similar games that's a bit cumbersome
now<00:02:09.200> it<00:02:09.440> doesn't<00:02:09.739> ruin<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.009> experience<00:02:10.550> you

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
now it doesn't ruin the experience you

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.150 
now it doesn't ruin the experience you
do<00:02:11.360> get<00:02:11.570> used<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:11.989> controls<00:02:12.170> but<00:02:13.010> they're

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
do get used to the controls but they're

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.460

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
just not ideal that's all the game
