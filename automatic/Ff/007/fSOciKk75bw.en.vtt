00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
 welcome love to another 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.379
 tutorial today I show you how to 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.050
 the geeris mod addons you look over 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.820
 a workshop or generally about gary 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.110
 So smart did not download 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.179
 externally from any pages of his 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.880
 in gary smart stop by this simple 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.529
 away we can extract out 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.300
 could convert under fire into server 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.980
 You can upload it to everyone 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.670
 in this case, two programs once 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.029
 filezilla this is the program of fdp 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.309
 client fdp program the file transport 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.950
 program around the files so the data 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.460
 also to be able to upload and you need 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.860
 the medconf july to me to both 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.450
 to both things if I have a link 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.760
 in the description send 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.500
 and yes it is pretty easy 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.960
 Actually, you are in yours 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.760
 gamespot addons folder and indeed finds 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.120
 her in which he does not hard drive then 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:59.129
 So on Steam Steam apps took over 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.730
 but sometimes it refers to times and 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.680
 then gehrys mod again garriott and 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.100
 not to miss addons here above 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.140
 stands 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.990
 that's another story it's all about 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.510
 around those addons whose the ones you are from 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.600
 Charisma under it invites the point 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.020
 gema files you can not so on 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.590
 make the server but we have this 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.790
 little tool here everytime I talk about it 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.080
 this financially helps you this 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.340
 things to bundle so you know the thing 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.960
 still upload to a server 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.630
 for example here so I have it 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.000
 started converter single fire us 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.500
 want a single violet 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.150
 I do not know why to convert 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.299
 do not jump right into the folder 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:48.030
 Actually, it's right in the folder 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:49.740
 No matter we are so cool right now 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.920
 For example, let's go on the server 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.240
 grab the weight do we want 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.799
 stop the weight can adjust 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.170
 thus is open here fine 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.549
 extraction was successfully and now 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.860
 this will appear here and this folder 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.320
 you can push up directly 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.840
 upload on the server so you can 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.580
 now server is still short her me 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.860
 you must on your spox he sees Casemod 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.990
 just like here 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.610
 with you also with the client also addons 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.690
 and since the chance then grabbed the pure 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.760
 are the things we are on it 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.520
 have among other things the weight tool is 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.140
 Also jesus on it easy zack drag 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.070
 and drop in and then noodle that up 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.470
 and when it's high loaded 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.470
 yes that is very nice places if yes 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.340
 of course, that's the way it is and then when it's up 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.380
 loaded then you have the need 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.010
 Restart server and that's the add 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.040
 on installed 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.140
 So it's actually very easy 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.130
 of course somehow graphically what 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.620
 Do, for example, if you stop 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.060
 or what needs the materials 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.850
 Of course, matter is also where I am 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.930
 computers are socially terrors and but 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.100
 otherwise, but otherwise that's what it was 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.270
 actually already so I have forever 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.920
 long wanted because I did not gathered 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.020
 I like these files here 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.510
 can convert 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.310
 but it is so easy again 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.770
 rapidly scrolling you look in here 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.680
 which ones you want to have started 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.110
 the medconf gui which single file out 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.870
 wild of the file of you wanted to have smart 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.970
 world wears on open wait shortly thereafter 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.950
 it is done uploading on the server 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.870
 and the bower is ready then 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.750
 everything already done so it has to 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.160
 actually be and yes and there you can 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.019
 stop right in but restart that is 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.299
 stop important to restart it and already 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.620
 can you add the on your server 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:35.239
 enjoy that that was it 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.980
 far as I am degree but yet he 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.480
 then we find myself there 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.160
 video explained before the last video 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.870
 you as you find the addons where you 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.269
 which one finds the one which installs something 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.250
 he really is ppi and yes and that is 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.660
 just the thing that was here 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.130
 crack the program with me until I 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.650
 hayden had found that but yes 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.940
 it was actually as far makes it good to 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.360
 next time he grabs it himself 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.360
 not so brutal
