kind of surprised that they made an
actual<00:02:54.930> character<00:02:55.410> for<00:02:55.620> him<00:02:55.800> because<00:02:55.950> he

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
actual character for him because he

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.690 
actual character for him because he
doesn't<00:02:56.310> really<00:02:56.489> have<00:02:56.610> any<00:02:56.940> moves<00:02:57.260> other<00:02:58.260> than

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
doesn't really have any moves other than

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.180 
doesn't really have any moves other than
slashing<00:02:59.700> his<00:02:59.790> sword<00:03:00.350> so<00:03:01.350> but<00:03:01.739> I<00:03:01.890> like<00:03:02.160> the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
slashing his sword so but I like the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.160 
slashing his sword so but I like the
characters<00:03:02.700> with<00:03:02.910> sword<00:03:03.150> since<00:03:03.450> it's<00:03:03.989> only

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
characters with sword since it's only

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.430 
characters with sword since it's only
Sasuke<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:06.350> also<00:03:07.350> um<00:03:08.330> hands<00:03:09.330> oh<00:03:09.480> they<00:03:10.230> didn't
