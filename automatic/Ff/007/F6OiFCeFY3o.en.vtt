nothing<00:01:24.440> like<00:01:24.800> the<00:01:25.490> sound<00:01:25.760> of<00:01:26.240> a<00:01:26.420> db9<00:01:26.780> you

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
nothing like the sound of a db9 you

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:49.770 
nothing like the sound of a db9 you
first<00:01:27.650> find<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.340> engine

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.110 

you

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.880 

as<00:01:52.900> a<00:01:52.990> designer<00:01:53.610> trying<00:01:54.610> to<00:01:55.080> evoke<00:01:56.080> an<00:01:56.290> emotion

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
as a designer trying to evoke an emotion

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.950 
as a designer trying to evoke an emotion
of<00:01:57.070> power<00:01:57.520> through<00:01:57.910> body<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.450> form<00:01:58.690> and<00:01:58.900> shape

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
of power through body and form and shape

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.520 
of power through body and form and shape
so<00:01:59.860> you're<00:02:00.070> creating<00:02:00.640> shapes<00:02:00.970> that<00:02:01.270> are<00:02:01.690> both

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
so you're creating shapes that are both

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.850 
so you're creating shapes that are both
powerful<00:02:03.150> sense<00:02:04.150> you're<00:02:04.420> elegant<00:02:05.410> and

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
powerful sense you're elegant and

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.370 
powerful sense you're elegant and
stylish<00:02:06.760> at<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.420> same<00:02:07.630> time<00:02:07.840> but<00:02:08.140> the

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
stylish at the same time but the

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.230 
stylish at the same time but the
immediate<00:02:09.010> reaction<00:02:09.550> is<00:02:09.670> that<00:02:09.880> this<00:02:10.000> is<00:02:10.210> a

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
immediate reaction is that this is a

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:20.320 
immediate reaction is that this is a
powerful<00:02:10.630> car

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.660 

what<00:02:20.900> we<00:02:21.050> do<00:02:21.200> with<00:02:21.230> db9<00:02:21.860> is<00:02:22.070> we<00:02:22.220> show<00:02:22.430> those

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
what we do with db9 is we show those

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.640 
what we do with db9 is we show those
muscles<00:02:23.120> straightaway<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:23.930> show<00:02:24.170> that<00:02:24.200> poise

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
muscles straightaway and show that poise

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.310 
muscles straightaway and show that poise
straightaway<00:02:25.460> unclothed<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:26.690> it's<00:02:27.080> there

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
straightaway unclothed and it's there

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.620 
straightaway unclothed and it's there
for<00:02:27.500> everyone<00:02:27.740> to<00:02:27.890> see<00:02:28.090> when<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.180> open<00:02:29.510> the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
for everyone to see when you open the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.120 
for everyone to see when you open the
hood<00:02:29.810> then<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.440> start<00:02:30.740> to<00:02:30.890> actually

hood then you start to actually
physically<00:02:31.700> see<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.270> power<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.750> we're

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
physically see the power that we're

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.110 
physically see the power that we're
trying<00:02:33.020> to<00:02:33.260> portray<00:02:33.680> but<00:02:34.340> it's<00:02:34.460> the<00:02:34.520> shoulders

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
trying to portray but it's the shoulders

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.910 
trying to portray but it's the shoulders
it's<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.420> proportion<00:02:36.110> that<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.470> car<00:02:36.680> has

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
it's the proportion that the car has

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.700 
it's the proportion that the car has
that<00:02:37.160> gives<00:02:37.430> it<00:02:37.640> this<00:02:37.790> power<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.870> stance<00:02:39.350> and
