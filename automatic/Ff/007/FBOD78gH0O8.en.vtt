00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.319
 very good to all kids on the 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.359
 killer commenting on a new video of 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.280
 black ops 2 and as you have seen in the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.080
 title today I will show you what are 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.599
 the best game modes to win 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.519
 more points in the black ops 2 then 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.220
 good is this is according to my 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.290
 statistics but overall I think that 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.020
 also matches that of most 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.820
 people so nothing what I what 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.560
 I have done is to go here to barracks 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.750
 good combat history here are you 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.910
 seeing my statistics has lowered me is 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.610
 a whole lot when when they took me 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.789
 My precious one was never taken from me 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.440
 started to lower the ratio so good what 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:40.559
 what I have to do here is go to 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.920
 race scored game modes to watch 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.920
 here 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.350
 forgive me markers here and here here 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.150
 we are here and here we will see the 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.920
 different statistics of our 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.120
 game modes then here we see in 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.220
 team duel 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.660
 I have a score per minute of 360 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.129
 it's not bad it's not bad but 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.809
 there are better here I have 442 than this 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.360
 Of course I will have played a couple of 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.950
 games only look as you see here 128 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.500
 low in 17 deaths only the very played 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.570
 little and they are broken cards so I have 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.430
 so much score per minute but let's go 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.050
 which it is not the best if you are a 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.350
 machines well yes here is one of the 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.440
 most important of the best modes of 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.149
 game to earn more points and as you see 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.500
 437 per minute is not bad here 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.930
 as you can see one of my friends has 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.509
 some more points but good is a 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.950
 good option to search and destroy is not not 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.229
 a good option as you see here for 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.700
 get to level up fast not os 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.630
 I recommend looking and destroying not to be 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.330
 you kill 20 and 60 times in a game 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.420
 it's so I recommend it but it's not 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.550
 normal not to take the good flag is 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.350
 there could be worth but there are better 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.689
 so we're not going to do anything 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.140
 to catch for the moment we take dominion and 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:57.229
 here another one of the good barracks without 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.729
 I'm sure you have done a good 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.320
 lot of casualties a lot of deaths a 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.840
 bunch of toms a lot of defenses 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.970
 especially the defenses and all the 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.110
 points per minute even this on a 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.399
 package is the 444 of the modern world 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.860
 641 points per minute birds that barracks 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.600
 It gives a lot of points per minute like this 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.239
 that nothing barracks and domain at the moment 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.860
 and demolition like I could not miss 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:23.000
 demolition also here you see is from the 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.190
 higher 487 I think it's my the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.560
 I have higher game modes I think 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.660
 that is this I do not know now we will see it point 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.310
 hot the truth that also waits not 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.800
 I had seen this this look guys 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.120
 also together hot so good since 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.610
 We have many hot spot options 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.580
 demolition domain barracks no doubt 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.260
 these are the best there are even people 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.230
 that looks I am a package is always 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.760
 in front of me what the fuck you see that 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.360
 they make a lot of points per minute like this 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.330
 that we will not continue low confirmed 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.190
 it stays a little down it's usually from the 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.930
 better but in my case so look at it 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.300
 also and also you to yours 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.670
 markers to see what are the modes of 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.170
 game that more points give us games of 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.610
 weapons because here is no longer playing and a 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.410
 game one in the claim will not be 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.020
 playing a game snipers 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.970
 played a couple of games so nothing 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.190
 neither are these game modes of 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.870
 group are not good for 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.540
 to get points so in 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.220
 definitive the best game modes 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.560
 according to my statistics and good for 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.090
 all in general are surely domain 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.970
 ammunition barracks 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.590
 and hot spot these four these 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.560
 four are the ones that I recommend those who 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.060
 more game and the more points you will earn 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.280
 so good now take advantage of that they are 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.510
 the double points were I do not know 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.790
 when will I upload this video this end 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.920
 of the week were the double points and has 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.650
 climbed almost an entire prestige playing 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.690
 alone not so so nothing guys if you 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.380
 has served this video you know what 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.600
 you have to comment on how they are 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.040
 your game modes what are the 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.690
 what more grenade points and if you are 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.800
 agree or not I already tell you that the 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:03.050
 better for me and almost certainly 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.840
 for you also hot spot 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.400
 demolition barracks and domains these 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.220
 four are the best game modes 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.660
 so nothing see you in the next 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.420
 video I do not know when it will be this week 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.640
 I may be a little more absent 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.190
 exams last of exams already before 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.410
 Christmas so nothing will be a 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.510
 little less active in the channel although I see 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.290
 that we care a lot because you do not see 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.750
 almost the videos 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.300
 I'm a little bit up to the eggs like that 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.280
 than nothing 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.300
 and see you in the next see you 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.300
 goodbye kids
